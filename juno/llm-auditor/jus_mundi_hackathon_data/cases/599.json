INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A.** The Dispute\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute arises out of Venezuela's introduction of measures affecting the Claimant's purported ownership over a cattle farming business in Venezuela. More specifically, the claims relate to Venezuela's conduct under a legal regime governing agricultural estates, primarily contained in the law of 13 November 2001 entitled *Decreto 1546 con fuerza de ley de tierras y desarrollo agrario* (the \"2001 Land Law\") and its successive laws and amendments (together referred to as the \"Land Law\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant contends that that conduct resulted in the unlawful expropriation of the Claimant's cattle farming business in Venezuela and constituted multiple breaches of the 1995 Agreement of Promotion and Protection of Investments between the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the government of the Republic of Venezuela (the \"BIT\"). The Claimant seeks damages for harm caused by these alleged breaches.\n\n**B.** The Parties\n------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant**\n-------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant, Vestey Group Limited is a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales under company number 4494323 and having its head offices at St. John's Lane, London EC1M 4AF, United Kingdom (the \"Claimant\" or \"Vestey\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Messrs. Nigel Blackaby, Sylvia Noury, Lluis Paradell, Jean-Paul Dechamps, Cristian Nitsch, Katrina Woolcock, Lucia Mazzuca of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, and by Julio Pinto and Pedro Rangel of Travieso Evans Arria Rengel & Paz.\n\n**2. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the \"Respondent\" or the \"Republic\").\n\n6.\n\nSince 20 August 2014, the Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Messrs. Osvaldo Guglielmino, Diego Brian Gosis, Manuel Galindo, Debora Espinoza, David Burguillos, Facundo Perez Aznar, Pablo Parrilla and Guillermo Moro of Guglielmino & Asociados S.A. Prior to 20 August 2014, the Respondent was represented by Messrs. Thomas B. Wilner, Fernando Mantilla-Serrano and Christopher M. Rayan of Shearman & Sterling LLP.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 October 2005 the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration filed by the Claimant against the Respondent (the \"Request\" or\"RfA\") dated 20 October 2005. The Request concerned the alleged expropriation and other violations of the obligations under the BIT in relation with Claimant\u2019s cattle farming business in Venezuela.\n\n8.\n\nIn the Request, the Claimant invoked Venezuela\u2019s consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in the BIT. The Claimant also relied on Venezuelan law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments (Decreto con Rango y Fuerza de Ley de Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de Inversiones) dated 22 October 1999 (the \"Venezuelan Investment Law\").\n\n9.\n\nOn 28 October 2005, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request pursuant to Rule 5 of the ICSID Institution Rules and transmitted a copy to Venezuela and to the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n10.\n\nThe Request, as supplemented by the Claimant\u2019s letter of 16 December 2005, was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 14 March 2006 pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On the same day, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 7(c) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, notified the Parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 May 2006, the Claimant requested the Centre to suspend the arbitral proceedings for a period of six months. On that same date, the proceedings were suspended until 19 September 2006. The suspension was extended at the Claimant\u2019s request on several occasions. The last suspension expired on 19 December 2011.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 20 December 2011, the Claimant notified Venezuela that the proceedings were resumed as of that date. By that same letter, the Claimant made a proposal to Venezuela as to the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment.\n\n13.\n\nOn 7 February 2012, the Parties agreed to again stay the proceedings until 21 February 2012.\n\n14.\n\nIn letter of 6 March 2012, the Claimant invoked the procedure for the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal established in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, *i.e.* one arbitrator appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator, who would serve as President of the tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. On 8 March 2012, Venezuela made a proposal about the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment, which departed from the procedure under Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n15.\n\nFollowing various exchanges between the Parties, the Claimant informed the Centre on 15 March 2012 that the Parties had reached an agreement on the method of constitution of the Tribunal. By this same communication, the Claimant appointed Prof. Horacio Grigera Naon, a national of Argentina, as arbitrator. Prof. Grigera Naon accepted his appointment on 20 March 2012. By letter of 18 April 2012, Venezuela appointed Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a national of France, as arbitrator. Prof. Dupuy accepted his appointment on 24 April 2012 (on 4 June 2012, he submitted an addendum to his declaration of acceptance).\n\n16.\n\nPursuant to the Parties\u2019 agreement, the co-arbitrators were requested to jointly propose a list of candidates to be considered by the Parties for the position of President of the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nBy email of 29 June 2012, the co-arbitrators informed the Center that the Parties had jointly selected Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, as President of the Tribunal, from the list of candidates that they had proposed. Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, accepted her appointment as President of the Tribunal on 5 July 2012.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of 6 July 2012, the Centre informed the Parties that all of the arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. Ms. Alicia Martin Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated by the Secretary-General of ICSID to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held by teleconference on 29 August 2012. Following the Parties\u2019 agreement that a meeting was not necessary, the first session was held among the Tribunal Members.\n\n20.\n\nDuring the first session, the Tribunal addressed the items on the draft procedural order as revised and agreed by the Parties, confirmed the Parties\u2019 agreements and decided on the points in dispute. On 30 August 2012, the Tribunal circulated Procedural Order No. 1 containing the Parties\u2019 agreements and the Tribunal\u2019s decisions, including a schedule of the proceedings.\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimant submitted its Memorial on the Merits (\"CM\") and accompanying materials on 15 January 2013.\n\n22.\n\nOn 1 March 2013, the Respondent submitted its Request for Bifurcation, pursuant to which it requested the Tribunal to suspend the proceedings on the merits and to determine the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as a preliminary matter.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant submitted its Observations on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation on 15 March 2013.\n\n24.\n\nOn 5 April 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, denying the Request for Bifurcation.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Objections to Jurisdiction (\"RCM\") and accompanying materials on 12 August 2013.\n\n26.\n\nOn 2 September 2013, following exchanges between the Parties, the Claimant submitted its First Request for the Production of Documents. On 16 September 2013, the Respondent submitted its Objections and Responses to the Claimant\u2019s First Request for the Production of Documents. On 23 September 2013, the Claimant filed a reply and, on 4 October 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, containing the Tribunal\u2019s decision on Claimant\u2019s First Request for Document Production.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits and Response to the Respondent\u2019s Objection to Jurisdiction (\"C-Reply\") and accompanying materials on 12 November 2013.\n\n28.\n\nOn 3 December 2013, following exchanges between the Parties, the Respondent submitted its First Request for the Production of Documents. On 17 December 2013, the Claimant submitted its Objections and Responses to the Respondent\u2019s First Request for the Production of Documents. On 24 December 2013, the Respondent filed its reply and, on 3 January 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, containing the Tribunal\u2019s decision on Respondent\u2019s First Document Production Request.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and its Reply on Jurisdiction and accompanying materials on 12 February 2014.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of 24 March 2014, the Claimant requested an order from the Tribunal granting the Claimant six weeks to file a response to the additional submissions on jurisdiction that the Respondent had filed together with its Rejoinder. By letter of 4 April 2014, the Respondent opposed this request. The Claimant also requested an order from the Tribunal regarding the Respondent\u2019s alleged submission of privileged documents and the allegedly untimely submission of documents by the Respondent.\n\n31.\n\nOn 17 April 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, in which it addressed a number of objections and requests made by the Claimant in connection with the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder and granted the Claimant\u2019s request regarding the filing of a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter of 2 May 2014, the Claimant made additional observations in relation to the Respondent\u2019s alleged submission of privileged documents and untimely submission of documents. The Respondent commented on 16 May 2014.\n\n33.\n\nOn 30 May 2014, the Claimant filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"C-Rejoinder\") and accompanying materials.\n\n34.\n\nOn 18 June 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 addressing the privilege issue and the timeliness of the documents submitted by the Respondent. The Claimant submitted an additional communication on these issues on 19 June 2014.\n\n35.\n\nOn 27 June 2014, the Respondent requested the postponement of the time limits in Procedural Orders Nos. 5 and 6 by 60 days due to the changes in the legal team representing Venezuela in this case. The Claimant confirmed that it had no objection to this postponement by letter of 2 July 2014. By letter of 16 July 2014, the Tribunal noted the Parties\u2019 agreement.\n\n36.\n\nOn 20 August 2014, Venezuela appointed new counsel in this case.\n\n37.\n\nOn 14 October 2014, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 6 and the Parties\u2019 agreement, the Respondent submitted a redacted version of its Reply on Jurisdictional Objections and Rejoinder (\"R-Rejoinder\").\n\n38.\n\nOn 3 December 2014, the President of the Tribunal, acting by delegation of her coarbitrators, held a pre-hearing conference with the Parties to discuss outstanding matters in connection with the organization of the hearing.\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal followed up with Procedural Order No. 7 of 15 December 2014 dealing with hearing matters including a provisional schedule.\n\n40.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held in Paris from 28 January to 4 February 2015.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn this section the Tribunal sets forth the main facts underlying the present dispute as they arise from the record. When it considers that a fact is not established, the Tribunal will so state, in particular, by noting that the fact is disputed or that it is alleged by one Party. It will refer to additional facts when needed in the context of its analysis.\n\n**A.** Brief Overview\n---------------------\n\n47.\n\nVestey began its operations in Venezuela in 1909 and by the end of the 20th century it operated a cattle farming business extending over more than 290,000 hectares of land with a herd exceeding 100,000 heads of livestock.\n\n48.\n\nIn 1999, Venezuela adopted a new constitution mandating a land reform and the elimination of large idle estates *(\"latifundios\").* To implement the land reform, Venezuela passed the 2001 Land Law on 13 November 2001. The 2001 Land Law authorized the State to recover illegally occupied idle estates for public utility purposes and social use.\n\n49.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2006, the Respondent served several recovery *(\"rescate\")* notices directed towards certain Farms which Vestey operated. In this context, Vestey agreed to sell one of its Farms and to donate another one to the State (the \"2006 Agreement\"). After failed negotiations, the Respondent ordered in 2011 the recovery of all the remaining Farms operated by Vestey and took control over Vestey's movable and immovable property located on the Farms.\n\n**B.** Vestey's Cattle Farming Business in Venezuela\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nVestey started its activities in Venezuela in 1909 by leasing a slaughterhouse and a cold storage facility in Puerto Cabello for purchasing, processing and exporting beef1.\n\nSee CM, \u00b619.\n\n51.\n\nIn 1916, Lancashire General Investment Trust Limited,2 a UK corporation and a subsidiary of Vestey, established a Venezuelan branch, which it transformed much later in 1987 into a Venezuelan corporation by the name of Agropecuaria Flora \"Agroflora\" C. A. (\"Agroflora\").3 Agroflora has been indirectly owned by the Claimant through Vestey Holdings Limited and Vestey Farms Limited.4\n\nIn 1923, Lancashire General Investment Trust Limited, a company incorporated in the United Kingdom in 1911, was converted into the Lancashire General Investment Company Limited, while maintaining its Venezuelan branch, Exh. C-9.\n\nReferences to Agroflora will encompass its predecessor, Lancashire General Investment Trust Limited, later Lancashire General Investment Company Limited.\n\nWhere relevant, the reference to \"Vestey\" or the \"Claimant\" will encompass Vestey Group Limited and its direct and indirect subsidiaries and their legal predecessors, Exhs. C-9, C-10.\n\n52.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1988, Vestey registered the acquisition of the following agricultural land plots with the Venezuelan public registry of immovable property (the \"Public Registry\"):\n\ni. Hato Guataparo - State of Carabobo;\n\nii. Hato Matapalos - State of Apure;\n\niii. Hato Los Cocos - State of Apure;\n\niv. Hato Morichito - State of Apure;\n\nv. Hato Los Viejitos - State of Apure;\n\nvi. Hato La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera - State of Apure;\n\nvii. Hato San Pablo Pae\u00f1o - State of Apure;\n\nviii. Hato Turagua - State of Apure;\n\nix. Hato Punta de Mata - State of Apure;\n\nx. Hato Las Palmeras - State of Apure;\n\nxi. Hato Ca\u00f1afistolo - State of Apure;\n\nxii. Hato La Cueva - State of Gu\u00e1rico;\n\nxiii. Hato El Charcote - State of Cojedes;\n\nxiv. Hato El Carmen - State of Falcon (each one a \"Farm\" and collectively the \"Farms\").5\n\nExtracts from the Public Registry, Exhs. C-17, C-229.\n\n53.\n\nOver the years, Vestey improved the Farms by adding fences, developing pastures, and building warehouses and accommodations. Its activities consisted essentially in breeding, raising, fattening, slaughtering and selling cattle.\n\n54.\n\nIn its very early years, Vestey exported meat to Europe. Since 1919, however, the beef which it produced in Venezuela was sold exclusively on the domestic market. In addition to selling meat, Vestey also sold cattle to other farmers for further fattening and slaughter or for genetic improvements6. To improve the genetic quality of its own herd, Vestey imported purebred cattle and maintained a small genetic laboratory7.\n\nCM, \u00b653, 57.\n\nCM, \u00b657.\n\n55.\n\nAs of 31 October 2011, when Venezuela ordered the recovery of the Farms, Vestey's cattle farming business counted 114, 327 heads of livestock, including purebred and commercial cattle, as well as buffalos and equine stock.8 Vestey also owned 64 vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, pickups and trucks, 43 tractors and a light airplane9. Vestey employed around 280 permanent and up to 170 temporary staff in Venezuela.10\n\n*Id.*\n\nCM, \u00b646.\n\nCM, \u00b651.\n\n**C.** The Land Reform\n----------------------\n\n56.\n\nIn 1999, a year after President Chavez\u2019s election, Venezuela adopted a new constitution. The Constitution was in line with the socialist objectives that inspired Venezuelan politics at that time aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and ensuring a secure food supply.11 The Constitution mandated a land reform, and in particular, called for the adoption of measures to eliminate large idle estates12.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b65.\n\nCM \u00b671; RCM, \u00b67.\n\n57.\n\nIn that context, Article 307 of the Constitution provides for the elimination of large idle estates in the following terms:\n\n*\"The predominance of large land estates is contrary to the interests of society. Appropriate tax law provisions shall be enacted to tax fallow lands and establish the necessary measures to transform them into productive economic units, likewise recovering arable land. Farmers and other agricultural producers are entitled to own land, in the cases and forms specified under the pertinent law. \"13*\n\nIn Spanish: \"El r\u00e9gimen latifundista es contrario al inter\u00e9s social. La ley dispondr\u00e1 lo conducente en materia tributaria para gravar las tierras ociosas y establecer\u00e1 las medidas necesarias para su transformaci\u00f3n en unidades econ\u00f3micas productivas, rescatando igualmente las tierras de vocaci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola. Los campesinos o campesinas y dem\u00e1s productores agropecuarios y productoras agropecuarias tienen derecho a la propiedad de la tierra, en los casos y formas especificados en la ley respectiva.\" Article 307, Constitution of Venezuela, Exh. C-69.\n\n58.\n\nOn 13 November 2001, in accordance with the powers vested in him,14 the President of Venezuela passed the 2001 Land Law. The 2001 Land Law created the National Land Institute (\"INTI\"), an administrative organ within the structure of the Ministry of Public Power of Agriculture and Lands (the \"MOA\").15 It also established regional land offices (\"RLOs\") as subdivisions of INTI. The 2001 Land Law reiterated the purpose of eliminating *latifundios* as contrary to justice.16 It further provided for the recovery without compensation of state-owned agricultural land illegally occupied by private persons.17\n\nLaw Authorizing the President to Pass Decrees with the Force of Law, 11 November 2000, Exh. C-71.\n\nArticle 120, 2001 Land Law, Exh. C-29.\n\n*Id.,* Article 1, Exh. C-29.\n\n*Id.,* Chapter VII, Exh. C-29.\n\n59.\n\nAbout a year later, on 20 November 2002, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Venezuela struck down certain provisions of the 2001 Land Law.18 In particular, the Court declared Articles 89 and 90 unconstitutional. Article 89 mandated the President of INTI to authorize a preventive intervention into idle or uncultivated land, and Article 90 denied the right of compensation for improvements found on the recovered land.\n\nDecision of the Constitutional Court of Venezuela, Exh. C-31.\n\n60.\n\nAs a consequence, on 18 May 2005, the National Assembly of Venezuela (the \"National Assembly\") amended the 2001 Land Law (the \"2005 Land Law\").19 Among other matters, the 2005 Land Law reiterated the procedure for recovery without compensation of illegally occupied state-owned land.

It claims that the government failed to protect the Farms from invasions of squatters. It also contends that Venezuela took confiscatory measures against Vestey\u2019s Farms under the legal regime of the Land Law. In the following paragraphs, the Tribunal states the facts as they arise from the record to provide the reader with a picture as complete as possible. This said, it notes that the Claimant requests no relief in connection with events involving Hatos El Charcote, Guataparo and San Pablo Pae\u00f1o.23\n\nC-Reply, \u00b69.\n\n**1. Hato El Charcote24**\n-------------------------\n\nAgroflora sold Hato El Charcote to INTI by 2006 Agreement, as described below.\n\n63.\n\nIn October 2000, around 50 persons invaded Hato El Charcote. By April 2001, similar invasions resulted in the occupation of around 25% of Hato El Charcote.25\n\nCM, \u00b685.\n\n64.\n\nIn 2002, INTI started investigating Agroflora's title over Hato El Charcote26 and, by December 2003, the squatters were occupying more than a half of the *hato.* The RLO of the state of Cojedes noted in a technical report of June of that year that the squatters had built 140 homes and a school and were cultivating 3 400 hectares of El Charcote.27\n\n*Punto de Informaci\u00f3n,* 5 December 2002, Exh.

It also authorized the intervention into El Charcote. The Claimant claims that, shortly thereafter, during the three months from January to March of 2005, the squatters set fire to the farm buildings and pastures in Hato El Charcote.\n\n*Decreto* 585/04, 9 December 2004, Exh. C-37.\n\n66.\n\nOn 28 February 2005, the RLO of the state of Cojedes transmitted the file of Hato El Charcote to INTI, with a determination that there was no chain of valid title transfers for the estate and that the land was thus idle.29 That was followed by INTI's reports of 2 and 9 March 2005 which concluded that there was no valid title over Hato El Charcote and that the farm was unproductive.30\n\n*Expediente,* 28 February 2005, Exh. C-99.\n\nINTI reports, 2 and 9 March 2005, Exhs. C-100, C-101.\n\n67.\n\nOn 15 March 2005, INTI then issued a notice,31 by which it:\n\ni. Declared Hato El Charcote idle and state property;\n\nii. Ordered interim measures for the protection of the environment;\n\niii. Gave the squatters present on the territory of Hato El Charcote the right to remain *(\"derecho de permanencia\")',*\n\niv. Authorized the initiation of the process of recovery of Hato El Charcote.\n\n*Notificaci\u00f3n,* 15 March 2005, Exh.

This request was still pending when Vestey sold Hato El Charcote to INTI in 2006 (see \u00b6\u00b6 73-78 below).\n\n**2. Other Farms**\n------------------\n\n70.\n\nIn February 2005, the RLO of the state of Apure started an investigation with respect to parts of Hato La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera.32 In that same year, similar investigations were conducted with respect to other Farms, namely Hatos Guataparo, Turagua, Los Viejitos, Ca\u00f1af\u00edstolo, Punta de Mata and Los Cocos.33\n\n*Boleta de Notificaci\u00f3n,* Exh.

On 1 October 2007, the Court dismissed the claim on the ground that the proceedings had been inactive for more than six months.\n\n72.\n\nOn 17 June 2005, INTI issued a similar notice declaring Hato San Pablo Pae\u00f1o and Hato La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera idle and state property.36 The notices included provisional measures for purposes of health and environmental protection. They also provided for the grant of *derechos de permanencia* to persons applying for such rights.\n\n*Boleta de Notificaci\u00f3n,* Exh. C-52.\n\n73.\n\nOn 6 September 2005, INTI notified Agroflora about the provisional measures. Two days later, about 70 squatters accompanied by armed forces entered Hato La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera.37 Following the intervention of the Director of INTI, who had been approached by Ms. dos Santos of Agroflora the squatters left the *hato* by November 2005.38\n\nRfA, \u00b684; RCM, \u00b665.\n\nDos Santos WS1,\u00b627.\n\n**E.** The **2006** Agreement\n-----------------------------\n\n74.\n\nIn October 2005 and then again in March of the following year, Ms. dos Santos met with the Director of INTI to discuss the situation at the Farms.39 This led to the conclusion of an agreement on 17 March 2006 between Vestey (including Vestey Group Limited, Vestey Farms, Agroflora, Agroni\u00f1a, and Haciendas Guataparo) and INTI, according to which Vestey undertook to sell Hato El Charcote to INTI for 9 billion bolivars (approximately USD 4 million) and to donate Hato San Pablo Pae\u00f1o (the \"2006 Agreement\"). Vestey also agreed to stay the ICSID proceedings which it had initiated about half a year earlier. For its part, INTI agreed to revoke its resolutions of 2005 declaring certain Farms state property, including the two Farms subject to the 2006 Agreement as well as two others, namely Hatos Los Cocos and La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera. It did so in the following terms:\n\n*\"Revise and revoke its resolutions of 12 March 2005, concerning the farm El Charcote, 31 March 2005, concerning the farm Los Cocos-Morichito, 17 June 2005, concerning the farms San Pablo Pae\u00f1o and La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera, and hand over the productivity and sufficiency of title to each of the said farms through the certificate of productive farm and/or relevant administrative acts, in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Lands and Agricultural Development [the Land Law] [...]. \"40*\n\nCM, \u00b6106.\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"Revisar y revocar sus Resoluciones de fecha 12 de marzo de 2005, respecto del fundo El Charcote, 31 de marzo de 2005., respecto del fundo Los Cocos-Morichito, 17 de junio de 2005, respecto de los fundos San Pablo Pae\u00f1o y La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera; y otorgar la productividad y suficiencia del t\u00edtulo de cada uno de dichos fundos por medio de un certificado de finca productiva y/o los actos administrativos pertinentes, de conformidad con las disposiciones de la Ley de Tierras y Desarrollo Agrario [...].\" Article 8.1.2006 Agreement, Exh.

He made a public statement welcoming Vestey\u2019s donation of the Farm to the state and asserting that the Republic was not going to take Vestey\u2019s cattle without compensation:\n\n*\"They have even gone as far as to donate the installations, that is to say, here there are houses, fences, things called improvements; and we are going to buy the cattle from them [...], and we are going to pay that to the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Inglesa [Vestey], it is theirs, how could we steal from them?* We *would be thieves, we would be... well, it would be cattle rustling, if we were to arrive here all macho, with the Army, the National Guard: \"This belongs to the State...\".

While it did not revoke its resolutions concerning Hatos Los Cocos and La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera, INTI issued productivity certificates for all the remaining Farms except Hato El Carmen.\n\n79.\n\nIn 2007, Vestey sold Hato Guataparo to a private person.\n\n**F.** Squatters at Hato Morichito\n----------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nIn May 2008, 30 to 40 indigenous families entered Hato Morichito, burned the fields and settled down on the farm land.46 The Claimant alleges that Venezuela took no action to expel the squatters from Hato Morichito and that Ms. dos Santos raised the issue during a meeting with Minister Loyo without success.\n\nCM, \u00b6116.\n\n81.\n\nIna letter dated 21 January 2009, the head of the RLO of the state of Apure, informed the National Guard about the settlement of indigenous families on the territory of Hato Morichito and requested help to provide them with agricultural infrastructure and water supply.47\n\nMr. Suarez\u2019s letter concerning the indigenous families, 21 January 2009, Exh.

C-144.\n\n83.\n\nIt is undisputed that this request for injunction was still at the stage of a summons in 2011 when the Respondent took control of the Farms (\u00b6\u00b696-107 below).\n\n**G.** Negotiations for The Sale of Agroflora\n---------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nIn late 2008, the Respondent initiated negotiations with Vestey with a view to buying Agroflora. Then, in March 2009, Ms. dos Santos and the Vice-President of Agroflora met with Mr. Ramirez, the President of state-owned PDVSA Agr\u00edcola to discuss the prospects of a sale of Agroflora's shares to PDVSA Agr\u00edcola. During the following month, Mr. Ramirez, with a delegation from PDVSA Agr\u00edcola, including management, technicians and veterinarians, visited Agroflora's premises and inspected the Farms in the state of Apure for one week.\n\n85.\n\nSeveral meetings followed such inspection and, on 2 July 2009, Vestey Farms, represented by Mr. Edelmann, and PDVSA Agr\u00edcola, represented by Mr. Ramirez, signed a letter of intent.49 The letter of intent recorded that the parties were interested in entering into a sale and purchase of the totality of the shares of Agroflora. It also laid down certain modalities of payment in installments for the event that the parties would agree on a price.\n\nLetter of intent, Exh. C-147.\n\n86.\n\nIn November 2009, Ernst & Young carried out a valuation of Agroflora's assets upon the instruction of PDVSA Agr\u00edcola. The valuation process included visits to the Farms and a review of documents necessary for a due diligence exercise.\n\n87.\n\nOn 3 March 2010, the parties met again to discuss the terms of the sale and purchase. Two days later, Mr. Edelmann wrote to Mr. Ramirez accepting to sell all the shares of Agroflora at the price of USD 120 million to be paid in instalments, terms which according to him - had been proposed at a meeting held at the offices of PDVSA Agr\u00edcola.50\n\nExh. C-152.\n\n88.\n\nApproximately three months later, Minister Loyo called Ms. dos Santos to a meeting, where he informed her that the MOA would replace PDVSA Agr\u00edcola in the sale and purchase negotiations.\n\n89.\n\nThereafter, on 17 August 2010, President Ch\u00e1vez approved a directive *(\"punto de cuenta\")* of the MOA, pursuant to which the government was authorized to pay between 247.5 million and 302.5 million bolivars for the acquisition of Agroflora. This valuation assigned no value to Agroflora's land.\n\n90.\n\nFollowing up on the directive, on 29 September 2010, Minister Loyo wrote to Ms. dos Santos offering a price of 247.5 million bolivars.51 The following day, Ms. dos Santos replied with a counteroffer of 273 million bolivars. She specifically referred to Vestey's right to repatriate the funds at the exchange rate of 1 USD to 2.60 bolivars pursuant to Article 2 of the Exchange Agreement No. 14 issued by the Minister of Popular Power of Economy and Finance.52\n\nExh. C-160.\n\nExh. C-150.\n\n91.\n\nOn 26 November 2010, Mr. Edelmann signed a term sheet, which insisted on Vestey being entitled to convert the proceeds of the sale, i.e. 273 million bolivars at 4.30 bolivars for 1 USD through CADIVI, the Venezuelan Foreign Currency Administration:\n\n*\"a. It is the essence of this agreement that [Vestey] shall obtain from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, through Venezuelan Exchange authorities, the payment for the sale of the shares [of Agroflora] at the Exchange rate of four point thirty bolivars per one United States dollar.*\n\n*b. - [Vestey] shall process the purchase price through C.A.D.I.

C-169.\n\n93.\n\nIn May 2011, Minister Loyo and Ms. dos Santos discussed the possibility that Vestey obtain the conversion of the purchase price from bolivars into US dollars through CADIVI. Ms. dos Santos then met the Head of the International Transactions Department and Chief Legal Advisor of CADIVI, who - according to the Claimant -advised that, as a foreign enterprise, Vestey could not register with CADIVI to buy and transfer US Dollars outside Venezuela. On 16 May 2011, Ms. dos Santos informed Minister Loyo about the outcome of the meeting with CADIVI.55\n\nExh.

The directive sought the President's approval to either purchase Agroflora with a payment in US dollars or recover the Farms pursuant to the Land Law.59 The President approved the recovery and made a public statement declaring \"the initiation of the administrative proceedings of recovery of land for exceptional circumstances of social interest and public use\".60 He continued: \"With this we take the complete administrative and operational control of Agropecuaria Flora....

INTI and Marisela rivaled to establish control over Agroflora\u2019s operations. Following the takeover, Agroflora\u2019s staff received a number of contradictory instructions from the representatives of INTI and Marisela.66 Despite advice to the contrary from the staff, the new administration conducted a cattle count in November at a time when the cows were pregnant. As a result, many cows miscarried and lost calves. The Marisela workers also disarmed the security guards in charge of defending the borders of the Farms.67 As a result, cattle theft increased. Several Marisela workers also began slaughtering cattle for their personal consumption. There were instances when Marisela workers invaded the personal premises where Agroflora\u2019s farm managers lived with their families.68 As a result, Agroflora\u2019s farm managers and several chief staff, including John Smith, who had been in charge of Agroflora\u2019s cattle operations, decided to resign.69\n\nTranscript, English, Day 3, 4:19 - 6:18.\n\nSmith WS, \u00b657.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 3, 17:21 -18:17.\n\nCM, \u00b6152.\n\n101.\n\nOn 13 November 2011, Ms. dos Santos wrote to Minister Loyo asking for a meeting in an attempt to find an amicable solution.70 Her message remained unanswered.\n\nEmail of 25 November 2011 from Ms. Dos Santos\u2019s to minister Loyo, Exh.

The request noted that the purpose of the recovery was to allow \"all domestic livestock producers, whether large, medium or small, the possibility of accessing developed genetic material through the sale of semen and bulls at affordable prices for the national agroindustrial sector of the economy\" and to \"strengthen and ensure the raising and fertility of the livestock with high genetic value.\"72\n\nRespondent's translation, in Spanish: \"permitiendo a todos los productores ganaderos nacionales ya sean grandes, medianos o peque\u00f1os, la posibilidad de acceder al material gen\u00e9tico desarrollado mediante la venta de semen y padrotes a precios solidarios para la econom\u00eda del sector agroproductivo nacional.\", Request of 30 November 2011 from the MOA to the Superior Agrarian Court, Exh. C-200.\n\n104.\n\nOn the very next day, on 1 December 2011, the Superior Agrarian Court granted the interim measures, allowing the MOA to occupy, possess and use Agroflora's property. The order also provided for the creation of an*ad hoc* administrative board, composed of three public officials to supervise the management and administration of Agroflora.73\n\nInterim measures of 1 December 2011, Exh. C-202.\n\n105.\n\nOn 5 December 2011, the Superior Agrarian Court served the interim order on Agroflora. On the same day, the MOA notified Agroflora of the appointment of the *ad hoc* administrative board composed of Messrs. Tom\u00e1s Rodriguez, Angel Alem\u00e1n and Richard D\u00edaz. The *ad hoc* board assumed the management of Agroflora and later dismissed Ms. dos Santos from her position as President of Agroflora.\n\n106.\n\nOn 9 December 2011, the Claimant filed an appeal from the decision granting the interim measures.74 The appeal was dismissed about 20 months later on 13 August 2013.75 The Claimant alleges that it was never served with the decision dismissing the appeal and that it learned of it through the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n*Oposici\u00f3n a la medida preventiva,* Exh.

ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n109.\n\nThis part deals with preliminary matters (A), preliminary objections (B), liability (C), quantum (D), and costs (E). Wherever appropriate, it first sets out the parties\u2019 positions before going into the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n\n**A.** Preliminary Matters\n--------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThis section addresses the scope of this Award (1), the relevance of previous decisions or awards (2), the law applicable to jurisdiction and merits (3), and certain procedural objections raised in the course of the proceedings (4).\n\n**1. Scope of this Award**\n--------------------------\n\n111.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal decided to join the proceedings on preliminary objections to the merits.80 Therefore, the present award finally disposes of all the issues in dispute, i.e. jurisdiction, admissibility, liability, and quantum.\n\nProcedural Order No.2.\n\n**2. The relevance of previous decisions or awards**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nBoth Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in support of their positions, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, in its judgment it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, it believes that, subject to compelling grounds to the contrary, it has a duty to adopt principles established in a series of consistent cases. It further believes that, subject always to the text of the BIT and the circumstances of each particular case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of international investment law, with a view to meeting the legitimate expectations of the community of states and investors towards legal certainty and the rule of law.\n\n**3. Applicable law to jurisdiction and merits**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that jurisdiction must be established under both Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Subject to the defenses discussed below, there is agreement that the jurisdictional requirements of these two instruments are met, and rightly so.\n\n115.\n\nIt is equally undisputed that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is governed by international law (save of course when international law refers to municipal law, which it does, for instance, in connection with the legality requirement; see 1\u00b6\u00b6202-206 below). Similarly, it is uncontroversial that the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the BIT is governed by customary international law as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (\"VCLT\"). It is finally accepted that the Tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction.81\n\nArticle 41 (1), ICSID Convention.\n\n116.\n\nAs to the law applicable to the merits, the Tribunal must resort to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:\n\n*\"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such an agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable. \"*\n\n117.\n\nThe Parties have not agreed on the rules of law that govern the merits of this dispute. Consequently, the Tribunal shall apply, in addition to the Treaty, Venezuelan law and international law when appropriate. The Tribunal is of the view that the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allocate matters to either law. It is thus for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law.82\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability, Exh. CLA-78, 14 December 2012, \u00b6179.\n\n118.\n\nWhen applying the law (whether national or international), the Tribunal is of the view that it is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. The principle *iura novit curia -* or better,*iura novit arbiter -* allows the Tribunal to form its own opinion of the meaning of the law, provided that it does not surprise the Parties with a legal theory that was not subject to debate and that the Parties could not anticipate.83\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015,\u00b6295 (\"[...] an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties. It can, *sua sponte,* rely on other publicly available authorities, even if they have not been cited by the parties, provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the parties were provided an opportunity to address it\"). *See also Fisheries Jurisdiction Case* (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, 25 July 1974, \u00b6 18 (\"[i]t being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain and apply the relevant law in the given circumstances of the case, the burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be imposed upon any of the Parties, for the law lies within the judicial knowledge of the Court.\"); *Albert Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL Case, Award, 23 April 2012, \u00b6141; *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013,\u00b6287.\n\n**4. Procedural objections at the hearing**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, the Parties made a few procedural objections. At the end of the hearing, the Claimant indicated that there remained no unresolved objections.84 The Respondent, however, maintained the objections put forward throughout the hearing.85 The Tribunal has considered and resolved the objections during the hearing. For the sake of the record, the Tribunal restates its decisions on those main objections.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 6, 197:6.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 6, 197:8-10.\n\n**a. Exhibit C-178**\n--------------------\n\n120.\n\nIn its opening statement, Venezuela relied on a word document which was purportedly attached to the email presented by the Claimant as exhibit C-178. The Respondent maintained that the author, Mr. Tom\u00e1s Rodriguez, an employee of the MOA, first sent the email and its attachment to Minister Loyo, and then forwarded it to Ms. dos Santos. The word document, entitled *\"Agroflora Justificativo de divisas\",* had been prepared by Agroflora\u2019s advisors in order to persuade the government to pay for Agroflora in foreign currency. The Respondent sought to rely on the metadata of the word document in order demonstrate its origins and the date of its creation. According to Venezuela, Mr. Tom\u00e1s Rodriguez misled Minister Loyo by not mentioning that the document originated from Agroflora.86 He now faces criminal charges. This matter, says the Respondent, is outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, since it involves issues of criminal law.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 1, 196:6-15.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimant objected to the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the content of the word document. According to Vestey, the word document is not in the record. Exhibit C-178 is an email from Mr. Tom\u00e1s Rodriguez to Ms. dos Santos, which forwards an email earlier sent to Minister Loyo. The attachment is not included in Exhibit C-178. If Venezuela wished to rely on the attached word document, says the Claimant, it should have introduced it into the record. That would allow the Claimant to refute the arguments which Venezuela purports to make in connection with that document. In any event, the Claimant adds that the authorship of the document is undisputed, as it had noted in its Memorial (footnote 297) that Agroflora\u2019s external counsel had prepared that word document.\n\n122.\n\nAfter the Claimant\u2019s explanation that the document originated from Agroflora\u2019s advisors, the President of the Tribunal asked the Respondent whether the explanation as to the authorship of the document and the reference to footnote 297 of the Claimant\u2019s memorial resolved the matter.87 Counsel for the Respondent answered affirmatively.88 Therefore, the Tribunal deemed the procedural incident resolved. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal has not relied on Exhibit C-178 or its attachment in the following analysis. Nor did the Tribunal rely on the statement or conduct of Mr. Tom\u00e1s Rodriguez.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 1,220:11-15.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 1,220:16.\n\n**b. Sequestration of Diana dos Santos**\n----------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nMs. dos Santos stated during her cross-examination on the second day of the hearing that she was informed of Mr. Tom\u00e1s Rodriguez\u2019s arrest.89 The arrest having been mentioned on the first day of the hearing, the Respondent raised an objection, according to which the witness\u2019s knowledge of the content of the hearing was a violation of the procedural rules. In particular, the Respondent referred to paragraph 11.6 of Procedural Order No. 7 providing for the sequestration of witnesses. In the Respondent\u2019s opinion, a witness may not become privy of the content of the hearing before he or she takes the witness stand.90\n\nTranscript, English, Day 2, 140:3-12.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 2, 140:18-24.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimant replied that paragraph 11.6 of Procedural Order No. 7 meant that a witness shall not attend a hearing prior to his or her examination and shall have no communication with the Party offering his or her evidence from the moment the examination begins. In any event, according to the Claimant, counsel had merely asked Ms. dos Santos on the eve of her appearance whether she was aware of Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s detention.91\n\nTranscript, English, Day 2, 144:8-16.\n\n125.\n\nFaced with these positions, the Tribunal invited the Parties to examine the text of paragraph 11.6 of Procedural Order No. 7, which reads as follows:\n\n*\"(a) In accordance with paragraph 14.19 of Procedural Order No. 1, fact witnesses are not permitted to attend the hearing (including the opening arguments) before their testimony but can attend thereafter. Expert witnesses can attend the hearing at any time, both before and after their testimony.*\n\n*(b) Once their testimonies have begun, witnesses and experts shall be isolated until they have completed their testimony and shall have no contact with the Party which presented them, or that Party\u2019s Counsel, during any recesses or interruptions that may arise. In addition, fact witnesses shall not read the transcript before their testimony is closed. \"*\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that it read the provision to bar a fact witness from attending the hearing before the oral examination and to require sequestration or isolation throughout the duration of the oral examination.92 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the provision had not been breached, since Ms. dos Santos had not attended the hearing before her oral testimony or communicated with the Claimant and its counsel after her examination began. On this basis, the Tribunal deemed the procedural objection resolved.93 It asked the Respondent if the proceedings could move on and received a positive answer.94\n\nTranscript, English, Day 2, 142:18-25.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 2, 146:18-23.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 2, 146:24-25, 147:1; It is also telling that Venezuela has not raised any concerns on this point in its PHBs.\n\n**c. Baker & McKenzie\u2019s legal advice to Agroflora**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nOn the second day of the hearing, the Respondent requested that Vestey produce the documents pertaining to the legal opinion given by Baker & McKenzie to Agroflora in connection with the legality of the requirement to prove chain-of-title. According to Venezuela, it emerged from Mr. George Vestey\u2019s cross-examination that Baker & McKenzie had given the advice to Agroflora and not to Vestey and that the former had shared it with the latter. Hence, says the Respondent, Vestey cannot claim that the documents are privileged.\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimant opposed the request on several grounds. First, it maintained that Venezuela could and should have requested those documents during the document production phase. Second, because all documents were seized by the government in 2011, the documents exchanged between Baker & McKenzie and Agroflora were since in the Respondent\u2019s possession. Third, Vestey claimed that the documents are protected by attorney-client privilege, as Mr. Vestey had not said that Agroflora shared the legal advice with Vestey. He was simply aware of the conclusions of that opinion in his capacity of a member of Vestey\u2019s board of directors.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal asked whether Venezuela had submitted the same request at the document production stage. Counsel for the Respondent contested in the negative and explained that the need to consult those documents only arose after Ms. dos Santos relied on them during her cross-examination. The Tribunal noted that it would assess testimonies of witnesses having due regard to all the surrounding circumstances that affect the credibility of the statements of a particular witness, including the absence from the record of any document on which the witness relies in his or her answers. Upon this explanation, the Respondent modified the request and asked the Tribunal leave to rely on the fact of the existence of those documents.95 The Tribunal concurred, and the hearing went on.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 2, 138:6-15.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the above procedural objections to be minor incidents with no effect on the content of the Award. They are mentioned for the sole purpose of the avoidance of doubt. It is indeed telling that none of the Parties has put forward any complaints in connection with the Tribunal\u2019s handling of the hearing in their post hearing briefs. The Tribunal thus trusts that all objections have been satisfactorily resolved.\n\n**B.** Preliminary Objections\n-----------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent has raised the following preliminary objections involving the lack of identity of the present dispute and the one submitted to arbitration (1), and the absence of an investment (2).\n\n**1. Lack of Identity of the Disputes**\n---------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThis preliminary objection which was first raised during the opening statement at the hearing,96 relates to the alleged lack of identity between the dispute originally registered with the Center and the dispute now before the Tribunal. The Claimant opposes this objection as untimely and in any event unsubstantiated.\n\nCounsel forthe Respondent argued that \"the measures that [...] the Tribunal has to decide upon [...] were not included in that registration request\" (Transcript, English, Day 1,222:10-13). The President then asked if the Respondent was \"raising a new [...] objection [...]: that there is no identity between the claims as they stand today and the claims as they were brought in the request for arbitration in 2005?\" \" (Transcript, English, Day 1,222:21-25). The Respondent\u2019s counsel replied that \"paragraph 4(h) of the [Claimant\u2019s] jurisdiction rejoinder [...] cuts any link there may be between the original claims of the request for arbitration and the present claims [...]\" (Transcript, English, Day 1,225:12-16). After the President\u2019s further question about the nature of the new objection, the Respondent\u2019s counsel noted: \"We could call it a matter of inadmissibility; we could call it a consequence of the same objection of no investment\" (Transcript, English, Day 1,227:3-5).\n\n133.\n\nBecause this objection had not been raised earlier, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to set it forth in an additional submission filed on 29 January 2015 *(Escrito Adicional: Objeciones Jurisdiccionales y de Admisibilidad)* and gave the Claimant an opportunity to respond in writing by 31 January 2015. The Parties also addressed this objection in their post-hearing briefs, both in terms of timeliness or admissibility and substance.\n\n**a. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this objection is admissible irrespective of the time when it was raised. In support, it relies on ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) according to which an ICSID tribunal may assess its jurisdiction\u00a0*sua sponte* at any stage of the arbitration. For Venezuela, this rule entails that the Tribunal must examine a jurisdictional objection even if it is belated or has not been raised at all. In reliance on decisions of ICSID tribunals97 and of the ICJ,98 the Respondent contends that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by way of estoppel.\n\nE.g. *Government of the Province of East Kalimantan v. PT Karim Prima Coal,* ICSID case No. ARB/07/3,\u00b6219; *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, \u00b6\u00b6109-110.\n\nCase Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide *(Bosnia and Herzogovina v. Serbia and Montenegro),* ICJ Judgment, 26 February 2007, \u00b6\u00b6118, 127.\n\n135.\n\nOn the merits of the defense, the Respondent argues that \"the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction due to the complete lack of identity between the claims before it and the claims presented upon registration that gave rise to these arbitration proceedings.\"99 The 2006 Agreement settled the original legal dispute. The issues and the legal framework which the Claimant invoked thereafter \"are completely different\" from those relied upon when it started the arbitration in 2005.100\n\nR-PHB1,\u00b666.\n\nR-PHB1,\u00b632.\n\n136.\n\nTo substantiate its claim of difference, the Respondent refers to paragraph 4.h of the Claimant\u2019s rejoinder on jurisdiction101, which supposedly shows that Vestey does not challenge the Land Law itself, but only \"how the law was applied\".102\n\n\"The 2010 Land Law did not change the system of registration and ownership of land in Venezuela\" (Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, 1J4.h, quoted at R-PHB1,\u00b633).\n\nR-PHB1,\u00b635.\n\n137.\n\nThe dispute about the application of the Land Law, so says the Respondent, is a new dispute that could not have existed at the time of the Request for Arbitration. In light of the 2006 Agreement, \"there is a complete termination of the claims contained in the Request for Arbitration which gave rise to the arbitration proceedings\".103 In this context, Venezuela invokes *Azpetrol,* where the tribunal declined jurisdiction due to a binding settlement agreement entered into between the parties.104\n\nR-PHB1,\u00b658.\n\nR-PHB1,\u00b638.\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the representatives of the Claimant have acknowledged the settlement of the original dispute. It points in particular to a letter from Ms. dos Santos to President Ch\u00e1vez, saying that the 2006 Agreement established a solid basis for the \"alliance\" between the government and Agroflora.105 The Respondent also relies on Lord Vestey\u2019s communication to President Ch\u00e1vez saying that he was delighted to have reached an amicable settlement.106\n\nLetter of 11 April 2008 from Ms. Dos Santos to President Ch\u00e1vez, Exh. C-134.\n\nLetter of 9 May 2006, from Lord Vestey\u2019s to President Ch\u00e1vez, Exh. R-95.\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent further refutes Vestey\u2019s invocation of ICSID Arbitration Rule40(1)107 as this rule only governs incidental or additional claims and therefore does not apply here. In this case, the new claims concern an entirely new legal dispute, which replaced the original dispute.108 As a consequence, the Respondent concludes that \"it is impossible to consider that Venezuela has given its consent to an arbitration proceeding whose alleged causes have completely changed to the point that there is no identity between them and those stated in the request for arbitration that gave rise to such proceeding\".109\n\nICSID Rule 40(1) reads as follows:  \n \"Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"\n\n*Escrito Adicional,* \u00b624.\n\nR-PHB1,\u00b6145; see also \u00b663.\n\n**b. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Claimant contends that this objection is inadmissible, because it is raised too late. It in particular cites to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), which provides that jurisdictional defenses must be raised \"as early as possible\".\n\n141.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent had ample opportunity to raise its objections during the three rounds of written submissions. Even assuming that the basis for the objection lies in the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the objection would be time barred since the Rejoinder was filed over eight months prior to the hearing (Claimant\u2019s submission of 31 January 2015, p.8). \"If a Respondent were able to introduce objections at will in a final hearing\", writes the Claimant, \"the most fundamental rights of due process would be infringed to the Claimant\" (Claimant\u2019s submission of 31 January 2015, p.8).\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimant further relies on ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, pursuant to which a party which knows or should have known of a breach of an applicable rule and which fails to object promptly, is deemed to have waived its objection. By replying to Vestey\u2019s arguments without raising an objection, Venezuela waived its right to object.\n\n143.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant submits that the nature of the legal dispute initially registered before the Centre remains unaltered. In the 2006 Agreement, the Parties did not settle the dispute. Rather, Vestey only agreed to suspend the ICSID arbitration, while its discontinuance was \"specifically made subject to the prior fulfilment by the INTI of \u2018each and all\u2019 of its obligations under that Agreement\".110 Under Article 8 of the 2006 Agreement, Venezuela was to revoke the resolutions against the Farms, recognize the sufficiency of Vestey\u2019s title, and relocate the squatters. Venezuela failed to fully comply with these obligations. Indeed, Vestey consistently noted in its correspondence with ICSID and Venezuela after the 2006 Agreement that the implementation of the latter was \"still in course\".111\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b657.\n\nC-PHB2,\u00b662.\n\n144.\n\nIn addition, Vestey submits that the requirement of Article 36 of the ICSID Convention that the Claimant provide \"information concerning the issues in dispute\" cannot mean that such information must be exhaustive, nor can it prevent the Claimant from adding subsequent measures taken against the same investment after the initiation of the arbitration.112\n\nC-PHB2,\u00b667.\n\n145.\n\nFinally, if the Claimant\u2019s current claims are considered new or ancillary, they must be admitted under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 40. They are directly connected to the subject matter of the dispute and are within the scope of the consent of the Parties and the jurisdiction of the Centre.113\n\nC-PHB2,\u00b674.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the admissibility of the new objection. ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) requires that a jurisdictional objection be raised \"as early as possible\":\n\n*\"Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the countermemorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder\u2014unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time. \"*\n\n147.\n\nVenezuela argues that it learned of Vestey's abandonment of its original claims through the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, which was filed on 30 May 2014.114 Be this as it may, it then waited until the first day of the hearing on 28 January 2015 to raise its defense. A time lag of eight months does obviously not meet the \"as early as possible\" requirement.\n\n*Escrito Adicional,* \u00b632.\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent is of the view that its delay is without consequence as the Tribunal is under a duty to assess its jurisdiction of its own motion. In support of this argument, it relies on ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2), which reads as follows:\n\n*\"The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.\" (Emphasis added)*\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power to review its jurisdiction ex *officio* does not absolve the parties from compliance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1). If Venezuela really believed that the 2006 Settlement Agreement settled the dispute, that rule would have required it to raise its objection at the time when the arbitration resumed in 2011. Similarly, if the supposed novelty of the claims only became apparent in May 2014, the rule would have required Venezuela to react well before the hearing.\n\n150.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal considers this objection untimely and thus inadmissible. This being so, it notes that if the objection were admissible, it would not succeed on the merits. Indeed, the Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent when it argues that the present dispute is entirely different from the one presented in the Request for Arbitration.\n\n151.\n\nUnder Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention as well as under the BIT, the Tribunal must have jurisdiction over the \"dispute\". A dispute is not the equivalent of a claim. The former is a broader concept than the latter. As the *CMS* tribunal had put it, \"the fact that [the claims] may originate from different sources or emerge at different times does not necessarily mean that the disputes are separate and distinct.\"115 In the present case, the dispute hinges on the lawfulness of Venezuela\u2019s introduction of rules for the elimination of idle estates and the measures taken against Vestey\u2019s cattle farming business under such rules. While the factual matrix of the dispute has evolved and the formulation of the claims has followed this evolution, the essence of the dispute is unchanged. A review of the chronology confirms the unity or identity of the dispute.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, Exh. CLA-139,\u00b6109. *(\"CMS\").*\n\n152.\n\nIn the Request for Arbitration filed in 2005, the Claimant noted that \"the Land Law provided a new legal framework for state intervention with rural land in Venezuela\"116 and that the \"dispute concerns the illegal treatment and confiscation by Venezuela of the country\u2019s principal cattle farming business, which has been owned by Vestey for some 90 years\".117\n\nRfA, \u00b652.\n\nRfA, \u00b67.\n\n153.\n\nThe 2006 Agreement did not put an end to the dispute so described. The Parties do not dispute that it merely suspended the arbitration. It failed to resolve the major aspect of the dispute which turns on the ownership of the Farms. The Respondent itself argues that the 2006 Agreement did not provide for an unconditional recognition of Vestey\u2019s title to the Farms.118 Nor did the 2006 Agreement change the allegedly expropriatory regime of the Land Law about which Claimant complained in its Request for Arbitration.\n\n\"[T]he only unqualified obligation that the Republic undertook in the 2006 Agreement was to provide payment to Agroflora for *Hato El Charcote* and the cattle in *Hato San Pablo Pae\u00f1o\"* (R-Rejoinder, \u00b698).\n\n154.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s submissions after the recommencement of this arbitration in 2011 further demonstrate that the 2006 Agreement did not bring about a solution to the dispute. The Claimant continued to complain of Venezuela\u2019s adoption of the Land Law, which, it said, eviscerated \"the legal framework upon which landowners like Vestey had relied\".119 In its Reply, the Claimant captured the essence of the dispute as follows:\n\n\"As from *2001, the regime of President Ch\u00e1vez decided to fundamentally alter the concept of ownership of property, annihilating over a hundred years of property rights, as enshrined in the Constitution, and otherwise in Venezuelan law, by requiring owners (in some cases decades after the land was purchased with registered title or acquired by way of acquisitive prescription) to collect and furnish to the government documentary evidence of a chain of title back to beyond 1848\".120*\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6260.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6177.\n\n155.\n\nHistory did not stand still after Vestey had initiated arbitration in 2005. The situation evolved, new facts accrued with the Respondent\u2019s amendment of the Land Law and measures taken under its regime, such as the recovery notices, the interim measures and final recovery. While these developments have densified the dispute, they have not changed its nature and identity.\n\n156.\n\nIn contrast, the Respondent submits that paragraph 4(h) of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction demonstrates the termination of the original dispute. The passage quoted by the Respondent reads as follows: \"[t]he 2010 Land Law did not change the system of registration and ownership of land in Venezuela\". The paragraph, however, continues to explain: \"Nonetheless, it [the Land Law] introduced, by way of Article 82, an administrative process enabling the INTI to \u2018recover\u2019 land \u2018attributed to individuals\u2019 (including, according to the INTI, those holding registered title) who could not document Chain of Title.\" Put in their context, these words show no intention to abandon the original complaint about the unlawfulness of the regime of the Land Law. Instead, the Claimant continues to denounce the incompatibility of the Land Law with the rules of private ownership in Venezuela and with Venezuela\u2019s obligations under international law.\n\n157.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent does not object to the admissibility of the Claimant\u2019s ancillary and new claims under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(1), and rightly so. The current claims are indeed closely connected to the original claims, as they both concern violations of the BIT by measures taken under the Land Law against the Claimant\u2019s cattle farming business.\n\n**2. Investment: Lack of Title**\n--------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the existence of a protected investment. Specifically, they diverge on whether Vestey has made an investment in accordance with the laws of Venezuela as required by the BIT. Their major difference turns on whether, prior to the disputed land reform, Venezuelan law required a registered land owner to prove a perfect chain of title tracing back to the period when the land was first released into private ownership, in some cases as early as 1848.121\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6114, 115; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b659, 60, 61.\n\n**a. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and under the BIT, because the Claimant has made no investment in accordance with the law of Venezuela as it has not acquired sufficient ownership title to the Farms.\n\n160.\n\nVenezuela notes that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention lacks a definition of \"investment\" and leaves it to the parties \"to define a certain transaction as an investment or accept certain types of investments under the protection of the treaty\".122 By contrast, Article 13 of the BIT contains a \"clear condition imposed by [Venezuela] and the United Kingdom\" that it \"applies only to investments made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host country\".123\n\nRCM, \u00b6101.\n\nRCM, \u00b6102.\n\n161.\n\nThe Respondent relies on *Saba Fakes v. Turkey124* to submit that, if the legality requirement is not met, the BIT will not apply and there will be no consent to arbitrate the dispute within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent also invokes *Fraport v. Philippines125,* contending that disrespect for the laws of the host state places an Investment outside the protection of the investment treaty. It adds that Vestey's good faith purchase of the Farms is not disputed. Rather, the disagreement hinges on Vestey's inability to prove the ownership over the land under the applicable rules of Venezuelan law.126\n\n*Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010, RLA-61 (\"Saba *Fakes v. Turkey\").*\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/12, Award, 10 December 2014. *(\u2018Fraport v. Philippines\").*\n\nTranscript, English, Day 6, 161:11-24.\n\n162.\n\nIn reliance on *Cementownia v. Turkey,127* Venezuela further submits that the legality must be assessed on the date of the events which form the basis for the claims.\n\n*Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/2, Award, 17 September 2009. *(\u2018Cementownia v. Turkey\")..*\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to argue that, in the present case, the Claimant failed to demonstrate that it made an investment in accordance with the laws of the host state.128 Specifically, the Claimant has not shown that it acquired title over the Farms. To substantiate this argument, the Respondent contends that \"[u]nder the Land Law, farm lands are considered to be state property unless the possessor can demonstrate its ownership through a perfect chain of title tracing back to the valid release of the land by the Venezuelan government\".129\n\nRCM, \u00b6107.\n\nRCM, \u00b6112, citing the 2010 Land Law, Art. 82.\n\n164.\n\nFor the Respondent, the requirement of a perfect chain of title is not new; it was present in Venezuelan law since at least 1936.130 The legislation governing vacant land and certain domestic court decisions provide for a presumption that the state is the owner of vacant agricultural land until a private person proves its ownership. Specifically, the Respondent relies on the 1848 Vacant Land Law (\"Ley *de 10 abril de 1848, Sobre Averiguaci\u00f3n de Tierras Bald\u00edas, su Deslinde, Mensura, Justiprecio y Enajenaci\u00f3n\"),* as well as on 1919 and 1936 Vacant Land Laws, the latter being still in force.\n\nR-Rejoinder \u00b6292.\n\n165.\n\nTo substantiate the existence of the presumption, Venezuela particularly cites Article 1 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law, which reads as follows:\n\n*\"All lands within the borders of the Republic, which are not communal or private property and do not belong legitimately to corporations or juridical persons shall be considered vacant.\"131*\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"Son bald\u00edos todos los terrenos que, estando dentro de los l\u00edmites de la Rep\u00fablica, no sean ejidos ni propiedad particular ni pertenezcan leg\u00edtimamente a corporaciones o personas jur\u00eddicas.\" The Vacant Land Law of 1936, Exh. R-3.\n\n166.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to decisions of the Supreme Court of Venezuela handed down in 1933 and 1991. The latter suggests that Article 1 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law \"creates a legal presumption in favor of the Republic, as claimant, so that it is only necessary to claim that certain land is vacant for creating the burden of the respondent to demonstrate its ownership of said lands [,..].\"132\n\nRespondent\u2019s translation, Supreme Court Decision, Exh. RLA-21.\n\n167.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent maintains that Vestey failed to discharge its burden of proving the ownership over the land. Especially, during the administrative recovery proceedings initiated by INTI, the Claimant was given multiple opportunities to prove ownership by showing an uninterrupted chain of title since the time when the land was first privately owned. The Claimant failed to do so and expressly recognized that failure in its internal communications.133\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6124, 125, 130.\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the extracts from the Public Registry presented by the Claimant134 in an attempt to prove ownership contain numerous inaccuracies, especially with respect to the areas of land. In any event, the Respondent argues that the registration merely proves \"just title\" *(\"justo titulo\"),* which is not sufficient to prove ownership. Just title shows the good faith intentions of the parties to a transaction. However, it does not establish that title was legally transferred, since no one can transfer more rights than he or she holds. Hence, any deficiency in the title that may have existed earlier in the chain affects the validity of all subsequent titles.\n\nExtracts from the Public Registry, Exhs. C-17, C-229.\n\n169.\n\nConsequently, for Venezuela, \"Vestey\u2019s inability to prove a perfect chain of title means that Vestey has not made an \u2018investment\u2019 in accordance with the laws of Venezuela\".135 Moreover, \"even if the Tribunal were to consider the Farms to be an \"investment\" under the Treaty, they are not an investment of a national of a Contracting Party, as required by Article 2 of the Treaty. Without perfect title, Vestey is not the lawful owner of the Farms and, as such, is notan investor within the meaning of the Treaty\".136\n\nRCM, \u00b6135.\n\nRCM, \u00b6135.\n\n**b. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Claimant first submits that Venezuela\u2019s objection concerning land ownership \"cannot go to jurisdiction\".137 Irrespective of the Tribunal's finding on the title over the land, Its ownership over the \"buildings, infrastructure, improvements to the land, livestock or vehicles that were seized by the Venezuelan government in November 2011 has not been contested by the Respondent\".138Thus, according to the Claimant, \"[t]here can be no doubt that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Vestey's claims insofar as they relate to the seizure of these (non-land) assets by Venezuela\".139\n\nFirst C-PHB, \u00b636.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6148.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6149.\n\n171.\n\nThe Claimant accepts that jurisdiction only extends to disputes arising out of an investment made in accordance with the laws of the host state. It submits that it has made such an investment as it held registered title over the Farms. For Vestey, such registered title is sufficient ownership title under Venezuelan law.\n\n172.\n\nAbout the alleged inaccuracies in the registered land areas, the Claimant explains that \"many of Agroflora\u2019s old registered titles did not employ modern measurement techniques and referred often to physical defining features and so the listed areas do not always correspond precisely to what can now be measured with precision\".140 In any event, the discrepancies between the actual surface of the Farms and their registered surface has no impact on Vestey\u2019s ownership.141\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6240.\n\nC-PHB2, p.37.\n\n173.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant submits that Venezuela's reliance on the Land Law and in particular on Article 84 of the 2010 Land Law introducing the requirement of the perfect chain of title is a matter for the merits. For Vestey, the Land Law is itself a measure in breach of the BIT, which allowed Venezuela to recover the land without compensation.142 If Venezuela could rely on the Land Law to avoid jurisdiction, the treaty protections would become illusory.143 Or in Claimant\u2019s words, \"Venezuela cannot avoid its liability under the Treaty by invoking its own domestic law, and the very measure that constitutes part and parcel of its wrongful conduct under the Treaty and international law\".144\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6154.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6155.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6156.\n\n174.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the existence of an investment and hence the validity of the title over the assets comprising an investment must be assessed as of \"the date on which the measures that gave rise to the dispute took place\".145 Thus, for jurisdictional purposes the Claimant only needs to demonstrate that it held an ownership title over the Farms before the introduction of the measures complained of in this arbitration.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b632, footnote 43.\n\n175.\n\nTo prove that it acquired the ownership title over the land, the Claimant relies on the presumption of validity of its registered title. The Civil Code of Venezuela and the Law of Public Registry provide that the registered title constitutes valid and sufficient title. For Vestey, only a final judicial decision can invalidate a registered ownership title.\n\n176.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant invokes the principle of acquisitive prescription. The Civil Code of Venezuela provides for the acquisition of ownership by operation of continued and uninterrupted possession of the land for more than 10 years. In reply to the Respondent's argument that acquisitive prescription may only be declared by a judge, the Claimant asserts that it raised acquisitive prescription in court proceedings in 2005 when it sought the annulment of INTI's resolutions. The Agrarian Court considered however, that annulment proceedings were not the appropriate procedural setting to rule on a claim of acquisitive prescription. The Claimant could not have presented an independent request for declaration of acquisitive prescription as, according to the Code of Civil Procedure, an action for declaration of acquisitive prescription may be filed against persons who are registered owners of the real estate in question. As Vestey was itself a registered owner, it could not have brought the action against itself.146\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b656.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimant also opposes the Respondent's argument that Venezuelan Law required demonstrating the perfect chain of title even prior to the introduction of the Land Law. The 1848 Vacant Land Law merely \"provided a way for occupiers or tenants of vacant lands to be transferred ownership of lands - nothing else\".147 As for the 1919 Vacant Land Law, the Claimant contends that \"Article 6.3 required proof of title (such as the registered title) for land acquired after 10 April 1848 but did not require proof of a *chain of title* back to or before that date\".148 Under 1936 Vacant Land Law, the possessors of land were only required to show title \"in cases where their possession of allegedly idle land was being challenged before a court pursuant to Article 10 of the same law\".149\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b626.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b628.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b632.\n\n178.\n\nMoreover, according to Vestey, the 1991 Supreme Court decision invoked by the Respondent did not require a chain of title to prove ownership; registered title is sufficient for purposes of proof of ownership.150\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b634.\n\n179.\n\nFurther, to refute the Respondent's argument that Agroflora's staff acknowledged not being able to prove title, the Claimant submits that \"[t]hese emails (written by business executives, not lawyers) do nothing more than discuss the INTI's unreasonable requests for Agroflora to produce documentation to prove Chain of Title. At no stage do these communications acknowledge that the INTI's requirements were legal or properly applied to Agroflora as a matter of Venezuelan law\".151\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b643.\n\n180.\n\nFinally, the Claimant invokes the principle of estoppel to argue that, in light of the government's prior recognition of Vestey\u2019s title on multiple occasions and \"after decades of peaceful possession [...], Venezuela must be prevented from changing course at this stage and denying the validity of Vestey's title in this arbitration\".152\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6173.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n181.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, jurisdiction must be established under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Both instruments make jurisdiction conditional upon the existence of an investment. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention does so in the following terms:\n\n*\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"*\n\n182.\n\nAnd Article 8 of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n*\"Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former [...] shall [...] be submitted to international arbitration [ICSID]\"*\n\n183.\n\nArticle 13 of the BIT further specifies the scope of application of the treaty and introduces a legality requirement with the following wording:\n\n*\"The present Agreement shall apply to investments in the territory of one Contracting Party made in accordance with its laws and regulations by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party...\"*\n\n184.\n\nIt Is common ground between the Parties that the investment must satisfy the legality requirement of Article 13 of the BIT to be protected.\n\n185.\n\nIn the following section, the Tribunal will start by determining whether there is an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention (i) and of the BIT (ii). It will then assess if the investment at issue is an investment \"of\" the Claimant as required by Article 8(1) of the BIT (iii). Thereafter, the Tribunal will analyze whether the investment complies with the requirement of legality contained in Article 13 of the BIT (iv). It will not address the other jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, which are undisputed and rightly so.\n\ni. *Investment under the ICSID Convention*\n------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe lack of definition in the ICSID Convention does not deprive the term \"investment\" of its significance. Like any other term of a treaty, it must be interpreted on the basis of its ordinary meaning, in its context, and in the light of the treaty's object and purpose.153\n\nArticle 31, VCLT.\n\n187.\n\nA majority of ICSID tribunals hold that the term \"investment\" in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention has an independent meaning.154 On the basis of ICSID jurisprudence as it has evolved, it can now be considered that the definition of \"investment\" comprises three components: a commitment or allocation of resources, risk, and duration.155\n\nE.g. *Saba Fakes v. Turkey,* \u00b6108; *Global Trading Resource Corp, and Globex International, Inc. v. Ukraine,* Award, 1 December 2010,\u00b643.\n\n*See e.g.* *LESI Spa et Astaldi S.p.A. v. People\u2019s Democratic Republic of* Algeria, Decision on Jurisdiction, 12 July 2006,\u00b672; *Saba Fakes v. Turkey,* \u00b6102.\n\n188.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that during more than a century from 1909 to 2011, Vestey contributed substantial resources to establish and operate cattle farming enterprise in Venezuela. It paid for the land, livestock, vehicles and other equipment; it incurred the costs for maintaining the Farms, creating and improving pastures, and genetically improving the herd. It is not disputed that Vestey\u2019s operations in Venezuela involved risks; nor that Vestey operated in Venezuela for a long time.\n\n189.\n\nHence, Vestey\u2019s business in Venezuela meets the definition of investment within the meaning of the ICSID convention.\n\nii. *Investment under the BIT*\n------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nArticle 1 of the BIT defines investment as follows:\n\n*\"\u2019Investment\u2019 means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:*\n\n*(i) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as mortgages liens or pledges;*\n\n*(ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company;*\n\n*(iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value;*\n\n*(iv) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes and know-how;*\n\n*(v) business concessions conferred by Law or under contract, including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.*\n\n*A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments;\"*\n\n191.\n\nVestey held 100% ownership interest in its cattle farming enterprise, *i.e.* Agroflora. Vestey's shareholding in Agroflora clearly falls within the BIT'S list of assets and, in particular, under the category of \"shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company.\"\n\n192.\n\nIn line with a series of more recent decisions,156 the Tribunal is of the opinion that the BIT notion of investment implies that the asset falling within the list be the result of an allocation of resources made by the investor. In this case, as was just mentioned, it is undisputed that Vestey contributed substantial economic resources into its Venezuelan cattle farming business. This condition is thus met.\n\n*Romak S.A. v. The Republic of Uzbekistan,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA280, Award, 26 November 2009,\u00b6207; *KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013,\u00b6165.\n\niii. *Investment \"of\u2019 an investor*\n----------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nThe consent to arbitrate expressed in Article 8 of the BIT covers disputes about the Respondent's obligations \"in relation to an investment of the national or company\" of the other Contracting State. It is common ground that Vestey qualifies as such a \"national or company\" of the UK. The Respondent, however, maintains that the investment is not an investment \"of\" Vestey, as Vestey failed to acquire the necessary title over the land.157\n\nRCM, \u00b6135.\n\n194.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that Venezuelan law governs the issue of ownership of the asset constituting the purported investment.158 While the term \"investment\" itself is to be defined under the applicable rules of international law,159 the question whether or not the Claimant holds title over the assets constituting an investment is a matter of municipal law.160\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b632.f.\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 January 2004, *(\"Enron\")* \u00b638; *AES v.

See also Douglas, *International Law of Investment Claims,* CUP, 2009, p. 52, \u00b6102.\n\n195.\n\nIn the present case, the investment out of which the dispute arose is Vestey\u2019s interest in the cattle farming enterprise, Agroflora, a company incorporated under Venezuelan law. The relevant inquiry is thus whether the Claimant held title to the shares in Agroflora under Venezuelan law.\n\n196.\n\nThe question remains whether Vestey also needs to show title to the individual assets (land, livestock, equipment, vehicles, etc.) to hold an investment and, hence, for jurisdiction to be established over this dispute. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this question must be answered in the negative. This dispute arises out of measures affecting Vestey\u2019s interest in the cattle farming enterprise in its entirety. The measures were not directed exclusively at individual assets, such as the land plots. They targeted the enterprise as a whole. It is thus the cattle farming enterprise as a whole that must qualify as an investment of an investor.\n\n197.\n\nThe reasoning of the *Holiday Inns* tribunal is instructive in this regard:\n\n*\"It is well known [...] that investment is accomplished by a number of juridical acts of all sorts. It would not be consonant either with economic reality or with the intention of the parties to consider each of these acts in complete isolation from the others.\"161*\n\n*HolidayInnsv. Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 12 May 1974, at Lalive, The First \"World Bank\" Arbitration, p. 159. *(\"Holiday Inns\").*\n\n198.\n\nTherefore, to conclude that the present dispute arises directly out of an investment of an investor, it is sufficient to find that Vestey held title to the shares in Agroflora. Title\n\nto the individual assets will certainly be relevant to determine the value of the allegedly expropriated investment. This is, however, a question for the merits.\n\n199.\n\nThe case law relied upon by the Respondent confirms this approach limiting the jurisdictional enquiry to the ownership of the shares. In *Libananco v. Turkey,* the tribunal indeed held that:\n\n*\"Turkish law applies to the issue of whether (and when) Libananco acquired the shares in question and thus had an \"Investment\" under Article 26(1) of the ECT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"162*\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, EXH. RLA-102, \u00b6112, emphasis added *('Libanaco\").*\n\n200.\n\nNowhere did the **Libananco** tribunal analyze whether the local subsidiary held each and every asset in accordance with the applicable rules of ownership. Venezuela shares such understanding, when it notes that the **Libananco** tribunal declined jurisdiction because of the claimant\u2019s failure to prove title to the shares \"over which the measures in question applied\"163. The reasoning in*Saba Fakes* was similar, when the Tribunal enquired into the claimant\u2019s ownership of the shares in the local company.164\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: *\"sobre las que habr\u00edan reca\u00eddo las medidas en cuesti\u00f3n\"-,* R-PHB1, \u00b674, footnote 44.\n\n*Saba Fakes v. Turkey,* part V.B.2.iii.\n\n201.\n\nIt is undisputed that Vestey owned Agroflora's shares and Vestey presented registered corporate documents to this effect.165 Nothing in the record suggests nor is it alleged that Vestey did not follow Venezuelan law when it acquired the shares. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the present dispute arises out of the investment \"of\" the Claimant.\n\nExh. C-9.\n\niv. *Investment made in accordance with Venezuelan law*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nEven when the dispute arises out of an investment of an investor, the Tribunal may lack jurisdiction if the investment was made in violation of the host state's law. The Respondent is right when it maintains that the legality requirement set forth in Article 13 of the BIT limits the scope of BIT application to investments made in compliance with the rules of the host state.\n\n203.\n\nDuring the hearing, the President asked the Respondent whether its objection under Article 13 of the BIT related to the \"absence or non-existence of an investment\" or whether it was \"an objection based on legality\". The answer was that \"the objection is the existence of the investment because there is no proof of title.\"166\n\nTranscript, English, Day 6, 162:4-17; Upon the Presiding Arbitrator's further request for clarification as to whether the objection \"[was] purportedly on the basis of the inexistence of the investment\" the Counsel reconfirmed: \"Yes, that is correct.\" (Transcript, English, Day 6, 163:8-10).\n\n204.\n\nThe legality requirement enshrined in Article 13 of the BIT is distinct from that of the existence or ownership of an investment. To conflate the two would imply that an investment treaty without a legality requirement would do away with the condition of the existence of ownership of the investment. There is no need for long explanations to understand that this would be an absurd result. This view is for instance confirmed when looking at\u00a0*Saba Fakes,* which the Respondent cites. There, the tribunal considered the claimant\u2019s failure to acquire the ownership of the shares to be fatal to its jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\u00a0and Article 1 (definition of investment) of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT, irrespective of the legality requirement in Article 2(2) of that investment treaty.167\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent does not contest the legality of Vestey\u2019s acquisition of the shares in Agroflora.\n\n205.\n\nThe Respondent does not allege that Vestey committed a violation of Venezuelan law when attempting to acquire the land. Nor does it dispute that Vestey acted in good faith in connection with the acquisition of the land.168 It rather argues that the Claimant's attempt did not succeed because it did not fulfill the requirements for a valid acquisition of title. Assuming *arguendo* that this argument were correct, a failed good faith attempt to acquire property would not constitute a breach of laws and regulations contrary to the legality requirement. In other words, the objection falls outside the ambit of Article 13 of the BIT. It invokes the existence and ownership of the investment, which the Tribunal has already affirmed.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 6, 161:19-24.\n\n206.\n\nThus, even if it were established, Vestey\u2019s alleged failure to acquire ownership of the land would not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction. The Tribunal will therefore address the issue of Vestey\u2019s land ownership in the context of its analysis of the merits.\n\n**C.** Liability\n----------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Venezuela breached its obligations under the BIT. It primarily invokes Article 5 of the BIT, contending that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated Vestey\u2019s investment. Moreover, the Claimant argues that Venezuela breached Article 2 of the BIT by taking arbitrary measures contrary to the standards\n\nof full protection and security and fair and equitable treatment. However, according to the Claimant, if the Tribunal \"make[s] a finding of unlawful expropriation, with the natural damages consequences\", it need not consider the claims related to the alleged breaches of Article 2 of the BIT.169\n\nTranscript, English, Day 1.94:7-11.\n\n**1. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n**a. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimant invokes Article 5 of the BIT, which prohibits expropriation, \"except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of [the State] on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation [...]\".170\n\nCM, \u00b6 75.\n\n209.\n\nThe Claimant contends that \"[t]he critical factor in determining whether a government measure constitutes expropriation is the effect that the measure has on the asset in question; neither the state's intent, nor its subjective motives, nor the form of the measures are relevant in this regard\".171\n\nCM, \u00b6177.\n\n210.\n\nIt adds that measures that \"effectively deprive an investor of the use or enjoyment of its investment, including the deprivation of all or a significant part of the economic benefit of property, are just as expropriatory as the seizure of an investor\u2019s formal title to his property\".172\n\nCM, \u00b6183.\n\n211.\n\nFor the Claimant, the Respondent's justification concerning the absence of a valid title is \"divorced from reality, [and is] a mere pretext to take Vestey's farms without compensation\".173 In reliance on*CME,* the Claimant also argues that \"a change in the legal environment does not authorize a host state to deprive a foreign investor of its investment, unless proper compensation is granted\".174\n\nCM, \u00b6 79.\n\nCM, \u00b6 78, citing *CME.*\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that, through the Land Law, Venezuela set a legal framework allowing it to take over private property without compensation. This was followed by the takeover of the Farms and the appointment of the *ad hoc* administrative board in November 2011. As a result, \"[t]oday Vestey has no voting rights in relation to Agroflora, is unable to select the company\u2019s management or otherwise control its operations, and cannot sell or pledge any business assets. Vestey has received no dividends since the takeover, and given that the *ad hoc* board is tasked with collecting value for the state, no dividends will be forthcoming in future. The Claimant has thus, been deprived of all of the fundamental property rights that it once held in Agroflora and its assets, and no longer receives any economic benefit from its investment\".175\n\nCM, \u00b6187.\n\n213.\n\nIn rebuttal of Venezuela\u2019s argument that Vestey did not own the Farms because it is unable to prove a perfect chain of title Vestey states that the requirement of a chain of title is arbitrary and was introduced by the Land Law, which Venezuela is not entitled to invoke here. The contrary \"would be to give States carte blanche to circumvent their obligation not to expropriate without compensation simply by passing a law justifying the seizure of asset in each case on the basis that the government had determined that the asset actually belonged to the State\".176\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6178, emphasis omitted.\n\n214.\n\nVestey claims that it had registered title to the land, which Venezuela endorsed by acquiescence throughout decades. Since no judicial decision invalidated such registered title, Vestey must be deemed the legitimate owner of the land under Venezuelan law. In any event, Vestey notes that its ownership over the movable property (including livestock, vehicles and other assets) is undisputed. Accordingly, Venezuela's takeover of the Farms constituted an expropriation.\n\n215.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the expropriation effected through the takeover of the Farm was contrary to Article 5 of the BIT as it was not for a public purpose (i), was conducted in breach of due process (ii), without compensation (iii); and in a discriminatory manner (iv).\n\ni. *Public purpose*\n-------------------\n\n216.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s submission is that the expropriation of Agroflora lacked the public purpose demanded by Article 5 of the BIT. In spite of the broad margin of appreciation that is recognized to expropriating states, tribunals do assess the existence of a genuine public purpose.177 For instance, the *ADC* tribunal scrutinized the justification advanced by Hungary in the following terms:\n\n*\"In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, a treaty requirement for \"public interest\" requires some genuine interest of the public. If mere reference to \"public interest\" can magically put such interest into existence and therefore satisfy this requirement, then this requirement would be rendered meaningless since the Tribunal can imagine no situation where this requirement would not have been met. \"178*\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6223.\n\n*ADC v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, Exh. CLA-37,\u00b6432.\n\n217.\n\nFor Vestey, the requirement of public purpose in Article 5 of the BIT cannot be self-judging. Otherwise it would lack *effet utile,* an interpretive result contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s \"duty to interpret and apply the provisions of the Treaty in accordance with international law\".179\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6228.\n\n218.\n\nIt is Vestey\u2019s submission that the alleged aim of safeguarding the availability of food for the citizens is not a valid public purpose under the circumstances. In reality, Agroflora was a very productive cattle farming business which served the domestic market exclusively, thereby meeting the goal of making food available to the Venezuelan people. There is no evidence that under the government's control Agroflora's livestock was sold to the public at subsidized prices, or that purebred cattle was donated to local farmers to improve the genetic stock of their herd.180 In fact, so says Vestey, Venezuela targeted certain agrifood businesses for political reasons and not for the purposes which it puts forward.181\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6225.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6226.\n\nii. *Due process*\n-----------------\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Article 5 of the BIT affords the expropriated investor the right to a prompt review of its case and of the valuation of its investments by a judicial or independent authority. It further argues that it is entitled to broader due process rights provided by other BITs of Venezuela which are made applicable by way of the most favored nation (\"MFN\") clause of the BIT. In particular, the Claimant seeks to rely on Article 5 of the BIT between Venezuela and the Czech Republic, which expressly provides that an expropriation must be carried out \"under due process of law\".182\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6231.\n\n220.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that, in addition to an independent review mechanism, due process requires compliance with the procedures set forth by domestic law. According to Vestey, Venezuela failed to follow these procedures. Specifically, INTI's recovery notices violated the provisions of the Land Law, pursuant to which the interim measures must specify the period of their application and expressly protect the right of residence of the squatters.183 Moreover, as the interim measures did not provide the legal basis for the seizure of Agroflora's assets other than the land, the government asked the court to establish an *ad hoc* administrative board. The court granted this request in one day even though there was no threat of dissipation of the assets.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6234.\n\n221.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the expropriation process also failed to comply with Venezuela's own Expropriation Law, which imposes amicable negotiations involving the valuation of the property by three experts. The Respondent admits, so says Vestey, that it did not apply the Expropriation Law.184\n\nTranscript, Spanish, Day 3, 936:13-15; C-PHB1, 1J159, citing Minister Loyo.\n\n222.\n\nMoreover, Venezuela never informed the Claimant of the final Recovery Decisions of 19 December 2011. It is Vestey\u2019s case that it did not learn about their existence until it received Venezuela's Counter-Memorial. It was thus prevented from filing an appeal in time.185 Similarly, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 13 August 2013 dismissing Agroflora's appeal against the order for interim measures was not communicated to Vestey until the Respondent filed it as an exhibit to its Rejoinder in this arbitration.186\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6237.\n\nC-PHB1,\u00b6157.\n\n223.\n\nOverall, these multiple procedural flaws deprived Vestey of its right to a prompt review of its case and of the valuation of its investments by a judicial or independent authority. It is thus Vestey\u2019s submission that Venezuela breached the due process requirement embodied in Article 5 of the BIT.187\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6239.\n\niii. *Compensation*\n-------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent failed to provide prompt, adequate and effective compensation as required by Article 5 of the BIT. The requirement that compensation be prompt implies that the monies be paid as soon as possible. The compensation must also be adequate, *i.e.* \"equivalent to the full value of the asset taken\".188 Moreover, the Claimant relies on Articles 5 and 6 of the BIT to suggest that the compensation must \"be effectively realizable and be freely transferable\" and \"should be paid In a currency that can be Immediately converted into other currencies on the foreign exchange market\".189\n\nCM,\u00b6192.\n\nCM, 1f193.\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimant refutes the Respondent's invocation of the offer made during the 2010 purchase negotiations. For Vestey, the offer to pay 273 million bolivars made by Minister Loyo more than a year before Agroflora\u2019s recovery cannot be deemed an offer to compensate the expropriation.190 In any event, that offer did not meet the criteria of effectiveness and adequacy.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6192.\n\n226.\n\nEffectiveness entails that compensation be paid in freely convertible currency.191 Even if Article 5 were read not to require compensation in freely transferable currency, the Claimant contends that it is entitled to invoke the relevant provisions of other treaties by virtue of the MFN clause of the BIT. The Claimant specifically refers to Article 5 of the investment treaty concluded by Venezuela with the Czech Republic, which requires compensation to be \"effectively realizable and be made freely transferrable in a freely convertible currency\".192\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6197, citing *Biloune.*\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6202, emphasis omitted.\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimant recalls that the MOA made its final offer in bolivars, leaving the risk of the currency conversion to Vestey. The only possible conversion was through CADIVI, which \"rarely authorized access to foreign currency and had effectively stopped providing US Dollars to private applicants by the end of 2008\".193 In addition, officials of CADIVI had informed Ms. dos Santos that neither Agroflora nor Vestey were authorized to obtain US dollars. In other words, the price in local currency \"would have been neither freely transferable nor freely convertible\".194\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6204.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6204.\n\n228.\n\nIn any event, the price offered during the sales negotiations was inadequate. The offer was far below the value assigned to Agroflora by the Claimant's expert. It also failed to ascribe any value to Agroflora\u2019s land - which alone was worth USD 40.8 million. The fact that Vestey was prepared to accept Venezuela's offer if paid in US dollars does not make the offer adequate, since Vestey\u2019s acceptance \"represented a compromise, proffered in view of the relentless political pressure applied by Venezuela [,..].\"195\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6209.\n\n229.\n\nVenezuela also failed to pay the compensation promptly. Almost five years after the recovery, no payment has yet been made. The Claimant opposes the Respondent's argument that compensation may be paid even as late as five years after the taking. Relying on the authorities cited by the Respondent, the Claimant contends that the normal time for a payment of compensation is between three and six months and, in exceptional circumstances if the payment is made in installments, it should in any event not exceed five years, taking into account interest accrued on the deferred installments.196 Venezuela faced no exceptional circumstances. It did pay much larger settlement and compensation amounts to other foreign investors, thereby evidencing that it had sufficient foreign currency reserves.197 Even assuming extraordinary circumstances *quod non,* Venezuela did not offer alternative arrangements, such as the payment in installments.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6213, citing UNCTAD Report; UNCTAD Report, Exh. CLA-75.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6214.\n\niv. *Discrimination*\n--------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the expropriation of Agroflora was discriminatory. In reliance on the *Saluka* test, also invoked by the Respondent, the Claimant observes that \"a claim for discrimination would be made out where (a) similar cases, (b) are treated differently, (c) without reasonable justification\".198 The Claimant points to instances where Venezuela paid a purchase price or expropriation compensation in convertible currency to foreign investors, including in the food sector.199 By refusing to make a payment in US dollars for Agroflora, Venezuela treated Vestey differently from these other foreign investors in like circumstances.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6218.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6219, footnotes 360, 361.\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that \"Venezuela unlawfully expropriated Agroflora by seizing all of its assets (including its land, to which it had valid legal title) and control of its operations, in a manner that failed to meet each and every requirement of Article 5 of the Treaty.\"200\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6240\n\n**b. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the right to take private property for a public purpose is \"one of the essential elements of State sovereignty\"201 which entails \"a presumption of legitimacy [of expropriation], which needs to be proven wrong\".202\n\n*AIG Capital Partners, Inc. & CJSC Tema Real Estate Company* v. *Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/6, Award, 7 October 2003, Exh. RLA-34; RCM, \u00b6139.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6325.\n\n233.\n\nFor Venezuela, the allegedly expropriated land was in reality state property recovered in accordance with the Land Law, being specified that the requirement of continuous chain of title existed for decades.203 Vestey having failed to demonstrate its title over the land, the Respondent ordered the recovery of Agroflora \"for reasons of social interest and public utility pursuant to Article 84 of the Land Law\".204 Venezuela also took control of the non-land assets of Agroflora \"based on a court interim order issued under Article 196 of the Land Law\", as a \"fully appropriate means for obtaining timely control of such assets without disrupting the agrarian production\".205\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6320.\n\nRCM, \u00b6137.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6317, 321.\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent in particular calls attention to the decision of the Supreme Court which held that the interim measures did not affect Agroflora's ownership title over its non-land assets.206 Venezuela thus considers that, if it were ordered to compensate the Claimant, it would be entitled to ownership over these assets. In any event, the Respondent finds the distinction drawn between land and non-land assets artificial, as \"the Republic's actions may only be judged against the standard set forth in Article 5(1) of the Treaty\".207 The Respondent contends that it has complied with this standard, as the recovery pursued a public purpose (i); respected due process of law (ii); was accompanied by a good faith attempt to compensate Vestey (iii); and was non-discriminatory (iv).\n\nSupreme Court Decision, 13 August 2013, Exh. R-115, p. 11; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6322.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6323.\n\ni. *Public purpose*\n-------------------\n\n235.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that it \"is not required to justify the public policy rationale for which it decided to recover [Agroflora]\" as \"a State is 'entitled to a measure of deference' in defining the public interest\".208 It is not open to the Tribunal to call into question Venezuela\u2019s economic policies. Each state, so says the Respondent, is \"free to judge for itself what it considers useful or necessary for the public good\".209\n\nContrary to the Claimant's argument, such deference does not render the BIT'S requirement of public purpose meaningless. The Respondent adds that none of the authorities relied upon by the Claimant suggests \"second-guess[ing] the sovereign determination of the public purpose\".210 In particular, \"the strategic interest invoked by Hungary in *ADC* was a mere pretense.\" In the present case, the \"recovery occurred in implementation of genuine, proven public policy objectives that the Republic has championed for many years\".211\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6348.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6351.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6352.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6354.\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to argue that it \"recovered Agroflora as part of its overarching plan to ensure sovereign control over the domestic production of food\".212 This purpose is clearly stated in all the recovery notices, which refer to the *\"[d]esarollo [r]ural [i]ntegrar213* The Respondent rejects the Claimant's allegation that food security would have equally, if not better, been achieved, if it had continued to run Agroflora. In any event, to Venezuela, \"it is not for Vestey to judge how the Republic should best achieve its public policy objectives\".214 Moreover, notes the Respondent, Vestey has not shown that the recovery of Agroflora was driven by other political motives.\n\nRCM, \u00b6143.\n\nRecovery notices, 1 November 2011, Exh. R-61.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6359.\n\nii. *Due process*\n-----------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument that Article 5 of the BIT provides for due process. For it, Article 5(1) of the BIT only envisages a right to have the measure reviewed.215 In line with this right, Venezuelan law established a mechanism of administrative and judicial review of recovery decisions. The Claimant made use of this mechanism by challenging the recovery notices and the interim measures before the Superior Agrarian Court. The Respondent further rejects the Claimant\u2019s contention that the Expropriation Law should have applied to the recovery process. According to Venezuela, the recovery was rightly conducted under the Land Law, which sets out a special legal regime for the recovery of agricultural land.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6369.\n\n238.\n\nThe Respondent submits that a breach of domestic procedures does not necessarily constitute a violation of due process. Accordingly, it is irrelevant that the Claimant asserts that \"the INTI provisional measures did not establish the exact time during which they could take effect and did not expressly state that they protect the right of permanent residents of squatters216 Similarly, the Claimant's allegation that the provisional measures did not refer to the legal basis for the recovery of the non-land assets is a matter of domestic law and has no bearing on the due process requirement under the Treaty. In the same vein, the Claimant's allegation that it received no formal notice of the interim measures lacks relevance for purposes of the Treaty application.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6374.\n\n239.\n\nFurthermore, according to Venezuela, it is disingenuous for the Claimant to argue that Venezuela's alleged failure to notify the final recovery decisions prevented a timely appeal. It also rejects Vestey\u2019s allegation that its appeal from the order for interim measures has never been decided and submits a decision of the Supreme Court dated 13 August 2013 by which such court dismissed the appeal.217\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6322; Exh. R-115.\n\n240.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent maintains that Vestey has failed to demonstrate that the recovery of the Farms violated the due process requirement under the BIT.\n\niii. *Compensation*\n-------------------\n\n241.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s submission that the non-payment of compensation does not make the expropriation unlawful *perse.* Indeed, when the terms of the compensation are disputed, the duty to pay does not arise since it is yet to be determined what specific compensation is due.218\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6330.\n\n242.\n\nMoreover, the requirement that compensation be prompt does not imply that it be immediate, but merely calls for payment as soon as possible.219 Even accepting the period of three to six months suggested by the Claimant, this requirement would not be breached here. Indeed, only about two months elapsed from the beginning of the recovery until the initiation of this arbitration. The time since the start of the arbitration cannot be taken into account, as it precisely serves to set the amount of the compensation.220\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6331.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6332.\n\n243.\n\nIn any event, the Republic offered compensation to Vestey both before and after the recovery. Minister Loyo offered to purchase Agroflora for 273 million bolivars.221 This amount, so says the Respondent, was convertible into US dollars in Venezuela through a legally established method of conversion. In particular, the Claimant could have sought the conversion of the purchase price through CADIVI. In such a case, it would have obtained USD 63.5 million at the rate of 1 US dollar for 4.3 bolivars.\n\nDraft sale and purchase agreement, 25 November 2010, Exh. C-291.\n\n244.\n\nContrary to the Claimant's allegation, this compensation offer, which the Claimant first accepted and then later refused, qualifies as compensation offer under the Treaty.222 The offer was also more than adequate, as it was higher than the market value ascribed to Agroflora by Econ One, the Respondent's damage expert in these proceedings whose valuation amounts to USD 45.8 million. This offer was made in local currency in good faith and Venezuela agreed in Clause 3 of the draft 2010 agreement223 that it would assist in expediting the conversion process with CADIVI.224 The fact that the offers were made in bolivars does not make them inadequate as it was the Claimant's refusal to pursue negotiations that prevented further discussions on currency.225 In the Respondent\u2019s view, Vestey was acting unreasonably when it turned down this offer.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6338.\n\n*Id.,* Clause 3.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6341.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6345.\n\n245.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that it repeated its compensation offer after the recovery. As Minister Loyo's testified, he personally called Ms. dos Santos to offer a payment during the second week of November 2011.226 Vestey can thus not blame Venezuela now for not having received compensation.227\n\nLoyo WS1, \u00b6\u00b630-31; Loyo WS2, \u00b6\u00b670-71; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6261,344.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6346.\n\niv. *Discrimination*\n--------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent observes that the Parties concur on the definition of discriminatory conduct as it was established in *Saluka,* i.e. a claim for discrimination would be made out where (a) similar cases (b) are treated differently (c) without reasonable justification. On this basis, it submits that the fact that it may have paid a purchase price or expropriation compensation in foreign currency to other foreign investors is irrelevant for four reasons.\n\n247.\n\nFirst, the duty of non-discrimination does not extend to compensation. Rather, as Article 5 of the BIT makes clear, it applies only to the taking itself. Second, the payments made in other cases where there was an agreement on the amount are of no relevance, since unlike there Vestey and Venezuela failed to reach an agreement on the amount due. Third, none of the enterprises compensated in foreign currency operated in the farming industry. Only one of them, namely the supermarket chain Cativen, was in the food business. In any event, the government compensated Cativen because, contrary to Vestey, it pursued the negotiations with the government. Fourth, unlawful discrimination implies an intent, which is lacking here because the Republic's actions did not consider the nationality of the persons involved. Venezuela recovered food businesses held by foreigners and Venezuelans alike.228\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6363-366.\n\n248.\n\nTherefore, Venezuela\u2019s recovery of Agroflora was in conformity with all the requirements of Article 5 of the BIT.229\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6367.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n249.\n\nThe relevant part of Article 5(1) of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n*\"Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of the Party, on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. \"*\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal will start by determining whether there has been an expropriation. In the affirmative, it will then examine whether the expropriation was lawful. In this context, it notes that the Parties do not dispute that the criteria for the legality of the expropriation enshrined in Article 5(1) of the BIT are cumulative.\n\ni. *Act of expropriation*\n-------------------------\n\n251.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that Venezuela took over the control of Agroflora\u2019s administration and assets. The Respondent contends, however, that Vestey did not own the land of its Farms and that, therefore, it simply recovered public land for which it owes no compensation.230\n\nR-PHB1, \u00a7 IV.A.I.a.\n\n252.\n\nTo determine whether Venezuela\u2019s taking of Agroflora\u2019s land constitutes an expropriation, the Tribunal must assess whether Vestey held a title to the land. The Parties agree that Venezuelan law governs ownership of the land. They disagree, however, on whether the Land Law, being one of the contested measures, must be taken into account when reviewing ownership.\n\n253.\n\nAs was described above, the present dispute arose when Venezuela introduced certain measures under the Land Law, starting with the adoption of the 2001 Land Law itself and culminating in the recovery proceedings in 2011.231 The Land Law is the very measure that Vestey is challenging before this Tribunal as one of the expropriatory acts which deprived it of its investment.232 The Parties are in agreement that an investor's ownership over the allegedly affected assets must be assessed immediately before the adoption of the challenged measures.233 Accordingly, the Tribunal will review the validity of Vestey\u2019s title just before the introduction of the Land Law, *i.e.* as of 13 November 2001.\n\nThe alleged events before the enactment of the 2001 Land Law, *i.e.,* the squatters' invasions at Hato El Charcote no longer form the basis of the claims, The Claimant\u2019s Reply to Venezuela\u2019s Request for Bifurcation, 15 March 2013,\u00b69. Therefore, the 2001 Land Law is chronologically the first measure giving rise to the claims.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b635, 36.\n\nR-Opening, slide 64.\n\n254.\n\nUsing a later date would render the protection granted in Article 5 of the BIT illusory. If one were to set the date of assessment of the investor\u2019s ownership any later than the date of the first contested measure, a state could adopt a law making it impossible for a private owner to prove ownership and thereby circumvent the Treaty guarantee. This cannot be the meaning of the Treaty.234 Therefore, the Tribunal will not consider the provisions of the Land Law in assessing Vestey\u2019s ownership over the allegedly expropriated land.\n\nThis would also go against the cornerstone rule of international law, according to which \"the characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful [...] is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.\" Article 3, ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Exh. CLA-19.\n\n255.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, in light of the Republic\u2019s previous recognition of Vestey\u2019s title in particular through the 2006 Agreement and the productivity certificates, the Respondent is estopped from challenging Vestey\u2019s land ownership. For the event that Venezuela is not so estopped, Vestey claims that its ownership is proven by the existence of a registered title. The Respondent, on the other hand, submits that the Claimant must establish the historic chain of valid title transfers to the land and that it failed to do so. The Parties further diverge on whether Vestey acquired title by acquisitive prescription. Each of these matters will be dealt with in turn.\n\n*a) Estoppel and recognition of title through productivity certificates and other governmental acts*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nIn support of Its argument of estoppel, the Claimant first submits that, pursuant to Article 8.2 of the 2006 Agreement, the government recognized its title when issuing the productivity certificates to Agroflora. It also invokes the fact that the government did not challenge its peaceful possession of the land for decades.\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by these arguments. The requirements for acquiring property rights over immovable assets situated in Venezuela are governed by specific norms of Venezuelan property law. For a private person to have a claim under international law arising from the deprivation of its property, it must hold that property in accordance with applicable rules of domestic law. The principle of estoppel cannot create otherwise inexistent property rights. This is so if one grounds the principle of estoppel on international law.\n\n258.\n\nIt is equally so if one seeks to find a basis for estoppel in domestic law. Indeed, Venezuelan law leaves no room for the acquisition of property by estoppel. Specifically, Article 796 of the Civil Code provides that property rights can be acquired by the following means:\n\n*\"Property and other rights can be acquired and transferred by virtue of the law, by succession, and by contract. They can be also acquired through prescription. \"235*\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"La propiedad y dem\u00e1s derechos se adquieren y transmiten por la Ley, por sucesi\u00f3n, por efecto de los contratos. Pueden tambi\u00e9n adquirirse por medio de la prescripci\u00f3n.\" Article 796, Civil Code of Venezuela, Exh. C-366.\n\n259.\n\nThese means do not include estoppel. One of them, acquisitive prescription, could be compared to estoppel in the sense that it implies that acquiescence to peaceful possession can create property rights. The creation of property rights through acquisitive prescription is, however, subject to stringent legal conditions.\n\n260.\n\nPutting aside the estoppel argument which cannot succeed here, the Tribunal notes that the governmental acts on which Vestey relies are incapable of creating or transferring property rights under Article 796 of the Civil Code. In particular, the 2006 Agreement did not contemplate selling or otherwise transferring the property over the land. Nor could the productivity certificates issued pursuant to the 2006 Agreement accomplish that end. A productivity certificate, which is only valid for two years, merely certifies the productivity of the land.236\n\nArticles 44, 48, Land Law, Exh. C-29.\n\n261.\n\nFinally, Venezuela\u2019s lack of challenge of Vestey\u2019s possession could only create rights if the conditions for acquisitive prescription were fulfilled, a question that the Tribunal will review later in this analysis.\n\n*b) Registered title*\n---------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the value of a registered title under Venezuelan law. For the Claimant, a registered title evidences sufficient ownership title unless it is invalidated by a final decision of the competent Venezuelan court. By contrast, the Respondent argues that a registered title shows \"just title\" *(\"justo titulo\").*\n\n263.\n\nArticle 27 of the Law on Public Registries provides that the entries into public registries qualify as public documents:\n\n*\"Registry entries and information contained and officially issued from the registrar system shall have all legal effects pertaining to public documents. \"237*\n\nClaimant\u2019s translation, in Spanish: \"Los asientos e informaciones reg\u00edstrales contenidos y emanados oficialmente del sistema registral, surtir\u00e1n todos los efectos jur\u00eddicos que corresponden a los documentos p\u00fablicos\", Article 27, Law on Public Registries, Exh. C-253.I.\n\n264.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the registry extracts presented by the Claimant have been issued by the Public Registry. Hence, they constitute public documents within the meaning of the Law on Public Registries.\n\n265.\n\nPursuant to Article 1359 of the Civil Code, a public document is presumed valid. Such provision reads in pertinent part as follows:\n\n*\"A public instrument carries faith, both as between the parties and as to the third parties, so long as it is not declared false [...]. \"238*\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"El instrumento p\u00fablico hace plena fe, as\u00ed entre las partes como respecto de terceros, mientras no sea declarado falso [...]\", Article 1359, Civil Code of Venezuela, Exh. C-366.\n\n266.\n\nAs Brewer-Carias writes, a public document \"does not only serve the purpose of informing of the occurrence of the registration, [but] it [also] constitutes public faith and, therefore, should be taken as valid unless otherwise proven in court [,..].\"239 The\n\nRespondent accepts that the registration creates a rebuttable presumption, i.e. presumption *iuris tantum,* of validity of the registered act.240\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"el s\u00f3lo registro en s\u00ed mismo no es prueba de que el t\u00edtulo registrado es \"v\u00e1lido\", el mismo hace fe p\u00fablica y por tanto, se debe tener como v\u00e1lido, salvo que se demuestre lo contrario, en juicio\", Allan R. Brewer-Car\u00edas, \"La Figura del \u2018Rescate\u2019 Administrativo de Tierras Agr\u00edcolas de Propiedad Privada Regulada en la Reforma de Ley de Tierras y Desarrollo Agr\u00edcola de 2010, Su Inconstitucionalidad, y el Tema de la Acreditaci\u00f3n de la Titularidad de la Propiedad Privada Sobre Tierras Rurales\", January 2014, Exh. C-372, p.4.\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation, in Spanish: \"la titularidad registral solo crea una presunci\u00f3n legal iuris tantum\", Transcript, Spanish, Day 1,239:17-19.\n\n267.\n\nHowever, as the Respondent asserts, it is not the act of the registration which gives rise to the transfer of property. Indeed, Article 796 of the Civil Code, which contains an exhaustive list of the modes of transfer or creation of a property right, does not list registration as an independent method of acquisition of property rights. By contrast, that provision does list contracts as self-standing means of transferring property.241 Venezuela acknowledged this in the following terms:\n\n*\"In the moment when there is a consent about - the asset sold and the price, the property is transferred automatically. \"242*\n\nArticle 796, Civil Code of Venezuela, Exh. C-366.\n\nTranscript, Spanish, Day 1, 240:18-22, 241:1-4. And in Spanish: \"En el momento en que hay consentimiento sobre lo -- el bien que se est\u00e1 vendiendo y el precio, la propiedad se transmite autom\u00e1ticamente.\"\n\n268.\n\nAccordingly, although registration is not an independent mode of acquisition of property, it is not disputed that it creates a presumption that the act underlying the registration is valid. In the present case, that underlying act is the contract for the transfer of property. Such contract does constitute an independent mode of acquisition of a property right, a matter that is uncontroversial. Unless it is invalidated through the means established by law, the registration obliges any third party, including this Tribunal, to presume that the property right has been validly transferred by operation of the registered property transfer agreement.\n\n269.\n\nThat conclusion is in line with the overarching legislative objective of legal certainty in property transactions. Or in the words of the Venezuelan legislators:\n\n*\"The mission of the registry is to guarantee the legal certainty of the registered acts and rights vis a vis third persons, through the publicity of the registry.\"243*\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"La misi\u00f3n de los registros es garantizar la seguridad jur\u00eddica de los actos y de los derechos inscritos, con respect a terceros, mediante la publicidad registral\", Article 25, Law on Public Registries, Exh. C-253.I.\n\n270.\n\nIf the registered title were to account solely for the good faith intention of the acquirer of the property it would not produce any legal consequences for third parties and registry entries would not need to be public. These entries are public precisely because they create the presumption of validity of a registered legal act *vis a vis* the entire public. Therefore, any third person can and must presume that legal acts entered into the Public Registry are valid.\n\n271.\n\nThe Public Registry may of course contain invalid or inaccurate data. The fact of registration does not validate an otherwise invalid legal act; it merely creates a rebuttable presumption that the act is valid.244 That presumption can only be overcome by a final judicial decision. Article 43 of the Law on Public Registries sets forth the method of impeaching the validity of a registered legal act in the following terms:\n\n*\"[R]egistry entries where a void or voidable legal act is recorded may only be annulled pursuant to a final judgment not subject to appeal. \"245*\n\n*Id.,* Article 43: \"La inscripci\u00f3n no convalida los actos o negocios jur\u00eddicos inscritos que sean nulos o anulables conforme a la ley.\"\n\nClaimant\u2019s translation, in Spanish: \"los asientos reg\u00edstrales en que consten esos actos o negocios jur\u00eddicos solamente podr\u00e1n ser anulados por sentencia definitivamente firme\", *Id.*\n\n272.\n\nConsequently, the validity of a registered act is not self-judging. Third persons, such as the government or this Tribunal, cannot judge for themselves whether a registered legal act is valid or not. They must presume the validity of the act until and unless the contrary is established by the competent Venezuelan court. In the absence of a judicial decision to the contrary, the Tribunal will thus consider that the registered property transfer agreements presented by Vestey validly transferred the property rights over the land plots.\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent further objects that the areas indicated in the registered titles do not coincide with the areas claimed by Vestey. The Claimant answers that the discrepancies are due to the fact that the old registered titles did not employ modern measurement techniques.\n\n274.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, these discrepancies do not *perse* affect the validity or existence of the registered titles. Venezuelan law does not provide for such a consequence. If the Respondent deemed the registered titles invalid as a result of these errors, it could have initiated the judicial action provided in Article 43 of the Law on Public Registries. Yet, it is undisputed that the government never started any legal proceedings to invalidate Vestey\u2019s registered title.\n\n275.\n\nThe outcome could have been different if the registry extracts made referen claimed by Vestey. The divergences merely involve the precise surfaces of the land registered in Agroflora\u2019s name. The actual surface at issue may be relevant for valuation purposes, but it has no bearing on the existence or validity of a registered title. On this basis, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Agroflora validly acquired title over the land applies to the surface areas stated in the registry extracts.ce to land plots different from those claimed by the Claimant. However, in this instance, the physical defining features and names of the registered plots coincide with those\u00a0claimed by Vestey. The divergences merely involve the precise surfaces of the land registered in Agroflora\u2019s name. The actual surface at issue may be relevant for valuation purposes, but it has no bearing on the existence or validity of a registered title. On this basis, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Agroflora validly acquired title over the land applies to the surface areas stated in the registry extracts.\n\n*c) Acquisitive prescription*\n-----------------------------\n\n276.\n\nIn any event, even if the registrations were not deemed to confer valid title, Vestey would hold such title on the ground of acquisitive prescription.\n\n277.\n\nIndeed, where the property transfer agreement is invalid (for instance, because, the seller did not own the asset), ownership may be acquired through prescription, which is an independent mode of acquisition of a property right. As Article 796 of the Civil Code stipulates, \"[t]he property and other rights can be acquired [...] through prescription.\"246 Article 1952 of the Civil Code further clarifies that \"prescription is a mode of acquisition of a right [,..].\"247\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"La propiedad y dem\u00e1s derechos se adquieren y transmiten [...] por medio de la prescripci\u00f3n.\" Article 796, Civil Code of Venezuela, Exh. C-366.\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"La prescripci\u00f3n es un medio de adquirir un derecho [...].\" *Id.,* Article 1952.\n\n278.\n\nArticle 1979 of the Civil Code provides a specific rule for the acquisition of property rights through prescription:\n\n*\"One who acquires an immovable good or a property right over an immovable good in good faith through a duly registered title not invalid for a defect in form, acquires the ownership or the property right within ten years from the date of the registration of the title.\"248*\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"Quien adquiere de buena fe un inmueble o un derecho real sobre un inmueble, en virtud de un t\u00edtulo debidamente registrado y que no sea nulo por defecto de forma, prescribe la propiedad o el derecho real por diez a\u00f1os, a contar de la fecha del registro del t\u00edtulo\", *Id.,* Article 1979.\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute that Vestey acted in good faith when it acquired registered title over the land. Nor does it challenge the formal validity of the registration. It arises from the record that Vestey completed the registration in respect of its last acquisition of contested land in 1988, namely more than ten years before the present dispute arose. The requirements for an acquisitive prescription provided in Article 1979 of the Civil Code are thus met.\n\n280.\n\nThe Respondent opposes that the prescriptive acquisition of a property right requires a declaration from the Venezuelan courts. In support, it relies on Article 690 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which stipulates as follows:\n\n*\"For claiming the declaration of the property through acquisitive prescription or the declaration of any other right susceptible of acquisitive prescription, the interested person must present a formal demand before a First Instance Civil Judge of the location of the real estate, which will substantiate and resolve in accordance with rules set forth in this Chapter. \"249*\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"Cuando se pretenda la declaraci\u00f3n de propiedad por prescripci\u00f3n adquisitiva seg\u00fan la ley, o la declaraci\u00f3n de cualquier otro derecho real susceptible de prescripci\u00f3n adquisitiva, el interesado presentara demanda en forma ante el Juez de Primera Instancia en lo Civil del lugar de situaci\u00f3n del inmueble, la cual se sustanciara y resolver\u00e1 con arreglo a lo dispuesto en el presente Cap\u00edtulo.\" Article 690, Code of Civil Procedure, Exh. R-91, emphasis added.\n\n281.\n\nThe wording of this provision is straightforward. It sets forth a procedural framework for a *declaration* of acquisitive prescription and not for the acquisitive prescription itself. Nothing in this article suggests that the declaration is a prerequisite for the acquisition of a property right through prescription. Article 796 of the Civil Code is clear in that \"[t]he property and other rights can be acquired [...] through prescription\". It does not require a declaration of prescription. The property right is acquired once the substantive requirements for this particular mode of acquisition are satisfied, as they are set forth in Article 1979 of the Civil Code.\n\n282.\n\nArticle 691 of the Code of Civil Procedure confirms that a judicial declaration is not a condition for the acquisition of rights by prescription:\n\n*\"The request [for the declaration of acquisitive prescription] shall be presented against all those persons who appear in the respective Registry Office as owners or holders of the title over any property right over the real estate. The request shall be accompanied with a certificate from the Registry in which the name, surname and domicile of such persons will be indicated, and with a certified copy of the respective title.\"250*\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; in Spanish: \"La demanda [de la declaraci\u00f3n de prescripci\u00f3n adquisitiva] deber\u00e1 proponerse contra todas aquellas personas que aparezcan en la respectiva Oficina de Registro como propietarias o titulares de cualquier derecho real sobre el inmueble. Con la demanda deber\u00e1 presentarse una certificaci\u00f3n del Registrador en la cual conste el nombre, apellido y domicilio de tales personas, y copia certificada del titulo respectivo.\" Article 691, Code of Civil Procedure, Exh. C-367.\n\n283.\n\nIf a judicial declaration under Article 691 of the Code of Civil Procedure were a prerequisite of acquisitive prescription, Article 1979 of the Civil Code would be rendered inutile, since the registered owner would never be able to initiate declaratory proceedings against oneself. The only understanding that reconciles these two provisions is that one acquires a property right once it meets the substantive requirements prescribed in Article 1979, while the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure provide a legal process to formally declare that acquisition has validly occurred.\n\n284.\n\nVenezuela also argues that Vestey is estopped from invoking acquisition by prescription as it did not raise this defense at the time of the recovery proceedings.251 In fact, Vestey relied on acquisitive prescription seeking to annul INTI\u2019s resolution effecting the recovery of El Charcote in judicial proceedings in 2005. The court dismissed the argument as procedurally inapposite.252 In any event, the Tribunal can discern no requirement in the applicable legal framework according to which the beneficiary of an acquisitive prescription must invoke the prescription before any court or authority or otherwise inform third parties. Therefore, even if Vestey had never invoked the acquisitive prescription it would not change the legal position, i.e. that it had acquired ownership in accordance with Article 1979 of the Civil Code.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b689, 90.\n\nDecision of the Superior Agrarian Court, 28 September 2005, Exh. C-114, p.19.\n\n*d) Chain of title*\n-------------------\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established that Vestey held title to the land at the time of the impugned measures. Venezuela\u2019s takeover of Agroflora and its land constitutes an expropriation. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will nevertheless address the Respondent\u2019s central argument about the chain of title.\n\n286.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, in order to demonstrate the sufficient ownership title over land, one must prove that the person from whom the land was acquired held him -or herself sufficient title. Accordingly, for Venezuela, proof of ownership involves establishing the validity of all the title transfers from the first release of the property into the private ownership. This requirement hinges on the principle that no one can transfer more rights than he or she holds - *nemo plus iuris transferre potest quam ipse habet.* The Respondent particularly relies on the 1936 Vacant Land Law to assert that the purported private owner of the land bears the burden to prove ownership by demonstrating the chain of title.253 The Claimant disagrees, arguing that the 1936 Vacant Land Law does not require private owners to establish their title by proving the chain of title. It submits that there was no legal basis for the chain of title requirement in Venezuelan law until it was introduced by the challenged Land Law.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on the 2010 Land Law. However, as it has been established above, the relevant date for assessing the ownership is the date when the first complained measure gave rise to the dispute. The 2010 Land Law itself constitutes one of the challenged measures. Therefore, it will not be taken into account when examining Vestey\u2019s title over the land.\n\n287.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the principle that no one can convey more rights than he or she holds implies that a defect in the chain of title affects all subsequent transactions. Most domestic property laws balance this principle against the interest of a good faith buyer and legal certainty in property transactions. Instead of imposing the burden of proving the chain of title, those laws offer more easily ascertainable ways of establishing ownership. These include in particular the presumption of validity of registered titles254, acquisitive prescription,255 and the protection notion of the *bona fide* purchaser.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Section 58, English Land Registration Act 2002.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Article 2265, Civil Code of France.\n\n288.\n\nUnder Venezuelan property law, the presumption of validity of registered titles, as well as the institution of acquisitive prescription allow owners to establish their ownership without investigating the chain of title. The Venezuelan legislators have also made sure that a private person will only be burdened to prove its ownership title in a limited number of cases. The Parties are in agreement that the general rule on distribution of burden of proof under Venezuelan law requires that a person who brings an action against the purported private owner disprove the ownership.256 This allocation can only be reversed in exceptional circumstances. In particular, in a case invoked by the Respondent, the Supreme Court of Venezuela noted that \"the regular principle on the allocation of the burden of proof does not apply to the vindication of the vacant land\" by the government in accordance with the 1936 Vacant Land Law.257 According to the court, the reversal of the burden of proof in favor of the state derives from Article 1 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law:\n\n*\"[l]t suffices that the State attempt to vindicate the particular land because it considers it vacant, for the respondent [i.e. the private owner] to bear the burden of proving ownership over the claimed land [.. ]\"258*\n\n*Contraciones Morphe,* Decision of the Supreme Court of Venezuela, Exh. RLA-21, p. 9.\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; *Id.,* p. 7.\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; *Id.,* emphasis added.\n\n289.\n\nNowhere did the court hold that there is a general reversal of the burden of proof in favor of the state in all types of ownership disputes between a private person and the state. Rather, according to the court, the burden will be reversed if the state *\"attempts to vindicate\"* allegedly vacant land. The rules on the vindication of vacant land are prescribed by Article 10 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law, which provides as follows:\n\n*\"In case the vacant land appear to be unlawfully occupied as a private property, the Federal Executive shall arrange to initiate the civil action before the competent courts, in conformity with the present Law. \"259*\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; Article 10, 1936 Vacant Land Law, Exh. R-3.\n\n290.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the government of Venezuela has never initiated a vindication action against Vestey seeking a declaration that the Farms were vacant pursuant to Article 10 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law. Consequently, the reversal of the burden of proof provided by Article 1 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law and invoked by the Respondent does not apply by its own terms. Hence, even if the 1936 Vacant Land Law were deemed to oblige Vestey to show the chain of title, *quod non,* that obligation was never been triggered by the government.260\n\nThe additional case law invoked by the Respondent further supports such interpretation of the burden of proving the chain of title. In particular, the 1997 decision of the Superior Agrarian Court established that a person bringing the vindictive action bears the burden of proving the chain of title. Exh. RLA-95, p. 6.\n\n291.\n\nFurthermore, Article 11 of the 1936 Vacant Land Law provides for limitations to civil vindication actions instituted by the state under Article 10. Article 11 bars the state from initiating such action altogether \"when there is evidence that, if invoked, the defense of acquisitive prescription will be successful\".261 Article 11 further authorizes the private person whose ownership is challenged to invoke acquisitive prescription as a defense during the vindication action under Article 10. Hence, even if the government had started a vindication action, Article 11 would have allowed Vestey to prove its ownership by claiming acquisitive prescription as a defense without the need to show chain of title.\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; Article 11, 1936 Vacant Land Law, Exh. R-3.\n\n292.\n\nOn the basis of this analysis, it is clear that Respondent has never placed Vestey in a procedural setting in which Venezuelan law would have required to show the chain of title. In conclusion, by the time of the measures, Vestey had acquired the full ownership title over the contested land. Therefore, the government\u2019s takeover of control over Agroflora\u2019s property and administration constitutes an expropriation within the meaning of Article 5 of the BIT.\n\nii. *Public purpose*\n--------------------\n\n293.\n\nArticle 5 of the BIT requires that an expropriation be \"for a public purpose related to the internal needs of the Party\". The Respondent accepts that \"[p]ursuant to Article 5 the [state's] actions must be for a declared public purpose\".262 In other words, there must be a public purpose and the measure must be aimed at achieving that purpose.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6351.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal must thus first assess whether there existed a public purpose. It concurs with the Respondent that for purposes of this assessment states deserve broad deference.263 In the words of the*LIAMCO* tribunal, the state is \"free to judge for itself what it considers useful or necessary for the public good\".264 International tribunals should thus accept the policies determined by the state for the common good, except in situations of blatant misuse of the power to set public policies.\n\n*loannis Kardassoupoulos and Ron Fuchs v. Georgia,* ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15, Award, 3 March 2010, Exh. CLA-68,\u00b6391.\n\n*Libyan Am. Oil Co. (LIAMCO) v. Libyan Arab Republic,* 20 LL.M. 1, Award, 1977, Exh. RLA-15, p. 58.\n\n295.\n\nHere, the Respondent submits that its purpose was \"to ensure the availability and timely access to food by its citizens, as part of its national plan to ensure food self-sufficiency\".265 It also submits that \"the widespread access to agricultural and livestock resources [...] make[s] up one of the main drivers of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\u2019s food strategy to provide resources to its population\".266 The Tribunal defers to this policy determination. In any event, that policy appears perfectly legitimate and worth of protection and there is no suggestion in the record that it was not.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6108.\n\nR-PHB1,\u00b6110.\n\n296.\n\nThis finding, however, does not end the inquiry. The Tribunal must also assess whether the impugned expropriatory measure was \"for\" the public purpose as Article 5(1) of the BIT requires. In doing so, it must consider all the relevant circumstances, including the government\u2019s post-expropriation conduct.267 While the objective is not to review the effectiveness of the measures, the government\u2019s failure to advance a declared purpose may serve as evidence that the measure was not taken in furtherance of such purpose. Thus, the idea is to determine whether the measure had a reasonable nexus with the declared public purpose or in other words, was at least capable of furthering that purpose.\n\n*ADC v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, Exh. CLA-37, \u00b6433.\n\n297.\n\nWhile it argues that the purpose of Agroflora\u2019s take over was to secure the population\u2019s access to food, the Respondent has accepted on multiple occasions that Agroflora was a very productive enterprise.268 It is also undisputed that the entire beef output of Agroflora was sold on the domestic market at the regulated price. During the hearing, the Respondent\u2019s expert testified that the Venezuelan government imports cattle from abroad at higher prices than the domestic ones and then uses a budgetary subsidy to domestically resell the imported cattle at the lower domestic price.269 In such circumstances, a productive private farming enterprise selling the entirety of its beef output on the domestic market at regulated prices contributes to the implementation of the state\u2019s access to food policy. It in fact shares the burden of meeting the alimentary needs of the population. It is difficult to see how the purpose of wider access to food would be better served by expropriating such private enterprise. Nothing in the record suggests that Agroflora\u2019s output increased after the expropriation, or that the population gained wider or cheaper access to the beef produced by Agroflora. To the contrary, there are unrebutted statements of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses that the government\u2019s management of Agroflora resulted in a decline of the production levels.270\n\nCertificates of Productivity, Exh. C-253.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 5, 165:12-25.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 3, pp. 5, 19.\n\n298.\n\nAnother justification advanced by Venezuela for the takeover of Agroflora was the need to guarantee wider public access to Vestey\u2019s genetically superior cattle. The fact shows, however, that Vestey regularly sold its purebred cattle and semen of high genetic quality to local producers.271 There is no evidence that after the expropriation the government increased the purebred cattle sales or decreased its sales price. To the contrary, the record suggests that under the government\u2019s control Agroflora sold purebred cattle at higher than regulated prices.272 In any event, if the government indeed aimed at wider public access to Agroflora\u2019s purebred cattle, measures lighter than expropriation were available. The government could for instance have adopted a regulation obliging Agroflora to increase the sales of purebred cattle or semen and/or to lower the prices.\n\nSmith WS, \u00b6\u00b67, 12; Sales of semen and purebred cattle, Exh. C-149.\n\nAuthorization issued by the *ad hoc* board, Exh. C-322.\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent also argued that its aim to facilitate public access to food warranted the redistribution to the people of the large uncultivated land plots in private hands *(latifundios).* This justification can hardly apply here, where the government clearly acknowledged that Agroflora was a productive enterprise. At the hearing, the Respondent\u2019s expert testified that there was no \"higher and better\" use for Agroflora\u2019s land than that practiced by Agroflora.273 In any event, there is no evidence that the government distributed the ownership to the land to private persons or had any plans to this effect.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 5, 111:6-8.\n\n300.\n\nOn this basis, the least that the Tribunal can say is that the nexus between Venezuela\u2019s declared purpose to achieve wider public access to food and the expropriation of Agroflora is not obvious. That being so, the Tribunal can dispense with a definitive ruling on this requirement in light of the conclusion reached in the following section.\n\niii. *Due process*\n------------------\n\n301.\n\nIt is a common ground between the Parties that Article 5(1) of the BIT guarantees an opportunity for an investor \"to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority, of his or its case\".274 That guarantee also applies to an independent review of the \"valuation of his or its investment\".\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6368, 369.\n\n302.\n\nThe Parties are also in agreement that Venezuela did not regard its measures as expropriation within the meaning of Venezuelan law. It took control of Agroflora under the legal regime of *rescate* provided in the Land Law.275 Indeed, when Vestey appealed the interim measures issued against Agroflora under the Land Law, the Supreme Court denied the application of the guarantees enshrined in the Expropriation Law, because this was not the relevant framework:\n\n*\"[W]e are not within the framework of an expropriation proceeding, but rather in the implementation of measures intended to ensure agro-food security and sovereignty of the Venezuelan people.\"276*\n\nTranscript, Spanish, Day 3, 936:13-15.\n\nRespondent\u2019s translation, Decision of the Supreme Court, 13 August 2013, Exh. R-115.\n\n303.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Expropriation Law provides detailed procedural guarantees. It requires that compensation for expropriation be determined by a commission of three experts, and requires the state to initiate a judicial action to expropriate an asset.277 This legal regime differs drastically from that of the Land Law. The *rescate* proceedings under the Land Law are based on the premise that the land is state property and, therefore, the state owes no compensation to the persons from whom the land is recovered. It goes even further by denying the right to compensation for any improvements found on the recovered land:\n\n*\"The persons illegally occupying the public land, which is susceptible of recovery, cannot claim any indemnity for any improvement or fruits present at the occupied land.\"278*\n\nArticles 22, 28-30, 32-35, Expropriation Law, Exh. C-235.\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation; Article 90, Land Law, Exh. C-29.\n\n304.\n\nIn 2002, the Constitutional Court of Venezuela struck down this latter provision as unconstitutional.279 However, in 2005, the Parliament reintroduced the same provision in Article 86 of the Land Law.280Similarly, the Land Law contains no rules for the compensation for the movable property, such as cattle or vehicles, seized with the recovered land.\n\nDecision of the Constitutional Court, Exh. C-31.\n\n2005 Land Law, Exh. C-41.\n\n305.\n\nBy introducing and applying the Land Law to Vestey\u2019s investment and thereby derogating from the procedural guarantees of the Expropriation Law, Venezuela deprived Vestey not only of the opportunity to have the valuation of its investment reviewed by an independent authority, but of the right to be compensated altogether. The regime provided by the Land Law fails to satisfy the due process requirements of the BIT.\n\n306.\n\nFurthermore, Venezuela failed to comply procedural regime of the Land Law itself, as rudimentary as it is. Namely, Article 93 of the Land Law provides that the *rescate* proceedings are concluded by INTI\u2019s final recovery decision. Article 94 of the same law stipulates that such final recovery decision must be notified to the occupant of the land and the latter then has 60 days to appeal that decision.281\n\n*Id.,* Articles 93, 94.\n\n307.\n\nINTI issued the final recovery decisions for the Farms on 19 December 2011.282 Venezuela filed these decisions as Exhibit R-66 to its Counter-Memorial, on 12 August 2013, over a year after the decisions were handed down. The Claimant complained that it then learned of these decisions for the first time.283 The Respondent neither alleges nor provides for that the decisions were conveyed to the Claimant earlier. The Tribunal thus concludes that Venezuela failed to communicate the final recovery decisions to Vestey as required by Article 94 of the Land Law, thereby depriving Vestey of the opportunity to appeal the decisions before a judicial authority.284 This conduct breached the guarantee of a prompt review by an independent authority enshrined in Article 5(1) of the BIT.\n\nExh. R-66.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6237.\n\nIt only managed to appeal the interim measures and the initial recovery notices.\n\n308.\n\nMoreover, Vestey also learned of the outcome of its appeal from the interim measures through this arbitration. The Respondent filed the Supreme Court decision as Exhibit R-115 to its Rejoinder of 13 October 2014. There is no allegation or evidence of an earlier communication of the decision dated from 13 August 2013. This procedural omission further infringed on Vestey\u2019s treaty right of independent review.\n\n309.\n\nIt flows from the foregoing discussion that the limited procedural guarantees existing under the *rescate* regime of the Land Law were insufficient to comply with the Treaty\u2019s due process requirement and that Venezuela\u2019s repeated failures to notify Vestey of its decisions breached even the limited procedural guarantees available under the Land Law. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot but find that Venezuela\u2019s expropriation of Vestey\u2019s investment was not in accordance with the procedural guarantees of Article 5(1) of the BIT. This determination suffices to conclude that the expropriation is unlawful. The Tribunal could thus dispense with the analysis of the remaining criteria of a lawful expropriation under Article 5(1) of the BIT, *i.e.* discrimination and compensation. Because of the particular facts of the case involving sales negotiations first and recovery proceedings later, which the Parties have extensively briefed, the Tribunal will nevertheless briefly address compensation.\n\niv. *Compensation*\n------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute that it paid no compensation to Vestey, but insists that it offered to do so. Whether compensation was offered would be relevant if the Tribunal were to assess the lawfulness of the expropriation. However, the Tribunal has already found that the expropriation was unlawful because it failed to comply with at least one other cumulative requirement of legality. This finding could end the inquiry under Article 5 of the BIT. However, as stated above, the Tribunal will nevertheless briefly discuss the requirement of compensation for the sake of completeness.\n\n311.\n\nThe Respondent submits that its offer for a purchase price during the sale and purchase negotiations of Agroflora must be considered as a compensation offer for expropriation purposes. In particular, it refers to the term sheet signed by Mr. Edelmann on 5 March 2010285 and to the draft sale and purchase agreement of 25 November 2010.286\n\nExh. C-152.\n\nExh. C-291.\n\n312.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that an offer to pay a price to buy a company can be assimilated to an offer to compensate for the expropriation. Article 5(1) of the BIT requires the expropriation to be *\"against*prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\" The sales negotiations took place over one year prior to the *rescate.* One can hardly see how a price offer made in that context could relate to compensation for the expropriation. The fact that the sales negotiations failed, for whatever reason, did not release Venezuela from its obligation under Article 5(1) of the BIT to provide compensation for expropriation.\n\n313.\n\nNotably, throughout the sales negotiations, the government offered to pay a purchase price, without ever making reference to an expropriation. The present facts differ from the circumstances of *Mobil* and*ConocoPhilips* which the Respondent invokes. In *Mobil,* there was evidence of \"discussions [that] took place in 2007 between the Parties on the compensation that was due to the Claimants *on the account of the expropriation.\"287* The representative of Mobil Oil Cerro Negro himself testified during the proceedings that the claimant \"had several meetings with the Ministry of Energy regarding compensation for*government\u2019s taking* of [their] interests in [...] joint ventures.\"288 Similarly, the term sheets proposed by the government in *ConocoPhillips* \"clearly showed that Venezuela intended to take the existing interests of ConocoPhillips in those Projects [,..].\"289 In contrast, here PDVSA Agr\u00edcola and later the MOA expressed an interest to purchase Vestey\u2019s shares in Agroflora. The offers relied upon by the Respondent make no reference whatsoever to expropriation or recovery.\n\n*Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, BV, Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd, Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Holdings, Inc, Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd, and Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award, 9 October 2014, Exhibit CLA-124, \u00b6302, emphasis added.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6304, emphasis added.\n\n*ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV, et al v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, 3 September 2013, Exhibit CLA-122,\u00b6382.\n\n314.\n\nVenezuela also alleges that it repeated its offer of payment in bolivars after the recovery of Agroflora, a fact which Vestey denies. Minister Loyo maintained in his witness statement that he called Ms. dos Santos to offer an indemnity and that she rejected it.290 During the hearing, Minister Loyo clarified that he made that offer personally by telephone.291 Other than these conflicting statements on the very fact of this offer, there is nothing in the record confirming that an offer was actually made and, if so, upon what terms.\n\nLoyo WS2,\u00b671:   \n\"Posteriormente, llam\u00e9 a la Sra. Dos Santos para manifestarle que la Ley de Tierras nos obligaba a indemnizar a Agroflora y que est\u00e1bamos en disponibilidad financiera para ello. La Sra. Dos Santos rechaz\u00f3 mi oferta indicando que a Vestey no le interesaba recibir pago alguno en Bol\u00edvares.\"   \nThe Respondent points to Vestey\u2019s board minutes referring to \"the continuous pressure to accept Bolivars\" (Exh. C-319). However, this is likely to refer to the offers made in the context of the sales negotiations and not to the alleged telephone conversation. The Respondent further points to George Vestey\u2019s testifying that Minister Loyo had offered Bolivars afterthe expropriation (R-PHB2,\u00b6115, citing Transcript, Spanish, Day 2, 509:8-18). From the transcript passage cited by the Respondent, it is clear that Mr. Vestey was answering a question about the sales negotiations *in November 2010* (Transcript, Spanish, Day 2, 508:17-510:2). In the original language, both the question and the answer started with the words \"In November 2010\" (Transcript, English, Day 2, 116:1 ; 116:4).\n\nTranscript, Spanish, Day 3, 1030:11-17:\n\n315.\n\nWhat is more, the events that followed tend to belie the thesis that the state offered compensation for the expropriated assets. Indeed, after the takeover of Agroflora on 13 November 2011, Ms. dos Santos wrote to Minister Loyo soliciting a meeting.292 Minister Loyo admits that he left this communication unanswered.293 Shortly thereafter, Jesper Edelmann traveled to Venezuela and also requested to meet with the Minister, again in vain. If Venezuela was really prepared to pay compensation, one would have expected it to entertain these requests and meet with Vestey\u2019s representatives to advise them of the terms upon which payment could be effected. In circumstances where Venezuela refused to meet the representatives of Vestey and failed to answer their written communications, a mere reference to a telephone offer without any corroboration appears insufficient to establish that the expropriation was carried out \"against prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" as required by Article 5(1) of the BIT.\n\nEmail of 13 November 2011, from Ms. Dos Santos email to Minister Loyo, Exh. C-196.\n\nTranscript, Spanish, Day 3, 1000:5-15\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Venezuela failed to provide compensation for the expropriation of Vestey\u2019s assets.\n\n**2. Violations of Article 2**\n------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent has also breached Article 2 of the BIT, which provides protection against unfair, inequitable, arbitrary and discriminatory measures, and requires ensuring the full protection and security of investments. The Respondent argues that the Claimant's claims under Article 2 of the BIT are subsumed in the claim for unlawful expropriation as, once compensation is determined for the taking, \"there can be, virtually by definition, no loss or damage left to be compensated separately based on a breach of other, lesser standards\".294 In any event, the Respondent denies the claim that it has violated Article 2 of the BIT.\n\n\"PRESIDENTE KAUFMANN-KOHLER: \u00bfEs usted que hizo la oferta o... SE\u00d1OR LOYO:  \nS\u00ed, como no, hicimos el ofrecimiento.   \nPRESIDENTE KAUFMANN-KOHLER: \u00bfUsted personalmente?   \nSE\u00d1OR LOYO: Personalmente, exactamente.\"\n\nRCM, \u00b6161.\n\n318.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimant stated that, if the Tribunal \"ma[de] a finding of unlawful expropriation, with the natural damages consequences\", it would not need to consider the claims for breaches of Article 2 of the BIT.295 On the basis of this statement and of the principle of procedural economy296 and having held that Venezuela is liable for the unlawful expropriation of Vestey\u2019s investment, the Tribunal will dispense with ruling on the claims for breach of Article 2 of the BIT.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 1.94:7-11.\n\nSee e.g. Standard Chartered Bank v. The United Republic of Tanzania, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12, Award, 2 November 2012, \u00b6272.\n\n**D.** Quantum\n--------------\n\n319.\n\nThe Parties disagree on many issues related to quantum. They primarily diverge on the applicable standard of compensation (1); causation (2); the method of valuation (3); the determination of the fair market value of the expropriated assets (4); and interest (5). The Tribunal will address each of these matters in turn.\n\n**1. Standard of Compensation**\n-------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nVestey seeks reparation for the harm caused by the unlawful expropriation. As restitution is not available, reparation must take the form of compensation, which will \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\".297 Opposing the Respondent's argument that the BIT standard of compensation prevails over the customary rule of full reparation, Vestey explains that Article 5 of the BIT merely sets the standard of compensation for a lawful expropriation. As the expropriation was unlawful, that standard does not apply.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6229-231, quoting *Chorz\u00f3w.*\n\n321.\n\nThe customary standard of full reparation provides for compensation of the fair market value (\"FMV\") of the expropriated asset, together with commercially reasonable interest.298 Vestey agrees with the Respondent that the value of the expropriated asset must be established as of the date of the announcement of the recovery of Agroflora, *i.e.* 29 October 2011 (the \"Valuation Date\"). It adds that discounts for transaction costs or liquidity of the assets are incompatible with the principle of full reparation.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6207, citing among others *CMS, Azurix,* and *Enron.*\n\n**b. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nThe Respondent notes that it addresses quantum only ex *abundanti cautela* and that none of its arguments should be construed as an acceptance of the obligation to pay damages.299\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6463.\n\n323.\n\nThis said, the Respondent argues that \"the customary international law standard of full compensation is preempted by Article 5 of the Treaty as *lex specialis\"*,300 Pursuant to Article 5 of the BIT, the amount of compensation \"is limited to [...] the fair market value of Agroflora\".301 Venezuela observes that the BIT does not limit its compensation standard to lawful expropriations. It argues that, therefore, the standard of compensation set forth by Article 5 of the BIT applies to both lawful and unlawful expropriations.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6472.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6469.\n\n324.\n\nEven if the standard of full reparation were applicable, the damages would not exceed the FMV of Agroflora.302 According to the Respondent, the Claimant did not demonstrate that it suffered a loss exceeding such value.303 Venezuelan law, so says the Respondent, only knows one compensation standard, which refers to the \"fair price of the expropriated investment\".304 Any award of damages should thus be confined to the FMV of Agroflora on the Valuation Date.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6474.\n\nRCM, \u00b6208.\n\nRCM, \u00b6210, footnote 371.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Parties agree on the Valuation Date, an agreement that the Tribunal will implement. They disagree, however, on the standard of compensation and on the implication of the latter on the methodology for quantifying the value of the expropriated assets.\n\n326.\n\nBy unlawfully expropriating Vestey\u2019s Investment, Venezuela has breached Its obligation under the Treaty. The Parties do not dispute that that breach is attributable to Venezuela. Thus, Venezuela has committed an internationally wrongful act as defined by Article 2 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,305 which entails the international responsibility of the state, and gives rise to an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the illicit act.306 The Tribunal notes here that, while the ILC Articles govern a State responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis another State and not a private person, it is generally accepted that the key provisions of the ILC, such as Article 31(1) can be transposed in the context of the investor-State disputes.\n\nPursuant to Article 2 ILC of the Articles on State Responsibility, \"[t]here is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law; and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State\" (Exh. CLA-19).\n\nArticles 1.31(1), ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Exh. CLA-19.\n\n327.\n\nStates are free to derogate from this general framework of responsibility.307 This said, the Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent when it submits that the rules on compensation set in Article 5 of the BIT constitute such a derogation. The relevant part of Article 5 of the BIT prohibits expropriation in the following terms:\n\n*\"Investments [...] shall notbe[...] expropriated [...] except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of the Party, on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\n\nArticle 55 of the ILC Articles, which reads as follows: \"These articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law\" (Exh. CLA-19).\n\n328.\n\nThe provision goes on to set out the parameters of compensation:\n\n*\u2019\u2019Such compensation shall amount to the genuine value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier. Such compensation, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. \"*\n\n329.\n\nIn these terms, Article 5 of the BIT does not purport to establish a special regime of reparation for expropriations which are unlawful due to reasons other than the absence of compensation. In *Chorz\u00f3w,* the PCI J applied the standard of full reparation after noting that the wrongful act of Poland did not consist \"merely in not having paid to the Companies the just price of what was expropriated.\"308 Similarly, Venezuela\u2019s expropriation of Vestey\u2019s investment was not illegal only because no compensation was paid. Venezuela also failed to grant due process as required by Article 5(1) of the BIT.\n\n*Factory of Chorz\u00f3w, Germany v. Polish Republic,* PCIJ Series A, No. 17, Judgment on Merits, 13 September 1928, Exh. CLA-2, p. 47.\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal is also unconvinced by the Respondent\u2019s reliance on its domestic law to argue that the relevant standard of compensation for expropriation is the \"fair price\" of the expropriated asset.309 By unlawfully expropriating Vestey\u2019s investment, Venezuela breached its obligations under international law and the consequences of that breach are exclusively governed by international law.\n\nRCM, \u00b6210.\n\n331.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Venezuela must provide full reparation under customary international law. The Tribunal will thus review the application of the standard of full reparation to the facts of this case. It notes at the outset that Vestey claims monetary damages and that Venezuela does not oppose this form of reparation.\n\n332.\n\nBefore closing this discussion of the standard of compensation, the Tribunal must address the Respondent\u2019s alternative argument, according to which \"once the Republic compensates the Claimant for the fair market value of the entire Agroflora business, the Republic will need to be given the title to [the non-land] assets in return\", since \"the interim measures did not affect Agroflora\u2019s ownership of its assets (other than the land it allegedly owned)\".310\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6322.\n\n333.\n\nIf this argument is characterized as a counterclaim, it must be deemed inadmissible under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, that provision requires that a counterclaim be \"within the scope of the consent of the parties and [...] otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\" The scope of the consent to arbitrate is provided in Article 8 of the BIT. It is limited to \"[d]isputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former....\" The Respondent\u2019s request to be awarded title over Agroflora\u2019s assets does not concern an obligation of Venezuela under the BIT and thus falls outside the scope of the consent to arbitrate. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this is a matter to be dealt with by the local courts in application of municipal property law.\n\n334.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s argument would not be successful either if it were not deemed a counterclaim but rather a defense against the claim for compensation. Article 5 of the\n\nBIT prohibits expropriations and measures tantamount to expropriations which do not meet the legality requirements without distinguishing between direct or indirect expropriation. In other words, Article 5 does not distinguish depending on whether title of the expropriated assets has passed or not. Hence, even where title to the assets is not formally affected, an unlawful expropriation must be remedied by an award covering the full value of the property taken.\n\n**2. Causation**\n----------------\n\n**a. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Venezuela\u2019s actions deprived Vestey of the entire economic benefit of its investment.311 It submits that in situations such as the present one \"the element of causation is implicit in the initial determination that an expropriation has taken place.\"312 The dismissal of the claims for damages in *Biwater,* which the Respondent invokes, is inapposite under the circumstances of this case. In *Biwater,* the tribunal dismissed the request for damages on the ground that the value of the expropriated investment was nil on the date of the expropriation.313 This is not arguable here, where both Parties agree that Agroflora had a certain value. The Claimant adds that whether Vestey\u2019s accounts showed an accounting loss is irrelevant to the assessment of the economic damages.314\n\nC-PHB1, 1ffl202-204.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, Exh. CLA-52,\u00b6780.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6204.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6206.\n\n**b. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe Respondent raised a new argument at the hearing asserting that there was no causal link between the alleged breaches of international law committed by the Respondent and the damages claimed by the Claimant. It relied on *Biwater* to argue that, in the absence of a showing of damage caused by the unlawful act, there can be no award of damages.315 The consolidated financial statements of Vestey Group Limited do not reflect the losses sought to be recovered in this arbitration. Therefore, for Venezuela, the Claimant has failed to prove that the alleged breaches of the BIT caused a loss.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6341,342.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n337.\n\nIt Is common ground between the Parties that damages are only due if harm was caused by the wrongful act in question. However, the Parties diverge on whether Venezuela\u2019s conduct caused damage to Vestey.\n\n338.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the *Biwater* decision to substantiate its position about the lack of damage sustained by the Claimant. In **Biwater,** however, the tribunal found that \"by 1 June 2005, being the date BGT [the claimant] states its investment was expropriated by the Republic, the said investment was of no economic value.\"316 The tribunal then reviewed the reasons for the depreciation of the investment and came to the conclusion that \"none of the Republic\u2019s violations of the BIT between 13 May 2005 and 1 June 2005 in fact caused the loss and damage in question, or broke the chain of causation that was already in place.\"317 Hence, in **Biwater,** the expropriated asset had lost its entire value at the time of the expropriation for reasons unrelated to the state\u2019s conduct.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6792.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6798.\n\n339.\n\nThe *Biwater* scenario cannot be compared to the facts before this Tribunal. In the present case, there is no dispute that Agroflora had a certain value at the time of the taking and the Respondent does not claim that Vestey lost its investment for causes independent from its conduct.\n\n340.\n\nAs was established in earlier sections of this award, the Claimant held an investment in Venezuela through its 100% share participation in Agroflora and Venezuela unlawfully expropriated the totality of the assets of Agroflora. As a result of this expropriation, Vestey lost the entirety of the value and economic benefit of its investment as well as the ability to manage, sell or otherwise dispose of it. The Tribunal thus has no doubt that causation is established. It is obviously a different matter to determine the amount of the loss that was caused by the expropriation.\n\n341.\n\nBefore the Tribunal turns to the valuation of the loss, it must deal with the Respondent\u2019s objections that Vestey\u2019s financial statements do not reflect the loss claimed in this arbitration. It first notes that these statements are not in the record, which in and of itself disposes of the objection. Moreover, even if they were on record and their content were to confirm Venezuela\u2019s allegations, they could not do away with the existence of the damage. Indeed, the fact that a parent company does not set off the value of Its Investments or provide for a contingent loss in its accounts cannot be conclusive evidence of the existence of a loss of the subsidiary. In this respect, the explanations which Mr. Rosen at the hearing appear plausible. He stated that \"a loss may not even be recorded in a parent company\u2019s accounts in certain circumstances, including where the parent company has a claim under an investment treaty and believes that its investment is recoverable.\"318\n\nTranscript, English, Day 5, 100:9-25.\n\n**3. Method of Valuation**\n--------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nThe Claimant submits that an asset-based valuation is \"[t]he most appropriate valuation methodology to establish the fair market value of a land-intensive farming business such as Agroflora...\"319 Venezuela itself proposed to use this valuation method during the aborted sales negotiations320. The FMV of Agroflora, so says the Claimant, cannot be less than the sum of the FMV of the individual assets, including vehicles, cattle and real estate.321 The Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Flores agreed that \"a willing seller would never agree to sell its business based on a DCF valuation if an asset-based valuation produced a higher price...\"322.\n\nCM, \u00b6235\n\n*Punto de Cuenta,* 17 August 2010, Exh. C-158.\n\nCM, \u00b6237.\n\nCiting Transcript, English, Day 5, 150:8-12; C-PHB1,\u00b6214.\n\n343.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the value of Agroflora's assets is not adequately represented by the cash flow stream that these assets may generate since \"the value of the land is realized only once, with a sale, and not on an annual or other regular basis\" (as captured by a DCF valuation)\".323 Based on the common business practice of \"land banking\", Vestey\u2019s long term business strategy contemplated that it could sell parcels of land at a profit from time to time, as it had done with the Santa Clara and Guataparo Farms, in 1998 and 2007 respectively. Only an asset-based method \"takes into account longer term appreciation in real estate assets which, while not generating cash flow, may be significantly greater on net than operational returns.\".324\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6315.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6216, footnote omitted.\n\n344.\n\nContrary to the arguments of the Respondent's experts, the Claimant argues that there is a market for Agroflora\u2019s cattle in Venezuela since there is a regulated price both for beef and livestock.325 Moreover, Ms. Soriano's rebuttal report well identified comparable transactions on the Venezuelan real estate market, evidencing the existence of the relevant market. In any event, any illiquidity on this market can be explained by Venezuela's measures \"overturning established principles of land ownership\". For Vestey, the Respondent should not be permitted to benefit from its own measures, which is why the valuation is based on a \"counter-factual\" or \"without measure\" scenario. For this, according to the Claimant, the valuations of comparable land plots in neighboring Brazil would be an appropriate benchmark.326\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6324.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6323.\n\n345.\n\nThe Claimant criticizes not only the method employed by the Respondent, but also the accuracy of Venezuela\u2019s proposed valuation. According to the Claimant, Econ One\u2019s DCF valuation is a desktop exercise carried out \"without grounding in the reality of Agroflora\u2019s business expectations\".327 If Econ One had consulted with management, it would have learned that Agroflora intended to increase its cattle sales, as its land reached the carrying capacity in 2011.328 Not having considered this factor, the Econ One projections cannot be accurate. The Tribunal should thus rely on the asset-based valuation produced by the Claimant\u2019s experts.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6271.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6269.\n\n**b. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the DCF method is the most appropriate method for determining the FMV of a going concern like Agroflora. While it agrees that a valuation based on assets is an accepted method, it argues that it \"cannot be used when there is no reliable market information for the assets being appraised\".329 It also contends that there is no market in Venezuela for land plots as large as those of Agroflora. Nor is there any reliable market information for Agroflora's livestock.330\n\nRCM, \u00b6217.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6499.\n\n347.\n\nDr. Flores of Econ One explains that, if the asset-based method produces a higher result than the income-based method, there must be an objective explanation for the difference.331 No such explanation exists in the present case. Vestey made the best possible use of the land. The land plots, being semi-inundated farm land, had no better potential. Therefore, the cash flows they generated must reflect their full value.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 5, 150:8-12.\n\n348.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the authorities cited by the Claimant do not support an asset-based valuation of agricultural businesses.332 In particular, Kantor states that the DCF method must be used for going concerns, while Ripinsky and Williams support an asset-based methodology only when the enterprise to be valued has a low probability of success. Agroflora was a profitable business with a long track record. Thus, it should be valued under the DCF method.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 502, 503.\n\n349.\n\nThe Respondent further opposes the Claimant's reliance on arbitral awards such as *Vivendi II, Waguib Elie, Metalclad, Tecmed, and Wena.* The tribunals in these cases discarded the DCF method only because the enterprise in question lacked a sufficient record of profits, was unprofitable or at an early stage of development.333 None of these factors are relevant in the present case.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6508.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n350.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the income-based and the asset-based methods are both widely accepted in valuation theory. Both methods can be used to set the FMV of an asset and should in principle yield similar results. However, there are circumstances which may render one method more appropriate than the other.\n\n351.\n\nOn the basis of the record and in particular of the expert evidence, the Tribunal arrives at the conclusion that the full value of Vestey\u2019s land is not captured by the cash flows that the business generates. The Claimant has established that it relied on the occasional sale of parcels of land, which appreciated over time in line with a general trend of rising prices for agricultural land. The DCF analysis does not reflect this appreciation, which is captured by an asset-based methodology of comparable sale and purchase transactions.\n\n352.\n\nThe experts on both sides agree that the market practice it to value agricultural farms under an asset-based methodology.334 The Respondent\u2019s expert also testified that market practice is a relevant consideration when choosing a valuation method.335 This appears indeed correct. A valuation is aimed at determining the FMV of an asset, namely the amount at which the asset would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Thus, if the actors in a particular market tend to use a certain method of valuation in their transactions, the FMV will be best determined by that method.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 3, 33:8-19; Transcript, Spanish, Day 4, 1323:8-16.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 5, 139:17-24.\n\n353.\n\nThe record shows that the asset-based valuation method is not only widely used for agricultural farms in general, but that it was also employed specifically in relation to Agroflora. The Respondent\u2019s expert agreed that the*Punto de Cuenta* of 17 August 2010, on which PDVSA Agr\u00edcola relied in the sales negotiations, reflects an asset-based valuation of Agroflora.336 Notably, the government subsequently founded its purchase offer of 273 million bolivars on that asset-based valuation and not on the alternative DCF valuation prepared by Vazquez & Asociados upon the instructions of Vestey.337\n\n*Id.;* Transcript, English, Day 5, 147:1-7.\n\nFinancial projections for Agroflora, July 2009, Exh. C-266.\n\n354.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot follow Venezuela when it contends that there is no market in the country for Agroflora\u2019s real estate and livestock. As will be discussed in detail in the following section, the valuation advanced by the Claimant\u2019s experts identifies sufficient information to arrive at robust results. In particular, the land plots selected by Ms. Soriano are comparable to Agroflora\u2019s land in terms of bio-economic use. To the extent that the bio-economic use is comparable, adjustments can then be made for size, transaction date and other relevant factors. As for the livestock, the existence of regulated prices allows an accurate calculation of the base price of the herd, which can then be adjusted to take account of the uncontested genetic quality of Agroflora\u2019s livestock.\n\n355.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent\u2019s DCF valuation appears flawed. Indeed, Dr. Flores admitted that the cash flows projections did not take into account the actual cattle count.338 As Ms. dos Santos testified, Agroflora\u2019s land would reach its carrying capacity at the end of 2011,339 forcing Agroflora to increase cattle sales. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this would necessarily have an impact on cash flows.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 5, 201:23-25.\n\nDos Santos WS2,\u00b682.\n\n356.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal will value Agroflora adopting an asset-based methodology. The only asset-based valuation on record is the one offered by the Claimant\u2019s expert, on which the Respondent has extensively commented. The Tribunal will thus use this valuation and the Respondent\u2019s comments as the starting point of its assessment.\n\n**4. Fair Market Value**\n------------------------\n\n357.\n\nThe Claimant's experts divided Agroflora's assets into three categories: livestock, real estate, and vehicles. For all three categories, they arrived at an aggregate value of USD 157,363,348.340 The Tribunal will assess the damages following this division.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6367.\n\n**a. Real Estate**\n------------------\n\ni. *The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n358.\n\nTo establish the FMV of Agroflora's real estate, the Claimant relies on the valuation report provided by Josefina Soriano of Best Valuation Activities (\"BVA\"). Ms. Soriano regularly provided valuation services to Agroflora from 1993 to 2011 and her reports were used to prepare Agroflora's audited financial statements.341 BVA\u2019s valuations were also accepted as the basis for the valuation of Hato El Charcote and Hato San Pablo Pae\u00f1o, which were sold and donated to Venezuela in 2006.342\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6346.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6346, Exh. C-248.\n\n359.\n\nTo value Agroflora's land, BVA used comparable land transactions as proxies.343 If there were any improvements on the comparable land plots, BVA deducted the value of such improvements and only retained the value of the undeveloped land. This was done in this manner because the improvements were valued separately from the land value by the replacement cost approach.344 The value of existing equipment necessary for the functioning of the structures, including motor pumps, fuel tanks, electricity generators, but excluding work equipment and tools, were added to the value of the real estate. Finally, BVA also valued Agroflora's administrative offices in Valencia. To this effect, it applied a market-based method and used comparable transactions as proxy.345\n\nBVA ER1, Exh. C-214, p. 20.\n\n*ld.,p.* 28.\n\n*Id.,* pp. 31.32; CM, 11259.\n\n360.\n\nIn response to the criticism of the Respondent's experts, Professor Ortega and Econ One, BVA submitted a rebuttal report, in which it modified the final result of the valuation. Among other matters, BVA's rebuttal report addressed the objections about some technical errors in the initial report and about the lack of comparability of the chosen transactions. The rebuttal report identifies new comparators regarded as relevant for their climatic, agronomic and socioeconomic characteristics. Such report also addresses the objection that the number of comparator transaction was insufficient by extending the time frame back to 2003 and making related inflation adjustments.346 On such basis, BVA then calculated the average price per hectare in the Venezuelan states where the Claimant's land was located, with the following results:\n\n\u2022 State of Apure: average USD 115 per hectare;\n\n\u2022 State of Gu\u00e1rico - average USD 167 per hectare;\n\n\u2022 State of Falcon - Average USD 1,702 per hectare.\n\nBVA ER2, \u00b6\u00b615-20.\n\n361.\n\nThe Claimant is of the view that BVA\u2019s calculations are conservative. Specifically, the price calculated by BVA for Hato La Cueva at USD 167 per hectare is significantly lower than the price of a farm with similar characteristics, Hato El Charcote, which was sold in 2006 at USD 322 per hectare.347 Similarly, in neighboring Brazil, land plots comparable to the ones valued by BVA at an average of USD 115.11 per hectare are valued at USD 471 per hectare.348\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6353.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6355.\n\n362.\n\nIn the aggregate, BVA valued Agroflora's real estate at USD 60.9m.\n\nii. *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nThe Respondent observes at the outset that the Claimant itself conceded that\"... the calculations regarding land valuation (including the calculations between comparable land transactions) in the BVA Report of November 2011 [BVA\u2019s first report] are no longer relied by Vestey in this arbitration\".349\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6512, 517, footnote 765.\n\n364.\n\nAs to the second BVA report, the Respondent contends that the transactions selected by BVA cannot be compared to Agroflora's land, as they apply to much smaller areas than Agroflora's land plots combined.350 In this context, it stresses that Ms. Soriano was not able to submit a single land transaction as large as 50% of the combined size of the Farms.351 Moreover, it disputes the bio-economic comparability of the chosen transactions. To identify such characteristics, BVA relied upon a report prepared by Gabriel Bittara of *Consultor\u00eda Ambiental y Dise\u00f1o Gr\u00e1fico* (\"CADIGRA\") who failed to disclose that he was a former consultant of Agroflora.352 Ms. Soriano admitted at the hearing that she had relied on the CADIGRA report without conducting an independent verification of the bio-economic characteristics of the comparator land plots.353\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6522.\n\nEcon One ER2.1J256; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6537.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6524.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6295.\n\n365.\n\nThe Respondent also challenges BVA's reference to transactions going back to 2003. It notes that BVA itself recognized that the transactions used as comparators should be contemporaneous to the Valuation Date354, but that \"out of 24 comparable transactions used by BVA, only four took place within two years from the valuation date\".355\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6530.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6531.\n\n366.\n\nThe Respondent's experts also dispute the methodology adopted by Ms. Soriano to take account of the differences in size, transaction times and land improvements.356 They observe that the adjustments, which relate to land size, transaction time and payment method, access roads, proximity to nodal points, and improvements, account for 50% of the price. Being the main value determinant, they render the result unreliable.357\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6282-288.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6535.\n\n367.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that its expert Ortega accepted the value of the improvements to the land put forward by Vestey. Instead, Professor Ortega insisted that BVA's first report is invalid in its entirety.358According to him, BVA counted the value of the improvements twice: first, as part of the unit price and, second, by a replacement cost method.359\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6541.\n\nOrtega ER2.1\u00b600.\n\n368.\n\nThe Respondent further challenges the Claimant's reliance on comparators from Brazil. It invokes \"[t]he economic, social and regulatory differences between Pentanal Region (Brazil) and the Estates of Apure, Gu\u00e1rico and Falcon (Venezuela)\" that \"make any attempt to compare their land prices unworkable\".360 Land as immovable property can only be valued in the context of its local market. Furthermore, in the Respondent\u2019s view, Vestey\u2019s reference to the sale price of El Charcote in the 2006 Agreement is ill-placed. By that agreement, Vestey also donated Hato San Pablo Pae\u00f1o and undertook to suspend the ICSID proceedings361, which justified the higher price paid for Hato El Charcote.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6544.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6448.\n\niii. *Analysis*\n---------------\n\n369.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal recalls the differences between the land areas which Vestey claims and those to which its title documents refer. A willing buyer would necessarily have noted these discrepancies and refused to pay for surfaces of land that did not appear in the registered title. Thus, the Tribunal is of the opinion that only the surface area figuring in the title documents is compensable.\n\n370.\n\nIn accordance with Annex 2 to the Claimant\u2019s First PHB, the Tribunal finds that Vestey\u2019s registered titles (column 3) extended to the following areas of the claimed land (column 2), which thus represent the compensable area (column 4):\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Farms | Claimed Area | Documented Area | Compensable Area |\n| Los Cocos | | | | | | | | | 55,843.72 | | 106,602.00 | 55,843.72 | |\n| Morichito | | | | | | | | |\n| Matapalos | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 42,467.02 | 36,913.58 | | 36,913.58 | |\n| Los Viejitos | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| |l\\_a Bendici\u00f3n | Ramera | 27,717.27 | 24,800.00 | | 24,800.00 | |\n|  | | | | | | | | | 111,622.54 | 99,145.72 | | 99,145.72 | |\n| Ca\u00f1af\u00edstolo |  | | | | | | | | |\n| iPunta de Mat | a |\n| Las Palmeras | 39,578.34 | | 46,875.00 | 39,578.34 | |\n| La Cueva | 12,189.18 | 0362 | 0 |\n| El Carmen | 4,644.21 | | 5,106.00 | 4,644.21 | |\n| TOTAL | 294,062.28 | 319,442.30 | 260,925.57 |\n\nThe registered title documents for Hato La Cueva, indicate no area. The figure of 12,189.18 hectares is drawn from INTI\u2019s 2011 recovery decision. However, this decision merely accounts for the area taken over by INTI in actual fact, it does not speak to title. Thus, the Claimant has prepared no registered document evidencing the area of Hato La Cueva, which explains that the Tribunal has not taken the alleged but unproven surface of this Farm into account.\n\n371.\n\nConsequently, out of the claimed area of 294,062.28 hectares, Vestey has demonstrated its legal title in respect of 260,925.57 hectares. The FMV of Vestey\u2019s land should thus be determined on the basis of this latter figure.\n\n372.\n\nHaving determined the surfaces of compensable land involved, the Tribunal must now assess their value. For this purpose, the Claimant relies on the expert report of Ms. Soriano of BVA. The Parties do not dispute that Ms. Soriano appraised Agroflora\u2019s real estate every third year since 1993. Nor is it contested that from 1993 to 2011 her valuations were used as the basis of the book value of the real estate for purposes of Agroflora\u2019s audited financial statements. Moreover, the government considered Ms. Soriano\u2019s valuations of El Charcote and San Pablo Pae\u00f1o to arrive at the value of those Farms when INTI purchased one and accepted the other as a donation in 2006.363\n\n*Bases de Negociaciones Presentadas,* Exh. C-248.\n\n373.\n\nYet, the Respondent questions the independence of Ms. Soriano because she used information supplied by Vestey about the areas of the land plots and because she failed to conduct an independent investigation into the technical or biological characteristics of the comparator land plots reported by CADIGRA.\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Ms. Soriano is not a legal nor an agricultural expert. As a consequence, she could not offer an independent opinion on the validity of Agroflora\u2019s title and on the areas covered by registered documents. Nor could she advance independent conclusions about the biological characteristics of the land. It is not inappropriate for an expert to rely on information supplied by the client if that information relates to matters outside his or her expertise and the reliance is disclosed. Similarly, it is not improper for an expert to use the data obtained from consultants with specific expertise if that use is similarly disclosed.\n\n375.\n\nThe Respondent also complains that Ms. Soriano employed registry data gathered by her assistant. The Tribunal finds this unobjectionable, provided the expert exercised due care in supervising the assistant. It would indeed be unreasonable to require that a valuation expert personally collect all the data necessary for his or her report, such as records from registries located in different regions. In addition, there is no indication in the record that Ms. Soriano failed to exercise due care or that the data collected by her assistant is somehow deficient.364\n\nThe Tribunal notes that when the Respondent\u2019s expert discovered certain inaccuracies in the registry information of the comparator transactions, BVA addressed these concerns in the second expert report.\n\n376.\n\nHaving reviewed the written evidence and having heard her testify at the hearing, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt the expertise and independence of Ms. Soriano. The record shows that she has vast experience in valuing real estate in Venezuela, including in particular Agroflora\u2019s farms, and her methodology appears well conceived. As a result, the Tribunal is satisfied that nothing prevents it from accepting BVA\u2019s evidence.\n\n377.\n\nTo arrive at the FMV of Agroflora\u2019s land, BVA identified 24 comparator land sales based on the similarity of their bio-economic characteristics. The Respondent challenges BVA\u2019s report for using comparators significantly smaller in size and dated as early as 2003. It is undisputed, however, that BVA applied adjustments accounting for the size of the land plots and the time of the transactions. The fact that the comparator land plots were not of the combined size of Agroflora\u2019s eleven farms does not render the comparison unavailing. Nor do the differences in transaction times *per se* vitiate the comparison. As the Respondent\u2019s expert Ortega testified, there is no rigid rule concerning the relevant timing of comparator sales.365 Here, 20 out of the 24 comparator transactions selected by BVA took place within a 5-year range from the Valuation Date. On this basis, the Tribunal accepts that the transactions chosen by BVA constituted a valid basis for a comparison, subject to adequate adjustments for the relevant differences.\n\nTranscript, Spanish, Day 4, 1367:19-1368:3.\n\n378.\n\nAs mentioned above, BVA applied a number of adjustments to the comparator transactions accounting for surface area, access roads, proximity to nodal points, conditions of payment, improvements, and transaction time. Except for the adjustments for improvements, which will be addressed below (11383), the Respondent\u2019s expert essentially repeats his objections about the choice of comparators and the multiplicity of the required adjustments.366 He also criticizes BVA\u2019s choice of the formula of size adjustment recommended by the Costa Rican *\u00d3rgano de Normalizaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica.* According to Professor Ortega, the use of the Costa Rican formula is ill-founded due to the differences in the bio-climatic conditions between Costa Rica and Venezuela. The Tribunal has difficulty seeing the connection between the standard for size adjustments and the differences in bio-climatic conditions. In the absence of further substantiation from Venezuela\u2019s expert, the Tribunal has no reason to question the methodology of BVA\u2019s size adjustments. Since the value of Agroflora\u2019s land is adjusted for size, the application of an additional size discount would be redundant. Indeed, the size adjustments already account for differences in unit prices of smaller plots compared to larger ones.\n\nOrtega 2, \u00b6\u00b678-96.\n\n379.\n\nTo assess the FMV of Agroflora\u2019s land, the Tribunal sought to multiply the unit values calculated by BVA by the surface areas over which Agroflora\u2019s title Is supported by the registered documents, as established above. Yet, this calculation confronted one difficulty: while BVA Identifies different unit prices for each Individual farm, the data on registered areas sometimes combine two or more farms without specifying how much land belong to each farm. To avoid any overcompensation by an Inaccurate allocation of land among farms, the Tribunal multiplied the compensable surface area of the combined land masses (Matapalos and Los Viejitos; Turagua, Canafistolo and Punta de Mata) by the lowest unit value determined by BVA. This difficulty did not arise for Los Cocos and Morlchlto, since the registered documents justify the entirety of the claimed area.\n\n380.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal concludes that the total value of Agroflora\u2019s land amounts to USD 31,155,964, broken down as shown In the following chart:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Farms | Compensable Area | Unit Value Bolivars/Ha | Value Bolivars |\n| Los Cocos | 32,004.97 | 363.14 | 11,622,285.00 |\n| Morichito | 23,838.75 | 378.02 | 9,011,524.00 |\n| Matapalos | 36,913.58 | 672.75367 | 24,833,611.00 |\n| Los Viejitos | 805.06 |\n| La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 9,672,000.00 |\n| Turagua | | | | | | | | 704.63 | | | | | | | |\n| Ca\u00f1afistolo | 99,145.72 | 304.91368 | 30,230,521.00 |\n| Punta de Mata | | | | | | | | 466.91 | | | | | | | |\n| Las Palmeras | 39,578.34 | 369.30 | 14,616,281.00 |\n| La Cueva | 0 | | 717.15 | 0 | |\n| El Carmen | 4,644.21 | 7,317.59 | 33,984,425.00 |\n| **TOTAL** | **260,925.57** | | | | | | | | 133,970,647.00 |\n| **TOTAL in** | **USD (exchange rate 1:4.3/ USD:Bs)369** | USD 31,155,964.00 |\n\nThe distribution of surfaces between Matapalos and Los Viejitos inside the documented total area is unknown. The Tribunal therefore uses the lower unit value for the combined area of the two Farms, *i.e. Q72.75* Bolivars/ha.\n\nThe distribution of surfaces between La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera, Turagua and Ca\u00f1afistolo inside the documented total area is unknown. The Tribunal therefore uses the lower unit value forthe combined area of the three Farms,*i.e.* 304.91 Bolivars/ha.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the only official exchange rate applicable on the Valuation Date is 1:4.3/ USD:Bs.\n\n381.\n\nHaving reached a conclusion on the value of the land, the Tribunal now turns to the other immovable assets. BVA calculated the value of the non-land immovable property by reference to the replacement cost and arrived at the following values:\n\n\u2022 Buildings: USD 6,695,577;\n\n\u2022 Improvements to the land: USD 5,550,949;\n\n\u2022 Formed pastures: USD 6,539,570;\n\n\u2022 Office premises in Valencia - USD 1,360,113.\n\n382.\n\nProfessor Ortega objects that BVA double counted the improvements. According to him, the improvements were directly valued by the replacement cost approach and indirectly valued in the unit price of the land, as the comparator land plots already included certain improvements. However, he does not specifically dispute the calculations made by BVA in reliance on the replacement cost method.\n\n383.\n\nIt is true that improvements were present on certain comparator land plots selected by BVA. However, BVA applied an adjustment in order to arrive at the unit prices. In a section dedicated to \"adjustment for the existence of improvements\", Ms. Soriano explains that \"this valuation of the Farms assumes its lands to be virgin, undeveloped land, [as] any improvements have been valued separately\".370 BVA thus excluded the value of the improvements from the unit prices. Thereafter, it separately valued the improvements found on Vestey\u2019s land and added their value to the overall value of the real estate. Therefore, the method of valuation implies no double counting.\n\nBVA2,\u00b653.\n\n384.\n\nThat being so, the Tribunal is not convinced that the method used by BVA to adjust the value of the buildings and improvements is sufficiently accurate. Professor Ortega points to the fact that Ms. Soriano did not visit the comparator farms to inspect the improvements. Ms. Soriano admits that, in a number of instances, she had no information about the value of the improvements present on the comparator lands. In such cases, \"[t]he value of the improvements [was] estimated by reference to the percentage of the total market value estimated, which pertain to improvements for the Agroflora Farm that is closest to the reference property or best approximates it in terms of characteristics\" (BVA 2, table 6). Thus, BVA assumed that the improvements present on the comparator land plots shared similarities with those found on Agroflora\u2019s land. Such assumptions may have led to substantial underestimation of the share of the improvements in the overall price of the comparable land plots. That in turn would result in accounting for at least a part of the improvements twice: first in the unit prices of the land, and second, when valued separately by the replacement cost approach. In order to avoid such risk of double counting, the Tribunal cannot but dismiss BVA\u2019s separate calculation of the value of the non-land assets. Such dismissal does not concern the value of the office premises in Valencia since they could not have possibly affected the unit prices of Vestey\u2019s agricultural land.\n\n385.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing discussion, the Tribunal considers it established that the value of Agroflora\u2019s real estate on the Valuation Date amounted to **USD 32,516,077.**\n\n**b. Livestock**\n----------------\n\ni. *The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n386.\n\nThe Claimant provides an expert report from Herb McLane of Agriteam Canada, who valued Agroflora's livestock, including cattle, buffalo and equine stock, based on Agroflora's livestock inventory of 30 November 2011. To calculate the base price of a head of cattle, Agriteam used (i) the regulated beef price of 13.67 bolivars/kilo, (ii) multiplied by the average weight of bulls and cull cows sent to slaughter, and (iii) taking into account the so-called \"dressing percentage\", a proportion of meat to the animal's live weight. He thus arrived at a base price for bulls of 3,554 bolivars/head (USD 827/head) and for cull cows of 2,679 bolivars/head (USD 623/head). The Claimant calls these calculations conservative, as they were based on the regulated beef price, the \"street price\" of the beef being around 28% higher.\n\n387.\n\nAfter identifying the base price, Agriteam applied a genetic multiplier factor (GMF) in order to account for the genetic merit and contribution of certain animals into the herd. The GMF varies depending on gender, age and breeding status. The highest GMF of 5 is attributed to breeding bulls, the most valuable animals in the herd.371 In some cases, the GMF is less than 1, \"signaling young livestock which had not yet fulfilled their growth potential and contribution to the herd\".372 According to Agriteam, the GMF gave full account to fertility, stayability and growth rate of the cattle.\n\nCM, \u00b6252.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6334.\n\n388.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the prices calculated by Agriteam are fully supported by comparators, such as government-controlled prices at which Agroflora sold purebred and commercial cattle, prices quoted at local and foreign auctions, as well as prices paid by the government for imported cattle.373 Based on all these factors Agriteam values Agroflora's 114,327 heads of livestock at USD 92,593,308.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6338.\n\n389.\n\nRefuting the Respondent\u2019s argument, the Claimant submits that a size or liquidity discount is incompatible with the principle of full reparation as \"Venezuela took over all of Agroflora\u2019s livestock and other assets in a single day\".374 In any event, even if the size discount were applicable in theory, it is not relevant in this case due to the high demand on cattle existing in Venezuela.375 Agroflora\u2019s livestock did not make up more than 1% of Venezuela\u2019s total national herd.376 Further, in respect of the deductions for marketing costs, the Respondent\u2019s expert himself testified that such costs would not exceed 5% of the sales value.377\n\nC-PHB1,\u00b61264.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6242.a.\n\nEcon One ER1, H14, as referred to by the Claimant.\n\nOrtega ER2, \u00b68; C-PHB2, \u00b6242.d.\n\n390.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the conservative nature of its GMF valuation, the Claimant\u2019s expert, David Makin, CFO of Vestey Farm Advisors, provided an alternative valuation based on productivity metrics. Mr. Makin first calculated the liquidation value of the cattle, buffalo and equine stock, and then the productivity value of the cattle only based on the beef output. This calculation does not take into account the value of the genetic enhancement of the livestock. It thus represents the lowest possible price that Agroflora could have obtained should it have chosen to sell all of its animals on the market at the regulated price. With this calculation, Mr. Makin arrived at a final figure of USD 61.8 million.\n\n391.\n\nIn order to then account for the genetic merit of Agroflora\u2019s herd, Mr. Makin drew up a simulation model over a 10-year period. The model takes account of the potential of Agroflora's herd to wean a higher number of calves with a higher growth rate compared to an average non-Agroflora herd. This model shows that over a 10-year period the Agroflora herd would produce 79% more output than the non-Agroflora herd. Mr. Makin thus concluded that the genetic merit of Agroflora\u2019s herd warranted the application of a 79% premium to the base price. By contrast, Agriteam\u2019s valuation on the basis of the GMF only attributes a 43% premium for genetic merit.\n\n392.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimant submits that Agriteam conservatively valued the FMV of Agroflora's livestock at USD 92,593,308.\n\nii. *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Respondent objects to Agriteam\u2019s unsupported GMF method. Contrary to the Claimant's assertions, the Respondent states that it never accepted the use of the GMF.378 Agriteam fails to explain the basis on which it allocates a monetary value to the GMF.379 The allocation of different values to different traits of Agroflora's cattle is unsupported. Agriteam\u2019s use of data from Canada as a proxy for testing the GMF is \"wholly inappropriate\" given the \"completely different environment and market\" existing in Venezuela.380\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6561.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6554.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6559.\n\n394.\n\nThe Respondent also challenges the Claimant's reliance on the prices of the local auction (Seproceb\u00fa). According to the Respondent, at this auction only about 50 heads of purebred cattle are sold annually. Similarly, Vestey incorrectly refers to the price paid by the government for the importation of cattle from Brazil and Colombia. That reference is ill-placed as the state has initiated public investigations about overpricing these transactions.381 As for the auctions in Colombia and Brazil, they occur on a different market and thus cannot serve as valid comparators.382\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6564.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6565.\n\n395.\n\nIn relation to Mr. Makin\u2019s valuation, the Respondent asserts that the report arbitrarily assumes a linear increase in the weight of the animals throughout their growth. It ignores conditions, such as weather and the animal's own characteristics that influence weight increase. Moreover, Mr. Makin\u2019s assumption that Agroflora's cattle produced a herd 79% over the baseline of other cattle farms in Venezuela is based on 1997-2002 input which is outdated. In any event, the conclusion that a 79% increase in output automatically translates into 79% increase in profit is flawed.383 While comparing Agroflora's cattle with that of other producers, Mr. Makin failed to consider that Agroflora had higher costs than less sophisticated Venezuelan farmers, including laboratory expenses, management costs, genetic costs, as well as labor, investment and operative costs.384\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6573.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6475.\n\n396.\n\nFor the Respondent, Mr. Makin also fails to account for the costs of liquidation that would be incurred had Agroflora decided to dispose of its cattle at once, such as sales fees, transportation, taxes, marketing and labor costs.385 Hence, Mr. Makin\u2019s calculation cannot be used as an alternative valuation of Agroflora's livestock.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6476.\n\n397.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the large size of Agroflora\u2019s herd warrants the application of a liquidity or size discount.386 It also insists that the 34% sales tax applicable in Venezuela must be deducted from the value of the livestock.387 According to Venezuela, the Claimant failed to prove the quantum of the damages by refusing to give a figure for the size discount. This failure prevents the Tribunal from assessing damages and thus from awarding any compensation for the livestock.388\n\nR-PHB1,\u00b6\u00b6320-327.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6322.\n\nR- PHB1,\u00b6327.\n\n398.\n\nFinally, Venezuela invokes an email exchange between Ms. dos Santos and Mr. Edelmann,389 to assert that by 2008 Agroflora valued its cattle at USD 32.4 million, a number which stands in stark contrast with the result reached by Agriteam.390\n\nEmail of 30 May 2008 from Diana dos Santos to Jesper Edelmann, Exh. R-119.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6568.\n\n399.\n\nFor all these reasons, it is the Respondent\u2019s case that the asset-based valuation of Agroflora's livestock should be discarded.\n\niii. *Analysis*\n---------------\n\n400.\n\nTo determine the FMV of Agroflora\u2019s livestock, the Claimant\u2019s expert started by calculating the base price or the \"beef value\" of the herd. Mr. Makin\u2019s valuation of the base price takes into account only one possible use of the livestock that is beef. It does not account for the genetic merit of the herd. The base price of the cattle and buffalo herd was calculated by reference to Agroflora\u2019s uncontested inventory and to the average weight of different categories of animals multiplied by the regulated beef price. Mr. Makin thus arrived at a base price of USD 60,622,750.\n\n401.\n\nThe Respondent disputes Mr. Makin\u2019s base price calculation in several respects. It first contends that the size of Agroflora\u2019s herd imposes a liquidity or size discount. For the Claimant, on the other hand, such a discount is incompatible with the principle of full reparation and with the fact that there has been no liquidation of the herd.\n\n402.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s task is to establish the FMV of Agroflora on the Valuation Date. This is primarily an economic exercise, which involves identifying the price at which the asset would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm\u2019s length transaction where the parties each act knowledgeably, prudently, and without coercion. The fact that Venezuela took over control of Agroflora in a single day does not change the Tribunal\u2019s task.\n\n403.\n\nLet us assume that a willing seller presents to a willing buyer an asset-based valuation of a farming enterprise, in which the value of a herd of more than 100,000 animals is calculated by multiplying the value of a single animal by the total number of animals. Under this assumption, the buyer is likely to insist on a size discount, because the demand for 100,000 animals taken together is lower than the demand for a single cow. A similar consideration guided BVA when it applied a size adjustment to Agroflora\u2019s land. As the Claimant itself underscored, \"[the size adjustment] reflects the fact that smaller properties tend to be more desirable and attract higher prices than larger ones\".391\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6238.\n\n404.\n\nThat being said, the Tribunal\u2019s task is not to value an abstract farming enterprise, but to determine the FMV of Agroflora taking into account the actual circumstances in the Venezuelan market. In this context, it recalls that Agroflora\u2019s livestock represented less than 1% of Venezuela\u2019s national herd and less than 8% of Venezuela\u2019s annual slaughter capacity.392 Moreover, as the Respondent\u2019s expert testified, Venezuela imported cattle from abroad at prices above the regulated price to resell it on the domestic market at the regulated price.393 In other words, it used to bear the difference in price by way of subsidies. In 2011, imports amounted to around 320,000 heads of cattle, i.e. three times Agroflora\u2019s herd. Hence, had Agroflora desired to sell its livestock, the market demand in Venezuela would most likely have been high. The government at least would have been willing to acquire Agroflora\u2019s entire herd to reduce spending higher amounts to purchase cattle from abroad. As a result, the specific market circumstances do not justify the application of a size or liquidity discount.\n\nAgriteam ER1, Table 2.\n\nTranscript, English, Day 5, 165:12-25.\n\n405.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the 34% sales tax should be deducted from the value of the livestock. According to the Respondent, the sales tax is applicable on the sale of goods, such as livestock, but not on the sale of an agricultural enterprise. The Tribunal notes that the asset-based valuation presented by the Claimant is aimed at determining the value of Agroflora as a going concern. Such valuation does not contemplate a sale of the Individual assets of Agroflora. The individual assets are only valued based on the premise that they would be sold to a willing buyer in combination with one another, as part of one enterprise. Therefore, the Tribunal understands that the 34% sales tax would not be payable and thus no adjustment is required.\n\n406.\n\nThird, Professor Ortega further criticizes Mr. Makin\u2019s calculation of the average weight of the different categories of Agroflora\u2019s animals. According to him, Mr. Makin arbitrarily assumed that the weight of the animals would grow linearly between different ages.394 The Tribunal notes that Professor Ortega does not challenge the actual data of animal weights extracted by Mr. Makin from Agroflora\u2019s records. This undisputed data determines the average weights of different categories of animals at birth, as well as at the ages of approximately 8, 18, 36, and 60 months. It also takes into consideration the weight loss of the animals after the age of 7-8 years.\n\nOrtega 2, \u00b6\u00b660, 161.\n\n407.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the weight of the animals at milestone ages of their life is established. What is in dispute is merely the evolution of the weight curve from one milestone to the other. In circumstances where the expert had no opportunity to measure the animals between the milestones and the Respondent\u2019s expert provides no indications on the evolution of the curve, assuming linear weight growth (and weight loss after 7-8 years) appears like a reasonable approximation of the reality that lies within the Tribunal\u2019s discretion in matters of assessment of the quantum.\n\n408.\n\nFor these reasons and for lack of further substantiated objections to Mr. Makin\u2019s calculation of the \"beef value\", the Tribunal is convinced that the base price of Agroflora\u2019s cattle and buffalo, without considering the genetic merit, amounts to USD 60,622,750.\n\n409.\n\nFourth, the Respondent relies on an email message which was sent by Ms. dos Santos to Mr. Edelmann on 30 May 2008. There, Ms. dos Santos estimated the value of Agroflora\u2019s herd at USD 32.4 million. The Tribunal has asked itself whether that estimate could be used as a benchmark for its valuation of the herd. It has essentially answered this question in the negative for various reasons. First, in her own words, Ms. dos Santos was replying with \"a very simplistic calculation based on our assessment of the Country actual situation, our best judgement, and the strategic strength of our cattle herd now [,..]\"395 to a request from Jesper Edelmann for \"some information\", which \"does not have to be very elaborate\". Second, the figure provided by Ms. dos Santos factored in the fact that a part of the Farms was occupied by indigenous squatters, resulting in an increase of cattle theft, further threatening the remaining Farms.396 These problems no longer existed three and half year later on the Valuation Date. Third, it is undisputed that Agroflora\u2019s herd increased in numbers between 2008 and 2011. Without considering those factors, the estimate could not have accurately reflected the actual value of the herd. Fourth, since Ms. dos Santos\u2019s estimate in 2008, Agroflora was subjected to expert valuations several times. For instance, in November 2009, Ernst & Young valued Agroflora\u2019s assets based on a thorough analysis and multiple visits at the Farms. It was on the basis of this expert valuation that PDVSA Agricola offered USD 120 million forthe shares of Agroflora in 2010.397*Genetic multiplier factor or GMF*\n\nEmail of 30 May 2008 from Diana dos Santos to Jesper Edelmann, Exh. R-119, p.1.\n\n*Id.,* p.2.\n\nAn email of 3 March 2010 from Mr. Edelmann to Mr. Ramirez, Exh. C-152.\n\n410.\n\nHaving determined the \"base value\", the Claimant\u2019s expert then valued the genetic merit of Agroflora\u2019s livestock by attributing GMF figures to different categories of the cattle. The GMF figures vary from 0.35 (for commercial calves) to 5.00 (for purebred bulls) multiplied by the average weight of the respective category of animals. The Respondent objects that these GMF figures have no connection with the actual economic and market data.\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties agree on the high genetic quality of Agroflora\u2019s herd.398 The Respondent\u2019s expert also testified that the market is prepared to pay more for a higher quality herd, which certainly makes commercial sense.399\n\nTranscript, Spanish, Day 4, 1368:15-16.\n\nTranscript, Spanish, Day 4, 1349:1-2.\n\n412.\n\nThe question remains, however, how much the market would pay for the genetic merit of Agroflora\u2019s herd? Agriteam represents that in assigning the particular GMF values, it considered factors such as fertility, stayability and growth rate. It does not, however, explain how those factors translate into the particular figures of the GMF. For instance, it has not justified why the market would pay five times the \"beef price\" for breading bulls. A reason could possibly have been that such bulls have a potential to generate five times more income in comparison with ordinary bulls without the same genetic merit. However, Agriteam presented no such economic analysis. Mr. Makin attempted to offer an economic justification of the GMF by a productivity simulation model. The model calculated the value of the increase in productivity of the livestock owing to the genetic merit400, but, as the Respondent\u2019s experts rightly observe, it fails to take into account the increased expenses associated with establishing and maintaining the high genetic quality herd. It is undisputed that Agroflora owned and operated a genetic laboratory and incurred other expenses related to the genetic program as well as the increased security needs. Without accounting for such expenses, Mr. Makin\u2019s simulation model cannot serve as an accurate economic justification for Agriteam\u2019s GMF figures.\n\nMakin, \u00b6\u00b639-47.\n\n413.\n\nThe Claimant further sought to justify its results by pointing to several market benchmarks, including the prices at which cattle was imported by the government as well as the prices of purebred cattle at the auctions in Venezuela and abroad. The Tribunal first notes that the prices paid by the government for imported cattle, as well as those paid at foreign auctions cannot serve as appropriate value indicators, since those transactions do not occur in the Venezuelan market. As for the records of the Seproceb\u00fa auctions, they reflect the sales of individual animals where the potential buyer has an opportunity to review the genetic data of each animal. The prices achieved in such settings may not accurately represent the value of the genetic merit of the different categories of Agroflora\u2019s cattle.401 Moreover, the Seproceb\u00fa data identifies prices only for purebred bulls and cows, which is insufficient to establish the value of the genetic merit of the other categories of Agroflora\u2019s herd.\n\nThe authorization issued by the *ad hoc* board (Exh. C-322) is insufficient for establishing the FMV of the genetic merit for each category of Agroflora\u2019s herd.\n\n414.\n\nFor the reasons just discussed, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not established the value of the genetic merit of Agroflora\u2019s herd in a sufficiently reliable manner. As a consequence, the Tribunal cannot but award compensation at the base price of the livestock. The base price of Agroflora\u2019s cattle and buffalos was held to amount to USD 60,622,750. One must add the value of the equine stock calculated by Agriteam at USD 1,152,126, which is not controversial. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the total value of Agroflora\u2019s livestock amounts to **USD 61,774,876.**\n\n**c. Vehicles**\n---------------\n\ni. *The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the valuation of its vehicles provided by Ingenier\u00eda Automotriz C.A (\"INMA\"). INMA\u2019s calculation is based on the replacement cost of the vehicles. It applies the depreciation factor in order to account for the age of the vehicles.402 Agroflora owned three types of vehicles: general vehicles, tractors, and a light airplane. The Claimant further relies on Agritruck\u2019s valuation letter, which appraised the 43 Ford New Holland tractors owned by Agroflora based on the information received from the Ford New Holland official dealership in Argentina.403 The Claimant explains the references to comparators from Argentina by governmental limitations in Venezuela causing a low turnover of agricultural vehicles. As for the 1979 Cessna 182Q airplane, the Claimant relies on the replacement cost for which it was ensured.404\n\nValuation letter of 21 December 2012 from INMA to Vestey, Exh. C-226; CM, \u00b6261.\n\nValuation letter of 4 January 2013 from Agritruck to Vestey, Exh. C-227; CM, \u00b6263.\n\nAirplane insurance policy, Exh. C-216; CM, \u00b6263.\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimant opposes the Respondent's allegation that the vehicles were subject to heavy use and wear. It submits that the vehicles were kept in good working conditions and that INTI's report confirmed the *\"buenas condiciones\"* of the vehicles.405 The Claimant argues further that its valuation takes account of the age of the vehicles as well as their wear and tear due to the harsh conditions in which they operated406by applying a depreciation factor. Following Venezuela's objection that INMA used a valuation in 2012 and not on the Valuation Date, the Claimant reverted with a valuation as of November 2011. The revised valuation produces a lower result, as inflation pushed prices up between 2011 and 2012.407\n\n*Informe t\u00e9cnico,* 30 June 2010, Exh. C-281; C-Reply, \u00b6359.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6362.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6361.\n\n417.\n\nIn rebuttal to the Respondent's argument that the insurance cost of the airplane is not an appropriate proxy, the Claimant puts forward examples of sales of comparable airplanes in Venezuela.408 It also argues that the airplane website listings relied upon as comparators by Venezuela are invalid, as they list prices in the US and prices of airplanes in the US and Venezuela differ due to Venezuelan import restrictions.409\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6363, Exh. C-350.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6363.\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimant finally counters the Respondent's argument that the price of subsequent repair of the airplane must be deducted from the valuation. According to the Claimant, it kept the airplane in good condition and, \"[i]n fact, the invoice for maintenance filed by Venezuela (dated five months after the takeover of Agroflora) indicates that more than half of the maintenance costs of 137,000 bolivars that Venezuela is now trying to deduct from the value of the airplane had already been paid by Agroflora as a credit into its account in July and November 2011 (when the company was still under the control of Vestey)\".410 Therefore, Vestey claims the full value of the airplane.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6364.\n\n419.\n\nAs a result, the Claimant contends that the FMV of its vehicles as of the Valuation Date amounted to USD 3,854,372.\n\nii. *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, unlike for the livestock and real estate, there is a market in Venezuela for Agroflora\u2019s vehicles, but that the Claimant miscalculated the relevant value.411\n\nRCM, \u00b6260.\n\n421.\n\nAccording to Venezuela, INMA\u2019s first valuation was erroneous because it referred to the period of December 2012/January 2013. Its second valuation is equally misleading, as it values vehicles used in normal conditions. Agroflora's vehicles, however, were used in severe weather conditions, in flooded and muddy areas.412 Similarly, Agritruck\u2019s valuation of Agroflora's tractors is unreliable, as it lists the prices of tractors in perfect condition, when the conditions under which Agroflora's tractors operated were extremely harsh.413\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6583.\n\nRCM, \u00b6265, R-Rejoinder, \u00b6585.\n\n422.\n\nMoreover, Venezuela takes issue with the valuation of the Cessna 182Q airplane. The insurance replacement value, so says the Respondent, does not reflect the FMV. The listings on US websites offer the same plane model at significantly lower prices. Moreover, the airplane underwent overdue repairs in April 2012, the cost of which must in any event be deducted from the valuation.414\n\nRCM, 1J266, R-Rejoinder, \u00b6587.\n\n423.\n\nFor these reasons, the Respondent\u2019s position is that the valuation of Agroflora\u2019s vehicles is unreliable and this amount must thus be disallowed.\n\niii. *Analysis*\n---------------\n\n424.\n\nThe Respondent does not challenge the inventory underlying the valuation of the vehicles or the existence of the relevant market in Venezuela. Its objections to this item of damages focus on two aspects.\n\n425.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that Agroflora\u2019s valuation does not take into account that the vehicles operated in harsh climatic conditions. The Tribunal finds it difficult to accept this submission for a number of reasons. It starts by recalling that INTI's report confirmed that Agroflora\u2019s vehicles were in good condition.415 It also notes that the Claimant\u2019s expert applies a depreciation factor reflecting the age of the vehicles. Further, as the Claimant rightly underlines, tractors are vehicles designed for tough conditions. Finally, it is telling that Venezuela has not sought to substantiate its objection with evidence of the condition of the vehicles, when it was in control of the fleet since late 2011.\n\n*Informe t\u00e9cnico,* 30 June 2010, Exh. C-281.\n\n426.\n\nSecond, the Respondent objects to Vestey\u2019s valuation of the airplane, which is based on the insurance replacement cost of USD 185,023.416 It claims that planes of this type are offered at lower prices in the U.S. It also notes that maintenance costs should be deducted. The Claimant has satisfactorily rebutted the first argument by submitting evidence of prices of comparable airplanes, which confirm the reasonableness of the valuation.417 Vestey has equally established that Agroflora had paid more than half of the future maintenance costs in advance before the expropriation.418 Be this as it may, the maintenance costs were incurred after the expropriation and there is no indication on record that it was due to the usage of the airplane by Vestey before the expropriation. The Tribunal is thus satisfied that the value of the vehicles and the airplane is established in an amount of **USD 3,854,372.**\n\nInsurance policy, Exh. C-216.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s comparators, on the other hand, are located in the US, which is a different market and may not serve as proper benchmarks for the value of Agroflora\u2019s airplane.\n\nSummary of expenses for repair of Cessna 182 Q, 17 April 2012, Exh. EO-27.\n\n**d. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n427.\n\nOn the basis of the reasons discussed in this section, the Tribunal considers that the FMV of the cattle farming business of Agroflora on the Valuation Date, as it has been established in these proceedings, amounted to**USD 98,145,325.**\n\n**5. Interest**\n---------------\n\n**a. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nVestey requests pre-award interest to bring Agroflora's FMV forward to present value419, because \"[t]o the extent the payment is delayed, Vestey loses the opportunity to use the compensation to productive ends [...]\".420\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6299, 300.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6301.\n\n429.\n\nThe Claimant argues in favor of applying the rate of Venezuela's sovereign bonds in US dollars. Such a rate, so says the Claimant, \"will account for the fact that Venezuela has had use of the compensation amount since the date of injury, effectively compelling Vestey to lend it funds without remuneration\".421 It adds that \"[a]n award of interest at a rate lower than the state's borrowing cost would create an incentive for states to 'refinance' fiscal obligations by withholding compensation for internationally wrongful acts\".422 The rate of the sovereign bonds amounts to 11.75%, which is lower than Agroflora's WACC, determined at 13% by Venezuela itself. According to the Claimant, applying the rate of Agroflora\u2019s WACC is another commercially sound alternative.423 The Claimant rejects the Respondent's choice of the US Treasury bond risk-free rate, as being merely meant to achieve the lowest possible result. Alternatively, it claims interest at 6 month LIBOR +2%.424\n\nCM, \u00b6268.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6372.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6374.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6375.\n\n430.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant requests that interest be compounded semi-annually in accordance with standard business practice.425 It opposes the Respondent\u2019s argument that Venezuelan law governs the issue of compound interest. In reliance on *BG,* It submits that \"the *Chorzow* standard 'would not be achieved if the award were to deprive Claimant of compound interest\".426 Compounding will result in the effective rate being 12.10%. Thus, the claim for pre-award interest until the date of the Second PHB, amounts to USD 82,426,582.\n\nCM, \u00b6269, citing *Azurix, Pey Casado, Continental Casualty.*\n\nC-Reply, f310.\n\n431.\n\nIn order not to incentivize Venezuela to postpone the payment of the award, the Claimant also requests post-award interest accruing from the date of the award until payment in full.427 It submits that post-award interest should be computed at the same rate as the pre-award interest and should be also compounded semi-annually.\n\nCM, \u00b6270, citing *CMS, Metalclad, and Occidental.*\n\n**b. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n432.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant is not entitled to pre-award interest, which is not compatible with the BIT standard of compensation. If any, interest should accrue after a 60-day grace period following the award.428 A grace period is necessary to account for the state\u2019s internal payment procedures.429 In the alternative, pre-award interest should accrue from the time when the Republic became aware of the claims, *i.e.* from the Claimant's first memorial which was filed on 15 January 2013.430\n\nRCM, \u00b6284, citing *Liamco, and Lamire.*\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6371.\n\nRCM, \u00b6288, citing *SD Myers, CME, Feldman, and Amco Asia.*\n\n433.\n\nFurther, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant is only entitled to the rate applicable to US Treasury bond, as it faces no lending or investment risk in relation to an investment that it no longer owns.431 Higher interest rates, such as Venezuela's 15 year sovereign bond, WACC or Libor +2%, fail to acknowledge that interest is only meant to compensate the Claimant for not having the use of its money. In particular, the WACC and the Venezuelan sovereign bond rate proposed by the Claimant account for the long term risk of sovereign default. However, the Claimant does not bear these risks.432 Similarly, LIBOR plus 2% is irrelevant as the Claimant has not shown that it needed to borrow money because it did not receive its compensation from the recovery of Agroflora immediately.433\n\nRCM, \u00b6290.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6623.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6628.\n\n434.\n\nMoreover, for Venezuela, the Claimant is not entitled to compound interest. Pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal should apply Venezuelan law as the Parties have not agreed on the law applicable to interest. Venezuelan law does not provide for compound interest, except where the Parties have specifically agreed on it434, which is not the case here. International tribunals do not award compound interest when the law of the respondent state does not provide for it (citing *CME, Autopista).* In addition, an award of compound interest must be justified as part of the damages granted to a claimant. Here, the Claimant has not even attempted to show that it incurred a loss by not being able to earn compound interest.435\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6372.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6296-302.\n\n435.\n\nFor these reasons the Respondent contends that interest, if any, should start running at the end of a 60 day grace period following the final award, interest should be simple; and the rate should be risk-free.436\n\nRCM, \u00b6303.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n436.\n\nVestey claims both pre- and post-award interest. The Respondent objects that no preaward interest is due. It argues in particular that the standard of compensation of the BIT does not warrant an award of pre-award interest.\n\n437.\n\nAs discussed above, Venezuela is under a duty to repair all the consequences of its internationally wrongful act and the BIT standard of compensation does not apply to unlawful expropriation. It is well established in the practice of international tribunals that pre-award interest is necessary to fully compensate the loss caused by an unlawful expropriation.437\n\nE.g., in lieu of many others, *Funnekotter* v. *Zimbabwe,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/6, Award, 22 April 2009, Exh. CLA-61, \u00b6115.\n\n438.\n\nA state\u2019s duty to pay damages arises at the time when the internationally wrongful act causes harm, which is in the present case the Valuation Date. This duty does not arise later, such as on the date of the injured party\u2019s complaint or of the judgment. As a result, interest will start running on the Valuation Date until payment in full.\n\n439.\n\nThe Parties also diverge on the interest rate. The Claimant argues for the rate of Venezuelan 15-year sovereign bonds. The Respondent objects that this rate accounts for a long term risk of sovereign default, which Vestey does not assume.\n\n440.\n\nThe function of reparation is to compensate the victim for its actual losses. It is not to reward it for risks which it does not bear. As the Claimant itself argues, the award should reestablish the situation which would in all probability have existed but for the wrongful measures. As the Parties agree on the Valuation Date, the \"but for\" scenario involves placing Vestey in the position in which it would have been if it had received compensation on that date. In that case, Vestey would have been able to make use of the funds received as compensation. At no point in that scenario would Vestey have borne the risk of Venezuela\u2019s sovereign default. The Claimant argues that \"[a]n award of interest at a rate lower than the state's borrowing cost would create an incentive for states to 'refinance' fiscal obligations by withholding compensation for internationally wrongful acts\".438 However, reparation focuses on making the victim whole; it is not concerned with the possible enrichment of the Respondent. As the *SPP* tribunal stressed, \"the measure of compensation should reflect the claimant's loss rather than the defendant's gain.\"439\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6372.\n\nSPP v. *Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/2, Award, 20 May 1992, Exh. RLA-74,\u00b6247.\n\n441.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimant suggests Agroflora\u2019s weighted average cost of capital or WACC as interest rate. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this is not an appropriate measure for interest here. Indeed, the WACC reflects a variety of risks associated with doing business. After the expropriation, Vestey was no longer doing business in Venezuela and did not assume these risks. In the \"but for\" scenario, it would have received the compensation on time, i.e. on the Valuation Date, and would have incurred no business related risks anymore.\n\n442.\n\nAs another alternative, the Claimant proposes to use a borrowing rate, specifically LIBOR plus 2%. This could indeed be an appropriate rate if the Claimant had to borrow funds because it did not receive the expropriation indemnity on time. In the present circumstances, there is no indication in the record to this effect, with the result that the Tribunal discards this possibility.\n\n443.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the interest rate should reflect the risk that Venezuela may not comply voluntarily with the Tribunal\u2019s award, which the Respondent opposes.\n\n444.\n\nArticle 53(1) of the ICSID Convention creates an international obligation for the respondent state to comply with the award in the following terms:\n\n*\"The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention. \"*\n\n445.\n\nFirst and foremost, the Tribunal does not find it appropriate for it to assume by anticipation that a sovereign state will breach a treaty obligation. Having said this, even if the assumption were made, it would in any event not justify an interest rate incorporating the risk of defaulting on the payment of the award. Indeed, accounting for this risk would mean seeking to repair a (hypothetical) breach of the ICSID Convention when this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to breaches of the BIT.\n\n446.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal will resort to a risk free rate applicable to US currency debt, i.e. the six-month US Treasury bond rate. The practice of international tribunals confirms this conclusion.440 So, for instance, in the words of the *Siemens* tribunal:\n\n*\"[T]he rate of interest to be taken into account is [...] the interest rate the amount of compensation would have earned had it been paid after the expropriation. Since the awarded compensation is in dollars, the Tribunal considers that the average rate of interest applicable to US six month certificates of deposit is an appropriate rate of interest. \"441*\n\nE.g. among others, *LG&E Energy Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/02/1, Award, 25 July 2007, Exh. CLA-43, *(\u2018LG&E v. Argentina\u2019\u2019)* \u00b6102; *BG Group Pic. v. The Republic of Argentina,* UNCITRAL Final Award, 24 December 2007, Exh. CLA-47,\u00b6455.\n\n*Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/02/8, Award, 17 January 2007, Exh. CLA-40, \u00b6396.\n\n447.\n\nThe Parties further diverge on whether interest should be compounded. The Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent when it argues that compound interest is inadmissible as a matter of Venezuelan law. The consequences of internationally wrongful acts are governed by international law. International law requires that Vestey be reinstated in the situation in which it would have been had it received the compensation on the Valuation Date. It would then have been able to deposit the amount and earn interest. It is standard practice that interest on deposits is compounded. Thus, the Tribunal is of the view that, to make Vestey whole, interest must be compounded. Case law confirms this choice.442\n\n*Middle East Cement & Handling Co S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6, Award, 12 April 2002, Exh. CLA-23,\u00b6174; *LG&E v. Argentina,* \u00b6103.\n\n448.\n\nThe Parties agree on the applicability of post-award interest. The Tribunal considers that interest must accrue at the same rate and upon the same terms both before and after the award. This is the consequence of the fact that the Respondent\u2019s obligation to pay damages does not arise on the date of the award but rather at the time when the internationally wrongful act caused harm. For the same reason, there is no legal justification for granting a grace period.\n\n449.\n\nTherefore, interest on the amount awarded shall accrue at the rate applicable to six-month US Treasury bonds, compounded semi-annually, from the Valuation Date until payment in full.\n\n**E. COSTS**\n------------\n\n450.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 8, the Parties submitted their cost submissions on 7 August 2015. Each Party claims that the entirety of the costs of this Arbitration should be borne by the other Party. In this section the Tribunal will summarize the Parties\u2019 respective positions (1 and 2) and discuss the allocation of costs (3).\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nThe Claimant requests the Tribunal to order the Respondent to pay all the costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the legal representation and expert advice, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and the ICSID administrative fees. According to the Claimant, in exercising their discretion in matters of costs allocation under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, tribunals often rely on the \"loser pays\" principle.443 They also look to the procedural conduct of the Parties. The Claimant is of the view that a number of factors militate for an award of costs in its favor.\n\n*PSEG Global Inc. and Konya llgin Elektrik Uretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, Award, 19 January 2007, Exh. CLA-39,\u00b6352; *LG&E v. Argentina,* \u00b6 112; *Victor Pey Casado* v. *Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. 98/2, Award, 8 May 2008, Exh. CLA-51, \u00b6728; *Rumeli Telekom AS v Telsim Mobil v. Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Award, 29 July 2008, Exh. CLA-53,\u00b6819.\n\n452.\n\nFirst, in order to achieve full reparation, the Claimant must be compensated for all the costs that it incurred as a result of the Respondent\u2019s unlawful conduct, including the costs of the arbitration proceedings.444Thus, if the Tribunal decides the substantive issues in favor of the Claimant, the costs must follow such determination.\n\n*Tidewater Investment Sri and Tidewater Caribe, CA v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Award, 13 March 2015, Exh. CLA-138,\u00b6213.\n\n453.\n\nSecond, Venezuela\u2019s procedural conduct in the course of the document production significantly increased the Claimant\u2019s legal and expert costs. In particular, the Republic only disclosed \"a grand total of 28 documents in relation to six of the 40 requests ordered by the Tribunal or agreed to by Venezuela\". Vestey adds that the documents were in any event largely unresponsive or already in its possession. It also stresses that, \"the Respondent refused to disclose the Ernst & Young valuation report, which would have saved substantial efforts in establishing the value of the expropriated assets\". In contrast, Vestey fully cooperated in the document production phase \"eventually producing some 360 documents to Venezuela in the course of that exercise\".445\n\nC-Costs, \u00b620.\n\n454.\n\nThird, Venezuela ambushed Vestey by raising a new untimely and unmeritorious jurisdictional objection on the first day of the hearing. This required additional submissions and two rounds of post hearing briefs, which imposed substantial additional costs.\n\n455.\n\nFourth, in the Rejoinder, Venezuela improperly filed evidence that it had obtained unlawfully when it took over Agroflora. It also improperly produced documents that it should have filed with the Counter-Memorial. Vestey was forced to request the Tribunal to strike the improper evidence. The Tribunal granted Vestey\u2019s request as to the privileged documents and allowed Vestey to produce additional documents in rebuttal. Venezuela nevertheless continued to refer to the documents.446 Vestey further incurred extra costs in connection with the rebuttal evidence.\n\nC-Costs, \u00b622.a, citing a letter from Venezuela to ICSID of 17 July 2015, page 5.\n\n456.\n\nFifth, throughout the hearing, Venezuela relied on the materials not on record. It also introduced 14 new legal authorities without previously notifying Vestey or the Tribunal. This behavior obliged Vestey to raise an objection.447 Thereafter, Venezuela introduced new factual and legal exhibits in its second PHB contrary to the applicable procedural rules. The Tribunal exceptionally admitted those documents and Vestey had again to file additional evidence in rebuttal.\n\nC-Costs, \u00b622.c, d.\n\n457.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimant seeks reimbursement of all the costs incurred in relation to this arbitration in the aggregate amounts of USD 1,920,310.85 and GBP 7,659,105.76, broken down as follows:\n\n(i) USD 675,000, corresponding to the Claimants\u2019 advance on the ICSID fees and expenses;\n\n(ii) GBP 7,285,955.74, corresponding to the fees and disbursements of the Claimant\u2019s international counsel, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP;\n\n(iii) USD 476,470.99, corresponding to the fees and disbursements of the Claimant\u2019s Venezuelan counsel, Travieso Evans Arria Rengel & Paz;\n\n(iv) USD 768,839.86, corresponding to the fees and expenses of the Claimant\u2019s valuation experts, FTI Consulting;\n\n(v) GBP 45,811.72, corresponding to the fees and expenses of the Claimant\u2019s Venezuelan land expert Soriano Cabrera of BVA;\n\n(vi) GBP 275,149.43, corresponding to the fees and expenses of the Claimant\u2019s cattle expert McLane (Agriteam Canada);\n\n(vii) GBP 52,188.87, corresponding to reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the Claimant for the purposes of these arbitral proceedings, including travel costs and related expenses of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses and representatives.\n\n458.\n\nVestey also asks the Tribunal to order Venezuela to pay interest on the amounts just listed at the rate of 11.75% applicable to Venezuela\u2019s 15-year sovereign bonds from the date of the costs submission until the date of payment, compounded semiannually.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nVenezuela requests the Tribunal to award it all the costs of this arbitration including the fees and expenses of the legal representation and expert advice, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees. According to the Respondent, the Tribunal has broad discretion to award costs pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rule 47 provided that its award is based on sound reasoning.448 When making its cost determination, the Tribunal should take account of \"[t]he degree of success of the parties\", any dilatory tactics or misconduct throughout the proceedings, as well as the \"adoption of an excessive, frivolous or unreasonable position\".449 Venezuela relies on the following circumstances to justify its request for costs.\n\nR-Costs, \u00b617.\n\nR-Costs, \u00b623.\n\n460.\n\nFirst, after the suspension of the arbitration as a result of the settlement reached through the 2006 Agreement and in spite of Venezuela\u2019s full compliance with the terms of that agreement, Vestey recommenced the proceedings in 2011 by submitting an entirely new dispute before the Tribunal. The Republic was thus forced to defend itself and incur enormous expenses.450\n\nR-Costs, \u00b6\u00b640-45.\n\n461.\n\nSecond, Vestey has sought on several occasions to deprive the Tribunal of evidence that could have been useful to find the truth. It requested the exclusion of certain valuation documents prepared in the course of Agroflora\u2019s sales negotiations. The Tribunal, however, did not grant such request and only ordered that these documents be redacted.451 The Claimant further attempted to exclude documents obtained by Venezuela when it took over Agroflora, although those documents could have shed light on Agroflora\u2019s sales negotiations and in particular on the issue of convertibility of the offered bolivars.452\n\nLetter of July 17, 2014 from Venezuela to the Tribunal, p. 4; Letter of 26 March 2014 from Vestey to the Tribunal, p. 2; R-Costs, \u00b625.\n\nR-Costs, \u00b6130.\n\n462.\n\nThird, during the hearing, the Claimant objected to Venezuela\u2019s reliance on Vestey\u2019s financial statements even though those statements were submitted by Vestey during the document production phase. Vestey also unsuccessfully sought to exclude new legal authorities introduced by the Republic during the hearing.453\n\nR-Costs, \u00b6132.\n\n463.\n\nFourth, the Claimant mounted another attack to exclude evidence introduced by the Respondent with its second PHB. The Tribunal again denied that request. Vestey also unsuccessfully tried to prevent the Respondent from substantiating its answers to the Tribunal\u2019s questions with relevant evidence.454\n\nR-Costs, \u00b6134.\n\n464.\n\nFifth, on a number of occasions, the Claimant provided false information to the Tribunal. In particular, the Claimant\u2019s expert BVA admitted the existence of factual inaccuracies in its first report and sought to clarify them in the second report. Another example is Vestey\u2019s reliance on land areas that are not corroborated by any document.455\n\nR-Costs, \u00b6137.\n\n465.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to order Vestey to bear all costs of this arbitration as follows:\n\n(i) For the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID administrative fees: USD 525,000.00;456\n\n(ii) Forthe costs of representation and legal assistance: USD 4,989,157.45;\n\n(iii) Forthe cost of the hearing and the expenses incurred for travel, accommodation and supplies: USD 74,152.90.\n\nAt the time of issuance of the Award, Venezuela was in default of the last advance payment of USD 150,000 and had stated that payment was forthcoming.\n\n466.\n\nTherefore, the aggregate costs requested by the Respondent total USD 5,588,310.35.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n467.\n\nBoth Parties seek an award of the entirety of the costs related to this arbitration, including the legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with these proceedings.\n\n468.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s costs amount to USD 1,920,310.85 and GBP 7,659,105.76, which includes USD 675,000 paid by the Claimant as advance of ICSID arbitration costs. The Respondent's costs amount to USD 5,588,310.35, which also includes USD 525,000 advanced to ICSID.\n\n469.\n\nThe Parties have not disputed that the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate the costs of the arbitration, including the Parties\u2019 legal fees and expenses, as it deems appropriate pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n470.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered all of the Parties\u2019 arguments as well as the circumstances of this case. It observes in particular that (i) the Respondent's raised a new preliminary objection at the final hearing; (ii) Contrary to the applicable rules, it introduced new factual exhibits and legal authorities in its second PHB, which the Tribunal exceptionally admitted, (iii) it failed to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s order on document production in respect of Ernst & Young\u2019s report on Agroflora\u2019s valuation, a document that might possibly have simplified the quantification exercise.\n\n471.\n\nIn light of these factors and of an overall assessment of the course and outcome of these proceedings, the Tribunal concludes in its discretion that it is fair for the Respondent to bear the entirety of the ICSID arbitration costs, i.e. the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID\u2019s administrative fees, the amount of which costs will arise from ICSID's final financial statement in this case. Forthe remainder of costs, the Tribunal considers it fair for each Party to bear its own legal fees and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with this arbitration.\n\n**V. OPERATIVE PART**\n---------------------\n\n472.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing facts and legal arguments, the Tribunal makes the following decision:\n\ni. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over this dispute;\n\nii. The Respondent has breached Article 5(1) of the BIT;\n\niii. The Respondent shall pay to the Claimant USD **98,145,325,** together with interest at the rate applicable to six-month US sovereign bonds, compounded semi-annually, from 29 October 2011 until payment in full;\n\niv. The Respondent shall bear the entirety of the ICSID arbitration costs and shall, accordingly, reimburse to the Claimant the latter's payments of the ICSID arbitration costs as established in ICSID's final financial statement of this case;\n\nv.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 12 August 2016, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"**Venezuela**\" or \"**Applicant**\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or \"**Centre**\") an application requesting the annulment of the Award rendered on 15 April 2016 (\"**Award**\") in the case (\"**Original Proceeding**\") between Vestey Group Ltd (\"**Vestey**\" or \"**Respondent**\") and Venezuela. The Application on Annulment (\"**Application**\") was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\") and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Arbitration Rules**\"). Venezuela seeks annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nWith its Application, Venezuela also requested a stay of enforcement of the Award pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nOn 16 August 2016, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Application had been registered on that date and that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID would proceed to appoint an *ad hoc* Committee (\"**Committee**\") pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Parties were also notified that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2), enforcement of the Award had been provisionally stayed.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of 8 November 2016, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 52(2), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that the Committee had been constituted \u2013 composed of Joan E. Donoghue (U.S.) as President, Gavan Griffith (Australian) and Ra\u00ebd M. Fathallah (Canadian/Lebanese) as Members \u2013 and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The Parties were also informed that Ms. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nOn 10 November 2016, a first advance payment was requested from the Applicant pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations 14(3)(d) and (e).\n\n6.\n\nIn order to afford the Parties an opportunity to submit their arguments on the stay of enforcement, on 18 November 2016 the Committee established a procedural calendar of submissions on this issue, including the possibility to present oral arguments at the first session, and informed the Parties that it had decided to extend *pro tem* the provisional stay of enforcement until it had heard both Parties and reached a decision on its continuation.\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 November 2016, the ICSID Secretariat circulated a draft agenda and procedural order approved by the Committee in preparation for the first session and invited the Parties to consult and revert with their joint or separate proposals on the proposed items as well as on any item they might wish to include.\n\n8.\n\nOn 28 November 2016, the Parties submitted their agreements on the draft procedural order, which included an expedited timetable in exchange for which the Respondent had agreed to \"forego its right to challenge the continuation of the provisional stay of enforcement granted by the Secretary-General on 16 August 2016.\"\n\n9.\n\nThe first session was held on 19 December 2016 by telephone conference. The list of participants was as follows:\n\nMembers of the Committee:  \nJoan E. Donoghue, President of the Committee  \nGavan Griffith, Member of the Committee  \nRa\u00ebd M.

The President noted the Committee's concern and indicated that it nonetheless had decided to hold the first session in the expectation that payment would soon be made and in order to maintain the schedule agreed by the Parties. The President also invited the Parties' comments on the potential impact of the advance payment issue on the stay of enforcement. Both Parties confirmed that their agreement remained in place in the expectation that payment would be made shortly. The Respondent reserved its rights concerning the stay of enforcement should a late payment delay the submission of the Applicant's Memorial.\n\n11.\n\nOn 30 December 2016, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 containing the Parties' agreements and the Committee's decisions on procedure, including a schedule of submissions. On the same date, the Secretary-General informed the Parties of the lack of payment and invited either Party to make the requested advance payment within 15 days pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations 14(3)(d) and (e).\n\n12.\n\nOn 23 January 2017, after several confirmations by the Applicant of its commitment to make the requested advance payment as soon as possible and to inform the Committee of any developments in this regard, the Secretary confirmed that the advance payment had not yet been received and, pursuant to the Committee's instructions, invited the Parties to inform the Committee of their respective views on whether the proceeding should be suspended, and the stay of enforcement lifted, as of 31 January 2017.\n\n13.\n\nThe Parties provided their respective views on 27 January 2017. The Respondent submitted that it is the Applicant's sole responsibility to pay the advances requested in the annulment proceeding and that, in light of the Applicant's default, ICSID should move to suspend the proceeding, which the Respondent proposed should take effect on the date of filing of the Applicant's Memorial assuming no payment has been made by that time, at which point the Respondent would reconsider whether to request that the stay of enforcement be lifted. The Applicant reiterated its commitment to pay and submitted that the payment situation did not impact the Parties' agreements, including the agreement not to request that the stay of enforcement be lifted as long as the calendar of submissions was respected, which the Applicant was committed to do. Accordingly, the Applicant requested that the proceeding not be suspended and that no decision be adopted concerning the stay of enforcement.\n\n14.\n\nOn 30 January 2017, the Respondent stated that \"the Applicant's continued non-payment of the advance on costs does indeed affect the Respondent's position regarding the stay,\" given that \"its agreement not to contest the stay was contingent on the proceedings advancing in accordance with the timetable agreed,\" which would be affected by a potential suspension caused by the Applicant's default. It was on that basis that the Respondent had reserved its right to request that the stay of enforcement be lifted if payment was not made by the deadline for the submission of the Applicant's Memorial.\n\n15.\n\nOn 30 January 2017, the Secretary-General moved that the Committee suspend the proceeding for lack of payment pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations 14(3)(d) and (e).\n\n16.\n\nOn 6 February 2017, the Committee suspended the proceeding for lack of payment and lifted the stay of enforcement of the Award. The Committee reasoned that, without prejudice to the Committee's decision on the allocation of costs, the Applicant on annulment bears the sole responsibility for making advance payments for costs. Payment was now eight weeks overdue and the Applicant had not provided any specific indication as to the date when payment should be expected despite repeated requests by the Committee. The Committee considered that it was not appropriate for the Centre to continue to incur costs and for the Committee members to continue to accrue fees under these circumstances. Neither did the Committee consider it appropriate to defer the suspension of the proceedings to the date of submission of the Applicant's Memorial, as suggested by the Respondent. The Committee noted that the proceeding could be quickly resumed and the timetable could be readjusted, possibly maintaining the hearing dates, should payment be received. Regarding the stay of enforcement, the Committee reasoned as follows: \"The Respondent has indicated that it seeks to preserve its right to seek the lifting of the stay of enforcement. However, once these proceedings are suspended, the Committee would not be in a position to act on a request to lift the stay, were such a request to be made. For this reason, the Committee has decided to lift the stay of enforcement, simultaneous with the stay of these proceeding [sic]. The Committee notes that, in the event that the proceeding [sic] are resumed, Rule 54 permits a Party to request a stay of enforcement of the Award.\"\n\n17.\n\nOn 6 April 2017, following confirmation of the advance payment, the proceeding was resumed and the Committee invited the Parties to try to agree on a revised schedule which, if possible, should maintain the hearing dates.\n\n18.\n\nOn 13 April 2017, the Parties submitted their agreement on the revised schedule. In exchange for the Applicant's agreement to the revised timetable, which maintained the hearing dates, the Respondent agreed not to oppose a request to reinstate the stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings, and the Applicant requested that the Committee stay enforcement of the Award pursuant to the terms of the Parties' agreement.\n\n19.\n\nOn 18 April 2017, the Applicant submitted its Memorial on Annulment (\"**Memorial**\").\n\n20.\n\nOn 27 April 2017, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of the Committee's decision to reinstate the stay of enforcement in accordance with ICSID Convention Article 52(5) and Arbitration Rules 54(1) and (4). The Committee indicated that the circumstances in this case, specifically the terms of the Parties' agreement, called for a stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n21.\n\nOn 20 June 2017, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Annulment (\"**Counter-Memorial**\").\n\n22.\n\nOn 12 July 2017, the Applicant was requested to make a second advance payment pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations 14(3)(d) and (e).\n\n23.\n\nOn 25 July 2017, the Applicant submitted its Reply on Annulment (\"**Reply**\").\n\n24.\n\nOn 21 August 2017, the Committee noted that the second advance payment was still outstanding and invited the Applicant to provide information on the steps taken to effect payment as well as a date when payment should be expected. The Committee further noted the proximity of the hearing and the fact that cancellation costs would be incurred if the hearing dates were to be cancelled after confirmation of the hearing services, which costs might exceed the then-current balance in the case account. The Committee stated that it intended to continue to plan for the hearing until 7 working days prior to the hearing and that, if no payment had been received by that date, the hearing dates would be cancelled.\n\n25.\n\nOn 21 August 2017, the Parties were invited to confer and try to reach agreement on the organization of the hearing.\n\n26.\n\nOn 24 August 2017, the Applicant informed the Committee that the payment process was started immediately after the second advance payment request was received. In any event, the Applicant assured the Committee that payment would be made before expiry of the deadline provided by the Committee for cancellation of the hearing dates.\n\n27.\n\nOn 29 August 2017, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on Annulment (\"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n28.\n\nOn 6 September 2017, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that payment was still outstanding and invited either Party to make the requested advance payment within 15 days pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations 14(3)(d) and (e).\n\n29.\n\nOn 6 September 2017, the Parties submitted their agreement on the organization of the hearing. On 8 September 2017, the Committee invited the Parties to agree to certain revisions to the hearing schedule.\n\n30.\n\nOn 15 September 2017, the Respondent reiterated its position that the Applicant is solely responsible for any advance payments requested for the conduct of the annulment proceedings. The Respondent submitted that the \"ongoing default risks substantial prejudice to Vestey, which expressly agreed not to challenge Venezuela's request to stay enforcement of the Award in exchange for an expedited procedural timetable, culminating in the Hearing in October 2017.\" Accordingly, Vestey reserved all its rights, including to request that the stay of enforcement be lifted should Venezuela fail to pay by the deadline provided by the Committee.\n\n31.\n\nOn 22 September 2017, the Applicant informed the Committee that \"the restrictions recently imposed by the United States Government\" on Venezuela had delayed payment, which had to be made to a US account. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the Applicant estimated that confirmation of payment would be made within the next 48 working hours.\n\n32.\n\nOn 29 September 2017, the Committee informed the Parties that ICSID had not received a notification from the World Bank's financial services that the funds corresponding to the second advance payment request had been received. Pursuant to the Committee's communication of 21 August 2017, the Committee informed the Parties that the hearing dates would be cancelled that same day by 5 pm Washington, D.C. time unless by that time ICSID had received a notification of payment from the World Bank's financial services. At 5:37 pm Washington, D.C. time that day, the Committee informed the Parties that, not having received a notification of payment, the hearing dates were accordingly cancelled.\n\n33.\n\nOn 5 October 2017, the Respondent requested that \"in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(d) of ICSID's Administrative and Financial Regulations, the Secretary-General move the Committee to suspend the present annulment proceeding effective immediately\" and that \"in accordance with Rule 54(3) of the Arbitration Rules, the Committee lift the stay of enforcement of the Award effective immediately, in order to avoid further prejudice to Vestey arising out of Venezuela's revocation of the parties' bargain.\"\n\n34.\n\nOn 14 October 2017, the Secretary-General moved that the Committee suspend the proceeding pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations 14(3)(d) and (e). On the same date, the Committee invited the Applicant to provide comments on the requests to suspend the proceeding and lift the stay of enforcement of the Award. On 17 October 2017, the Applicant informed the Committee of its intention to effect payment as soon as possible and stated that it would keep the Secretariat apprised of any developments in this process.\n\n35.\n\nOn 18 October 2017, the Secretary-General informed the Parties of the Committee's decision to suspend the proceeding for lack of payment and to lift the stay enforcement of the Award. Regarding the suspension, the Committee noted that the proceeding could not continue because there were insufficient funds to cover the next step, namely the hearing. Regarding stay of enforcement, the Committee noted as follows:\n\n*The Committee had originally found that the circumstance that required the stay of enforcement of the Award was the Respondent's agreement not to object a request for the stay of enforcement in exchange for an expedited schedule culminating in the October hearing dates. The cancellation of these dates and the suspension of the proceeding as a result of the Applicant's failure to make the requested payment has now prevented compliance with the expedited schedule agreed as a condition not to oppose the stay of enforcement. Since this condition is no longer met, the Committee understands that there is no longer an agreement by the Respondent not to oppose Venezuela's request for a stay of enforcement, which Vestey confirmed in its communication of October 5, 2017. In the absence of this agreement, which constituted the circumstance requiring the stay of enforcement of the Award, the Committee must conclude that the circumstances no longer require that the enforcement of the Award be stayed. Accordingly, the stay of enforcement of the Award is hereby lifted.*\n\n36.\n\nFollowing payment by the Applicant, the proceeding resumed on 7 December 2017.\n\n37.\n\nOn 5 February 2018, following a series of consultations with the Parties, new hearing dates were set for 2 and 3 August 2018.\n\n38.\n\nOn 6 July 2018, having consulted with the Parties, the Committee issued a new hearing schedule that took into account the Parties' respective positions and permitted the Committee to deliberate after the close of the second hearing day. The Committee also invited the Parties to confirm whether they agreed with its assessment that a pre-hearing conference call was not necessary, which the Parties confirmed on 9 and 11 July 2018 respectively.\n\n39.\n\nThe hearing was held on 2 and 3 August 2018 in the World Bank facilities in Paris. Present at the hearing were:\n\nMembers of the Committee:  \nJoan E. Donoghue, President of the Committee  \nGavan Griffith, Member of the Committee  \nRa\u00ebd M. Fathallah, Member of the Committee\n\nICSID Secretariat:  \nAlicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, Secretary of the Committee\n\nParticipants on behalf of the Applicant:  \nReinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica   \nHenry Rodr\u00edguez Facchinetti, Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica   \nOsvaldo Guglielmino, Guglielmino & Asociados  \nMariana Lozza, Guglielmino & Asociados   \nGuillermo Moro, Guglielmino & Asociados  \nPablo Parrilla, Guglielmino & Asociados   \nAlejandro Vulejser, Guglielmino & Asociados  \nJoaqu\u00edn Coronel, Guglielmino & Asociados\n\nParticipants on behalf of the Respondent:  \nArthur Vestey, Vestey Group Limited   \nWilliam Vestey, Vestey Group Limited  \nSamuel Vestey, Vestey Group Limited   \nNigel Blackaby, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer  \nSylvia Noury, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer  \nBen Love, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer  \nAnnie Pan, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer  \nElizabeth Forster, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer\n\n40.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, having consulted with the Parties, the Committee decided various post-hearing matters, including corrections to the transcript and timing and format of costs submissions. The Committee also decided that post-hearing briefs were not authorized, but that the Committee might revert to the Parties with questions should any arise during deliberations.\n\n41.\n\nOn 4 September 2018, the Parties submitted their agreed corrections to the hearing transcripts.\n\n42.\n\nOn 15 October 2018, the Parties submitted their respective costs submissions. In response to the Committee's request, the Parties submitted further details regarding their fees and expenses on 14 November 2018.\n\n43.\n\nOn 8 February 2019, the Committee declared the proceeding closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 38(1).\n\n**II. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Applicant requests that:1\n\n(i) the Award rendered in this case be annulled pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 50; and\n\n(ii) Vestey Group Ltd. be ordered to pay all costs and legal expenses arising from these proceedings.\n\nReply, para. 244.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Committee:2\n\n(a) REJECT Venezuela's Request for Annulment in its entirety; and\n\n(b) ORDER that Venezuela bear all costs and expenses incurred by Vestey in connection with the present annulment proceeding, including the fees of the Centre, the costs and fees of the *Ad Hoc* Committee and Vestey's full legal fees and expenses.\n\nRejoinder, para. 128.\n\n**III. OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction and that Venezuela had breached the expropriation provision (Article 5(1)) of the 1995 Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela (\"**Treaty**\").3 The Applicant seeks annulment of the Award under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, alleging manifest excess of powers (subparagraph (1)(b)), serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (subparagraph (1)(d)) and failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based (subparagraph (1)(e)).4\n\nAward, para. 472.\n\nMemorial, para. 2; Reply, para. 2.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Venezuela's Application constitutes \"an improper use of ICSID's annulment mechanism to frustrate or delay enforcement of the Award\" and should be dismissed with costs. According to Vestey, \"all of Venezuela's arguments for annulment are premised on its disagreement with the substance of the Tribunal's findings in the Award.\" As such, Venezuela's Application falls outside the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.5 Vestey points to the length and detail of Venezuela's Memorial in which, according to Vestey, Venezuela repeats the factual and legal arguments that it had raised in the Original Proceeding.6 It adds that its decision not to oppose Venezuela's stay of enforcement request cannot be seen as an indication of the credibility of the Application.7 Vestey took this decision in the context of an agreement in exchange for an expedited procedural calendar, consistent with its desire to conclude this proceeding as soon as possible.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 2-7.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 77.\n\nRejoinder, para. 6.\n\n48.\n\nThe Applicant rejects the contention that this annulment proceeding constitutes an attempt to re-litigate the case or that it is part of a dilatory strategy, and affirms that it is exercising its right under the ICSID Convention to bring annulment proceedings, which is particularly obvious in this instance because the Parties agreed to an expedited procedure and Vestey twice declined to oppose the stay of enforcement of the Award. The Applicant also disagrees that the length and detail of its argument for annulment show anything other than its \"intention to present arguments in the most rigorous and detailed manner possible in an attempt to contribute to the task of the Committee.\"8\n\nReply, paras. 42-43, 112-113.\n\n49.\n\nBefore considering the specific grounds for annulment raised by the Applicant, the Committee addresses the legal standard to be applied in an annulment proceeding (generally and with respect to each of the subparagraphs of ICSID Convention Article 52(1) invoked by the Applicant). The summaries of Party positions that appear below are not intended to be a comprehensive survey of all points that they made, but rather to identify their principal positions. The Committee has taken into account the full range of arguments advanced by the Parties.\n\n**IV. THE LEGAL STANDARDS RELEVANT TO ANNULMENT**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **G****eneral** **S****tandard of** **A****nnulment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Applicant acknowledges the extraordinary nature of the annulment mechanism,9 the finality of ICSID awards10 and the distinction between appeal and annulment.11 According to the Applicant, the possibility of annulment does not jeopardize the finality of awards. To the contrary, annulment is the mechanism that ensures the integrity of the system and \"provides finality and enforceability only to decisions which do not materially contradict the letter and the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention, and which have not been rendered in violation of its rules.\"12 The Applicant maintains that its arguments do not refer to reasonable disagreements with the Tribunal on the facts or the law, but are limited to serious defects befitting the grounds for annulment in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.13\n\nReply, para. 22.\n\nReply, para. 23.\n\nReply, paras. 30-34.\n\nReply, para. 23.\n\nReply, para. 27.\n\n51.\n\nThe Applicant considers that the grounds for annulment are to be interpreted neither narrowly nor extensively, but in accordance with the interpretation principles of public international law.14\n\nReply, paras. 35-37.\n\n52.\n\nThe Applicant rejects the proposition put forward by Vestey according to which the Committee would have discretion not to annul the Award despite having found that a ground for annulment exists. According to the Applicant, a Committee's discretion is limited to the evaluation of arguments and documents under consideration, and does not encompass the decision whether to annul an award where a ground for annulment has been found to exist. Under those circumstances, \"annulment committees have no discretion at all; rather, they have the strict duty to order annulment.\"15\n\nReply, paras. 38-41.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nVestey submits that the remedy of annulment is designed to safeguard the integrity of the arbitration and not the substantive correctness of the Award. It follows that annulment is not equivalent to appeal and does not permit a substantive review of the Award or substitution of the Committee's own views on the facts or the law for those of the Tribunal. To the contrary, the remedy of annulment is \"limited and exceptional.\" Consistent with its \"narrow and extraordinary character,\" the ICSID Convention only provides for five grounds for annulment that should be considered exhaustive and interpreted restrictively.16 Vestey disagrees with Venezuela's reliance on a line of jurisprudence suggesting that the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention does not support an interpretation of the grounds for annulment that is narrow or restrictive,17 and contends that the drafting history of the treaty confirms that it \"was designed purposefully to confer a limited scope of review.\"18\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 41-44, relying, *inter alia*, on ICSID Secretariat, 'Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID', 5 May 2016, paras. 73, 74 (\"Updated Background Paper on Annulment\"); *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V. v.

The Committee's discretion to annul should be exercised \"in harmony with the narrow object and purpose of the annulment remedy and its underlying policy considerations.\" In particular, the Committee must take into account the gravity of the circumstances and whether they had, or could have had, a material impact on the Award. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to determine whether any ground for annulment affects the Award in full or in part, regardless of the Applicant's characterization. In this case, the grounds for annulment affecting the land components of Vestey's investment, if established, can have no impact on the non-land components of the compensation awarded.19 The Committee should bear in mind that, where a decision in an award is supported by two lines of reasoning, the Committee \"would have to find annullable errors in both lines of reasoning.\" This is because an annullable error in only one of those lines of reasoning would have no impact on the outcome of the Award which, as a result, should not be annulled.20\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 46-47, relying, *inter alia*, on C.H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, (Cambridge University Press, 2d ed., 2009) (\"C.H. Schreuer\"), pp. 1039-1040; *Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

Citing prior decisions of *ad hoc* committees, the Parties agree that annulment is an extraordinary measure. They recognize that annulment is distinct from appeal. They agree that the purpose of annulment is to preserve the integrity of the ICSID system of investor-State arbitration.\n\n56.\n\nIn view of the Parties' agreement on these general points, which are regularly recited by *ad hoc* committees, this Committee sees no reason to dwell on them. The Committee proceeds on the basis that annulment is an exceptional remedy that is distinct from an appeal, which is intended to ensure the integrity of ICSID arbitration proceedings, not their substantive correctness.\n\n57.\n\nAs to the interpretation of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, the Committee considers that no special rule of interpretation \u2013 such as the \"restrictive\" interpretation suggested by Vestey \u2013 applies here. The Committee will interpret the ICSID Convention in light of the law of treaty interpretation,21 in what has been called an \"objective\" manner.22 There is no doubt that annulment is a circumscribed ground of review, limited by the confined terms of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki, 5 June 2007 (\"*Soufraki v. UAE*\"), para. 21.\n\n*Sociedad An\u00f3nima Eduardo Vieira v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/7), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Request for Annulment of Sociedad An\u00f3nima Eduardo Vieira, 10 December 2010, para. 242.\n\n58.\n\nAn *ad hoc* committee may annul an award partially or entirely. If a decision contained in an award is supported by two alternative lines of reasoning, there is a basis to annul the award only if the *ad hoc* committee finds an annullable error in both lines of reasoning. The Committee notes Respondent's assertion that an *ad hoc* committee has the discretion not to annul an award even if it finds that there is a ground on which to do so. The Committee will return to this point if it finds one or more grounds for annulment to apply.\n\n59.\n\nBearing in mind these general points regarding the mechanism of annulment, the Committee turns to the three sub-paragraphs of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention on which the Applicant relies. For each sub-paragraph, this Decision first summarizes the Parties' positions on the applicable legal standard and then sets out the Committee's analysis of that legal standard. Thereafter, the Committee examines, under each sub-paragraph of Article 52(1), the particular grounds for annulment asserted by the Applicant, beginning in each case with a summary of the Parties' positions, followed by the Committee's conclusions.\n\n**B.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Applicant states that it agrees with a two-prong approach to this ground, starting with a determination of whether there was an excess of powers, followed by a determination of whether the excess was manifest.23 The Applicant does not dispute that the \"manifest\" element of the standard requires a certain level of gravity or impact on the outcome of the case.24 However, it disagrees with Vestey's interpretation that \"manifest\" means obvious from a simple reading and without deeper analysis, which is not supported by the Convention, the existing annulment decisions and the works of scholars. According to the Applicant, the excess of powers need not be apparent on its face and therefore does not bar analysis, including by reviewing evidence and legal instruments.25\n\nReply, para. 44.\n\nReply, para. 56.\n\nMemorial, paras. 32-33; Reply, paras. 44-55, 66, relying on *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Application for Annulment of the Award, 29 June 2010 (\"*Sempra v.

Ecuador*\"), para. 57.\n\n61.\n\nThe Applicant considers that an excess of powers can occur when a Tribunal (i) inappropriately exercises, or does not exercise, jurisdiction or (ii) when it fails to apply the applicable law.26\n\nMemorial, para. 34; Reply, para. 57.\n\n62.\n\nFirst, regarding the exercise of jurisdiction where none exists (or the non-exercise of jurisdiction where it exists), the Applicant argues that a determination of whether there has been a manifest excess of powers with regard to jurisdiction necessarily entails the power to review in full or *de novo* the decision on jurisdiction. The application of ICSID Convention Article 52 in this manner is not prevented by the principle of *Kompetenz-Kompetenz*.27 Moreover, according to the Applicant, Vestey acknowledges as much when it states that \"the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction [\u2026] can only be overturned if it is manifestly wrong.\"28\n\nReply, paras. 58-67 (relying on *Vivendi I*, para. 86; *Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn, Bhd v. The Government of Malaysia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10), Decision on the Application for Annulment, 16 April 2009, para. 74; and *Occidental v. Ecuador*, para. 189) and para. 114.\n\nReply, para. 114.\n\n63.\n\nSecond, regarding the failure to apply the applicable law, the Applicant states that it agrees with Vestey that this ground for annulment applies when the Tribunal ignores the applicable law or applies a law other than the applicable law. However, the Applicant disagrees with Vestey that the failure must have been complete or *in toto* rather than concerning \"any specific portion or provision,\" and considers that failure to apply the applicable law also includes a misapplication or error in the application of the law that rises to the degree of depriving the applicable law of its \"ordinary scope\" or of its \"actual normative effect.\"29 The Applicant further rejects the notion that \"a mere reference to the applicable law in the award is sufficient\" for the award not to be subject to annulment. To the contrary, this ground for annulment turns on whether the Tribunal eventually applied the applicable law.30 As explained by the Applicant during the hearing:\n\n[I]*t is not enough to identify the system of law that has to be applied. It is necessary to identify which rule of that system of law has to be applied and which are the conditions that each of those rules has in order to be able to conclude that the Tribunal indeed applied those rules of the system of law that it had to apply.*31\n\nReply, paras. 68-74 (relying on *Occidental v.

Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nVestey states that it agrees with Venezuela regarding \"certain basic principles\" of this standard, including the two-step analysis, whereby the Committee first determines whether there was an excess of powers and then determines whether the excess was manifest. An excess of powers can exist where the Tribunal inappropriately exercises (or fails to exercise) jurisdiction or when it fails to apply the law agreed by the parties. An excess of powers will be manifest where it is, *inter alia*, \"obvious, evident and perceived without difficulty.\"34\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 51.\n\n66.\n\nVestey does not agree with Venezuela's characterization of this ground as permitting a review of the substantive correctness of the Tribunal's findings on jurisdiction or the merits, which \"represent, at best, minority views in the ICSID jurisprudence that otherwise advocates for circumspection in reviewing tribunal decisions alleged to contain 'manifest' excesses of power meriting annulment.\"35 To the contrary, Vestey contends that to establish whether there has been a manifest excess of powers, a committee's remit is subject to limits largely stemming from the \"manifest\" element of the analysis. First, the excess must be both material to the outcome of the case and obvious from a simple reading of the Award, without deeper analysis.36 Second, this ground does not permit a *de novo* assessment of jurisdiction, which implies that \"where a manifest excess of jurisdiction is alleged based solely on the tribunal's incorrect assessment of facts or appreciation of evidence produced by the parties, there can be no basis for annulment\" and that a tenable or reasonable decision on jurisdiction is not subject to annulment.37 Third, an erroneous application of the law or a partial failure to apply the law do not constitute a manifest excess of powers. Instead, \"only a *complete* failure to apply the correct law, rather than any specific portion or provision, may amount to a manifest excess of powers.\" In other words, the enquiry should be \"limited to ascertaining whether the Tribunal identified the proper law applicable to the issue at hand and attempted to apply that law to such issue. It is beyond the Committee's remit to verify whether the Tribunal's application of the law was complete or correct.\"38 Even a manifest error of law fails to meet this standard, and the small number of committees that have endorsed the approach that a particularly gross or egregious misapplication or misinterpretation of the law might amount to a failure to apply it altogether have noted the exceptional nature of such a case.39\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 52; Rejoinder, para. 37.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 52-58, relying, *inter alia*, on *Soufraki v.

The Committee's observations regarding the relevant legal standards are made in light of the particular grounds for annulment invoked by the Applicant, without attempting a comprehensive survey of the law.\n\n68.\n\nAs to the legal standard applicable to annulment on the basis of manifest excess of powers, the Applicant accepts the Respondent's assertion that a \"manifest\" excess of powers must have a certain level of \"gravity, seriousness or materiality to the outcome of the case.\"40 The question of materiality has particular relevance when an applicant in annulment asserts that the exercise of jurisdiction by a tribunal was a manifest excess of powers. The Committee concurs with the observation of the committee in *EDF* that \"the most obvious instance of an excess of powers by a tribunal is the decision of an issue which falls outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal.\"41\n\nReply, para. 56, quoting Counter-Memorial, para. 57.\n\n*EDF v. Argentina*, para. 191.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that a manifest excess of powers must be evident on the face of the Award. The Respondent also considers it unnecessary for the Committee to enter into an examination of the materials on which the Tribunal's decision is based.42 The Applicant disagrees with both of these propositions, instead maintaining that an *ad hoc* committee is not precluded either from engaging in inquiry and analysis of the award or from reviewing evidence and legal instruments that were before the Tribunal.43\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 54(c).\n\nReply, para. 49.\n\n70.\n\nIn the view of the Committee, in order for a tribunal's excess of powers to be manifest, it must be readily discernible. As the *EDF* committee said, however, this does not mean that the excess of powers must \"leap out of the page on a first reading of the Award.\"44 Depending on the issues raised by an application, it may be necessary for the parties to identify with considerable elaboration the reasons for their respective positions regarding an asserted ground for annulment. In addition, the particular circumstances on which an applicant premises a claim for annulment may mean that, in order to assess the competing contentions of the parties, an *ad hoc* committee should take into account not only the award itself, but also extracts from the record of the proceedings before the tribunal. Once the issues have been presented to the *ad hoc* committee, the excess of powers must be obvious in order to provide a basis for annulment.\n\n*EDF v. Argentina*, para. 193.\n\n71.\n\nIn respect of the contention that the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction manifestly exceeded its powers, the Committee rejects Venezuela's invitation to conduct a *de novo* review of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Its task is not to express its own views on the matter of jurisdiction or to substitute its views for the conclusions of the Tribunal.45 Rather, its role is limited to a determination of whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it decided to exercise jurisdiction.\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, SA and Vivendi Universal, SA v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19), Decision on Annulment, 5 May 2017 (\"*Vivendi II*\"), para. 117; and *Azurix v. Argentina*, para. 69.\n\n72.\n\nWith respect to the legal standard applicable to the Committee's review of the Applicant's contention that a tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing (in several respects) to apply the applicable law, the Parties agree that a tribunal commits an excess of powers by failing to apply the law as agreed by the parties.46 For Venezuela, annulment is warranted not only when a tribunal ignores the applicable law or fails entirely to apply it, but also when it fails to apply any particular provision or portion of the applicable law. In the Committee's view, Venezuela ignores the \"fundamental distinction between erroneous application of the law and a failure to apply the law.\"47 If a tribunal has correctly identified the applicable law and has in fact applied that law in the award, there is no scope for an *ad hoc* committee to delve into the correctness of a tribunal's interpretation or application of the applicable law. This does not mean that a committee's inquiry ends once it observes that the tribunal has recited that a particular body of law applies to an issue before it. As stated by the *ad hoc* committee in *MTD v. Chile*:\n\n*An award will not escape annulment if the tribunal while purporting to apply the relevant law actually applies another, quite different law. But in such a case the error must be \"manifest,\" not arguable, and a misapprehension (still less mere disagreement) as to the content of a particular rule is not enough.*48\n\nMemorial, para. 47; Counter-Memorial, para. 138.\n\n*Sempra v. Argentina*, para. 173.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on Annulment, 21 March 2007 (\"*MTD v. Chile*\"), para. 47 (footnote omitted).\n\n73.\n\nThus, if the Committee has satisfied itself that the Tribunal has correctly identified the applicable law and has in fact applied it, there can be no basis for annulment on the ground that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law and thus manifestly exceeded its powers. If the Committee were to consider whether it agreed with the Tribunal's interpretation and application of the applicable law, it would cross the line between an annulment proceeding, which seeks to preserve the integrity of the process, and an appeal.\n\n74.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Parties also endorse what has been described as a \"two-step\" approach to a decision on whether a tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers, whereby a committee first decides whether there has been an excess of powers and then, if it so determines, decides whether that excess of powers was manifest. As has been recognized,49 however, not all *ad hoc* committees have followed this approach. Certainly, a committee cannot annul an award unless it finds both that there was an excess of powers and that the excess of powers was manifest. This does not mean that the ICSID Convention dictates one specific sequence that committees must follow in their reasoning. An *ad hoc* committee must frame its analysis in the manner that best enables it to consider fully the Parties' positions on each asserted ground for annulment.\n\nMemorial, para. 29, citing C.H.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Applicant observes that there is a basis for annulment under subparagraph (d) of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention if there is a departure that is serious from a rule of procedure that is fundamental. A \"fundamental rule of procedure\" has a wider connotation than the specific arbitration rules applicable to an ICSID proceeding and refers to the minimal procedural standards under international law, including the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal. A determination that the departure was \"serious\" requires an analysis of the specific facts of the case.50\n\nMemorial, paras. 57-60; Reply, para. 78.\n\n76.\n\nConcerning the question whether a \"serious\" departure also requires a degree of importance or materiality measurable by the prejudice to the parties, the Applicant contends that it is sufficient that the departure \"had the potential of having an impact on the award.\" The Applicant rejects the notion that there is a requirement to demonstrate that the departure \"was a determining factor in the outcome of the proceeding\" or to show that, without the departure, the award would have been \"favorable\" or \"different.\" Such a requirement would deprive the ground for annulment of any *effet utile*.51\n\nReply, paras. 78-85, relying on *Teco Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23), Decision on Annulment, 5 April 2016 (\"*Teco v. Guatemala*\"), para. 85; and *Tulip v. Turkey*, para. 78.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nVestey states that \"certain basic principles relating to this ground are not in dispute, including that\" it is a dual requirement encompassing the need for the rule to be fundamental and for the departure to be serious, that a fundamental rule of procedure refers to a \"set of minimal standards of procedure\" that includes the parties' \"right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal,\" and that whether the departure was serious depends on the specific facts of the case.52\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 155.\n\n78.\n\nHowever, Vestey disputes \"Venezuela's incomplete articulation of the 'seriousness' requirement [\u2026] which Venezuela considers satisfied if the departure from the relevant rule merely had the potential to have an effect on the award.\"53 According to Vestey, while this element has been interpreted to include an impact or potential for impact on the award, it also includes a requirement of \"importance or materiality consistent with the ordinary meaning of 'serious', measurable by the prejudice to the parties.\"54 Specifically, it must deprive the affected party of the protection intended by the rule from which the Tribunal departed.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 156.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 158.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nIn several respects, the Parties agree on the legal standard applicable to the determination whether there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under subparagraph (d) of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. They agree that a party's right to be heard is among these fundamental rules and that there is a dual requirement, both that the departure be \"serious\" and that rule of procedure at issue be \"fundamental.\" They recognize that an *ad hoc* committee's application of this legal standard is inevitably very fact-specific.\n\n80.\n\nThe Parties use different formulations to describe the threshold that must be crossed to give rise to a \"serious\" departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Venezuela suggests that the bar is low, *i.e.*, that the departure \"had the potential to\"55 or \"could have had\"56 an impact on an award. Vestey considers that a \"serious\" departure is one that is more than minimal57 and that annulment committees have endorsed a requirement of importance or materiality, \"measurable by the prejudice\" to the party.58\n\nMemorial, para. 64.\n\nReply, para. 81.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 159, citing *Tulip v. Turkey*, para. 78.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 158.\n\n81.\n\nAs noted by the committee in *Tulip v*. *Turkey*, because a determination with respect to any point in an award is likely to be the result of a number of factors, it is difficult to assess whether or to what extent a change in one parameter would have changed the outcome in an arbitral proceeding.59 Thus, to establish that a departure from a fundamental rule was \"serious,\" it cannot be necessary to demonstrate that it would have altered the outcome. At the same time, it is not sufficient that a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure may have had, or had the potential to have, an impact on the result, as Venezuela urges. To determine whether a tribunal's departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is serious enough to provide a basis for annulment, it is necessary to consider whether, in the particular circumstances of a case, the departure was of such a nature that there was a genuine prospect of a different result.\n\n*Tulip v. Turkey*, para. 78.\n\n82.\n\nThe rule of procedure invoked by Venezuela is the right to be heard, which undoubtedly is fundamental. When the Committee turns to the specific grounds on which Venezuela contends that the award should be annulled, it will consider whether the Tribunal denied Venezuela its right to be heard and, if so, whether there was a genuine prospect that the result would have been different absent such denial*.*\n\n**D.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the absence of qualifiers such as \"manifest\" or \"serious\" in subparagraph (e) of ICSID Convention Article 52(1) means that there are no limitations that call for a restrictive interpretation of the provision, which is consistent with the fundamental importance of intelligible reasoning for the validity of awards.60\n\nReply, paras. 89-95.\n\n84.\n\nVenezuela maintains the failure to state reasons in this particular case relates to \"fundamental issues,\" to a \"decisive factor\" or to a question that is \"determinant for understanding the reasoning of the award.\"61 The Applicant further contends that \"a simple failure to mention a source that was discussed at length during the proceedings [is not to be confused] with the fact\u2014present in this case\u2014that the Tribunal's failure to state reasons makes it impossible to understand the Tribunal's reasoning.\"62\n\nReply, paras. 97-98.\n\nReply, para. 100.\n\n85.\n\nThe Applicant rejects the sufficiency of reasons that were implicit and reasonably inferable from \"a simple reading of the Award and the case file\"63 and contends that committees have an \"obligation to annul\" rather than seeking to redress a failure to state reasons by reconstructing arguments allegedly implicit to \"the point where the committee takes on the tribunal's own task of rendering a decision.\"64\n\nReply, paras. 101-102.\n\nReply, paras. 104-106.\n\n86.\n\nFinally, the Applicant disputes Vestey's contention that contradictory reasons only amount to failure to state reasons when they \"equate to no reasons at all.\" To the contrary, the Applicant contends that this is only \"the most extreme example of this ground\" and that an award must be annulled where there are \"contradictory,\" \"inadequate,\" \"insufficient,\" \"unintelligib[le],\" \"absent\" or \"frivolous\" reasons on a point that is essential to the outcome of the case.65\n\nReply, paras. 108-110, relying on *Sempra v. Argentina*, para. 167; *Alapli v. Turkey*, paras. 198, 202.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nVestey states that it agrees with Venezuela regarding \"certain basic principles relating to this ground.\" In particular, the parties must be able to follow the Tribunal's reasoning to its conclusion, that a complete lack of reasoning as well as frivolous or contradictory reasons can amount to failure to state reasons, and that incorrect or unconvincing reasons are not within the Committee's remit and cannot amount to failure to state reasons.66\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 106.\n\n88.\n\nHowever, Vestey disagrees with Venezuela's \"attempt to expand the tribunal's obligation to state reasons beyond the minimum requirement established by the *MINE* committee, as well as its suggestion that mere inconsistency, as opposed to genuine contradiction, in the tribunal's reasoning can be a basis for annulment.\"67 According to Vestey, the obligation to state reasons is a minimum requirement that imposes a high threshold despite the absence of qualifying language attached to this ground and gives due regard to tribunals' discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning. To determine whether insufficient or inadequate reasoning merits annulment, committees have considered whether the reasoning concerned a question on which the tribunal's decision would have turned. They have stated that there is no need for the Tribunal to provide \"reasons for its reasons,\" to address every single argument presented by the parties, to explain its valuation of each piece of evidence, to provide references supporting a proposition (particularly where they are well known or contained in the parties' submissions), or to expressly set out the reasons where they are implicit and reasonably inferred.68 Regarding implicit reasons, Vestey does not dispute that reasons should not be constructed where none exist, but contends that a committee should seek to understand those reasons \"from the record before the tribunal\" and with \"reasonable efforts.\"69\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 107.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 107-111, relying, *inter alia*, on *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v.

Vestey submits that, for those to amount to a failure to state reasons, they must cancel each other out and equate to no reasons at all. Committees have distinguished genuine contradictions from compromises resulting from weighing conflicting considerations and have also, to the extent possible, favored an interpretation that confirms the consistency of a decision rather than its alleged contradictions.70 Vestey contends that contradictions in additional or supplementary reasons do not meet the standard, and argues that the legal authorities relied on by Venezuela do not support its attempt to lower the standard for contradictory reasons.71\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 112-116, relying, *inter alia*, on *Daimler Financial Services AG v.

Guinea*, para. 5.09.\n\n*Vivendi I*, para. 64. See also *CMS v. Argentina*, paras. 53-55 (citing *Vivendi I* and *MINE v. Guinea*).\n\n92.\n\nIt is accepted that annulment may be predicated both on the entire absence of reasons and on insufficient, inadequate or contradictory reasons.74 However, reasoning is not insufficient simply because the tribunal does not set out \"its consideration and treatment of each piece of evidence adduced by either party.\"75 A tribunal is required to state the reasons for its decision, but not necessarily the reasons for its reasons. It is not up to an *ad hoc* committee to construct its own reasons for a decision by a tribunal. This does not exclude a finding that a tribunal's reasons are sufficiently implicit in the considerations and conclusion in the award, if they reasonably may be inferred from the terms used in the decision.76 \"[I]f reasons are not stated but are evident and a logical consequence of what is stated in an award, an *ad hoc* committee should be able to so hold.\"77\n\nSee, *e.g.*, *Sempra v. Argentina*, para. 167.\n\n*Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*, para. 104.\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE*, para. 128.\n\n*Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*, para. 83.\n\n93.\n\nIn summary, insufficient or inadequate reasoning only provides a ground for annulment under Article 51(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention if a tribunal's reasons \"are so inadequate that the coherence of the reasoning is seriously affected.\"78\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7), Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award, 1 November 2006, para. 21.\n\n94.\n\nIn the Committee's view, contradictory reasons that fall within subparagraph (e) of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention are reasons that \"cancel each other and will not enable the reader to understand the tribunal's motives.\"79 When contradictory reasons \"neutralize\" each other,80 they are tantamount to no reason at all. However, an *ad hoc* committee should take care not to find contradiction when a tribunal's reasons can more accurately be described as a reflection of the conflicting considerations that the tribunal was required to balance in reaching its conclusions.81\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP v.

THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE TRIBUNAL MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers because it (a) exercised jurisdiction it did not have by deciding a dispute that was different from the dispute originally submitted;82 (b) failed to apply the applicable law by assuming jurisdiction by estoppel in disregard of its own finding that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel;83 (c) failed to apply the applicable law by not admitting the Applicant's objection to jurisdiction in disregard of Arbitration Rule 41(2);84 (d) failed to apply the applicable law and acted outside its scope of jurisdiction by creating property rights that did not otherwise exist under Venezuelan law;85 and (e) failed to apply the applicable law by recognizing property rights for unidentified assets.86\n\nMemorial, paras. 105-140; Reply, paras. 112-137.\n\nMemorial, paras. 141-147.\n\nMemorial, paras. 148-151.\n\nMemorial, paras. 164-195; Reply, paras. 146-181.\n\nMemorial, paras. 218-226; Reply, para. 199, 204-206, 210-212, 216-217, 221.\n\n**A.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Applicant maintains that the Tribunal exercised jurisdiction over a dispute that was different from the dispute that Vestey submitted to arbitration. Venezuela first asserted the lack of identity between the dispute as set out in out in the Request for Arbitration and the dispute that was before the Tribunal in its opening statement at the hearing in the Original Proceeding.87 (The Tribunal referred to this objection as the \"lack of identity\" objection, and the Committee will also do so). The Tribunal's conclusion regarding Venezuela's objection to jurisdiction was that:\n\n[T]*he Tribunal considers this objection untimely and thus inadmissible. This being so, it notes that if the objection were admissible, it would not succeed on the merits. Indeed, the Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent when it argues that the present dispute is entirely different from the one presented in the Request for Arbitration.*88\n\nAward, para. 132.\n\nAward, para. 150.\n\n98.\n\nThe Applicant relies on this conclusion by the Tribunal to advance two grounds for annulment. First, it maintains that, by deciding that the objection was untimely and thus finding it inadmissible, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. That ground for annulment is addressed below in section VI.A. Second, the Applicant points to the Tribunal's subsidiary conclusion that the objection would have failed on the merits and claims that this was a manifest excess of the Tribunal's powers.\n\n99.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the Tribunal \"manifestly exceeded its powers when it asserted jurisdiction over a dispute which had no identity with the dispute that gave rise to the arbitral proceeding, taking into account the way that dispute was formulated in the Arbitration Request.\"89 The Applicant sets out a \"series of facts\" that were cited in the request and asserts that this series of facts \"and no other, was the object of the dispute stated by Vestey Group in the arbitration proceedings.\"90 The Applicant claims that the dispute originally brought to arbitration in 2005 was settled on 17 March 2006 through the conclusion of a settlement agreement (\"**the 2006 Agreement**\"),91 following which Vestey sought and obtained numerous suspensions of the ICSID proceeding between 2006 and 2011. These requests show that the \"agreement reached by the parties was being satisfactorily implemented,\" and that the only reason why Vestey did not request the discontinuation of the ICSID case, as required by the 2006 Agreement, was \"the possibility of obtaining additional benefits from the Republic.\"92\n\nMemorial, para. 3.\n\nMemorial, paras. 105-109.\n\nReply, paras. 119-120.\n\nMemorial, paras. 105-120.\n\n100.\n\nDespite the fact that the dispute had been settled, Vestey decided to resume the ICSID proceeding \"in violation of the letter and the spirit of the agreement.\"93 Vestey did so by submitting claims based on issues which had not been included in the Request for Arbitration, the \"only possible link\" being \"Vestey's claim with respect to the requirement demanding that the chain of title to the farms be proven.\"94 The Applicant contends that, in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Vestey impliedly recognized that the requirement to prove a chain of title was already applicable in 2001. According to the Applicant, this means that all of Vestey's claims post-dating the 2006 Agreement were either new (and different from the dispute submitted to arbitration) or formed part of the original dispute (and had therefore been settled with the 2006 Agreement or abandoned by Vestey since its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction). As this only became apparent with the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Venezuela's objection to jurisdiction based on the above facts and made during its opening statement at the hearing was submitted at the first procedural opportunity.95 Nonetheless, the Tribunal in the Award considered the objection untimely and, as a consequence, inadmissible.96\n\nReply, para. 12.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 25(b); Reply, para. 121.\n\nMemorial, paras. 122-127; Reply, para. 121.\n\nMemorial, paras. 128-129.\n\n101.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, \"the critical date for analyzing whether all of the jurisdictional requirements have been met\u2014which requirements undoubtedly include the specific definition of the dispute\u2014is the date of registration of the proceeding.\" Because the Tribunal's jurisdiction was limited to the dispute brought with the Request for Arbitration, which was settled in 2006, the Tribunal's decision of a different dispute exceeds those limits and was therefore made in excess of its jurisdiction.97\n\nMemorial, paras. 130-136.\n\n102.\n\nTo make this determination, the Applicant contends that the Committee is not precluded from considering its jurisdictional objection *de novo*, including by analyzing the submissions of the Parties, the supporting evidence or the relevant legal instruments. The fact that the Tribunal \"dismissed each of these arguments in the Award,\" as claimed by Vestey, does not preclude this exercise. The problem lies in the way that the issue of jurisdiction was treated in the Award.98\n\nReply, paras. 115-118 (relying on *Sempra v. Argentina*, paras. 159-186) and 125.\n\n103.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal's decision that the jurisdictional objection would have failed on the merits is \"fundamental to the determination of the rights of the parties\" and, therefore, it cannot be argued that \"the manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal is not sufficiently important or substantial to warrant annulment.\"99\n\nReply, para. 124.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nVestey recalls that Venezuela raised its jurisdictional objection based on the alleged lack of identity of the disputes for the first time during the hearing in 2015. Vestey explains that the Tribunal allowed Venezuela the opportunity fully to brief this objection but ultimately rejected it as inadmissible in the Award, noting that Arbitration Rule 41(1) would have required Venezuela to submit its objection at the earliest opportunity, namely when the arbitration resumed in 2011. Even on Venezuela's case that the novelty of the claims only became apparent in May 2014 with Vestey's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that an 8-month time lapse did not meet the standard under Arbitration Rule 41(1), of which Venezuela was not absolved by virtue of the Tribunal's ability to consider the objection *ex officio* under the second paragraph of the same rule. Despite having rejected the objection on admissibility grounds, the Tribunal went on to consider the substance of the objection, including the effect of the 2006 Agreement and, having analyzed it, made a subsidiary decision that the objection failed on the merits, finding that the new factual developments densified the dispute but did not change its nature and identity. The Tribunal further held that Vestey's claims would, in any event, be admissible as ancillary claims under Arbitration Rule 40(1).100\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 102-110.\n\n105.\n\nVestey contends that the Tribunal's decision may only be annulled on this ground if it is \"manifestly wrong,\" for which determination the Committee cannot undertake a *de novo* examination of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Instead, the Committee would have to determine that the Tribunal wrongly assumed jurisdiction in a manner that is \"clear, obvious and evident from a simple reading of the Award, discernible without deeper analysis, without examination of underlying documents and without being subject to debate.\"101 Vestey maintains that Venezuela's invitation to the Committee to review the submissions and evidence of the underlying arbitration is \"inconsistent with the plain meaning of 'manifest' and the nature and scope of the annulment remedy, which cannot be used as an avenue for appeal.\"102\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 78.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 77-79.\n\n106.\n\nVestey submits that Venezuela's request would fail \"[r]egardless of how much analysis and review Venezuela asks the Committee to undertake\" because \"findings of fact cannot be revised at the annulment stage [\u2026] even when they underlie an alleged excess of jurisdiction.\" The Committee is bound by the Tribunal's findings on the identity of the dispute described in the Request for Arbitration and that which was resolved in the Award. Accordingly, Venezuela's assertion must fail as it depends entirely on the Committee coming to a different conclusion on this factual matter.103 In any event, the Tribunal's rejection of the objection is primarily based on untimeliness, and therefore the Tribunal's factual findings only provide an alternative ground for the same result.104\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 80.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 115.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Committee begins by recalling that the Tribunal's primary basis for rejecting the identity-of-disputes objection was its untimeliness. Its conclusion that the objection failed on the merits was subsidiary to the decision that the objection was inadmissible.\n\n108.\n\nEach Party has propounded the approach that it urges the Committee to take with respect to this issue. Venezuela urges *de novo* review. Vestey asserts that the findings of the Tribunal were factual and not amenable to review in annulment. However, in this annulment proceeding, each Party reinforced its positions by citing documents in the record before the Tribunal, including the Request for Arbitration, the 2006 Agreement and extracts from written and oral submissions in the Original Proceeding, which references placed the Parties' respective assertions in context.\n\n109.\n\nIn summary, the Applicant's contention, both in this annulment proceeding and before the Tribunal, is that the dispute presented in the Request for Arbitration was settled in the 2006 Agreement and that the dispute before the Tribunal in the arbitration proceeding, once it was resumed in 2011, was different from the dispute presented in the Request for Arbitration.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal observed that, pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, it must have jurisdiction over a \"dispute.\" It stated its conclusion as to the substance of Venezuela's identity-of-disputes objection as follows:\n\n*In the present case, the dispute hinges on the lawfulness of Venezuela's introduction of rules for the elimination of idle estates and the measures taken against Vestey's cattle farming business under such rules. While the factual matrix of the dispute has evolved and the formulation of the claims has followed this evolution, the essence of the dispute is unchanged. A review of the chronology confirms the unity or identity of the dispute.*105\n\nAward, para. 151.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal also noted the general way in which Vestey (the Claimant in the Original Proceeding) framed the dispute in the Request for Arbitration:\n\n*In the Request for Arbitration filed in 2005, the Claimant noted that \"the Land Law provided a new legal framework for state intervention with rural land in Venezuela\" and that the \"dispute concerns the illegal treatment and confiscation by Venezuela of the country's principal cattle farming business, which has been owned by Vestey for some 90 years.\"*106\n\nAward, para. 152 (footnote omitted), quoting RFA, paras. 7, 52.\n\n112.\n\nVenezuela urged the Committee to construe the dispute presented in the Request for Arbitration more narrowly than did the Tribunal. The Committee declines to do so. It notes that the Request for Arbitration stated that Venezuela \"has taken, or is in the process of taking, concrete steps to confiscate most if not all of Vestey's farms in Venezuela\" and that \"the Government is intent on confiscating most if not all of Vestey's land.\"107 The Request for Arbitration also noted the \"constantly evolving nature of Venezuela's Measures\" and reserved Vestey's right to \"specify, supplement, or amend its claims.\"108\n\nRFA, paras. 30, 86, 91 (cited in Vestey's Opening Presentation, p. 31).\n\nRFA, paras. 103, 106.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that the 2006 Agreement \"did not put an end to the dispute so described.\"109 In support of this conclusion, it stated that the Parties \"do not dispute that it [that is, the 2006 Agreement] merely suspended the arbitration.\"110 In this annulment proceeding, however, Venezuela asserted that the 2006 Agreement required Vestey to discontinue the case (rather than merely to suspend it) and insisted that the 2006 Agreement settled the dispute contained in the Request for Arbitration.\n\nAward, para. 153.\n\nAward, para. 153.\n\n114.\n\nAlthough it appears that the Parties entered into the 2006 Agreement with the expectation that it would lead to settlement of the dispute presented in the Request for Arbitration,111 the Tribunal concluded that the 2006 Agreement \"did not bring about a solution to the dispute,\" citing Vestey's continuing complaints about Venezuela's measures (as described in Vestey's Reply in the Original Proceeding).112 It reached this conclusion after framing its inquiry with reference to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, having examined the 2006 Agreement and the Request for Arbitration.\n\n2006 Agreement, para. 6 (the 2006 Agreement was reached \"in order to amicably resolve and prevent disputes involving the farms\"); Memorial, para. 115.\n\nAward, para. 154.\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion that the 2006 Agreement did not settle the dispute that was set out in the Request for Arbitration leaves open the possibility that the dispute changed so much after the filing of the Request for Arbitration that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by exercising jurisdiction in this case. However, as the Committee has previously noted, the Request for Arbitration indicated that Vestey had reason to anticipate the possibility that additional measures would be applied to its investment and expressly reserved Vestey's right to update its claims. The Tribunal also observed that \"history did not stand still\" after the arbitration was initiated, and that developments after the filing of the Request for Arbitration \"densified the dispute,\" but did not change its \"nature and identity.\"113 It pointed to statements by Vestey indicating that it continued its objections to Venezuela's measures.114 And documents from the Original Proceeding115 that were brought to the attention of the Committee confirm the Tribunal's conclusions.\n\nAward, para. 155.\n\nAward, para. 156.\n\nVestey's Opening Presentation, p. 16. See *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01), Decision on Annulment, 1 February 2016, para. 167.\n\n116.\n\nThe Committee concludes that it was open to the Tribunal to reach the conclusion that it would have rejected Venezuela's identity-of-disputes objection to jurisdiction, had it found the objection admissible. Hence the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers in rejecting this objection by Venezuela on the merits, on a subsidiary basis.\n\n117.\n\nAs previously noted,116 when two lines of reasoning support a tribunal's decision, the award can survive an annulment challenge even if one ground of reasoning is found to be a basis for annulment. However, because the Tribunal's conclusions regarding the substance of the identity-of-disputes objection were subsidiary to its rejection of the objection as inadmissible, the Committee will also address Venezuela's contention that the decision on inadmissibility was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (see Section VI.A below).117\n\nSee *supra*, para. 58.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pp. 200-203, relying on *Daimler v. Argentina*.\n\n**B.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Applicant contends that \"it is well recognised in international law\" that it is not appropriate to dismiss an objection to jurisdiction on admissibility grounds.118 According to the Applicant, during the hearing, the Tribunal recognized that it is a rule of customary international law that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel. This rule implies that an objection to jurisdiction can be validly raised at any stage of the proceeding. Given that the Tribunal decided in the Award that the objection was untimely and therefore inadmissible, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to apply the \"rule of law\" it had previously identified, which \"was applicable to the case,\" thus manifestly exceeding its 119 powers.119\n\nMemorial, paras. 143-147; Reply, para. 129.\n\nReply, paras. 134-136.\n\n119.\n\nThe Award does not state that the Tribunal based its decision on jurisdiction on application of the principle of estoppel. However, according to the Applicant, the Tribunal \"clearly identified the principle under consideration as a rule of customary international law\" and determined that customary international law governed the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the BIT. The Applicant further states \"[i]f the ICSID Convention\u2014and obviously its rules\u2014must be interpreted in the light of customary international law and, according to the Tribunal, it is a rule of customary international law that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel, then the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in rejecting the Republic's objection to jurisdiction as inadmissible.\"120\n\nReply, paras. 130-133.\n\n120.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, it is not accurate that the Tribunal only made \"a mere remark\" of the rule at the hearing, because the Tribunal made that statement in response to an argument by Venezuela, after hearing the Parties and having deliberated. Thus, \"the notion under consideration was practically an obvious issue which was to be easily resolved in the affirmative.\"121\n\nReply, para. 132.\n\n121.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Award is not protected by the Tribunal's identification of customary international law as part of the applicable law because the Tribunal then failed to apply this particular part of the applicable law. The Award must, accordingly, \"be annulled in full by the Committee.\"122\n\nReply, paras. 134-137, relying on *Sempra v. Argentina*, paras. 165, 195.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nVestey contends that Venezuela has not identified a finding by the Tribunal that the prohibition against acquiring jurisdiction by estoppel was the legal rule applicable to its jurisdictional objection (even if that were customary international law on this point and even if the Tribunal acknowledged that customary international law governs treaty interpretation). To the contrary, Vestey contends that the Tribunal applied the specifically applicable legal standards under the Arbitration Rules, which would have displaced customary international law in any event to the extent that the two differed. Moreover, the Tribunal decided the objection on the merits on a subsidiary basis only.123\n\nRejoinder, paras. 61-62; Transcript, Day 2, pp. 258, 259.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe basis for this ground for annulment appears to be the statement by the President of the Tribunal at the hearing that \"there is no estoppel in terms of jurisdiction.\"124 Venezuela asserts that it is well-established under international law that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel and thus that a party's objection to jurisdiction may be raised at any point in a proceeding.125 On Venezuela's reasoning, this asserted rule of customary international law was the applicable law, which the Tribunal failed to apply when it rejected the identity-of-disputes objection as untimely.\n\nMemorial, para. 145, quoting Tribunal Hearing Tr. Day 1, 281:8-282:3.\n\nMemorial, para. 144.\n\n124.\n\nIn the view of the Committee, there is no indication that the Tribunal exercised jurisdiction on the basis of estoppel, nor that it considered that the admissibility of an objection to its jurisdiction was to be decided on the basis of customary international law. The Tribunal instead identified the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules as the law applicable to the admissibility of the objection, and it applied that law to the facts and circumstances of this case. Accordingly, there is no basis to accept this ground for annulment.\n\n**C.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Applicant states that Arbitration Rule 41(2), which forms part of the \"proper law,\" allows tribunals to consider their jurisdiction on their own initiative at any stage of the proceeding.126 *A fortiori* pursuant to this rule, the Tribunal could have considered whether it had jurisdiction over the dispute at the request of a Party. The Applicant contends that the Tribunal's decision to find the objection inadmissible is not an erroneous application of the applicable law but is instead a failure to apply the applicable law that must lead to the annulment of the Award on the grounds of manifest excess of powers.127\n\nMemorial, paras. 141, 148-150, relying on *Daimler v. Argentina*, paras. 107-110.\n\nMemorial, paras. 151-152.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nVestey contends that the Tribunal applied \"the same system of law Venezuela argues to be applicable\" when it decided on the admissibility of Venezuela's objection, namely international law and, specifically, Rule 41(1) of the Arbitration Rules, as prescribed by Article 8 of the Treaty. Because the Tribunal identified and applied the law that Venezuela considers applicable there is no failure to apply the applicable law. Any further review of the correctness of the Tribunal's application of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules is beyond the powers of the Committee and would not rise to a complete non-application of the proper law.128\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 82-87; Rejoinder, para. 56.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nIt appears to the Committee that this ground for annulment is premised on Venezuela's view that Arbitration Rule 41(2) permits a tribunal to consider its own jurisdiction at any time, and that, because the Tribunal nonetheless found Venezuela's objection to be untimely, it failed to apply the applicable law, and thus manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n128.\n\nAs previously noted, the Committee considers that Venezuela offers an unduly expansive interpretation of the scope of review available to an *ad hoc* committee when an applicant in annulment contends that a tribunal has failed to apply the applicable law and thus has manifestly exceeded its powers. The Tribunal identified the applicable law (the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules) and applied it. Venezuela asks the Committee, in essence, to second-guess the manner in which the Tribunal applied the applicable law. Such inquiry is beyond the scope of an annulment proceeding. This ground for annulment therefore fails.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n129.\n\nIn support of the next two grounds for annulment, as well as others to be addressed in later sections of this Decision, Venezuela relies on parts of the Award that address property rights claimed by Vestey. Accordingly, in the interest of clarity and efficiency, and before turning to the specific grounds for annulment, the Committee summarizes the parts of the Award that address Vestey's claim to property rights.\n\n130.\n\nIn the arbitration, Venezuela asserted in opposition to Vestey's expropriation claim that Vestey did not have title to all of its farms. The Tribunal recognized that it therefore needed to assess whether Vestey held title. Vestey contended that Venezuela was estopped from challenging title in the Arbitration, having previously recognized title in the 2006 Agreement and in productivity certificates that Venezuela had issued.129 The Tribunal rejected this contention. It stated:\n\n*For a private person to have a claim under international law arising from the deprivation of its property, it must hold that property in accordance with applicable rules of domestic law. The principle of estoppel cannot create otherwise inexistent property rights. This is so if one grounds the principle of estoppel on international law.*130\n\nAward, paras. 251-256.\n\nAward, para. 257.\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal also stated that Venezuelan law \"leaves no room for the acquisition of property by estoppel.\"131 It continued by observing that one means of acquiring title under Venezuelan law \"could be compared to estoppel in the sense that it implies that acquiescence to peaceful possession can create property rights. The creation of property rights through acquisitive prescription is, however, subject to stringent legal conditions.\"132\n\nAward para. 258.\n\nAward, para. 259.\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal then turned to the Parties' disagreement over the value of registered title under Venezuelan law. It concluded that, under Venezuelan law, registration is not an independent mode of acquisition of property, but that it creates a presumption that the act underlying the registration is valid. It stated that, in the present case:\n\n[T]*hat underlying act is the contract for the transfer of property. Such contract does constitute an independent mode of acquisition of a property right, a matter that is uncontroversial. Unless it is invalidated through the means established by law, the registration obliges any third party, including this Tribunal, to presume that the property right has been validly transferred by operation of the registered property transfer agreement.*133\n\nAward, para. 268.\n\n133.\n\nThe Award further stated: \"[i]n the absence of a judicial decision to the contrary, the Tribunal will thus consider that the registered property transfer agreements presented by Vestey validly transferred the property rights over the land plots.\"134\n\nAward, para. 272.\n\n134.\n\nThere were some discrepancies between the areas indicated in the registered titles and the areas claimed by Vestey. The Tribunal found that these discrepancies did not *per se* affect the validity or existence of registered title. It stated that the outcome \"could have been different if the registry extracts made reference to land plots different from those claimed by the Claimant. However, in this instance, the physical defining features and names of the registered plots coincide with those claimed by Vestey. The divergences merely involve the precise surfaces\"135 of the registered land, which, the Tribunal concluded, could be relevant for valuation purposes, but has no bearing on the existence or validity of a registered title.\n\nAward, para. 275.\n\n135.\n\nHaving concluded that Vestey had valid title to the farms based on registered title, the Tribunal then turned to acquisitive prescription, stating that \"even if the registrations were not deemed to confer valid title, Vestey would hold such title on the ground of acquisitive prescription.\"136 It set out its understanding of the relevant provisions of Venezuelan law, including Article 1979 of the Civil Code, and concluded that the requirements for acquisitive prescription set out in Article 1979 had been met.137\n\nAward, para. 276.\n\nAward, para. 279.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal then considered Venezuela's argument, based on Article 691 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Venezuela, that acquisitive prescription requires a declaration from Venezuela's courts. It concluded that Article 691 of the Code of Civil Procedure confirms that a judicial declaration is not a condition for acquisitive prescription and that, if a judicial declaration were a prerequisite, Article 1979 of the Civil Code (setting out the requirements for acquisitive prescription) would be rendered inutile. \"The only understanding that reconciles these two provisions is that one acquires a property right once it meets the substantive requirements prescribed in Article 1979, while the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure provide a legal process to formally declare that acquisition has validly occurred.\"138\n\nAward, para. 283.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion that Vestey had valid title was therefore based on two lines of reasoning that are set out in the Award, *i.e.*, the presumptions that the Tribunal found to arise from registered title and acquisitive prescription.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal also addressed Venezuela's argument that Vestey was estopped from invoking acquisition by prescription in the arbitration proceeding because it did not raise the defense at the time of the recovery proceedings. The Tribunal stated that Vestey had, in fact, relied on acquisitive prescription in seeking to annul a resolution effecting recovery in judicial proceedings in 2005, in which the court dismissed the argument as procedurally inapposite, and concluded:\n\n*In any event, the Tribunal can discern no requirement in the applicable legal framework according to which the beneficiary of an acquisitive prescription must invoke the prescription before any court or authority or otherwise inform third parties. Therefore, even if Vestey had never invoked the acquisitive prescription it would not change the legal position, i.e. that it had acquired ownership in accordance with Article 1979 of the Civil Code.*139\n\nAward, para. 284.\n\n**D.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Applicant recounts that the Tribunal established that Vestey had property rights based on \"(a) the fact that Vestey had a registered deed of title that was not timely challenged by the Republic, and (b) the fact that Vestey has allegedly acquired the land by acquisitive prescription.\"140\n\nMemorial, para. 167; Reply, paras. 147, 152-157.\n\n140.\n\nRegarding the unchallenged registered titles, the Tribunal stated that the presumption of the validity of registered title binds third parties, including the Tribunal, \"until or unless the contrary is established by a competent Venezuelan court.\" In the absence of a contrary decision by a Venezuelan court, the Tribunal concluded that \"the registered property transfer agreements presented by Vestey validly transferred the property rights over the land plots.\"141\n\nReply, para. 156 (emphasis omitted).\n\n141.\n\nThe Applicant argues that in so reasoning, the Tribunal applied \"erroneous and inapplicable rules [\u2026] by regarding two obviously separate and distinct issues as equivalent: the validity of the deeds of title and the acquisition of property rights.\"142 It presented to the Committee the interpretation of Venezuelan law on which it premises this assertion, which is not recited here.143 Venezuela maintains that it does \"not disagree with the Tribunal's interpretation of Venezuelan law\" but contends that the Tribunal, having correctly identified the applicable law, \"finally decided not to apply it.\"144 The Applicant concludes that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers \"because it failed to apply the law it had regarded as applicable\" and because \"it acted outside its scope of jurisdiction,\" both of which are manifest because they arise directly from the text of the Award.145\n\nMemorial, paras. 168-170.\n\nMemorial, paras. 171-173; Reply, paras. 157-160.\n\nReply, para. 147.\n\nMemorial, para. 174; Reply, paras. 163-165.\n\n142.\n\nRegarding acquisitive prescription, the Applicant states that \"the Tribunal considered that Vestey acquired the land that is the subject matter of its claim by acquisitive prescription\" despite the absence of a court decision to such effect, which would have been \"merely declarative.\" It states that, without a court decision \"it is legally impossible to consider that acquisitive prescription has ever occurred,\" not less because \"a court cannot compensate, on its own initiative, for the parties' failure to raise the issue of acquisitive prescription,\" because an international tribunal \"is not even the appropriate jurisdictional body before which the issue of acquisitive prescription should be filed\" or because Vestey did not \"make any claim that could lead to the Tribunal's favourable decision in the Award.\"146 The Applicant also states that there is no relevant court decision on acquisitive prescription because Vestey did not invoke or otherwise refer to it in any proceeding before Venezuelan courts except for a defense brought in a proceeding concerning a farm that \"is not part of the present dispute under the 2006 Agreement.\" As summarized by the Applicant:\n\n*Therefore, when the Tribunal claims in the Award that Vestey acquired property rights by acquisitive prescription, it manifestly exceeds its powers under the terms of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, as it acts outside the scope of jurisdiction and decides the creation of property rights in land, which rights can only be established by the courts of the Republic, when there is no controversy as to the fact that such competent courts have never declared so, either because Vestey never filed an action in this regard, or because when the issue was raised by way of defence the judges hearing the respective case denied it*.147\n\nMemorial, paras. 175-188; Reply, paras. 166-175, 177-180.\n\nMemorial, para. 188.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nVestey contends that there is no failure to apply the proper law here. Venezuela acknowledges that the proper law in this case is Venezuelan law, and that is also the law applied by the Tribunal to determine the existence of Vestey's property rights. In particular, having analyzed and interpreted various sources of Venezuelan law to determine the land ownership requirements, the Tribunal then applied those and concluded that Vestey held valid title to the land under Venezuelan law \"on the basis that it: (i) held registered title in respect of the land claimed (without having to demonstrate a perfect chain of title in addition); and (ii) in any event, would have acquired title by acquisitive prescription.\"148\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 89-92.\n\n144.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal did not create property rights, nor did it ever purport to create property rights. The Tribunal merely determined, as a factual matter, that Vestey held valid title and property rights under Venezuelan law, a determination that was \"squarely within the Tribunal's power\" and cannot be substituted by the Committee's own interpretation of Venezuelan law or appreciation of the facts. Therefore, since the Tribunal purported to apply the same law as considered applicable by Venezuela, the Committee must dismiss the claim that the Tribunal exceeded its powers in this regard. Even a clearly erroneous or incomplete application of the proper law would not give rise to an excess of powers.149\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 93-94; Rejoinder, para. 77.\n\n145.\n\nVenezuela's real argument, according to Vestey, is that the Tribunal failed to interpret Venezuelan law correctly or failed to give effect to its specific provisions. In particular, Venezuela contends that the Tribunal decided not to apply either or both of the perfect-chain-of-title requirement (concerning the existence and validity of the property rights) and the requirement of judicial declaration (concerning the acquisition of rights through acquisitive prescription).150\n\nRejoinder, paras. 67-72, 74.\n\n146.\n\nAccording to Vestey, the Tribunal did not fail to apply these requirements but expressly found that they were not applicable (regarding the perfect chain of title) or non-existent (regarding the judicial declaration), on the basis of its interpretation and application of Venezuelan law.151\n\nRejoinder, paras. 72-75; Transcript, Day 1, pp. 130-135 and Day 2, pp. 239-250.\n\n147.\n\nVestey concludes that, since Venezuela has failed to establish an excess of powers, there is no need to examine whether excess satisfies the requirement that it be manifest. In any event, Venezuela's assertion that the excess is manifest because it \"clearly arises from the text of the Award\" is negated by Venezuela's extensive references and lengthy arguments on the evidence before the Tribunal. This claim must therefore be dismissed.152\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 95-96.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal found that Vestey held valid title to the land that it claims on two bases, namely that it held registered title to that land and that, even if Vestey did not have valid title, it would hold such title on the ground of acquisitive prescription. Venezuela challenges both lines of reasoning set out in the Award, claiming that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law, which was a manifest excess of powers.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that the Parties agreed that Venezuelan law governed ownership of the land in question.153 It then examined various provisions of Venezuelan law related to the value of registered title under Venezuelan law, addressing the Parties' competing interpretations of Venezuelan law. It concluded that, in the absence of a judicial decision to the contrary, it would consider that \"the registered property transfer agreements presented by Vestey validly transferred the property rights over the land plots.\"154\n\nAward, para. 252.\n\nAward, para. 272.\n\n150.\n\nSo expressed, in its reasons the Tribunal both identified Venezuelan law as the law applicable to this aspect of the dispute and applied that law. There is no indication that it instead applied a different body of law. Venezuela's objections to the Tribunal's conclusions regarding registered title are criticisms of the correctness of the Tribunal's interpretation and application of Venezuelan law. So characterized, its objections are beyond the purview of an annulment proceeding.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal also applied Venezuelan law to decide whether, even if registrations of title were not deemed to confer valid title, Vestey would hold title on the basis of acquisitive prescription.155 The Award sets out the Tribunal's analysis of provisions of Venezuelan law that it applied.156 Again, Venezuela's objections are based on its disagreement with the manner in which the Tribunal interpreted and applied the applicable law, *i.e.*, Venezuelan law.\n\nAward, para. 276.\n\nAward, paras. 276-284.\n\n152.\n\nVenezuela also suggests that the Tribunal's \"creation of property rights\" was an excess of its jurisdiction.157 As noted above, the Tribunal applied Venezuelan law to reach its conclusions regarding the existence of property rights. Venezuela does not substantiate the assertion that the Tribunal \"created\" property rights. This assertion does not provide a basis to conclude that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\nReply, paras. 164-165.\n\n153.\n\nIn summary, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers and thus that there is no basis to annul the Award pursuant to subparagraph (b) of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**E.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Applicant considers that the Tribunal failed to apply Venezuelan law by recognizing property rights in what it describes as \"unidentified property,\" because it failed to apply the applicable law (Venezuelan law) to determine the existence of the alleged real property rights. The Applicant explains that although the Tribunal confirmed the lack of identity between the titles that Vestey possessed and the land that it claimed, it \"did not invalidate Vestey's claim with respect to this land, but merely reduced the amount of damages for the alleged expropriation, as if the hectares of land were fungible goods.\"158\n\nMemorial, para. 224; Reply, para. 213 (footnote omitted).\n\n155.\n\nThe Applicant states that, under Venezuelan law, \"property rights are not interchangeable and for a right in rem to exist, its identification must be accurate and concrete.\" As a consequence, \"if it is not possible to determine the actual surface area, there can be no property rights in it.\"159\n\nMemorial, paras. 221-223; Reply, paras. 211-212.\n\n156.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it purported to apply Venezuelan law and instead \"created rights in clear violation of the domestic law that it had to apply and disregard[ed] the fundamental concepts of real property rights and the general principles of private law.\"160 As to this alleged error, the Applicant contends that it is the Committee's duty to determine whether the Tribunal \"observed such applicable law and relied on it to resolve the dispute\" as opposed to merely purporting to apply it but actually applying a different law.161\n\nMemorial, para. 225; Reply, para. 210.\n\nReply, para. 214, relying on *MTD v. Chile*, para. 47.\n\n157.\n\nIn addition, during the hearing, the Applicant contended that the Tribunal both failed to apply the law applicable to compensation when it awarded damages for uncertain or indeterminate surfaces of land, and ignored the applicable evidentiary rules on burden of proof when it relied on unreliable sources to quantify the value of that land.162\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 42-48 and Day 2, pp. 214-217.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nVestey contends that the Tribunal applied the same law that Venezuela considers to be applicable. Specifically, the Tribunal applied Venezuelan law to determine whether the surface area discrepancies between the registered titles and the surface areas occupied and operated by Vestey affected the existence or validity of Vestey's registered titles, and concluded that they did not because \"Venezuelan law does not provide for such a consequence,\" although said discrepancies \"may be relevant for valuation purposes.\"163\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 98-99 (emphasis omitted).\n\n159.\n\nSince the Tribunal endeavored to apply the proper law to the matter of existence and validity of Vestey's property rights, there was no excess of powers. An erroneous or incomplete application of the proper law would not qualify as failure to apply the applicable law, and any review into whether the proper law was applied correctly would be beyond the Committee's remit. Moreover, absent a showing of excess of powers, there is no need to examine whether the \"manifest\" requirement has been met, and the Committee must dismiss this claim.164 Vestey contends that, as with the argument concerning Vestey's property rights, Venezuela's argument here is \"essentially a complaint that the Tribunal failed to adopt Venezuela's view on Venezuelan law.\" However, the Tribunal did not fail to apply the proper law when it rejected Venezuela's position on Venezuelan law and found that the discrepancies in surface area did not invalidate Vestey's rights.165\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 100-101.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 81-82.\n\n160.\n\nVestey also responds to an argument developed by Venezuela in its Reply in this annulment proceeding, to the effect that the Tribunal exceeded its powers when it found that \"the physical defining features and names of the registered plots coincide with those claimed by Vestey.\" According to Vestey, Venezuela fails to explain how a factual conclusion, which is squarely within the Tribunal's powers, can amount to an excess of powers. This argument must also be rejected.166\n\nRejoinder, para. 83.\n\n161.\n\nTo the extent that Venezuela has argued that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law to its decision on compensation, Vestey submits that the Tribunal correctly endeavored to apply international law as the law applicable to determine \"the effect of the discrepancies in surface area raised by Venezuela on the amount of compensation to which Vestey was entitled in relation to the land assets,\" and therefore this claim must equally be rejected.167\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 102.\n\n162.\n\nDuring the hearing, Vestey noted that Venezuela had made new arguments at the hearing concerning failure to apply the proper law based on the surface area discrepancies, namely that the Tribunal's determination of compensation was uncertain, which contradicts international rules of law on compensation, that the international rule of the burden of proof had not been followed, and that the Tribunal was wrong to decide to use the lesser of the surface areas of land. Vestey contends that the Tribunal applied principles of international law to its assessment of damages, such that any misapplication thereof would not be grounds for annulment, and that in any event international law on this matter is that damages be established with reasonable confidence, not with certainty. Vestey further contends that the Tribunal applied the principle of burden of proof and found in its discretion that it had been met. Finally, Vestey contends that the Tribunal's decision to award damages for the lesser of the land claimed was a factual determination squarely within its powers and that Venezuela's argument is a disagreement with how the Tribunal should have valued the plots of land.168 In any event, Vestey contends that the argument based on the Tribunal's decision to compensate for the lesser of the land claimed is not relevant to all farms and would not have had a material impact on the unit price, which was already established at the lowest unit value determined by Claimant's expert.169\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pp. 261-269.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pp. 271-272.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nIn the Original Proceeding, the Tribunal addressed Venezuela's objection that the land areas in the registered titles did not coincide with the areas claimed by Vestey. Vestey's response was that the discrepancies were due to the fact that the old registered titles did not employ modern measurement techniques.170 The Tribunal concluded that the discrepancies \"do not *per se* affect the validity or existence of the registered titles. Venezuelan law does not provide for such a consequence.\" It also observed that Venezuela could have initiated judicial action to challenge the title, pursuant to Article 43 of the Law on Public Registries, but it had not done so.171\n\nAward, para. 273.\n\nAward, para. 274.\n\n164.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Parties agree that the applicable law for determining the ownership of the land claimed by Vestey is Venezuelan law. The Tribunal invoked Venezuelan law as the applicable law and the Award indicates that it applied that law. It found that Venezuelan law did not have the consequences asserted by Venezuela.\n\n165.\n\nThe Applicant's objections to the Tribunal's conclusions on this point must be characterized as objections to the correctness of the conclusions that the Tribunal reached in interpreting Venezuelan law and in applying it to the facts as it found them. Alleged error in application of the correct law does not suffice to support annulment.\n\n166.\n\nVenezuela's contention that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law in determining compensation is equally unavailing. The Award sets out the Parties' respective positions on the standard of compensation, including their positions on the relationship between the standard in customary international law and the standard set out in the applicable bilateral investment treaty.172 It then states the Tribunal's conclusions on this point, giving the reasons for those conclusions. The objections that Venezuela raised in the annulment hearing go to the substance of the Tribunal's conclusions regarding the standard of compensation.\n\nAward, paras. 320-324.\n\n167.\n\nFor these reasons, this ground for annulment is rejected.\n\n**VI. THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE TRIBUNAL SERIOUSLY DEPARTED FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Applicant alleges that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure when it deprived the Applicant of its right to be heard by (a) deciding a dispute that was not the same as that originally submitted;173 and (b) basing its decision to assume jurisdiction on a provision that had not been invoked.174\n\nMemorial, para. 158; Reply, paras. 138-145.\n\nMemorial, paras. 153-157, 160.\n\n**A.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n169.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal's decision to assume jurisdiction over a different dispute allowed the Tribunal \"to hear matters that had not been raised by Vestey in its Request for Arbitration\" and \"implies a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure because it violates a set of minimum standards [\u2026] specifically the right to be heard.\"175\n\nMemorial, para. 158.\n\n170.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal's departure was \"undoubtedly serious\" because it \"seriously impair[ed] the right of defence of the Republic and the principle of identity of disputes.\"176\n\nReply, para. 138.\n\n171.\n\nThe Applicant rejects the argument that it is not complaining about any specific violation of its right of defense and that its real issue relates to the substance of the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction. The Applicant confirms that it is not seeking to re-litigate the merits of the objection. Its argument relates to the fact that it \"formulated its defence in this case on the premise that Vestey's claims were those invoked in its Request for Arbitration\" and that, following the 2006 Agreement, \"Vestey's only remaining claim was the one relating to the need to prove the chain of title.\" Once Vestey abandoned that argument in the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Venezuela raised a new objection at the first procedural opportunity (during its opening statement at the hearing). However, the objection was considered inadmissible, so Venezuela's arguments on the merits of the objection were deprived of any \"useful effect.\" According to the Applicant, its right to be heard and its right of defense have been violated because \"the Tribunal assumed jurisdiction over a different controversy than the one submitted in the Request for Arbitration, after the Republic raised its objection at the first useful procedural opportunity.\"177\n\nReply, paras. 139-141.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nVestey observes that Venezuela does not appear to complain about \"any specific violation of its right to be heard on the allegedly different dispute\" decided by the Tribunal, which is not surprising since Venezuela was not denied the right to address the claims post-dating the Request for Arbitration (to which the entirety of the arbitration was devoted), nor was Venezuela denied the opportunity to present its objection based on the alleged lack of identity of the disputes (even if Venezuela did so as late as the hearing).178\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 166.\n\n173.\n\nInstead, Venezuela appears to complain about the substance of the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction, which is \"evident from its continued insistence that the Tribunal exercised jurisdiction over a '*different*' dispute, when the Tribunal in fact found the disputes were one and the same.\" According to Vestey, it is the conduct of the proceedings and not the content of the decision that can be a basis for annulment under this ground, and so this request must be dismissed.179\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 167, 171 (emphasis in original and footnote omitted).\n\n174.\n\nTo the extent Venezuela argues that it was deprived of the right to be heard by the Tribunal declaring the objection inadmissible, Vestey contends that the dismissal took place *after* the Tribunal had honored Venezuela's right to be heard by granting it ample opportunity to brief its objection both on admissibility and on the merits.180\n\nRejoinder, paras. 121-122; Transcript, Day 1, p. 119.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Committee here considers whether the Tribunal violated Venezuela's right to be heard, and thus engaged in a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, when it rejected as untimely Venezuela's lack-of-identity-of-disputes objection and found that, as a subsidiary matter, the objection would have failed on the merits, had it been admissible.\n\n176.\n\nAs the Award indicates, Venezuela first raised the alleged lack-of-identity-of-disputes objection in its opening statement at the hearing in the Original Proceeding.181 Vestey objected on the grounds of timeliness and substance.182 The Award contains excerpts from the transcript of the hearing in which the President of the Tribunal sought to clarify whether Venezuela was raising a jurisdictional objection.183 Rather than ruling on the matter at the hearing, the Tribunal gave Venezuela an opportunity to make an additional written submission with respect to its jurisdictional objection, to which Vestey was given an opportunity to reply in writing. The Parties also addressed the objection in post-hearing briefs.184\n\nAward, para. 132.\n\nAward, paras. 140-143.\n\nAward, para. 132, fn. 96.\n\nAward, para. 143.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal considered the requirement that a jurisdictional objection be raised \"as early as possible\" (Arbitration Rule 41(1)), in light of Venezuela's claim that it only learned of what it termed as Vestey's abandonment of its original claim when Vestey filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, eight months before the start of the hearing. The Award indicates that the Tribunal was not persuaded by Venezuela's assertion that Vestey's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction demonstrated the termination of the original dispute.185 \"Be this as it may,\" the Tribunal wrote, a delay of eight months \"does obviously not meet the 'as early as possible' requirement.\"186\n\nAward, para. 156.\n\nAward, para. 147.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal added:\n\n*If Venezuela really believed that the 2006 Settlement Agreement settled the dispute,* [ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1)] *would have required it to raise its objection at the time when the arbitration resumed in 2011. Similarly, if the supposed novelty of the claims only became apparent in May 2014* [when Vestey filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction]*, the rule would have required Venezuela to react well before the hearing.*187\n\nAward, para. 149.\n\n179.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considered and rejected Venezuela's argument that its delay in raising a jurisdictional objection was without consequence in light of Arbitration Rule 41(2), which provides that a tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether a dispute or ancillary claim is within its jurisdiction. It found that a tribunal's discretionary power to review its jurisdiction at any time does not absolve a party of compliance with Arbitration Rule 41(1).188\n\nAward, para. 149.\n\n180.\n\nThus, although Venezuela did not raise the identity-of-disputes objection until the hearing, the Tribunal gave Venezuela the right to be heard, as to both the timeliness and the substance of its objection to jurisdiction, in an additional written submission and in post-hearing briefs.189 After giving Venezuela these opportunities to set out its views, the Tribunal found the objection to be untimely and thus inadmissible. The Tribunal also indicated that, even if the objection had been admissible, it would not have succeeded on the merits.190\n\nAward, paras. 41-43.\n\nAward, paras. 150-156.\n\n181.\n\nVenezuela asserts that it was denied a right to be heard because it based its defense before the Tribunal on the arguments that Vestey had made in its Request for Arbitration and, according to Venezuela, Vestey abandoned that argument in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.191 The Award amply demonstrates, however, that Venezuela submitted arguments and evidence to the Tribunal on the dispute that was the subject of the Award, and that the Tribunal considered Venezuela's views.\n\nReply, para. 141.\n\n182.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal's decision to reject Venezuela's identity-of-disputes objection did not violate Venezuela's right to be heard and thus that this ground for annulment must be rejected.\n\n**B.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n183.\n\nArbitration Rule 40(1) permits a party to present incidental or ancillary claims directly arising out of the subject-matter of the dispute. Arbitration Rule 40(2) requires that any such claims by a claimant be made no later than in the reply. The Applicant observes that the Tribunal stated that \"the Respondent does not object to the admissibility of the Claimant's ancillary and new claims under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(1), and rightly so\" and that the Tribunal disagreed with the characterization of the dispute as entirely different from the one submitted in the Request for Arbitration.192\n\nMemorial, para. 153.\n\n184.\n\nThe Applicant labels as \"misleading\" the Tribunal's statement that Venezuela did not object to the admissibility of Vestey's ancillary and new claims under Arbitration Rule 40(1). It contends that Vestey never made an application under this rule and that \"the Tribunal treated claims submitted by Vestey but not included in its Request for Arbitration as ancillary claims, without being required to do so by either party.\" According to the Applicant, had Vestey brought a request under Arbitration Rule 40(1), it \"would have been required to define the subject-matter of its ancillary claims and their link to the dispute brought in its Request for Arbitration.\" However, as no such request was filed, the Applicant \"did not have \u2014and could not have had\u2014 the opportunity to address a request that was never made.\" Accordingly, the Applicant was not guaranteed the right to be heard, which constitutes a serious departure from a rule of procedure.193\n\nMemorial, paras. 154-157, 160; Reply, paras. 144-145.\n\n185.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Applicant also explained that its right to be heard was not protected by the Tribunal's indication that \"it would have upheld that proposition of ancillary claims had it ever been fostered by Vestey.\" This is because \"the right to be heard is not just the right to put out there arguments for a Tribunal or Committee that has already taken a decision,\" but requires the opportunity to convince a Tribunal or Committee on the particular topic.194\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 79-80.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nVestey points out that the Parties exchanged submissions on whether the claims post-dating the Request for Arbitration would qualify as ancillary claims under Arbitration Rule 40(1) and whether Vestey would have been required to invoke this rule formally in order to introduce ancillary claims as such. It was with the benefit of these submissions that the Tribunal made its observation on Arbitration Rule 40(1). Vestey contends that the Tribunal was not required to adopt a different procedure concerning ancillary claims, as none is specified in either Arbitration Rule 40\u00a0or ICSID Convention Article 46. Even if such a requirement existed and was considered fundamental, Venezuela cannot show that any departure therefrom was serious, given that Venezuela had repeated opportunities to respond on the substance. Any such complaint would be further undermined by the Tribunal's indication that it would have admitted Vestey's claims had Venezuela objected to them under Arbitration Rule 40\u00a0(as it had the burden to do pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(1)).\n\n187.\n\nVestey considers that it is unnecessary for the Committee to decide whether the departure was \"serious\" given that it has been established that there was no departure at all. Venezuela has not shown either of the two requirements of this ground for annulment, namely whether the departure was materially prejudicial to Venezuela and whether the Tribunal would have reached a different decision had Venezuela had \"a further opportunity to reiterate its theory that Vestey's ancillary claims could not be admitted under [Arbitration] Rule 40(1) for failure to follow some special procedure.\" This ground for annulment must accordingly be dismissed.195\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 170-171.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nVenezuela maintains that it was denied the right to be heard with respect to Vestey's claims because Vestey failed to identify its claims as \"incidental or additional\" claims as required by Arbitration Rule 40. According to Venezuela, this was a serious departure from a fundamental procedural rule.196\n\nReply, para. 143.\n\n189.\n\nAfter Venezuela raised its jurisdictional objection at the hearing in the Original Proceeding, it was given leave to make an additional submission in support of the identity-of-disputes objection. In that additional submission, Venezuela, citing Arbitration Rule 40(1), noted that Vestey had made no ancillary claims.197 Venezuela repeated this position in a post-hearing brief, in which it also stated that Arbitration Rule 40(1) must be specifically invoked when an ancillary claim is brought.198\n\nVenezuela's additional submission, ARE-2, para. 9.\n\nVenezuela's post-hearing brief, AAE-2, paras. 18, 43-44.\n\n190.\n\nIn its post-hearing brief in the Original Proceeding, Vestey reiterated both its objection on timeliness and its position on the substance of the objection that the 2006 Agreement did not settle the dispute between the Parties. It also stated that even if the Tribunal were to classify claims made in Vestey's Reply as ancillary claims within the scope of Arbitration Rule 40(1), Venezuela's objection would have been time-barred.199\n\nVestey's second post-hearing brief, ARE-5, paras. 37-39, 66-68.\n\n191.\n\nAfter the Tribunal heard the range of arguments presented by the Parties in respect of Venezuela's identity-of-disputes objection, it decided that the objection was untimely and thus inadmissible. On a subsidiary basis, the Tribunal concluded that the identity-of-disputes objection would not have succeeded on the merits, because the developments after the filing of the Request for Arbitration \"densified\" the dispute but did not \"change its nature and identity.\" These are the grounds \u2013 primary and subsidiary \u2013 on which the Tribunal based its decision with respect to Venezuela's identity-of-disputes objection.\n\n192.\n\nHaving reached these conclusions, the Tribunal added:\n\n[*\u2026*] *the Respondent does not object to the admissibility of the Claimant's ancillary and new claims under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(1), and rightly so. The current claims are indeed closely connected to the original claims, as they both concern violations of the BIT by measures taken under the Land Law against the Claimant's cattle farming business.*200\n\nAward, para. 157.\n\n193.\n\nContrary to Venezuela's assertion, the Committee does not consider that, by mentioning Arbitration Rule 40(1), the Tribunal \"relied on a provision that was not invoked.\" The Award states that the Tribunal \"notes that the Respondent does not object to the admissibility of the Claimant's ancillary and new claims under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(1), and rightly so. The current claims are indeed closely connected to the original claims.\"201 Thus, having already rejected the identity-of-disputes objection as untimely and having concluded, on a subsidiary basis, that the objection would also fail on the merits, the Tribunal added a further observation suggesting that it also would have rejected the objection if Venezuela had raised it under Arbitration Rule 40(1). This observation by the Tribunal does not equate to a denial of Venezuela's right to be heard.\n\nMemorial, para. 153; Award, para. 157.\n\n194.\n\nThe Committee notes Vestey's contention, relying on Arbitration Rule 27, that Venezuela waived its right to seek annulment on the basis of what it contends to have been a failure to follow procedures required by Arbitration Rule 40, because it did not raise this point in the Original Proceeding.202 The above summary of the Original Proceeding makes clear, however, that Venezuela made assertions regarding the procedural requirement of Arbitration Rule 40 in the Original Proceeding.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 168-169; Rejoinder, paras. 123-126; Transcript, Day 1, p. 120:1-25 \u2013 p. 124:1-15.\n\n195.\n\nFor these reasons the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not violate a fundamental rule of procedure by relying on a rule of procedure that was not invoked.\n\n**VII. THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE TRIBUNAL FAILED TO STATE REASONS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nVenezuela has submitted a number of arguments in support of the contention that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based, which can be grouped into six points. Point (A) is the contention that the Tribunal assumed jurisdiction by estoppel contrary to its previous finding that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel.203\n\nMemorial, paras. 162-163; Reply, paras. 142-145.\n\n197.\n\nThe other five ways in which the Award allegedly failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Points (B)-(F) below) are tied to the Tribunal's conclusions regarding title to, and valuation of, the real property at issue (see paragraphs 129-138 above). In summary, Venezuela contends that the Tribunal:\n\n(b) contradicted itself when it created property rights having previously found that it did not have jurisdiction to create property rights;204\n\n(c) failed to explain the assimilation between having an unchallenged registered title and having acquired property rights, or how acquisitive prescription had occurred despite the absence of a court declaration;205\n\n(d) determined that Vestey had acquired property rights through the Applicant's failure to challenge its registered titles, contrary to its finding that property rights cannot be acquired by estoppel under Venezuelan law;206\n\n(e) made an unexplained determination, based on Vestey's unsupported statements, that compensable property rights exist having found that the deeds do not match the land claimed, also in contradiction with the Tribunal's finding that only the surface area in the title documents is subject to compensation;207 and\n\n(f) contradicted itself by drawing different inferences from a Party's failure to act depending on which Party benefitted from those inferences.208\n\nMemorial, paras. 192-193 y 205; Reply, paras. 182-198.\n\nMemorial, para. 166.\n\nMemorial, paras. 196-199.\n\nMemorial, paras. 207-217, 226.\n\nMemorial, paras. 201-204.\n\n**A.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe Applicant states that, during the hearing in the Original Proceeding, the Tribunal held that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel. Notwithstanding this finding, the Tribunal considered that Venezuela's jurisdictional objection was not admissible because it had been filed in breach of Arbitration Rule 41(1). \"If, as the Tribunal contends, jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel, the alleged violation of a procedural rule by the Republic cannot be opposed to it, thereby establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"209\n\nMemorial, para. 163.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nAccording to Vestey, Venezuela relies on a contradiction between a remark made by the President of the Tribunal at the hearing (that jurisdiction cannot be based on estoppel) and the Tribunal's reasoning in the Award. However, even if the President's remark could be read as accepting Venezuela's proposition that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel, \"Venezuela has not identified any aspect of the Award in which the Tribunal relies on the principle that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel,\" and the request must be dismissed on this basis alone.210\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 119-120.\n\n200.\n\nVestey contends that there is no contradiction between the Tribunal's recognition of the principle of estoppel and its dismissal of Venezuela's objection as untimely. The Tribunal \"concluded that it had (and had always had) jurisdiction over the dispute before it. The principle that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel was therefore irrelevant to the present case.\"211\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 121.\n\n201.\n\nFinally, even if Venezuela were correct that there is \"a certain theoretical tension\" between the principle and Arbitration Rule 41(1), \"this clearly would not be a contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning but rather a scenario in which the Tribunal would be required to arrive at a legal solution balancing two potentially conflicting legal rules.\" Because annulment is not appeal, that solution cannot be reviewed by the Committee. In any event, Vestey considers the Tribunal's decision \"unsurprising\" given that the principle of *lex specialis* would result in the rule trumping the principle.212\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 122.\n\n202.\n\nVestey concludes that there is no contradiction, much less one that would merit annulment, since the Tribunal also dismissed the objection on the merits. Accordingly, Venezuela's request must be rejected.213\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 123. In its Rejoinder, at paras. 3 and 85, Vestey notes that the allegation of failure to state reasons regarding the Tribunal's decision to reject the objection based on the alleged lack of identity of the disputes has been dropped by Venezuela, which is a \"[t]estament to the meritless nature of this annulment application.\"\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nPoint (A) is premised on an asserted contradiction between a statement made by the President of the Tribunal at the hearing \u2013 that jurisdiction cannot be based on estoppel \u2013 and the Tribunal's decision pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(1) that the identity-of-disputes objection was untimely and thus inadmissible, which Venezuela characterizes as an assumption of jurisdiction by estoppel. The Committee sees no such contradiction. The Award does not indicate that the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction was governed by customary international law (which, according to the Applicant, contains a rule that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel). Instead, the Award applies the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and sets out the reasons for the Tribunal's conclusions that the objection was untimely. It also states that, even if the objection had been admissible, it would have failed in substance.214 The President's statement at the hearing does not contradict the Tribunal's stated reasons for rejecting Venezuela's jurisdictional objection, on the basis of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules.\n\nSee *supra*, paras. 124, 175-180.\n\n204.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that Point (A) does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (1)(e) of ICSID Convention Article 52.\n\n**B.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal \"failed to state reasons when it claimed, on the one hand, that creating property rights which did not previously exist as such under the applicable domestic law was outside its scope of jurisdiction but, on the other hand, created non-existent rights under the applicable Venezuelan law.\"215\n\nMemorial, para. 205 (footnote omitted).\n\n206.\n\nSpecifically, the Tribunal \"decided to create rights based on an alleged acquisitive prescription as a means of acquiring property\" despite the absence of a court decision, in contradiction with the Tribunal's recognition that a court declaration is \"an essential requirement for acquisitive prescription to validly take place.\"216 The Tribunal also relied on unchallenged registered deeds of title to determine the existence of property rights, despite the fact that \"registration of a deed title relates only to the validity of the specific transaction or specific transactions being registered, but it cannot establish the existence or validity of transactions that have never taken place throughout the entire chain of title, nor can it create non-existent property rights because such transactions never existed.\"217\n\nReply, paras. 193-197.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 38.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nAccording to Vestey, the assertion that the Tribunal created property rights is based only on Venezuela's disagreement with the Tribunal's interpretation and application of Venezuelan law and must therefore be dismissed. The Tribunal \"never sought to 'create' property rights which did not otherwise exist under Venezuelan law but instead upheld the validity of the property rights Vestey (through Agroflora) already held under Venezuelan law.\"218 There is no contradiction between the finding that Vestey had property rights and the recognition that the Tribunal cannot create otherwise nonexistent property rights.219\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 136; Rejoinder, para. 101(d).\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 153.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThe Committee understands Venezuela to assert in Point (B) that there is a contradiction between (1) the Tribunal's observation that, for a person to have a claim under international law for deprivation of property, it must hold that right under domestic law and (2) the Tribunal's conclusions that Vestey acquired property rights under Venezuelan law through registered contracts of purchase and through acquisitive prescription.\n\n209.\n\nThe Committee does not find in the Award the \"creation\" by the Tribunal of property rights that Venezuela advances as the basis of a contradiction in reasoning. Instead, as previously noted by the Committee, the Tribunal stated clearly that such rights as exist must be founded on domestic law. It then set out the reasons why, in its view, Vestey had those rights under Venezuelan law, as a consequence of registered title or, in the alternative, acquisitive prescription.220 Venezuela evidently regards the Tribunal's conclusions on Venezuelan law to be incorrect, but that is not a basis for an annulment.\n\nSee *supra*, paras. 129-138.\n\n210.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that Point (B) does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (1)(e) of ICSID Convention Article 52.\n\n**C.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal failed to provide the reasons for its \"theory that the registration of a deed of title that has not been annulled implies the acquisition of a valid property right over land.\"221\n\nMemorial, para. 166.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal also failed to \"justify why, being an international arbitral tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention, it could determine the occurrence of acquisitive prescription in favour of Vestey, despite the fact that the Venezuelan law rules cited and regarded by the Tribunal as applicable undoubtedly require that a domestic court issue a final decision for property rights to be considered acquired by acquisitive prescription.\"222 According to the Applicant, it is not possible to understand how the Tribunal concluded that Vestey had acquired ownership of the land through acquisitive prescription considering that a judge (and, *a fortiori*, an arbitrator) cannot address acquisitive prescription on his or her own initiative and that Vestey did not obtain (or attempt to obtain) a court declaration of acquisitive prescription regarding any of the farms at issue.223\n\nMemorial, para. 166.\n\nMemorial, para. 200.\n\n213.\n\nThe Applicant contends that there is a contradiction between the Tribunal's conclusion that Vestey had acquired the land by acquisitive prescription and the Tribunal's premises \"(a) that under Venezuelan law there are strict rules for the acquisition of property, (b) that Article 1956 of the Venezuelan Civil Code provides that no court \u2014let alone an arbitral tribunal\u2014 can compensate, on its own initiative, for the parties' failure to raise the issue of acquisitive prescription, and (c) that Vestey did not have a court declare that acquisitive prescription had taken place nor did it try to obtain such a declaration from the competent local authorities with respect to the land that is the subject matter of the dispute submitted to arbitration.\"224 In particular with regard to the stringent legal conditions necessary for acquisitive prescription provided for in Article 690 in the Civil Code of Procedure, Venezuela contends that the Tribunal entirely disregarded those requirements, including the need to assert acquisitive prescription before Venezuelan courts by the interested party. Furthermore, the Tribunal acknowledged that Vestey invoked acquisitive prescription before Venezuelan courts regarding a farm that is no longer part of the dispute. According to Venezuela, this admission contradicts the Tribunal's finding that it was not possible for a title-holder to initiate this action. It also contradicts the Tribunal's finding that the proceeding was merely declaratory, given that the court ultimately rejected Vestey's submission.225\n\nReply, paras. 186-187.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 58-63.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nVestey rejects the allegation that the Tribunal advanced a theory according to which the registration of a deed of title that had not been annulled implied the acquisition of a valid property right over land. To the contrary, Vestey explains that the Tribunal expressly stated that registration was not an independent mode of acquisition of property.226\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 127.\n\n215.\n\nRegarding acquisitive prescription, Vestey contends that this request must be dismissed because \"the Tribunal did offer a reasoned and structured analysis on this point (however much Venezuela may disagree with it).\" In particular, the Tribunal found (on a subsidiary basis) that Vestey had acquired ownership by acquisitive prescription because the \"strict conditions\" under Venezuelan law had been met, which did not include a judicial declaration or a requirement that acquisitive prescription be invoked before any court or authority or otherwise to inform third parties.227\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 128-130; Rejoinder, para. 101(b).\n\n216.\n\nIn any event, even if there was a deficiency in the Tribunal's reasoning concerning acquisitive prescription, any such deficiency would not affect the Tribunal's primary basis to conclude that Vestey had valid title to the land, namely its holding valid registered titles.228\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 131; Rejoinder, para. 101(b).\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe Committee understands Point (C) to be an objection that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its two conclusions with respect to title (*i.e.*, its decision that Vestey had title to the land based on the presumption of validity for registered title and its decision on acquisitive prescription).\n\n218.\n\nThe Committee finds a clear statement of the Tribunal's reasons in the Award, summarized above. Contrary to Venezuela's contention, the Award does not state that Vestey acquired title through registration. It specifies that a contract for transfer of property was an uncontroversial mode of transferring property and that, unless registration of title is invalidated through means established by law, registration of title requires the Tribunal to presume the validity of that title.229\n\nAward, para. 268.\n\n219.\n\nAs to acquisitive prescription, the Committee considers that the asserted contradiction between the reasoning that the Award sets out in support of the Tribunal's conclusion and the alternative reasoning that Venezuela advances is in fact a reflection of Venezuela's disagreement with the Tribunal's conclusions regarding Venezuelan law. Review of the correctness of the Tribunal's conclusions is beyond the scope of an annulment proceeding.\n\n220.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that Point (C) does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (1)(e) of ICSID Convention Article 52.\n\n**D.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n221.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal found that Vestey had acquired ownership of the land as a result of Venezuela's failure to challenge its registered title, \"which is to say that Vestey acquired ownership of the land by estoppel.\" This finding of the Tribunal is contradicted by the Tribunal's statement that ownership of land cannot be acquired by estoppel under Venezuelan law. The fact that the Tribunal relies on a \"presumption\" of validity of an unchallenged registered title does not correct the contradiction because, for an un-rebutted presumption to result in the registered titles being sufficient to prove the existence of property rights, it would have to be possible to acquire property rights \"by virtue of an omission,\" which is what the Tribunal had stated could not happen under Venezuelan law.230\n\nMemorial, paras. 197-199.\n\n222.\n\nThe Applicant accepts that the Tribunal did not expressly declare in the Award that property rights had been acquired by estoppel. According to the Applicant, however, the Tribunal asserted that Vestey had acquired property rights as a result of an omission, namely Venezuela's alleged failure to timely challenge the registered title. The assertion that property rights have been acquired \"on the basis of one of the parties' acts or omissions\" constitutes \"a concept known as estoppel,\" which means that the Tribunal's assertion is equivalent to a declaration that Vestey had acquired ownership of the land by estoppel, thus contradicting the Tribunal's position that Venezuela's law does not allow for the acquisition of property by estoppel.231\n\nReply, paras. 182-185.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nVestey contends that there is no contradiction, as there is no finding in the Award that Vestey acquired ownership of the land by estoppel or as a result of a failure by Venezuela to challenge Vestey's registered titles. What the Tribunal found was that, in the absence of a successful challenge to those titles, Venezuelan law required the Tribunal to presume their validity.232\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 125; Rejoinder, para. 101(a).\n\n224.\n\nAccording to Vestey, Venezuela conflates the issues of acquisition of property (through the contracts for the transfer of property that underlie the registration) and proof of ownership (through the registration of a title that has not been legally invalidated) in an attempt to establish a contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning. Venezuela does so despite the Tribunal's efforts to explain that it was not holding that ownership had been acquired by holding a registered title, but rather that the validity of the contract by which ownership had been acquired had to be presumed as a result of holding a registered title.233\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 126-127.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nVenezuela recognizes that the Tribunal did not expressly rely on estoppel when it found that Vestey had valid title to the land at issue, but maintains nonetheless that the Tribunal's conclusion that Vestey had acquired title based on a Party's acts or omissions was equivalent to a conclusion that Vestey had acquired title through estoppel. This conclusion, according to Venezuela, contradicted the Tribunal's statement that property rights cannot be established through estoppel.\n\n226.\n\nContrary to the Applicant's assertion, the Tribunal did not conclude that Vestey had acquired ownership of land as a result of Venezuela's alleged failure to challenge title (which the Applicant equates with the acquisition of ownership by estoppel).234 Instead, the Award states the Tribunal's agreement with Venezuela's contention that registration was not a means of acquiring title and that a contract was an independent means of transferring property. It then sets out the Tribunal's conclusion that registration creates a presumption that the act underlying the registration is valid and that, unless a property right has been invalidated through the means established by law, third parties, including the Tribunal, must presume the validity of the registered title.235 This conclusion as to Vestey's ownership of the land is based on the Tribunal's application of cited provisions of Venezuelan law. There is no contradiction between this reasoning and the Tribunal's observation that property rights cannot be established through estoppel.\n\nMemorial, para. 197.\n\nAward, paras. 267-268.\n\n227.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that Point (C) does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (1)(e) of ICSID Convention Article 52.\n\n**E.

Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n228.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, \"the Republic proved that the deeds of title submitted by Vestey did not refer to the land claimed,\" \"Vestey was forced to admit that 'the titles on the record are not a reliable source of information of the actual size of the land'\" and \"the Tribunal expressly acknowledged that the deeds of title submitted by Vestey did not match the size of the land claimed.\"236\n\nMemorial, paras. 207-209.\n\n229.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the Tribunal found that Vestey had demonstrated its legal title in respect of a large portion of the area claimed. The Applicant contends that the Tribunal did not indicate the reasons why it regarded as valid the information provided by Vestey in its first post-hearing brief regarding the surface area of the titles despite \"the errors and the false and inaccurate data contained therein\" when compared to the titles. The Tribunal's inconsistency is, according to the Applicant, \"manifest and easily verifiable\" by simply reading the information contained in the table attached to Vestey's first post-hearing brief and comparing it to the deeds of title of the farms. As an example, the Applicant refers to the El Carmen Farm.237\n\nMemorial, paras. 210-214; Reply, paras. 199-206.\n\n230.\n\nThe Applicant rejects Vestey's contentions according to which (first) the Tribunal found that the discrepancies did not affect the existence or validity of the deeds of title, (second) the Tribunal's reasoning is apparent from a simple review of the deeds, including El Carmen Farm, (third) the Tribunal has no obligation to consider each and every argument and, (fourth) in any event, the Tribunal implicitly rejected Venezuela's allegations.238\n\nReply, paras. 207-208.\n\n231.\n\nRegarding the first of Vestey's arguments, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal's assertion that any discrepancies may be relevant for valuation purposes but have no bearing on the existence or validity of the titles because \"the physical defining features and names of the registered plots coincide with those claimed by Vestey\" is \"[simply] false, is not supported by any documents and the Tribunal has not stated reasons therefor.\"239 The fact that Venezuela did not refer to those defining features during the Original Proceeding \"is not sufficient reason to regard them as valid\" given that, as of today, the Applicant still does not know exactly which defining features were relied on by the Tribunal and could not have anticipated that the Tribunal would rely on unidentified features of the land to confirm Vestey's ownership.240\n\nReply, paras. 209-210.\n\nReply, para. 215.\n\n232.\n\nRegarding the second of Vestey's arguments, the Applicant contends that Vestey's citation of the deed containing the alleged defining features and names of the El Carmen Farm actually shows that the surface area is indeterminate and that the alleged defining features and names are inaccurate, ridiculous and insufficient to reveal the Tribunal's reasoning. Moreover, the deed of title to the El Carmen Farm states that the surface area had not been ascertained and would be determined later by appropriate means, which confirms the undetermined size of the farm. The Applicant maintains that neither the title nor the footnoted references provided by Vestey in the table annexed to its first post-hearing brief are sufficient to conclude that the farm is either 5,106 or 4,644.21 hectares. Vestey itself confirmed that the measurements were indicative and subject to verification and, in the Original Proceeding, Vestey's expert admitted to the differences in surface areas amongst the documents submitted and stated that she had relied on the information provided by her employer for the purposes of her expert testimony and that the inaccuracies in surface areas also extended to Matapalos, Morichito, Los Cocos, Los Viejitos, La Bendici\u00f3n Ramera, Turagua, Punta de Mata, Las Palmeras, Ca\u00f1af\u00edstolo and La Cueva.241\n\nReply, paras. 218-239.\n\n233.\n\nRegarding the third and fourth of Vestey's arguments, the Applicant contends that a tribunal has an obligation to address an argument put forward by a party \"when the argument in question is the cornerstone of the case.\" In any event, the reasons supporting the Tribunal's conclusions \"are not obvious and cannot be inferred from a simple review of the case file.\" In particular, a review would only reveal that no willing buyer would have considered the documents containing the references and descriptions as reliable to determine the surface area of the farms. According to the Applicant, the Tribunal's simple statement that \"the physical defining features and names of registered plots coincide with those claimed by Vestey\" is insufficient to explain why it regarded Vestey's measurements as valid in circumstances where their inaccuracies had been demonstrated and confirmed and where the Tribunal did not explain which physical features were being relied on for this purpose. This lack of reasoning not only fails \"to guarantee that the tribunal's decision was not arbitrary\" but it also affects the Applicant's right of defense. The Tribunal awarding compensation based on the lesser of the land surface area is also insufficient without specifying the particular hectares in respect to which expropriation was being compensated.242\n\nReply, paras. 234-242.\n\n234.\n\nThe Applicant maintains that it is contradictory to determine the existence and valuation of property whose delimitation the Tribunal had acknowledged could not be ascertained.243 In addition, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal's decision is \"manifestly contradictory\" given that the Tribunal awarded compensation for land which surface area is not included in the deeds of title after having found that \"only the surface area figuring in the title documents is compensable.\"244 In general, \"the absence of coherent and adequate reasoning\" to understand why the Tribunal validated the surface area claimed by Vestey, together with all of the above constitutes, according to the Applicant, \"clear grounds for annulment in accordance with Article 52(1)(e) by which the Committee should abide.\"245\n\nMemorial, paras. 224, 226.\n\nMemorial, para. 216.\n\nMemorial, para. 217; Reply, para. 243.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nRegarding the allegedly unexplained determination that compensable property rights validly exist despite the lack of identity between the land claimed and the land documented, Vestey explains that the Tribunal addressed this matter expressly in the Award and found that there was a correspondence in essence between the documented and the claimed land, such that the observed discrepancies did not affect the existence or validity of Vestey's property rights over the land. Because the Tribunal did find that the registered titles identified the land claimed, the Tribunal \"did not contradict itself when proceeding to assess compensation for the land.\"246\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 139-140; Rejoinder, paras. 106-109.\n\n236.\n\nAccording to Vestey, Venezuela's main issue seems to be with the reason for the Tribunal's conclusion that there was no lack of identity of the land, namely that \"the physical defining features and names of the registered plots coincide with those claimed by Vestey,\" which Venezuela considers to be \"false\" and unsupported by evidence or reasoning. \"Venezuela's allegation that the Tribunal's conclusions [are] false is a complaint that the Tribunal incorrectly appreciated the evidence and is not subject to annulment review.\" Vestey also submits that the lack of references to underlying documents would in any event not be grounds for annulment, and neither would the Tribunal's decision not to provide reasons for what is already a reason in support of its conclusion. Vestey finds it unsurprising that the Tribunal did not feel the need to provide an extensive elaboration on the identity of the plots based on their defining features or names, seeing as Venezuela's argument in the arbitration on this issue was based on the discrepancies in surface areas and not on any discrepancies in defining features or names.247\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 141-142; Rejoinder, paras. 106-109.\n\n237.\n\nVestey submits that, in any event, the Tribunal did cite to the relevant documents, in that its references to \"registry extracts\" and \"registered plots\" were referencing the title documents filed by Vestey as evidence in support of its claim. According to Vestey, a simple review of these titles reveals the reasons for the Tribunal's conclusion on this issue, including in relation to the El Carmen Farm on which Venezuela relied. This claim must therefore be dismissed.248 During the hearing, Vestey noted that Venezuela had made new arguments at the hearing concerning failure to state reasons based on the physical defining features and names of the registered plots and whether they coincided with those claimed. Vestey rejects those allegations on the merits but, in any event, contends that this is an issue of valuation of the evidence undertaken by the Tribunal that cannot be revised on annulment.249\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 143-145; Rejoinder, paras. 106-109.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pp. 274-281.\n\n238.\n\nRegarding Venezuela's claim of failure to give reasons for the Tribunal's decision on compensation for the land, Vestey contends that it must also be rejected because the Tribunal did give reasons for its decision to compensate only the lesser of the documented and the claimed surface areas, namely that a willing buyer would have refused to pay for land that did not appear in the registered titles. Vestey explains how Venezuela considers that, for this purpose, the Tribunal blindly adopted the figures provided in Vestey's table and did not address Venezuela's arguments concerning their lack of reliability. According to Vestey, failure to address each and every argument put forward by the Parties is not a ground for annulment. In any event, it is clear that the Tribunal implicitly rejected Venezuela's arguments on the lack of reliability of the figures when it confirmed that the surface areas in the titles were largely as set out in Vestey's table for every farm, including El Carmen. A simple review of the footnotes accompanying the table reveals that the figures originated in the title documents, and a simple reading of the title documents reveals exactly where the components of the surface area figures came from. In light of the above, this claim must equally be dismissed.250\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 146-151; Rejoinder, paras. 110-112.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nAs previously noted, the Tribunal decided that discrepancies between the area of a particular farm indicated in the registered title and the area of that farm claimed by Vestey did not affect the validity of title, but could be relevant for valuation purposes. It further noted that the outcome \"could have been different if the registry extracts made reference to land plots different from those claimed by the Claimant. However, in this instance, the physical defining features and names of the registered plots coincide with those claimed by Vestey.\"251\n\nAward, para. 275.\n\n240.\n\nVenezuela objects that the Award does not set out details to support its conclusion that the physical features identified in registered deeds coincided with the descriptions of plots claimed by Vestey. It asserts the Tribunal's conclusion on this point was \"false.\"252 Venezuela acknowledges that it did not raise discrepancies in physical features in the Original Proceeding but states that it did not know that the Tribunal was going to rely on those features in the Award.\n\nReply, para. 210.\n\n241.\n\nIn the Committee's view, the Award states the reasoning that led the Tribunal to find sufficient correspondence between the registered plots and the plots claimed by Vestey, based on the evidence before it. Venezuela's complaint that the Tribunal did not elaborate on the details that led to its reasoning are, in the view of the Committee, an unpersuasive insistence that the Tribunal provide not only the reasons for its decisions regarding title, but also the \"reasons for its reasons.\"253\n\nSee *supra*, para. 92.\n\n242.\n\nIn the annulment proceeding, the Parties presented excerpts from evidence presented in the Original Proceeding that included the names or the physical features, both as claimed by Vestey and as recorded in registered title deeds, including evidence with respect to the El Carmen Farm. Not surprisingly, Vestey sought to convince the Committee of the consistency of the descriptions, while Venezuela sought to identify discrepancies. It is not for this Committee to conduct its own weighing of such evidence in this annulment proceeding. It is sufficient to observe that the record presented to the Committee demonstrates that the Tribunal had ample opportunity to compare the registered title documents to the physical features of the land claimed by Vestey and that it stated its conclusion that the physical defining features and the registered deeds coincided when giving the reasons for its conclusion as to the title to the land.\n\n243.\n\nAt the stage of valuation, the Award returned to the discrepancies between claimed area and area shown in registered title, observing that a willing buyer would not be expected to pay for surfaces that do not appear in the registered title. The Award includes a table showing, for each farm, both the claimed area and the documented area. The Tribunal designated as the \"compensable area\" for each farm the lesser of these two figures. The Tribunal used the total compensable area, calculated on this basis, in determining the fair market value of the land.254\n\nAward, paras. 369-371.\n\n244.\n\nThus, the Tribunal set out the reasoning on which it based the surface area of each farm that it used for purposes of valuation. Although the Award does not set out evidence that led the Tribunal to adopt the figures that it presented as the claimed area and the documented area for each farm, the Parties placed before the Committee extensive documentation from the Original Proceeding that revealed the kind of evidence that had been available to the Tribunal. There is no basis for the Committee to form its own conclusions with respect to that evidence in this annulment proceeding. It is sufficient to conclude that the Award, on the basis of the record before the Tribunal, stated the reasons for the Tribunal's conclusions regarding the compensable area that it used for purposes of valuation, *i.e.*, the lesser of the claimed area and the documented area for each farm.\n\n245.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that Point (E) does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (1)(e) of ICSID Convention Article 52.\n\n**F. D****ifferent** **I****nferences** **D****rawn from a** **P****arty****'****s** **F****ailure TO** **A****ct** **D****epending on W****hich** **P****arty** **B****enefitted from those** **I****nferences**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Applicant contends that there is a contradiction in the Tribunal's different application of the same approach \"depending on whether the resulting decision favoured Vestey or the Republic.\" In particular, the Tribunal determined that \"the Republic's failure to challenge the deeds of title before the competent local authorities was sufficient to validate Vestey's position and that the Republic could not challenge such deeds of title now in the international arbitration.\" By contrast, the Tribunal determined that \"Vestey's failure to raise such issue before the competent local authorities was not necessary in order to establish that it had occurred, and that it was admissible to grant property rights [\u2026] even if the defence had been raised for the first time in the context of this international arbitration.\"255\n\nMemorial, paras. 201-203.\n\n247.\n\nThe Applicant rejects Vestey's argument that the above constitutes a straightforward application by the Tribunal of Venezuelan law. In particular, to the extent an obligation to show a perfect chain of title to establish ownership existed under Venezuelan law, Venezuela never triggered it, and there is no requirement under Venezuelan law to invoke acquisitive prescription before a local court in order to declare its existence such that Vestey's failure to invoke it was not relevant.256\n\nReply, paras. 188-190.\n\n248.\n\nRegarding the perfect chain of title argument, Venezuela contends that Vestey's argument is factually incorrect since \"the Republic asked Vestey, more than once, for proof of the complete chain of title.\" In addition, the Tribunal's decision that Venezuela's failure to challenge the chain of title was sufficient to validate Vestey's position that establishing a chain of title was unnecessary contradicts the Tribunal's acceptance that a defect in the chain of tittle affects all subsequent transactions.257\n\nReply, para. 191.\n\n249.\n\nRegarding the need to have acquisitive prescription declared by a court, Venezuela maintains that a court declaration is required and that \"this was acknowledged by the Tribunal itself\" when it established that \"a legal process [is required] to formally declare that acquisition has validly occurred.\"258\n\nReply, para. 192, fn. 248.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nVestey contends that there is no contradiction between holding that, to the extent that an obligation to show a perfect chain of title exists, Venezuela never triggered it (accordingly, Venezuela's failure to trigger this requirement was relevant to its applicability) and holding that Venezuelan law does not require an interested party to invoke acquisitive prescription before a local court or authority to establish its existence (accordingly, Vestey's failure to invoke acquisitive prescription was irrelevant to its existence).259\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 132-133; Rejoinder, para. 101(c).\n\n251.\n\nAny such contradiction would not be in the Tribunal's reasoning, but would exist under Venezuelan law. Even in this case, such a contradiction would not affect the Tribunal's reasoning, since the Tribunal recognized \"that the existing solution represented a solution adopted by *Venezuelan law itself*, balancing the principle that no person can transfer more rights than he or she holds against the practical need for legal certainty in property transactions.\" Vestey submits that this finding is not open to annulment.260\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 134 (emphasis in original); Rejoinder, para. 101(c).\n\n252.\n\nVestey further contends that the Committee must disregard Venezuela's \"unwarranted\" remarks that the Tribunal's conclusions show any kind of inequality, which Venezuela would have brought under Article 52(1)(b) or (d) of the ICSID Convention if it had \"real reason to question the impartiality of the Tribunal,\" which Venezuela has not done.261\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 135.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nVenezuela asserts a contradiction between two conclusions that the Tribunal reached in the Award, based on what it describes as inferences that the Tribunal drew from a party's \"failure to act,\" suggesting that an inference favorable to Vestey was made, but an inference favorable to Venezuela was rejected. The purported contradiction overlooks the fact that the two cited portions of the Award address distinct questions arising under different provisions of Venezuelan law. Even assuming that the reasoning of the Tribunal is fairly characterized as two instances in which it drew an inference from a Party's failure to act, these inferences are independent of each other and the consequence of each inference necessarily depends on the particular legal question to which the inference is relevant. The conclusions reached by the Tribunal with respect to distinct questions arising under Venezuelan law cannot be described as contradictory reasoning.\n\n254.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that Point (F) does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (1)(e) of ICSID Convention Article 52.\n\n255.\n\nHaving examined the six points that Venezuela invokes in support of its assertion that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based, the Committee rejects that ground for annulment.\n\n**VIII. THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nOn the basis of the above analysis, the Committee finds no basis to annul the Award pursuant to subparagraphs (b), (d) or (e) of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Applicant contends that there is no presumption in the ICSID Convention, the Arbitration Rules or the BIT to determine costs allocation, nor are there any \"specific guidelines.\" In these circumstances, the practice has been for committees to make no order as to the parties' own costs, and to have both parties share the committee's and ICSID's costs regardless of the success of the annulment application.262 However, some *ad hoc* committees have awarded costs to the winning party, and other committees have taken into account the conduct of the parties as well as \"the substance of the case and the arguments invoked.\"263\n\nApplicant's costs submission, paras. 1-2, relying on C.H. Schreuer, para. 133.\n\nApplicant's costs submission, para. 3, relying *inter alia* on *Sempra v. Argentina*, paras. 225, 227; and *Iberdrola Energia S.A. v. Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/5), Decision on Annulment, 13 January 2015, para. 146.\n\n258.\n\nIn this particular case, the Applicant argues that all costs, including the Applicant's legal fees and expenses, should be borne by Vestey, with interest, pursuant to the criterion that costs follow the event and taking into account Vestey's conduct throughout the annulment proceeding.264 Regarding the latter, the Applicant contends that Vestey made false representations intended to mislead the Tribunal and has continued this conduct during the annulment proceeding by pointing to a supposed correlation between the property titles and the land claimed that does not stand scrutiny. The Applicant further contends that Vestey developed a position on acquisitive prescription during the annulment proceeding that contradicts its own position during the original arbitration.265\n\nApplicant's costs submission, paras. 4-6, 15.\n\nApplicant's costs submission, para. 5.\n\n259.\n\nAlternatively, in the event that the Award is not annulled, the Applicant contends that each Party should bear its own costs and that the costs of the proceeding should be shared.266 According to the Applicant, there is no reason to deviate from this practice given that Vestey has not shown that the Applicant did not have sufficiently serious reasons to challenge the Award, that its arguments were frivolous or that its case clearly lacked merit. The Applicant further contends that Vestey has no reason to allege that the Applicant has acted in bad faith in this post-award proceeding. Finally, concerning the argument that the Applicant brings annulment proceedings as a matter of routine, the Applicant contends that it cannot be burdened with costs for exercising a right under the Convention and that the Committee cannot award costs to discourage parties from bringing future annulment proceedings.267\n\nApplicant's costs submission, paras. 7, 15.\n\nApplicant's costs submission, paras. 9-10.\n\n260.\n\nEven if the Applicant were to bear the costs of the proceeding, Venezuela contends that Vestey should still bear its own legal costs pursuant to the practice resulting from previous annulment decisions.268\n\nApplicant's costs submission, para. 11, relying on *EDF v. Argentina*, para. 339.\n\n261.\n\nIn particular, the Applicant requests that (i) Vestey be ordered to bear all costs of the proceeding, including the arbitration costs at US$524,985.00 (in the amount advanced to the Centre) and the Applicant's legal fees and expenses amounting to US$1,746,566.98, plus interest \"calculated at a simple rate which fully compensates the damage sustained from the date of the decision\" and, subsidiarily, that (ii) Vestey be ordered to reimburse the Applicant for \"half of the administrative costs of these annulment proceedings, including fees and expenses of members of the Committee\" amounting to US$262,492.5.269\n\nApplicant's supplementary costs submission, p. 2.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nVestey requests that the Committee order the Applicant to bear Vestey's costs in their entirety, plus interest until the date of payment. Vestey contends that annulment committees have commonly and increasingly relied on the \"loser pays\" principle, which should only be displaced when the winning party has committed some wrongdoing.270 The principle applies particularly, though not necessarily, \"where the application was 'clearly without merit', was 'to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed', or failed to 'pose novel or complex questions' or to raise 'valid' arguments.\"271\n\nRespondent's costs submission, paras. 1, 4, 7, relying *inter alia* on *Venoklim Holding B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/22), Decision on the Application for Annulment, 2 February 2018, paras. 293-294; and *Repsol v. Ecuador*, para. 88.\n\nRespondent's costs submission, para. 5, relying *inter alia* on *AES v. Hungary*, para. 181; *CDC Group PLC v. Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, 29 June 2005, para. 89; and *Repsol v. Ecuador*, para. 86.\n\n263.\n\nIn addition, according to Vestey, the role of an award of costs in furthering the Convention's objective of finality has also been recognized by annulment Committees. In this sense, Vestey contends that \"when the remedy is available as of right, the allocation of costs is the only check the system has placed on serial misusers of annulment\" who bring annulment proceedings routinely or for dilatory purposes.272\n\nRespondent's costs submission, para. 6, referencing Counter-Memorial, para. 176, and relying *inter alia* on *Repsol v. Ecuador*, para. 86.\n\n264.\n\nIn accordance with the above, Vestey should be awarded the entirety of its annulment costs if it succeeds on the merits, which is particularly warranted in this case because Vestey has demonstrated that the application for annulment is clearly without merit, lacking in valid arguments and most unlikely to succeed.273 This result is also supported by the Applicant's conduct during the annulment proceeding, and would serve to discourage future meritless annulment applications submitted in order to delay or obstruct immediate enforcement.274 Concerning the Applicant's conduct, the Respondent contends that the Republic \"failed to pursue the process with reasonable diligence\" delaying its conclusion and increasing costs \"by twice causing the process to be suspended on account of its failure to pay the advance costs for which the Applicant is responsible.\"275\n\nRespondent's costs submission, paras. 8-9.\n\nRespondent's costs submission, paras. 8, 10.\n\nRespondent's costs submission, para. 11.\n\n265.\n\nIn particular, Vestey seeks reimbursement of its legal fees and expenses in the amount of \u00a3685,849.15 as well as interest on this sum \"[i]n order to be made whole\" at the rate applicable to six-month US sovereign bonds, compounded semi-annually from the date of its costs submissions and until the date of payment. Vestey also requests that the Committee award any other relief it may deem appropriate.276\n\nRespondent's supplementary costs submission, paras. 13-14.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied to an annulment proceeding, *mutatis mutandis*, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 53), give an *ad hoc* committee the discretion to allocate as it deems appropriate all costs, including the costs of the proceedings (a committee's fees and expenses, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses) as well as the costs and expenses of the parties.\n\n267.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding are as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Committee's fees and expenses |\n| Judge Joan E. Donoghue | US$84,606.50 |\n| Dr. Gavan Griffith | US$74,145.15 |\n| Dr. Ra\u00ebd M. Fathallah | US$71,910.05 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | US$116,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | US$71,353.87 |\n| Total | US$418,015.57 |\n\n268.\n\nVenezuela, as the Applicant on Annulment, has been responsible for advance payments, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e). The above costs have been paid out of those advance payments. Any balance that remains will be refunded to the Applicant.\n\n269.\n\nVenezuela's failure to make advance payments in a timely manner led the Committee to suspend the proceedings twice, causing the cancellation of the scheduled hearing dates and the consequent delay in the issuance of a decision on annulment.\n\n270.\n\nTaking into account the Parties' cost submissions and having considered the additional details provided in their supplemental cost submissions, the Committee has no reason to question the reasonableness of the fees and expenses submitted by either Party.\n\n271.\n\nVenezuela has not prevailed on any of the grounds for annulment that it advanced. Taking into account the outcome of the annulment proceeding and the conduct of the Parties during the course of the proceeding, the Committee considers it appropriate in this case to follow the approach of \"cost follows the event,\" and thus decides that Venezuela should bear all of the costs of the proceeding, amounting to US$418,015.57, as well as Vestey's fees and expenses, amounting to \u00a3685,849.15 The Committee notes that it finds no merit in Venezuela's assertion that Vestey made false statements intended to mislead the Tribunal.\n\n272.\n\nThe Committee makes no award of interest in relation to costs.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n273.\n\nOn 17 April 2019, the President of the Committee wrote to the Secretary-General as follows:\n\n*Dear Madam Secretary-General,*\n\n*On 8 February 2019, after the ad hoc Committee had concluded its substantive work on the Decision in Vestey Group Ltd v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4), this annulment proceeding was declared closed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38, as is indicated on the ICSID website. The Secretary has informed the Committee that the final technical review and translation of the Decision is nearly complete.*\n\n*Subsequent to closure of the proceeding, the Centre informed the Committee that it had received communications from two individuals, each asserting the sole right to represent the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in proceedings before ICSID. Those communications are not part of the record in this proceeding.*\n\n*Having finalized this Decision on Annulment, the Committee considers that its work is complete. The Parties to this proceeding are the Vestey Group Ltd and a State, i.e., the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The two above-mentioned communications do not purport to change the identity of a Party. It is not for this Committee to take a position in respect of matters addressed in the above-referenced communications.*\n\n*The Award ordered the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to pay compensation to the Vestey Group Ltd. Pursuant to Article 53 of the Convention, the Award is binding on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and is not subject to any appeal or other remedy except as provided by the Convention. The Decision of this Committee rejects all grounds for annulment. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the Centre to render this Decision on Annulment promptly.*\n\n**X. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n274.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee decides:\n\n1. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela's Application for Annulment of the Award is dismissed in its entirety;\n\n2. The Applicant shall bear the costs of this annulment proceeding in the amount of US$418,015.57;\n\n3. The Applicant is ordered to pay the Respondent's fees and expenses of \u00a3685,849.15."}]}
