INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in this arbitration is Bear Creek Mining Corporation (\"Bear Creek\"), a company incorporated under the laws of Canada, with its headquarters located at 625 Howe Street, Suite 1050, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T5. The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by:\n\nMr. Henry G. Burnett, King & Spalding LLP  \nMr. Roberto J. Aguirre-Luzi, King & Spalding LLP  \nMs. Caline Mouawad, King & Spalding LLP  \nMr. Fernando Rodriguez-Cortina, King & Spalding LLP  \nMr. Louis-Alexis Bret, King & Spalding LLP  \nMs. Margrete Stevens, King & Spalding LLP  \nAlberto Delgado Venegas, Miranda & Amado Abogados  \nCristina Ferraro Delgado, Miranda & Amado Abogados\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent in this arbitration is the Republic of Peru (\"Peru\"), a sovereign state with an address for service as Dr. Carlos Jos\u00e9 Valderrama Bernal, President, Special Commission Representing the Republic of Peru in International Investment Disputes, Ministry of Economy and Finance of Peru, Jir\u00f3n Lampa 277 - Fifth Floor, Lima, Peru. The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by:\n\nMr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Sidley Austin LLP  \nMs. Marinn Carlson, Sidley Austin LLP  \nMs. Jennifer Haworth McCandless, Sidley Austin LLP  \nMs. Mar\u00eda Carolina Dur\u00e1n, Sidley Austin LLP  \nDr. Juan Pazos Battistini, Estudio Navarro, Ferrero & Pazos Abogados  \nMr. Ricardo Puccio Sala, Estudio Navarro, Ferrero & Pazos Abogados\n\n3.\n\nThe Parties' dispute concerns Claimant's alleged investments in Peru, including the Santa Ana silver mining project and the alleged associated legal and contractual rights. The Claimant contends that Respondent has failed to afford Claimant's alleged investment in Peru the protections guaranteed in the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Peru (\"FTA\").1 The Respondent contests the Tribunal's jurisdiction and argues that the Claimant's claims are unfounded on the merits.2\n\nRfA para. 2.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 18, note 37.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY RELATED TO CLAIMANT'S APPLICATION FOR PROVISIONAL MEASURES**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn January 9, 2015, Claimant filed Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures with the Tribunal (\"C.Prov.M.-I\").\n\n5.\n\nThe First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal was held on January 12, 2015. During this session, the President referred procedurally to Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures and invited the Parties to propose a procedural schedule. The Parties agreed that Respondent would file a response on February 6, 2015, and that this response would be followed by a second round of submissions, with Claimant's observations to be filed on February 20, 2015 and Respondent's rebuttal on March 6, 2015.\n\n6.\n\nOn January 14, 2015, the Tribunal Secretary, on behalf of the Tribunal, emailed the Parties the the procedural schedule, as agreed by the Parties during the First Session.\n\n7.\n\nOn January 27, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO-1\"), which contains a summary of the Parties' discussions at the First Session related to the procedural aspects of Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n8.\n\nOn February 6, 2015, Respondent filed Respondent's Response to Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (\"R.Prov.M.-I\").\n\n9.\n\nOn February 20, 2015, Claimant filed Claimant's Observations to Peru's Response to the Request for Provisional Measures (\"C.Prov.M.-II\").\n\n10.\n\nOn March 6, 2015, Respondent filed Respondent's Rejoinder on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (\"R.Prov.M.-II\").\n\n11.\n\nOn March 27, 2015, pursuant to section 11.4 of PO-1, Respondent filed English translations of its exhibits R-006 to R-009.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT'S REQUESTS**\n------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, Claimant requested that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\na. Declare that Peru has violated the FTA and international law in connection with its treatment of Bear Creek and Bear Creek's investment;\n\nb. Award Bear Creek full restitution or the monetary equivalent of all damages, including historical, moral, and consequential damages, it suffered due to Peru's breaches of its FTA obligations, in an amount to be determined based upon the evidence;\n\nc. Order Peru to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration, including ICSID's administrative fees, the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal, the fees and expenses of Bear Creek's legal representatives in respect of this arbitration, and any other costs of this arbitration;\n\nd. Award Bear Creek pre-award and post-award compound interest on any restitutory or compensatory amounts until the date of full satisfaction of the Final Award, at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal in accordance with the FTA; and\n\ne. Grant any other and further relief that it deems just and proper.3\n\nRfA para. 75.\n\n13.\n\nIn Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures and in Claimant's Observations to Peru's Response to the Request for Provisional Measures, the Claimant made the following request:\n\n[\u2026] Claimant Bear Creek respectfully requests that the Tribunal issue interim measures ordering Peru to stay the MINEM Lawsuit while this arbitration is pending.4\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 50; C.Prov.M.-II para. 44.\n\n14.\n\nIn Claimant's Observations to Peru's Response to the Request for Provisional Measures, the Claimant made the following additional request:\n\n[\u2026] If the Tribunal were to deny Bear Creek's request for provisional measures, Bear Creek requests the Tribunal to confirm that Bear Creek's continued defense against Peru's claims against Bear Creek in the MINEM Lawsuit before the Peruvian courts does not constitute a violation of the waiver requirements set forth in Article 823.1(e) of the Treaty.5\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 44.\n\n15.\n\nIn both filings, Claimant reserved the right to seek additional interim relief.6\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 50; C.Prov.M.-II para. 44.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S REQUESTS**\n--------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nFor the Republic of Peru, this case concerns the state's sovereign discretion over whether to allow foreign nationals to exploit resources in its border regions. Preliminarily, Respondent asserts that it will challenge Claimant's claims on a number of grounds, including jurisdiction, liability, and damages. Respondent may object to jurisdiction on the basis that: (1) the rights Claimant claims were not lawfully acquired, and (2) even assuming such rights were lawfully acquired, the Claimant's rights did not include exploitation, as well as exploration rights, undermining the extent of an alleged expropriation. On the merits, Respondent intends to submit arguments on public necessity, and on Claimant's activities in Peru, including its adherence to international human rights and corporate social responsibility standards. Respondent will contest Claimant's damages calculation. Respondent reserved the right to submit additional arguments.7\n\nTribunal's First Session, January 12, 2015, 25:34 \u2013 40:40.\n\n17.\n\nIn Respondent's Response to Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures and reiterated in Respondent's Rejoinder on Provisional Measures, the Respondent has requested the Tribunal to:\n\n[\u2026] deny Claimant's request for provisional measures. In the alternative, if the Tribunal decides to grant Claimant's request, Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal expressly confirm that, if the issue of the questionable validity under Peruvian law of Claimant's acquisition of the concessions is presented to it as part of the parties' jurisdictional or merits arguments, the Tribunal will hear and decide those issues [of Peruvian domestic law].8\n\nR. Prov.M.-I para. 53; R. Prov.M.-II para. 49 (adding bracketed text).\n\n**IV. INTRODUCTION TO THE TRIBUNAL'S CONSIDERATIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the extensive factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their written submissions. The Tribunal's use of one Party's terms as opposed to another's is not to be taken as a reflection of the Tribunal's legal interpretation of an issue \u2013 rather, effort has been made to use consistent terminology throughout this Procedural Order to facilitate understanding. Below, the Tribunal discusses the arguments of the Parties that it considers most relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal's reasoning addresses what the Tribunal considers to be determinative factors in deciding the disputed issues and, accordingly, the relief sought by the Parties. The Tribunal considers, however, that for purposes of clarity, a brief repetition of certain aspects of its conclusions in the context of particular issues may be necessary or appropriate.\n\n19.\n\nArticle 840 of the FTA provides:\n\nInterim Measures of Protection\n\nA Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 819 or 820. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.\n\n20.\n\nFurther, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, in accordance with general principles, the Claimant has the burden of proving that the conditions to order the requested provisional measures are fulfilled. As a preliminary observation, the Tribunal points out that the present case has two characteristics which, in combination, make it different from most other cases in which decisions on requests for provisional measures were decided. First, Claimant does not yet have ongoing factual investment activities to protect through provisional measures. Second, Art. 841 of the FTA gives a priority to awarding only monetary damages. Both charactersitics combine to establish a high threshold for the provisional measures requested by Claimant, who has the burden of proof that the conditions for ordering provisional measures are fulfilled.\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal's considerations and conclusions in this Order are reached solely in relation to the Request for Provisional Measures. They are entirely without prejudice to the later phases of this procedure regarding issues of jurisdiction and, to the extent the case reaches that stage, the merits.\n\n**V. STATEMENT OF FACTS RELATED TO THE PROVISIONAL MEASURES SOUGHT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe following factual submissions are summarized below, without prejudice to the Parties' further arguments in this matter.\n\n24.\n\nClaimant learned of the existence of potential silver ore deposits in Santa Ana, located 30 kilometers from the border between Peru and Bolivia, in 2004.9 Respondent regulates the activities of foreigners in border regions in accordance with Art. 71 of the Peruvian Constitution, which states that aliens are not permitted to \"acquire or possess under any title, directly or indirectly, mines, lands, woods, water, fuel or energy sources, whether it be individually or in partnership, under penalty of losing that so acquired right to the State\", within a distance of 50 kilometers from the border.10 A foreign national can only gain rights to natural resources in border regions where the foreign national makes a case to the Peruvian government for a \"public necessity\", which must be expressly determined by an executive decree approved by the Council of Ministers in accordance with the law.11 Claimant explains that mining rights in Peru are granted to those who first request them, thereby generating the risk that, by applying for the Supreme Decree, Claimant would alert Peruvian individuals and companies of the mineral deposits, thereby enabling them to obtain the corresponding rights before Claimant.12 In order to maximize its chances of ultimately securing the mining rights related to these deposits, Claimant agreed with Ms. Jenny Karina Villavicencio Gardini (\"Ms. Villavicencio\"), a Peruvian national and employee of Claimant, that she would secure these mineral rights while Claimant requested and until it obtained the authorization required under Art. 71 of the Peruvian Constitution.13\n\nRfA para. 11; R.Prov.M.-I para. 5.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 6.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 6.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 7, RfA para. 13.\n\nRfA para. 14; R.Prov.M.-I para. 7, First Session at 21:19 \u2013 21:36 (\"Bear Creek agreed with Ms. Karina Villavicencio, a Peruvian national and employee of Bear Creek of Peru that she would secure these mineral rights while the company requested and until it obtained the authorization required under Article 71 of the Peruvian Constitution.\"); R.Prov.M.-II para. 7.\n\n25.\n\nFrom May to November 2004, Ms. Villavicencio filed six mining petitions corresponding to the project area, in her own name.14 Thereafter, on November 17, 2004 and on September 5, 2006, Ms. Villavicencio entered into six Option Agreements with Claimant, giving Claimant the option to acquire the mining concessions if it successfully obtained all requisite authorizations to acquire them.15\n\nRfA para. 14; R.Prov.M.-I para. 9.\n\nRfA para. 14, 15.\n\n26.\n\nClaimant and Ms. Villavicencio recorded the option agreements with the Peruvian Public Registry in 2005.16 On November 7, 2005, SUNARP rendered an administrative decision confirming that the 2004 Option Agreements were valid under the Peruvian Constitution because they did not entail a transfer of legal rights until Claimant would decide to exercise its options under said agreements.17\n\nRfA para. 14; C.Prov.M.-II para. 1.\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 11.\n\n27.\n\nOn December 5, 2006, Claimant initiated the procedure to obtain the necessary mining rights for the Santa Ana Project.18 On November 29, 2007, Supreme Decree 083-2007 (\"Supreme Decree 083\") was enacted by the President and Council of Ministers of Peru. This authorized Bear Creek to acquire, own, and operate the corresponding mining concessions (the \"Karina Mining Concessions\") and to exercise rights derived from the ownership.19 Thereafter, in late 2007 or early 2008, Claimant acquired title to the mining concessions over the Santa Ana Project.20\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 5; C.Prov.M.-II para. 2; RfA para. 16.\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 4, 5; C.Prov.M.-II para. 10; RfA para. 17.\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 4, 5; C.Prov.M.-II para. 1, 10; RfA para. 17; R.Prov.M.-I para. 9.\n\n28.\n\nThe Parties dispute a number of issues, including whether: (1) Ms. Villavicencio claimed the Santa Ana concessions in her own individual capacity as a Peruvian citizen, (2) Claimant specifically disclosed the nature and extent to Ms. Villavicencio's employment when applying to the Government for the Supreme Decree required under Art. 71 of the Peruvian Constitution, (3) the option agreements that Claimant entered into with Ms. Villavicencio are legal under Peruvian law and are common place within the Peruvian mining sector, and (4) whether, because the option contracts between Claimant and Ms. Villavicencio were registered with the public registry, Peru knew that these option agreements were between Claimant and its employee.21\n\nR.Prov.M.-II para. 8; C-Prov.M.-II para. 6 - 9.\n\n29.\n\nOn December 23, 2010, Claimant submitted its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (\"ESIA\") to the Peruvian Government.22 On January 7, 2011, MINEM approved the Community Participation Plan and Executive Summary of the ESIA, and instructed Claimant to implement community participation mechanisms for the evaluation of the ESIA. MINEM conducted a final public hearing on the ESIA on February 23, 2011.23\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 4; RfA para. 21.\n\nRfA para. 21.\n\n30.\n\nOn June 1, 2011, Respondent ordered a 12-month suspension of the ESIA process for Santa Ana. Shortly thereafter, on June 25, 2011, Peru enacted Supreme Decree 032-2011-EM (\"Supreme Decree 032\"), reversing Supreme Decree 083 and the Peruvian executive's prior finding of a public necessity, thereby eliminating the legal prerequisite for Claimant's ownership of mineral concessions in the border region.24\n\nRfA para. 23; C.Prov.M.-I para. 6; R.Prov.M.-I para. 12; C.Prov.M.-II para. 113 (on May 25, 2011).\n\n31.\n\nOn July 12, 2011, Claimant filed a constitutional action of *amparo*, seeking annulment of Supreme Decree 032.25\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 6; R.Prov.M.-I para. 12; RfA para. 26.\n\n32.\n\nThereafter, in the summer of 201126, MINEM filed a civil action against Claimant and Ms. Villavicencio to invalidate three instruments: (1) the option contracts that Claimant and Ms. Villavicencio executed that ensured that Claimant would acquire the mining concessions from her, (2) the registration of those option contracts in the national public registry, and (3) the issuance of the mining concessions to Ms. Villavicencio.27 Respondent alleges that Claimant's acquisition of mineral rights by use of a proxy to maneuver around the prohibition of a foreigner's direct or indirect acquisition of such mineral rights was in violation of Art. 71 of the Peruvian Constitution.28 If found to be illegally obtained, MINEM requested that the concessions be declared as having reverted back to the Peruvian state.29\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 3, 10 (on July 14, 2011); C.Prov.M.-II para. 13 (three months after Supreme Decree 032); RfA para. 28 (on August 25, 2011).\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 10.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 10.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 10.\n\n33.\n\nOn December 27, 2012, the judge in the first instance dismissed all of MINEM's claims against Claimant because MINEM had improperly combined administrative and civil claims.30 MINEM appealed and, on June 17, 2013, the Superior Court decided to separate the claims and directed the first instance judge to proceed with MINEM's civil claims.31 Claimant appealed and, on August 6, 2013, the Supreme Court dismissed Claimant's appeal.32\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 8; R.Prov.M.-I para. 11; RfA para. 30 (stating Feb. 5, 2013).\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 8; RfA para. 30; R.Prov.M.-I para. 11.\n\nRfA para. 31.\n\n34.\n\nOn November 18, 2013, Claimant filed a constitutional action of *amparo*, its second *amparo* action, against the Superior Court for a declaration that June 17, 2013 decision was unconstitutional.33\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 12; RfA para. 31.\n\n35.\n\nOn May 12, 2014, the Lima First Constitutional Court issued a ruling vindicating Claimant's claims in its *amparo* action against Supreme Decree 032. The Peruvian Government appealed this decision.34\n\nRfA para. 27.\n\n36.\n\nOn May 19, 2014, the first instance judge decided to proceed with MINEM's claims relating to the transfer of the mining concessions to Bear Creek and the recording of such transfers in the Peruvian Public Registry (\"MINEM Lawsuit\").35\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 8; R.Prov.M.-I para. 11.\n\n37.\n\nOn August 11, 2014, Claimant filed voluntary dismissal writs, requesting that the court discontinue both *amparo* proceedings.36 MINEM filed a writ on October 3, 2014 stating that Claimant's withdrawal of the *amparo* case related to Supreme Decree 032 was proof that Claimant considered that its constitutional rights had not actually been violated.37 On October 23, 2014, Decision 33 was adopted, declaring that the *amparo* proceedings had concluded.38\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 9; R.Prov.M.-I para. 12.\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 9.\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 9.\n\n**VI. TRIBUNAL'S AUTHORITY TO GRANT PROVISIONAL MEASURES REQUESTED BY CLAIMANT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention empowers the Tribunal to issue provisional measures. Claimant invokes the writings of Prof. Schreuer to the effect that numerous arbitral awards, including those in *Maffezini*, *Pey Casado*, *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s*, *Occidental*, and *Biwater Gauff* cases, have developed a doctrine under which provisional measures have a binding effect on parties. Accordingly, there can be no doubt that this Tribunal has the authority to order interim measures against Respondent while this arbitration is pending. This is said to be consistent with Art. 840 of the FTA.39\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 14 - 16.\n\n39.\n\nThere is nothing in Art. 840 of the FTA preventing this Tribunal from issuing the requested provisional measures. While Art. 840 of the FTA limits the Tribunal's power to order certain kinds of interim relief, these limitations are not relevant to the present request. First, the limitations do not apply to an ICSID tribunal. Second, Claimant's requested measures do not fall within the limitations of Art. 840 of the FTA, as Claimant's requested relief is the temporary suspension of a concurrent, parallel local court proceeding during the pendency of this arbitration. These proceedings do not themselves constitute a measure alleged to constitute a breach of the FTA, but are merely further evidence of the Government's attack on Claimant's legal rights.40\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 17 - 19.\n\n40.\n\nThere is nothing extraordinary about Claimant's request. In consenting to arbitrate investment disputes, Respondent accepted that a tribunal may order provisional measures, even in a situation that could entail some interference with sovereign powers. This Tribunal, like the *Himpurna* tribunal, should not shirk from its duty to issue appropriate provisional measures. The state's decision to pursue civil litigation is not analogous to the sovereign authority exercised in criminal prosecutions and the Tribunal should not afford this state decision the same deference (which, in any event, is not an unfettered right).41\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 14 - 17.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nRespondent does not dispute the Tribunal's authority, under Art. 47 of the ICSID Convention, to recommend provisional measures, but argues that neither of the two requirements, i.e. that (1) the measures must be necessary to preserve an existing right and (2) the measures must be urgently needed to achieve that purpose, have been met in this case.42\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 2, 14, 17.\n\n42.\n\nWhile the Tribunal's powers to issue provisional measures may be wide in scope, the Tribunal must exercise considerable caution before issuing provisional measures, which as the *Maffezini* and *Occidental* tribunals have found, are in and of themselves extraordinary.43 The Tribunal should exercise caution where issues of State sovereignty are implicated. The same concerns related to the preservation of the state's sovereign rights, as expressed by the *PNG* and *Quiborax* tribunals in relation to criminal cases, are equally applicable to the present matter concerning the MINEM Lawsuit. The MINEM Lawsuit seeks to implement and enforce Peru's national laws within its territory, and Peru's right to investigate potential violations of its Constitution is a part of Peru's sovereignty.44 Peru's national sovereignty is equally at issue when Peru is upholding its Constitution, as when it is prosecuting a criminal offense.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 15.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 15 - 17.\n\n43.\n\nRespondent's pursuance of the MINEM Lawsuit is independent of this arbitration. Unlike the *Lao Holdings* and *Quiborax* cases, where the respective tribunals found that criminal prosecutions were used to advance the arbitration, the MINEM Lawsuit was filed three years before Claimant filed this arbitration. The MINEM Lawsuit is a good faith exercise of state sovereignty.45\n\nR.Prov.M.-II para. 14 - 17.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------\n\n44.\n\nAs undisputed between the Parties, the Tribunal is in principle entitled to order provisional measures. The Tribunal, hereafter, examines whether the conditions for ordering the provisional measures requested by Claimant are satisfied.\n\n**VII. WHETHER CLAIMANT SATISFIES THE THREE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROVISIONAL MEASURES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Claimant must meet three pre-requisites in order for the Tribunal to issue provisional measures. Claimant must demonstrate that there exists: (A) a *prima facie* jurisdiction of the Tribunal; (B) a threat of substantial or irreparable harm or prejudice to the property or rights capable of being protected by the Tribunal; and (C) urgency or imminence of said harm or prejudice.46 Each is elaborated, below.\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 20; R.Prov.M.-I para. 18, note 37.\n\n**A. THE TRIBUNAL HAS** ***PRIMA FACIE*** **JURISDICTION OVER CLAIMANT'S CLAIMS**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction over the present dispute because (1) Claimant has satisfied the FTA's conditions precedent to submit a claim to arbitration, including Art. 823(1) and 819 of the FTA; (2) under Art. 825 of the FTA, Respondent consented to submit disputes to ICSID arbitration; and (3) Claimant's claims fall within the requirements for ICSID jurisdiction. Accordingly, Claimant has established *prima facie* the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the present dispute.47\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 21 - 27.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nWhile tribunals require the requesting party to show a *prima facie* jurisdiction before issuing provisional measures, this is a relatively undemanding requirement and Respondent does not challenge whether Claimant has met this low threshold. Nevertheless, there are serious jurisdictional questions in this case and Respondent reserves the right to advance these jurisdictional objections in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules and PO-1. Any determination or decision related to the provisional measures sought by Claimant cannot prejudge the merits of future jurisdictional objections.48\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 18, note 37.\n\n**3. The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n48.\n\nAs the Parties do not dispute, and the Tribunal is equally satisfied, there is a *prima facie* jurisdiction in the present proceedings. This conclusion is without prejudice to the examination in the jurisdictional phase of this procedure.\n\n**B. WHETHER CLAIMANT HAS PROVEN THAT THE REQUESTED PROVISIONAL MEASURES ARE NECESSARY TO PRESERVE AN EXISTING RIGHT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Parties present arguments on four issues related to Claimant's alleged entitlement to the requested provisional measures: (1) whether Peru's prosecution of the MINEM Lawsuit risks prejudicing Claimant's rights in this arbitration; (2) whether the MINEM Lawsuit threatens the *status quo* ; (3) whether the MINEM Lawsuit poses a threat of irreparable harm that cannot be compensated by money damages; and (4) whether the MINEM Lawsuit exacerbates the dispute. The arguments put forward by each Party are summarized briefly, below.\n\n**1. Whether Peru's Prosecution of the MINEM Lawsuit Risks Prejudicing Bear Creek's Rights in this Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nClaimant has asserted four rights that merit protection pending the outcome of this arbitration: (1) the right to have ICSID arbitration be the exclusive remedy for the dispute, (2) the right to have its dispute decided by the international tribunal, (3) the right to prevent legal rights that are subject of the arbitration from being impaired or eviscerated prior to a final determination by the tribunal, and (4) the right to proceed through arbitration without having the dispute aggravated, exacerbated, or extended by the other party.49\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 21.\n\n51.\n\nIn order to protect a party's right to ICSID arbitration as an exclusive remedy, ICSID tribunals, including those in *MINE v. Guinea*, *SGS v. Pakistan*, *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s*, *CSOB v. Slovak Republic*, *Holiday Inns v. Morocco*, and *Perenco v. Ecuador* have ordered respondent states to stay domestic proceedings concerning issues at stake in the respective arbitrations. These cases confirm that Claimant has a right to have ICSID arbitration be the exclusive remedy of its dispute with Peru and that the Tribunal has the power and duty to preserve its jurisdiction by issuing the requested provisional measures. That the MINEM Lawsuit and the ICSID proceedings are separate is not determinative. Instead, the issue for purposes of Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention is whether the parallel proceedings deal with the same subject matter of the ICSID dispute. Here, there can be no doubt that, while the legal issues are not identical to those before this Tribunal, the MINEM Lawsuit relates broadly to the same subject matter of the arbitration, namely, Claimant's rights over the Santa Ana Project. Claimant has a protectable right to prevent its legal rights that are subject of this arbitration from being impaired or eviscerated prior to a final determination by this Tribunal. Adjudication of the MINEM Lawsuit by the Civil Court would be tantamount to a substantial modification or effective termination of Claimant's right to ICSID arbitration as an exclusive remedy. If that Court rules on the validity of Claimant's mining rights during the pendency of this arbitration, Claimant could be denied effective relief in these proceedings, especially if the Tribunal were to order restitution of the Santa Ana Project in its final award. This is exactly the kind of problem that Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention seeks to avoid. International courts and tribunals, such as the PCIJ in the *In re Electricity Company* case and the *CSOB* tribunal, have ordered states to suspend domestic proceedings where those proceedings could impair rights that could result from the court's decision. Allowing the Peruvian court to order that title over the Santa Ana Concessions revert back to the State while this arbitration is pending would eviscerate and impair Bear Creek's rights prior to a final determination by this Tribunal.50\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 34 - 42; C.Prov.M.-II para. 22 - 23.\n\n52.\n\nThe FTA does not require investors to exhaust local remedies before gaining access to international arbitration, and the Parties consent to ICSID arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy, including litigation before Peruvian courts. Accordingly, Claimant waived its right to continue participating in its two *amparo* proceedings in connection with Supreme Decree 032 and the MINEM Lawsuit.51\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 31 - 33.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nArticle 26 of the ICSID Convention means that claims brought before an ICSID tribunal cannot be heard in any other forum. The MINEM Lawsuit does not implicate Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention and cannot prejudice Claimant's rights in this arbitration because the MINEM Lawsuit encompasses a dispute that is factually, legally, and temporally distinct from the matters raised before this Tribunal. The MINEM Lawsuit is about Claimant's 2004 \u2013 2007 acquisitions of rights and not the 2011 Decree that Claimant challenges in this arbitration. The MINEM Lawsuit involves, exclusively, Peruvian domestic law. The MINEM Lawsuit will not determine whether the 2011 Decree violated the FTA. Accordingly, there can be no concern about Claimant's right to an exclusive remedy through ICSID arbitration, the right to have its dispute decided by an international tribunal, or the right to prevent impairment of its legal rights prior to this Tribunal's final decision.52\n\nR. Prov.M.-I para. 20, 22, 23, 27; R.Prov.M.-II para. 19(i), 24, 26.\n\n54.\n\nClaimant, while admitting that the disputes are separate, argues that this fact is not determinative and that the subject matter of this arbitration relates to the subject matter of the MINEM Lawsuit. While some tribunals have considered whether parallel proceedings relate to the same subject matter as the ICSID arbitration, the cases cited by Claimant are distinguishable on the facts from this matter. Those decisions show only that provisional measures are appropriate where the domestic proceeding would impinge on the tribunal's ability to decide the factual and legal issues relevant to the arbitration. This conflict, however, is not present where, as here, the substantive issues to be decided in the domestic proceeding and in the international arbitration encompass different factual bases and different legal regimes. For example, in *Quiborax*, the tribunal found that criminal proceedings brought by Bolivia against claimants' employees did not threaten the exclusivity of the arbitration, even though the disputes were related and involved the same investment and the same actors. The *Perenco* tribunal found that the ongoing domestic proceeding, where the state sought the same outcome in the domestic courts as would result from implementation of the measures that the claimant challenged in the arbitration, violated claimant's rights under Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention. This is not the case in the present proceedings. In *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s*, the tribunal forbade the state from litigating in courts the same dispute brought before the tribunal. That tribunal, however, refused to grant the claimant's request to enjoin the state from pursuing a wider range of domestic procedures including criminal proceedings and tax investigations. The *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* tribunal refused to order provisional measures against the tax investigation and further found that provisional measures related to the criminal proceedings were unwarranted, as they would not preserve Claimant's right to have that proceeding be the exclusive remedy of the dispute. Thus, the *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* tribunal rejected its claimant's attempt to obtain extensive provisional measures beyond those directly concerning the alleged treaty breach.53\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 24 \u2013 26; R.Prov.M.-II para. 22.\n\n55.\n\nEven using Claimant's proposed \"related to\" standard, Claimant has nonetheless failed to show that the MINEM Lawsuit damages the rights that it asserts \u2013 namely, its right to have this Tribunal decide its claims to the exclusion of other fora or decision makers. This Tribunal can still decide all of the substantive issues pertinent to the arbitration, regardless of whether the MINEM Lawsuit proceeds. There is no risk of incompatible rulings. While the Peruvian court's determination of whether, as a matter of Peruvian law, Claimant properly acquired the concession rights in the first place is a critical piece of information for this Tribunal's assessment of its jurisdiction to hear the case, it is one that will not deprive the Tribunal of its power to decide on its jurisdiction. Claimant has also agreed that this Tribunal can decide Claimant's claims without making a determination as to whether the 2004 Option Agreements were valid and properly registered under Peruvian law.54\n\nR.Prov.M.-II para. 23, 25.\n\n56.\n\nThe right of an exclusive ICSID remedy under Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention is limited by the scope of the parties' consent to ICSID arbitration. In the FTA, Peru consented to the ICSID arbitration of claims for breach of the FTA's protections. Peru has not consented to ICSID arbitration of any dispute arising out of an investment. Peru's consent to arbitration cannot be extended to require Peru to resolve legal claims that are different from the FTA breach.55\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 28.\n\n57.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal should reject Claimant's argument that Respondent is required to withdraw the MINEM Lawsuit because Claimant has withdrawn its *amparo* actions. Claimant withdrew its *amparo* actions \u2013 at the appellate stage \u2013 because it was required to do so under the FTA in order to launch this arbitration. The MINEM Lawsuit is not a proceeding with respect to the alleged FTA breach, and there is no reciprocal obligation in the FTA for the respondent state to withdraw any proceedings.56\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 29.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal**\n--------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe subject of the MINEM Lawsuit is the validity of Claimant's acquisitions during the period 2004 to 2007 of rights and it exclusively relates to matters of Peruvian domestic law. Claimant concedes that the legal issues are not identical to those before this Tribunal. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the MINEM Lawsuit relates broadly to the same subject matter of the arbitration, namely, Claimant's rights over the Santa Ana Project. However, as Claimant concedes, the Peruvian Courts' ruling on the concession rights and a decision in the MINEM Lawsuit would not be binding on this Tribunal. Though findings of the Peruvian courts in the MINEM Lawsuit may have to be taken into account for any later findings of the present Tribunal on the merits, they will not be (and cannot be) as such dispositive of the legal and factual matters that arise in the present proceedings. These concern the determination of whether Peru has violated the international law standards of the FTA by its treatment of Claimant and Claimant's alleged investment and, particularly, by Supreme Decree 032.\n\n**2. Whether the MINEM Lawsuit Threatens the** ***Status Quo***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nAlthough Claimant may not have ongoing operations (due to Supreme Decree 032), it continues to hold title to the concessions. If successful in this arbitration and if it obtains restitution of Supreme Decree 083, Claimant will be poised to commence operations in short order. If the MINEM Lawsuit proceeds, it could result in a decision nullifying Claimant's mineral rights prior to a final award in this arbitration. These rights would then revert to the state and could be obtained by any Peruvian individual or corporation. This would upset the *status quo* \u2013 i.e., Claimant's current holding of the concessions. Claimant's right to acquire, own, and operate the Santa Ana Project pursuant to Supreme Decree 083 and Claimant's title over the concessions are at issue in this arbitration and those rights must be preserved during these proceedings.57\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 44; C.Prov.M.-II para. 26 - 28.\n\n60.\n\nRespondent does not dispute the Tribunal's power to order provisional measures to maintain the *status quo*. But, Respondent's limitation of this right to situations necessary to \"prevent the destruction of an ongoing investment\" or to halt the seizure of the claimant's assets, has no legal foundation. Tribunals have issued provisional measures to preserve the *status quo* in a variety of fact-specific circumstances, even in cases where the claimant no longer had ongoing operations. In *Chevron v. Ecuador*, in response to concerns that a domestic court would enter a judgment that would be final and enforceable pending the outcome of the arbitration, the tribunal issued an Order for Interim Measures directing the parties to maintain the *status quo* and to refrain from conduct likely to impair or adversely affect the tribunal's ability to fairly address any issue raised by the parties before that tribunal. Here, if Respondent were to nullify Claimant's rights \u2013 although not binding on this Tribunal \u2013 that would upset the *status quo* and make it difficult to Claimant to recover its rights in the Santa Ana Project, as it seeks to in this arbitration.58\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 42; C.Prov.M.-II para. 24 - 25.\n\n61.\n\nClaimant does not seek to improve its situation by preventing the Peruvian Court from ruling on the concession rights and notes that a decision in the MINEM Lawsuit would not be binding on this Tribunal. Claimant is merely seeking to preserve the *status quo* as of today, namely, Claimant's title-holding of these concessions.59\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 28 - 29.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nClaimant's rights are not prejudiced because the MINEM Lawsuit does not threaten to alter the *status quo* of the Santa Ana Project. Claimant does not possess a clean title to the Santa Ana concessions and its characterization of the *status quo* as its \"title-holding of these concessions\" is inaccurate. Rather than preserve the *status quo*, Claimant is attempting to use the provisional measures to improve its own situation by preventing a possible ruling that could confirm that Claimant did not lawfully acquire its (now impaired) title. Although Claimant may possess a nominal title to the Santa Ana concessions, the paper title is inoperative as a result of Supreme Decree 032. Accordingly, at present, Claimant lacks the constitutionally required authorizations to acquire or possess the border-zone mining concessions that are the subject of this arbitration. Claimant, therefore, will not be able to lawfully do anything with the title to the concessions unless and until the Peruvian State reinstates the finding of public necessity and approves Claimant's ownership of the mining rights through another Supreme Decree issued by Peru's Council of Ministers. Possible outcomes of the MINEM Lawsuit \u2013 whether the reversion of mineral rights to Peru or a ruling that the concession rights were illegally acquired \u2013 cannot upset the current status of the Parties in this arbitration.60\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 30; R.Prov.M.-II para. 27, 28, 30, 31.\n\n63.\n\nClaimant has, however, already argued that it has lost the rights to the Santa Ana Project and that it seeks restitution of these property rights. This Tribunal cannot entertain Claimant's inconsistent positions that \u2013 on its substantive claims \u2013 it has lost rights, but \u2013 for the purposes of provisional measures \u2013 it has regained its property right to the concessions.61\n\nR.Prov.M.-II para. 29.\n\n64.\n\nTribunals have issued provisional measures to preserve the *status quo* by preventing the destruction of an ongoing investment or by halting an extensive seizure of claimant's assets. No such scenario exists here and there is no ongoing activity of any kind. Instead, Claimant's situation is similar to that of the claimant in *Quiborax*, where the tribunal found that, with the concessions already revoked, the claimant no longer had activities or an ongoing investment to protect through provisional measures. In addition, Claimant's situation is similar to the facts in *Phoenix Action*, where the claimant sought provisional measures against civil proceedings that would otherwise have determined the ownership of lands that were at issue in the arbitration. There, the tribunal found that claimant's ownership of the properties at issue was under dispute. That tribunal refused to give the claimant the sought provisional measures, since that would give claimant more rights that it ever possessed or had title to claim. Such measures would not maintain the *status quo* but would instead effect a fundamental change, improving the claimant's situation. Here, under the *status quo*, Claimant is legally barred from holding or exercising any border-zone concession rights, regardless of the outcome of the MINEM Lawsuit.62\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 31 - 34; R.Prov.M.-II para. 31 - 32.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal**\n--------------------\n\n65.\n\nIt is undisputed that Claimant does not have ongoing operations for its alleged investment. The Tribunal further recalls that, as Claimant concedes, whatever authority a decision in the MINEM Lawsuit might have, it would not be binding on this Tribunal. The situation here is similar to that which pertained in the *Phoenix Action* and *Quiborax* cases. Irrespective of the outcome of the MINEM Lawsuit, Claimant will not be able to do anything lawfully with the title to the concessions unless and until the Peruvian State reinstates the finding of public necessity and approves Claimant's ownership of the mining rights through another Supreme Decree issued by Peru's Council of Ministers. This latter issue is before the present Tribunal. Therefore, the MINEM Lawsuit does not as such threaten the *status quo* of the present arbitral proceedings.\n\n**3. Whether the MINEM Lawsuit Poses a Threat of Irreparable or Substantial Harm that Cannot be Compensated by Money Damages**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nRespondent's position that Claimant faces no threat of irreparable harm for which the Tribunal would be unable to order adequate monetary compensation misinterprets the irreparable harm requirement and improperly restricts its meaning. Interim measures are meant to prevent \"substantial\" or \"irreparable\" harm. These terms are flexible in international law and do not require that the injury complained of be not remediable by an award of damages. Substantial harm may still exist even where a party has a right of recourse to damages. The *PNG* tribunal confirmed that the term \"irreparable\" is understood as requiring a showing of a material risk of serious or grave damage to the requesting party, and not harm that is literally irreparable in the narrow, common law sense of the term. Substantial harm, even if not irreparable, is generally sufficient to satisfy the element of the standard for granting provisional measures. It is also sufficient to show that there is a material risk that serious harm will occur, not that it is certain to occur.63\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 31.\n\n67.\n\nThe *CEMEX*, *Occidental*, and *Plama* decisions on which Respondent relies to promote its narrow reading of \"irreparable\" harm do not support Respondent's position. In each of those cases, the claimant either exclusively sought monetary damages or conceded that its damages would be compensable by money, which is not the case here. Here, Claimant has the right to seek restitution as a remedy and has done so in the RfA. This right is entitled to protection, and Art. 841 of the FTA empowers the Tribunal to award restitution. That Peru may ultimately elect to pay damages instead does not change Claimant's right to seek and be awarded restitution or the Tribunal's power to award it. Restitution is not a foreclosed remedy as a matter of law. Nor should it become a *de facto* foreclosed remedy. If the MINEM Lawsuit continues, it could result in a court decision depriving Claimant of title over the concessions, making Claimant unable to seek restitution of the Santa Ana Project in the form of a Supreme Decree reinstating the declaration of public necessity contained in Supreme Decree 083 because Respondent by way of a private lawsuit would have taken away the underlying mineral rights.64\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 32 - 34.\n\n68.\n\nRespondent's argument that restitution would be inappropriate, unlikely, or a grave intrusion on Peru's sovereignty invites the Tribunal to pre-judge the merits of Claimant's case before any briefing or hearing on the issues. It is precisely this type of prejudgment that is inappropriate in the context of examining a provisional measures request.65\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 35.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe irreparable harm standard prevails in treaty jurisprudence. While tribunals diverge on whether the standard requires that the alleged harm must be incapable of being compensated by monetary damages, or merely that the harm will be inadequately compensated by monetary damages (as Respondent argues), each approach requires that the Tribunal determine whether money damages are possible and appropriate compensation. If money damages are possible and appropriate, provisional measures are unlikely to be necessary. All of the cases cited by Claimant, including *Paushok* and *PNG*, support this position. Claimant has not identified any right at issue whose loss could not be compensated through a damages award. Accordingly, Claimant cannot demonstrate the irreparable harm required for a provisional measures recommendation.66\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 38; R.Prov.M.-II para. 34 - 35.\n\n70.\n\nClaimant's main concern appears to be that, if the MINEM Lawsuit decides against Claimant with a holding that Claimant illegally obtained the concessions that form the basis of its alleged investment, then the Tribunal will be unable to award restitution or compensation. In effect, however, the FTA has already determined that money damages are an adequate remedy for whatever harms the investor may suffer. While the Tribunal may propose restitution, Art. 841 of the FTA mandates that the respondent state may always choose to pay monetary damages in lieu of restitution. Claimant's insistence that restitution should not be foreclosed flies in the face of the terms of the FTA. In any event, restitution is an exceedingly rare remedy \u2013 it is intrusive and as unlikely as this Tribunal ordering Peru to issue a Supreme Decree finding Claimant's concession to be a public necessity (an extreme and unusual remedy, if granted by this Tribunal). Claimant cannot base its request for provisional measures on such a tenuous and hypothetical possibility. Claimant cannot prove that damages would be an inadequate remedy for the harm that would allegedly be caused absent the provisional measures.67\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 35 - 37; R.Prov.M.-II para. 37.\n\n71.\n\nClaimant is incorrect to allege that this Tribunal cannot reach a conclusion on the adequacy of money damages now \u2013 the Tribunal can and should do so in order to determine the appropriateness of provisional measures.68\n\nR.Prov.M.-II para. 33, 36.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal**\n--------------------\n\n72.\n\nIt is undisputed that Claimant presently has no ongoing factual investment activities. It follows that, factually, no irreparable or substantial harm can be caused to the alleged investment by the MINEM Lawsuit. Regarding the Claimant's legal position, however, Art. 841 of the FTA has to be taken into account. It provides that the Respondent state may always choose to pay monetary damages in lieu of restitution. Claimant's insistence that restitution should not be foreclosed would not be enforceable even if it were to be recognized by the present Tribunal. However, the compensation by money damages, if awarded by the present Tribunal, cannot be threatened by the MINEM Lawsuit, irrespective of the outcome of that lawsuit.\n\n**4. Whether the MINEM Lawsuit Exacerbates the Dispute**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nAs recognized by the PCIJ in the *Electricity Company* case, there is a principle that is universally accepted by international tribunals that the parties to a case must abstain from any measure capable of exercising a prejudicial effect in regard to the execution of the decision to be given, and any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute. Allowing the MINEM Lawsuit to proceed exacerbates this dispute and aggravates Claimant's losses and prejudice sustained as a result of Peru's breaches of the FTA. An adverse ruling in the MINEM Lawsuit could result in the nullification of Claimant's mineral rights in the Santa Ana Project, which could entail adverse consequences for Claimant, including criminal proceedings, as well as the impairment of development of Claimant's larger Corani Project, also located in Peru. Claimant's arguments regarding the *status quo*, the election of this Tribunal as having exclusive jurisdiction over this dispute, are incorporated by reference.69\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 43 - 45.\n\n74.\n\nRespondent's narrow view about protections against exacerbation of a dispute \u2013 limiting it to issues that make the resolution to the dispute by the Tribunal more difficult \u2013 is unwarranted. Tribunals usually refer to the non-exacerbation of the dispute in the same breath as the procedural integrity of an arbitration proceeding and the right to an effective final award. The *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* tribunal noted that disputing parties must refrain from measures capable of having a prejudicial effect on the rendering or implementation of an eventual ICSID award or decision. The *City Oriente* tribunal issued interim measures against Ecuador targeted at \"prohibiting any action that affects disputed rights, aggravates the dispute, frustrates the effectiveness of the award or entails having either party take justice into their own hands.\" The MINEM Lawsuit exacerbates the dispute because it threatens the effectiveness of the Tribunal's ultimate award in this arbitration. If the Tribunal were to rule in Claimant's favor and order restitution of the Supreme Decree, that award could not be effective if Claimant's title over the concessions has reverted back to the State as a result of the MINEM Lawsuit.70\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 36 - 37.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe kind of \"aggravation\" that tribunals contemplate when considering provisional measures is that which makes resolution of the dispute by the Tribunal more difficult. Nothing in the MINEM Lawsuit makes resolution of the dispute before the Tribunal more difficult because Claimant will still be able to present all of its claims for breach of the FTA. Respondent's arguments with regard to restitution, presented above, are incorporated by reference.71\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 41; R.Prov.M.-II para. 38 - 39.\n\n76.\n\nAs a threshold matter, at least one Tribunal has reasoned that the mere aggravation of a dispute, while a factor that may be considered in whether to recommend provisional measures, cannot be the sole basis for such a recommendation. Even if the Tribunal were to find that the MINEM Lawsuit threatened to aggravate the dispute (which is does not), the Tribunal should not order provisional measures unless it is also satisfied that the irreparable harm and urgency elements are also met. Respondent's arguments that these elements are not met are incorporated by reference.72\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 39 - 40.\n\n77.\n\nClaimant appears to argue that the MINEM Lawsuit could make it more difficult for Claimant to prove that it acquired a valid, legal investment in Peru for the purpose of satisfying the jurisdictional requirements of the FTA and the ICSID Convention. Making Claimant's case easier, however, is not the purpose of provisional measures. As stated above, provisional measures should not be issued in order to improve the situation of Claimant before rendering the Tribunal's award. If Claimant acquired the mineral concessions through improper means, then preventing Peru from pulling back the veil from Claimant's deception cannot be an appropriate basis for issuing provisional measures. If the MINEM Lawsuit determines that Claimant did not lawfully acquire or own its claimed investment, and if the Tribunal on that basis concludes that it lacks jurisdiction, then Claimant would have had no right to present its claims to this Tribunal in the first place. Provisional measures should not be issued on the premise of protecting Claimant against a potential determination that it has no rights before this Tribunal.73\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 42 - 43.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal**\n--------------------\n\n78.\n\nTaking into account the Tribunal's considerations and conclusions in the previous sections above, the MINEM Lawsuit cannot be said to exacerbate the present dispute. This is because Claimant has no ongoing factual investment activities, and because Claimant will still be able to present and the Tribunal will still be able to decide all of the claims for breach of the FTA. irrespective of the outcome of the MINEM lawsuit\n\n**5. Whether the requested Provisional Measures are Urgent Because of a Risk of Imminent Harm to Bear Creek**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nRespondent does not dispute that the requirement of urgency is met, as stated by the ICJ and tribunals such as that in *City Oriente*, \"if the action that is allegedly prejudicial to the rights of either Party is likely to be taken before the final decision of the tribunal is given.\"74 Respondent, however, argues that the measures are non-urgent because the impending ruling in the MINEM Lawsuit is on Claimant's procedural defenses, a merits decision is nowhere near imminent, and it is unclear how a procedural ruling could have any effect on Claimant's rights for this arbitration. Respondent's arguments are incorrect. First, Respondent's attempt to distinguish between procedural and merits rulings presents a false dichotomy. The relevant question is whether the Civil Court of Lima could render a decision in the MINEM Lawsuit at any time before the Tribunal renders a final award in this case. Respondent does not contest that this risk exists. Accordingly, the urgency requirement has been met, irrespective of the nature of the forthcoming ruling. That the MINEM Lawsuit has been pending since July 2011 does not change this. The Court's decision on Claimant's procedural defenses directly affects the Tribunal's exclusive jurisdiction over the present dispute. This is especially so since Claimant abandoned its *amparo* actions, which were a major defense in the MINEM Lawsuit. Allowing the MINEM Lawsuit to continue while the arbitration is pending would unfairly prejudice Claimant's fundamental rights.75\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 47; C.Prov.M.-II para. 38.\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 46 - 48; C.Prov.M.-II para. 38 - 39.\n\n**6. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe need for provisional measures is urgent if the action that is allegedly prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before the final decision of the tribunal.76 Claimant has failed to prove the requisite urgency that it faces an imminent harm. Although the MINEM Lawsuit is currently pending and could render a decision at any time, this case has winded through various levels of the Peruvian court system since 2011 and is still only considering Claimant's threshold procedural arguments. The timing of procedural defenses is not the relevant inquiry for a showing of imminent harm. It is unclear how rulings on Claimant's procedural defenses could have any effect on Claimant's rights for the purposes of this arbitration. If the court upholds any of these defenses, the MINEM Lawsuit could come to an end, subject to appeal. If the court rejects those defenses, the proceedings will proceed to the merits. Any court decision on the substantive issues would likely remain outstanding for some time. Claimant has not presented any evidence that the domestic court is on the verge of making a substantive ruling in the MINEM Lawsuit. Without more and since Claimant's case falls short of this necessary element, Claimant has not shown any level of urgency that tribunals require before awarding provisional measures.77\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 44.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 44 - 46; R.Prov.M.-II para. 40 - 42.\n\n**7. The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n81.\n\nAgain, taking into account the Tribunal's considerations and conclusions in the previous sections above, since Claimant has no ongoing factual investment activities, and since Claimant will still be able to present and the Tribunal will still be able to decide all of the claims for breach of the FTA, irrespective of the outcome of the MINEM lawsuit, the Tribunal sees no urgency for the requested provisional measures.\n\n**VIII. CLAIMANT'S ALTERNATIVE REQUEST, IF PROVISIONAL MEASURES ARE DENIED**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nIn Claimant's Observations to Peru's Response to the Request for Provisional Measures, the Claimant made the following additional request:\n\n[\u2026] If the Tribunal were to deny Bear Creek's request for provisional measures, Bear Creek requests the Tribunal to confirm that Bear Creek's continued defense against Peru's claims against Bear Creek in the MINEM Lawsuit before the Peruvian courts does not constitute a violation of the waiver requirements set forth in Article 823.1(e) of the Treaty.78\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 44.\n\n83.\n\nWhile Claimant presented no arguments in relation to this request, it explained that, in connection with the filing of this arbitration, pursuant to Art. 823.1(e) of the FTA, Claimant waived its right to initiate or continue any local proceedings with respect to measures that are alleged to be a breach of Art. 819 of the FTA. Accordingly, Claimant requested the Peruvian courts discontinue the proceedings in the two constitutional actions of *amparo* that Claimant had commenced.79 Among these, Claimant waived its right to continue participating in the MINEM Lawsuit.80\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 9, 23.\n\nRfA para. 54.\n\n84.\n\nArguing that the continued prosecution of the MINEM Lawsuit prejudices Claimant, Claimant submitted that requiring Claimant to pursue its claims in ICSID while defending itself in parallel litigation in Peru with respect to matters it believes to be directly at issue in this arbitration (after having withdrawn its two *amparo* actions) would, in addition to threatening the Tribunal's jurisdiction, require Claimant to devote substantial time and resources to defending itself, while at the same time pursuing its claims under the FTA and international law in this proceeding.81 Claimant also stated that \"Bear Creek cannot be expected to defend itself in Peruvian Courts after voluntarily withdrawing its *amparos* in connection with these proceedings and thus abandoning a major defense in this respect.\"82\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 12.\n\nC.Prov.M.-I para. 48.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nRespondent did not present any arguments directly related to Claimant's alternate request for relief. Respondent did state that Claimant's analogy between the MINEM Lawsuit and the two *amparo* actions, where Claimant suggests that since it withdrew its actions, Peru should be required to stay the MINEM Lawsuit, is incorrect. The disputes are patently different \u2013 the MINEM Lawsuit is a Peruvian civil action that addresses Claimant's actions in 2004 \u2013 2007, whereas the present dispute involves Respondent's 2011 decision to issue Supreme Decree 032.83\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 13.\n\n86.\n\nArticle 821.3(e) of the FTA requires a disputing investor to \"waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of either party \u2026 any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be in breach\u2026\"84 Claimant's *amparo* action challenging the constitutionality of Supreme Decree 032 was a \"proceeding with respect to the measure of Peru that is alleged to be in breach\" of the FTA. But, even setting aside the fact that the MINEM Lawsuit is not a \"proceeding with respect to\" Supreme Decree 032 \u2013 the dispositive fact is that there is no reciprocal obligation in the FTA for a respondent state to withdraw any proceedings.85\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 29.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 29.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither Party has submitted arguments directly addressing this Alternative Request. The above summary of certain submissions by the Parties can be considered as being of relevance to this Request. As the Request has been submitted to the Tribunal as an alternative request and as the alternative condition given by Claimant, i.e. a denial of provisional measures, is fulfilled, it has to be decided by the Tribunal.\n\n88.\n\nSince the Parties had an opportunity in two rounds of submissions to present arguments directly addressing the Alternative Request and did not do so, and since no factual issues disputed between the Parties are relevant for the examination of the Request, the Tribunal considers that it can decide the legal questions involved without having to refer back to the Parties.\n\n89.\n\nArt. 823.1(e) FTA provides:\n\nA disputing investor may submit a claim to arbitration under Article 819 only if:\n\n(e) both the disputing investor and the enterprise waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of either Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 820, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party.\n\n90.\n\nIn its above considerations in earlier sections of this Order regarding Claimant's primary Request for provisional measures, the Tribunal has concluded that:\n\n\u2022 the legal issues in the MINEM Lawsuit are not identical to those before this Tribunal; and\n\n\u2022 though findings of the Peruvian courts in the MINEM Lawsuit may have to be taken into account for any later findings of the present Tribunal on the merits, they cannot be dispositive of the legal and factual matters that arise in the present proceedings, namely the determination of whether Peru has violated the international law standards of the FTA by its treatment of Claimant and Claimant's alleged investment and, particularly, by Supreme Decree 032.\n\n91.\n\nIn view of these conclusions, the Tribunal considers that Art. 823.1(e) FTA is not applicable, since the condition is not fulfilled that \"any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 820\" are at stake in the MINEM Lawsuit before the courts of Peru.\n\n92.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant's continued defense against Peru's claims against Bear Creek in the MINEM Lawsuit before the Peruvian courts does not constitute a violation of the waiver requirements set forth in Article 823.1(e) of the FTA.86\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 44.\n\n**IX. RESPONDENT'S ALTERNATIVE REQUEST, IF PROVISIONAL MEASURES ARE GRANTED**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nFor the case that the Tribunal grants the provisional measures, Respondent has submitted the following alternative request:\n\n[\u2026] In the alternative, if the Tribunal decides to grant Claimant's request, Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal expressly confirm that, if the issue of the questionable validity under Peruvian law of Claimant's acquisition of the concessions is presented to it as part of the parties' jurisdictional or merits arguments, the Tribunal will hear and decide those issues of Peruvian domestic law.87\n\nR.Prov.M.-II para. 49.\n\n94.\n\nClaimant attempts to foreclose any review of the legality of its acquisition of the Santa Ana concessions by, on the one hand, asking for the Tribunal to stay those proceedings and, on the other hand, asserting that the Tribunal need not rule on Peru's allegations in the MINEM Lawsuit. That the potentially unlawful manner in which Claimant acquired its alleged investment is an issue before this Tribunal is, however, inescapable. If the MINEM Lawsuit proceeds, the Tribunal may have the benefit of a Peruvian court ruling in assessing this issue. If the provisional measures are granted, the Tribunal will need to decide the issue without that guidance. At present, however, it appears that Claimant is seeking to preclude the Tribunal from reaching this issue, thus using the requested provisional measures to improperly improve its own case. As Claimant has already attempted to inaccurately convince the Tribunal that it is prevailing in the MINEM Lawsuit and that the Tribunal should draw inferences in Claimant's favor about the validity of the MINEM claims, Claimant could likewise attempt to seek an advantage in this arbitration by claiming that, inasmuch as the Santa Ana concessions had not been declared invalid by Peruvian courts, they should be deemed valid. In light of these concerns, Respondent insists that if the Tribunal temporarily enjoins the MINEM Lawsuit pending the outcome of this arbitration, the Tribunal will need to hear arguments and decide under Peruvian law whether Claimant lawfully acquired the Santa Ana concessions or whether, instead, its scheme violated the Peruvian Constitution.88\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 48 - 52; R.Prov.M.-II para. 43, 45 - 46.\n\n95.\n\nClaimant wants the Tribunal to suspend that lawsuit but, at the same time, persuade the Tribunal that the legality of the acquisition of the alleged investment is not a matter for the Tribunal to decide. Under Claimant's argumentation, no one would decide on the lawfulness of Claimant's alleged investment. Claimant's arguments are inherently contradictory. On the one hand, Claimant argues that the MINEM Lawsuit is so intertwined with this arbitration that it must be suspended because otherwise it would be an obstacle to this Tribunal deciding the Treaty claims. On the other hand, Claimant argues that the Tribunal should not decide the questions posed in the MINEM Lawsuit. Both cannot be correct: either the MINEM Lawsuit deals with issues that the Tribunal needs to address itself, or it does not. Respondent's arguments, however, are consistent. First, the Tribunal does not need to suspend the MINEM Lawsuit to maintain its ability to hear the Treaty claims (the MINEM Lawsuit does not concern Treaty claims). Second, the Tribunal must decide as part of this arbitration whether Claimant lawfully acquired the Santa Ana concessions, and that determination may be informed by the judgment of the Peruvian courts in the MINEM Lawsuit, if that lawsuit reaches the merits. Claimant's request for provisional measures is evidently driven by the concern that the acquisition of the alleged investment may be deemed illegal.89\n\nR.Prov.M.-II para. 47 - 48.\n\n96.\n\nThere is no question of this Tribunal deciding the MINEM Lawsuit, as a counterclaim or otherwise. Respondent has never sought to include the MINEM claims as counterclaims. But, if the Tribunal orders the suspension of the MINEM Lawsuit, it will fall entirely on the Tribunal to decide the legality of Claimant's proxy acquisition of the Santa Ana concessions. This determination will be important for the assessment of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.90\n\nR.Prov.M.-I para. 50; R.Prov.M.-II para. 44 - 45.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nPeru has sought to dissuade the Tribunal from issuing interim measures by insisting that, if it were to order such measures, the Tribunal should pledge to hear arguments on and decide for itself the key issues of Peruvian law that are presented in the MINEM Lawsuit. The Tribunal certainly need not do that. First, the Tribunal does not need to rule on Peru's allegations in the MINEM Lawsuit in order to determine whether Claimant's investments in Santa Ana are protected under the FTA. In the MINEM Lawsuit, Respondent attacks the validity and registration of the 2004 Option Agreements in 2004 and 2005. This Tribunal, however, is tasked with deciding whether Respondent's 2011 Supreme Decree 032 revoking Claimant's authorization to exploit the Santa Ana concessions breached the FTA and international law. The Tribunal can decide this issue without making a determination as to whether the 2004 Option Agreements were valid and properly registered under Peruvian law. While Peru can raise similar factual arguments before the Tribunal and the Peruvian civil court, it is improper to suggest that the Tribunal must decide MINEM's civil claims.91\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 40 - 41.\n\n98.\n\nFurthermore, by requiring that the Tribunal pledge to decide the claims in the MINEM Lawsuit, Peru also seeks to limit Claimant's right to have the Tribunal determine whether the MINEM Lawsuit constitutes a governmental measure taken in breach of the FTA. The Tribunal, in pledging to decide MINEM's claim, would in effect become a party to and judge of the measure, the legality of which is at issue in this arbitration.92 The MINEM claims, in any event, are outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Under the FTA, Claimant and Peru only consented to arbitrate claims relating to whether the Government's measures violate the Treaty and international law. There has been no consent for the Tribunal to decide Peruvian civil law claims. If the Tribunal were to hear MINEM's civil claims, Respondent would need to raise these as counterclaims. These would, however, be improper, given that that the Parties have not consented to the arbitration of domestic civil claims.93\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 42.\n\nC.Prov.M.-II para. 42.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------\n\n99.\n\nSince the Tribunal, in the earlier sections of this Order above, has concluded that the request for provisional measures is to be denied, there is no need to decide on this alternative relief sought by the Respondent.\n\n**X. COSTS**\n------------\n\n100.\n\nIn their submissions related to the provisional measures, the Parties presented no arguments regarding who would bear the costs of this portion of the procedure. Likewise, the Tribunal sees no need to deal with the cost issue at this time. However, the Parties may submit comments regarding the costs caused by this procedure on provisional measures at a later stage of the present procedure, before the Tribunal decides on the costs of arbitration.\n\n**XI. DISPOSITIF**\n------------------\n\n[101].\n\n**Taking into account its considerations and conclusions above, the Tribunal decides:**\n\n**1. Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures is denied.**\n\n**2. Regarding Claimant's Alternative Request in case provisional measures are denied, the Tribunal confirms that Claimant's continued defense against Peru's claims against Bear Creek in the MINEM Lawsuit before the Peruvian courts does not constitute a violation of the waiver requirements set forth in Article 823.1(e) of the FTA.**\n\n**3. Any decision regarding the costs caused by this procedure on provisional measures is deferred to a later stage of the proceedings**."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2017-11-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Professor Philippe Sands QC", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Professor Philippe Sands QC\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn certain respects this might be described as a straightforward case. An investor - the Claimant, Bear Creek Mining Corporation - decided that it wished to mine silver ore deposits located in an area of Peru known as Santa Ana in the Puno department. In accordance with Article 71 of the Peruvian Constitution, this location, which is within 50 kilometres of the border between Peru and Bolivia, meant that the Claimant was obliged to obtain - along with a multitude of other permitting requirements - a \"public necessity\" Decree granted to it by the Peruvian Council of Ministers. In November 2007, the Council of Ministers proceeded to adopt Supreme Decree 083-2007, declaring the Santa Ana Project to be a public necessity. This authorised the Claimant to acquire seven mining rights in the Santa Ana area of Puno. Three years and six months later, in June 2011, the Council of Ministers adopted Supreme Decree 032-2011-EM. This revoked Supreme Decree 083-2007 and the finding of \"public necessity\", ending the Claimant\u2019s right to operate its Santa Ana concessions. In between those two dates - November 2007 and June 2011 - there were protests and considerable social unrest in the Puno department. As set out below, I am clear that the protests and unrests were caused in part by the Santa Ana Project.\n\n2.\n\nI am very largely in agreement with the conclusions of the Tribunal, to the effect that, within the meaning of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and Peru (FTA): the Claimant made an investment; the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claim; and there is no bar to the exercise by the Tribunal of such jurisdiction (admissibility). I also agree with the conclusion that the effect of Supreme Decree 032-2011 was to expropriate by indirect means the right of the Claimant to operate the Santa Ana concessions, and that this occurred in violation of Article 812 of the FTA. In my view, the circumstances which the Peruvian government faced - massive and growing social unrest caused in part by the Santa Ana Project - left it with no option but to act in some way to protect the well-being of its citizens; however, other and less draconian options were available to the Council of Ministers, including the suspension of Decree 0832007, rather than revocation. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that these other options were explored or assessed, properly or even at all. The circumstances in which Supreme Decree 032-2011 was adopted - in particular the failure to give the Claimant a right to be heard before its adoption - also gave rise, in my view, to a violation of Article 805, being a violation of the obligation to offer \"fair and equitable treatment\". I understand, however, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that \"*the Parties have not presented arguments related to the legal consequences of such a finding, and such a finding indeed would not change or add to those that follow from an unlawful indirect expropriation*\".1\n\nAward, para. 533.\n\n3.\n\nI also agree with the Majority that the consequence of the violation of Article 812 of the FTA entitles the Claimant to be awarded a measure of compensation, and with the general approach taken to the assessment of that compensation. In particular, I fully concur - given the Project\u2019s speculative and unlikely prospects in face of serious social unrest, the manifest failure to obtain a \"social license\", and the many environmental and other regulatory authorisations yet to be obtained - with the conclusion set out in the Award that \"*the calculation of Claimant\u2019s damages in the present case cannot be carried out by reference to the potential expected profitability of the Santa Ana Project and the DCF method*\".2 In the circumstances, the proper measure of damages is to be assessed by reference to the Claimant\u2019s actual investment in the Project after November 27, 2007.3\n\nAward, para. 604.\n\nClaimant invested a total of US$ 21,827,687. However, as part of this investment occurred before Claimant legally obtained the concessions on 27 November 2007, when Supreme Decree 083 was issued. The final amount thus invested by Claimant equals US$ 18,237,592. See Award, paras. 658 ff.\n\n4.\n\nI disagree, however, with the Majority\u2019s assessment of the amount of damages that are due, in application of this approach, and in particular the failure to reduce that amount by reason of the fault of the Claimant in contributing to the unrest.4 Whilst I agree that it is for the Respondent to establish any contributory fault, my assessment of the evidence before the Tribunal is that the Respondent has clearly established the Claimant\u2019s contributory responsibility, by reason of its acts and omissions, to the social unrest that left the Peruvian government in the predicament it faced, and the need to do something reasonable and lawful to protect public well-being. I set out my reasons in this Partial Dissent.\n\nAward, para. 668.\n\n5.\n\nA central issue in the facts argued before the Tribunal concerned the circumstances of the collapse of the Santa Ana Project - a matter of fact - and the legal standard to be applied - a matter of law. As to the latter, as noted by the Tribunal, the *Abengoa* award offers the legal standard to be applied. On this approach, the Tribunal is called on to assess whether \"*events that led to the loss of the Claimants\u2019 investment would not have occurred*\" if \"*a social communication program had been timely implemented*\".5 I am not persuaded by the conclusion reached at paragraph 411 of the Award in this case. On the basis of the evidence before us I have difficulty in understanding how it could be concluded, as the Majority does, that there was no connection - or partially causal relationship - between the manner in which the Claimant conducted itself and the circumstances that gave rise, firstly, to the disruption of the Santa Ana Project, and then to its premature demise as a consequence of Supreme Decree 032- 2011.\n\nAward, para. 410 citing ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/2, *Abengoa S.A. y Cofides S.A. v. United Mexican States*, Award (18 April 2013).\n\n6.\n\nIn reaching a contrary view to my colleagues, I rely on the totality of the evidence that was put before us by the Parties, and in particular the extensive testimony of numerous witnesses and experts. For the reasons set out below, in my view this evidence clearly shows that the Claimant\u2019s acts and omissions, in the period before 2008, during 2008, thereafter, and right up until May 2011, contributed in material ways to the events that unfolded and then led to the Project\u2019s collapse. In particular, the Project collapsed because of the investor\u2019s inability to obtain a \"social license\", the necessary understanding between the Project\u2019s proponents and those living in the communities most likely to be affected by it, whether directly or indirectly. It is blindingly obvious that the viability and success of a project such as this, located in the community of the Aymara peoples, a group of interconnected communities, was necessarily dependent on local support. In this regard, the Project can hardly be said to have got off to a good start, with the Claimant making use of a degree of subterfuge, by obtaining permits in the name of one of its own lowly employees - Ms Villavicencio, a Peruvian national - which it, as a foreign corporation, was not at the time authorised or lawfully entitled to obtain. If nothing else, the absence of transparency at that early stage of the Project can only have contributed to an undermining of the conditions necessary to build trust over the longer term. The discontent that followed, expressed by many members of the affected local communities, was foreseeable.\n\n7.\n\nIn this regard it is helpful that the Parties broadly agree that the investment was made in an area in which the rights of numerous indigenous communities - under national and international law - were fully engaged. Of particular relevance are the rules set forth in ILO Convention 169 (Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention), which was applicable to the territory of Peru after it became a Party on February 2nd, 1994. The Preamble to the Convention, which was adopted in 1989, recognizes \"*the aspirations of [indigenous and tribal] peoples to exercise control over their own institutions, ways of life and economic development and to maintain and develop their identities, languages and religions, within the framework of the States in which they live*\", and calls attention to \"*the distinctive contributions of indigenous and tribal peoples to the cultural diversity and social and ecological harmony of humankind and to international cooperation and understanding*\". This preambular language offers encouragement to any investor to take into account as fully as possible the aspirations of indigenous and tribal peoples. Establishing conditions of transparency and trust are a vital pre-requisite for the success of a project, which involves a corporation arriving from a faraway place to pursue an investment in the lands of indigenous and tribal peoples.\n\n8.\n\nArticle 1 provides that the Convention *\"applies to\"* certain \"*tribal peoples\"* and *\"peoples... who are regarded as indigenous*\". There can be no doubt that it is applicable to the Aymara peoples in respect of the activities proposed by the Santa Ana Project. No serious argument to the contrary was made.\n\n9.\n\nArticle 13(1) of the Convention provides that:\n\n\"*In applying the provisions of this Part of the Convention governments shall respect the special importance for the cultures and spiritual values of the peoples concerned of their relationship with the lands or territories, or both as applicable, which they occupy or otherwise use, and in particular the collective aspects of this relationship*.\"\n\nArticle 15 then provides:\n\n\"*1. The rights of the peoples concerned to the natural resources pertaining to their lands shall be specially safeguarded. These rights include the right of these peoples to participate in the use, management and conservation of these resources.*\n\n*2. In cases in which the State retains the ownership of mineral or sub-surface resources or rights to other resources pertaining to lands, governments shall establish or maintain procedures through which they shall consult these peoples, with a view to ascertaining whether and to what degree their interests would be prejudiced, before undertaking or permitting any programmes for the exploration or exploitation of such resources pertaining to their lands. The peoples concerned shall wherever possible participate in the benefits of such activities, and shall receive fair compensation for any damages which they may sustain as a result of such activities*.\"\n\nAs noted, there is no dispute between the Parties that the Convention is applicable to the indigenous peoples situated in the area of the Santa Ana Project.6 It is the case, of course, that the obligation to implement the Convention is one that falls on States,7 by implementing the Convention through national laws. In the case of Peru, ILO Convention 169 was approved and implemented in 1993 through Legislative Resolution No. 26253.\n\nSee for example, Claimant\u2019s Post Hearing Brief I (21 December 2016), para. 1 ff.; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction (6 October 2015), para. 62 ff.\n\nCEACR Observation on Bolivia 2005/76th Session: \"... the obligation to ensure that consultations are held in a manner consistent with the requirements established in the Convention is an obligation to be discharged by governments, not by private individuals or companies.\"\n\n10.\n\nYet the fact that the Convention may not impose obligations directly on a private foreign investor as such does not, however, mean that it is without significance or legal effects for them. In *Urbaser v Argentina*, the Tribunal noted that human rights relating to dignity and adequate housing and living conditions \"*are complemented by an obligation on all parts, public and private parties, not to engage in activity aimed at destroying such rights*.\"8 The *Urbaser* Tribunal further noted that the BIT being applied in that case \"*has to be construed in harmony with other rules of international law of which it forms part, including those relating to human rights*\",9 and that Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention together with the governing law clause of that BIT (Article X(5)) provided that that \"*Tribunal shall apply the law of the host State \"and such rules of international law as may be applicable*.\"10\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, *Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partuergoa v The Argentine Republic,* Award (8 December 2016), para. 1199.\n\nibid., para. 1200.\n\nibid., para. 1202.\n\n11.\n\nThe same considerations apply in the present case in relation to the requirements of ILO Convention 169, and in particular its Article 15 on consultation requirements. Article 837 of the Canada Peru FTA, on Governing Law, provides that this Tribunal \"*shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law*\". ILO Convention 169 is a rule of international law applicable to the territory of Peru. This Tribunal is entitled to take the Convention into account in determining whether the Claimant carried out its obligation to give effect to the aspirations of the Aymara peoples in an appropriate manner, having regard to all relevant legal requirements, including the implementing Peruvian legislation.\n\n12.\n\nThe relevance and applicability of Convention 169 was accepted by the Respondent.11 As for the Claimant, its Chief Operation Officer, Mr Elsiario Antunez de Mayolo, testified that the Convention was \"*mentioned... as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment and also with the consultants*.\"12 Counsel for the Claimant accepted that the Convention had been \"*incorporated into*\" domestic law, including the right of the indigenous peoples to consultation under the Convention.13 Whether by means of the domestic law of Peru or otherwise, the relevance of the Convention has been recognised by both Parties. Yet when I asked Mr Antunez de Mayolo whether he was familiar with what Article 15 of the Convention said, or had ever seen it, he replied: \"*no*.\"14 This, in my view, indicates that the Claimant had, at best, a semidetached relationship to the vital rights set forth in this part of the Convention. It was not as fully prepared for the making of an investment in the lands of the communities of indigenous peoples - the peoples concerned by the project it was embarked upon - as it should have been.\n\nSee for example Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction (6 October 2015), paras. 62, 135.\n\nTranscript at 611:16-21.\n\nTranscript at 625:6-20 (Mr Burnett).\n\nTranscript at. 612:3-6.\n\n13.\n\nArticle 15 recognises various rights \"*of the peoples concerned*\". These rights include: (1) to \"*participate in the use, management and conservation\" of resources \"pertaining to their lands*\"; (2) to be consulted \"*with a view to ascertaining whether and to what degree their interests would be prejudiced, before undertaking or permitting any programmes for the exploration or exploitation of such resources pertaining to their lands*\"; and (3) \"*wherever possible [to] participate in the benefits of such activities, and [to] receive fair compensation for any damages which they may sustain as a result of such activities.*\" It is noteworthy that the Convention connects the right to be consulted with the right to participate in the benefits. It also to be noted that when Article 15 refers to \"*these peoples*\" it means all of \"*the peoples concerned*\", not just some of them.\n\n14.\n\nThe question therefore arises whether the rights of all \"*the peoples concerned*\" by the Santa Ana Project were given sufficient effect, as required by the Convention and the implementing domestic law. That raises, as a first issue, who \"the peoples concerned\" were, and as a second step, whether the rights of all these peoples, including in particular the right to be consulted, were given sufficient recognition.\n\n15.\n\nThe evidence before us included a map contained in the Claimant\u2019s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). This showed, within a continuous line marked on the map, the geographic area to be exploited under the Project, and the area directly affected.15\n\nExhibit R-398.\n\n16.\n\nThe map identifies a number of communities originally believed by the Claimant to fall within the Project\u2019s area of direct influence. These might be said to be \"*the peoples concerned*\". These communities ethnically and culturally belong to the Aymara group. They are indigenous peoples, who mostly engage in \"*agriculture, small-scale fishing and livestock farming*\",16 activities that are closely connected to the land they inhabit. Moreover, for them this land \"*is not only a geographical space but represents a spiritual bond for the communities*\", including as \"*the 'guardian mountains\u2019 [Apus], which represent extremely important spiritual sanctuaries for all the population in the area*.\"17\n\nAmicus Curiae Brief Submitted by the Association of Human Rights and the Environment - Puno (\"DHUMA\") and Dr. Lopez (10 June 2016) (Eng.), p. 3.\n\nibid., p. 7.\n\n17.\n\nDuring the written pleadings, this map was modified by the Respondent to mark in green all those communities that had members employed by Claimant in one of its rotational work programmes. The members of other communities were not involved in any form of employment scheme related to the Santa Ana Project. These communities, said to be opposed to the Santa Ana Project, were marked in red on this map.18\n\nExhibit R-312.\n\n18.\n\nIt is apparent that the total number of communities marked in red is significant. These communities are not only amongst those that might be affected - whether directly or indirectly - by certain negative aspects of the Project, but also those that would not benefit from it in economic terms. The map appears to show that different communities were treated in a different way, and that all groups within Claimant\u2019s own identified area of influence - whether direct or indirect - were not treated in the same manner.\n\n19.\n\nThere was ample evidence before the Tribunal that the communities who began to protest in 2008 (and in later years, including 2011) tended to be those marked in red on this second map. This suggests a correlation between the two factors, and would appear to offer a possible explanation for the adverse responses - of certain communities - to the Santa Ana Project, and the role of the Claimant. The fact that Claimant did not - on the evidence before the Tribunal - take real or sufficient steps to address those concerns and grievances, and to engage the trust of *all* potentially affected communities, appears to have contributed, at least in part, to some of the population\u2019s general discontent with the Santa Ana Project, ultimately crystallising in the spring 2011 protests. The evidence before the Tribunal shows that the Claimant was put on notice as early as 2008 that numerous communities (marked in red) had strong objections, yet the evidence before the Tribunal made clear - to me at least - that it failed to take active - or, in some instances, any - steps to address the concerns of those communities.\n\n20.\n\nOne of the expert witnesses who appeared before the Tribunal, on behalf of the Respondent, was Professor Antonio Alfonso Pe\u00f1a Jumpa. He is a Professor at the Pontificia University of Peru. He holds degrees in law and in anthropology, including a doctorate from Leuven University in Belgium. He provided a clear summary of his two expert reports, and was then cross-examined by the Claimant. I found him to be an expert witness of obvious independence, who was persuasive and credible. No one of equivalent weight was put up against him. His testimony was clear, understated, balanced, focused and - in respect of its impact on me -significant.\n\n21.\n\nShown a copy of the map showing the communities marked in red and green, Professor Pe\u00f1a Jumpa told the Tribunal that the communities and *parcialidad* shown in green squares were \"*beneficiarie* s\" of the Santa Ana Project (Challacollo, Huacullani, Ingenio, Ancomarca and Condor Ancocahua),19 in the sense that they got jobs from it. He added that \"*[t]he others, ones in red, can also be identified as communities or parcialidades*\". They included Yorohoco, Arconuma, Churhuanua, Totoroma, Sacacani, Carique Challacollo and San Juan (connected with another community), and all of these were \"*communities or parcialidades that are part of the zone*\" affected by the Project.20 Despite being, as he put it, \"*fully connected*\" to the area touched by the Project, these communities did not receive jobs related to it.21 All of these communities, in red and in green as marked on the map, were, in his view, \"*peoples concerned to the natural resources pertaining to their lands*\" within the meaning of Article 15 of the Convention,22 and thus entitled to \"*participate in the benefits of [the investor's] activities*\", as Article 15 of the Convention requires. These views were not seriously challenged by Claimant in cross-examination, or contradicted by other evidence before the Tribunal.\n\nTranscript at 1304:1-5.\n\nTranscript at 1304:17-21.\n\nTranscript at 1307:7-22.\n\nTranscript at 1383:18-1384:5.\n\n22.\n\nAs regards consultation, and the claim that the workshops and *talleres* might be sufficient to win over these communities, Professor Pe\u00f1a noted that even amongst those communities that had been given jobs \"*there was a lot of opposition*\".23 As he put it, \"*many members of Challacollo, which supposedly is one of the communities that is favored [by the Project], came out against*.\"24 This testimony was not dented in cross-examination.\n\nTranscript at 1308:8-13.\n\nTranscript at 1308:20-22.\n\n23.\n\nThe differences between the Parties on this point concerned, rather, whether all the markings on the map were to be treated as \"*communities*\". Questioned by a member of the Tribunal, the Claimant\u2019s President and Chief Executive, Mr Andrew Swarthout, asserted that:\n\n\"*the towns in these little red circles are not communities. They are actually, at least some of them I -I can't say all of them, but it looks like most of them are actually what I would describe as little ranch clusters that belong to a community... these belong to communities that we did, in fact, have talleres and workshops and consultations with, so many, if not all, of these. My colleague, Elsiario Antunez de Mayolo can better address this particular map because he has a lot more granularity in the field, but I can say that many of these do not constitute communities and, in fact, belong to communities that were in our community consult list, and we can establish that we've actually included all of these.*\"25\n\nTranscript at 542:20-543:16.\n\n24.\n\nMr Antunez de Mayolo told the Tribunal that the red circles on the map represented \"*groupings of housing units or small population centers that are within the communities*\", that \"*[t]hey are not communities but, rather, clusters of houses*.\"26 He also stated that these \"*clusters*\" were included in workshops with the four or five communities that made up the area of direct influence,27 and that the Claimant had held \"informational workshops\" for communities outside the area of direct impact.28 Yet on cross-examination Mr Antunez de Mayolo accepted that there were four communities in the Project\u2019s area of direct influence,29 and a further 32 communities in the area of indirect influence (14 in the Kelluyo District and 18 in the Huacullani District).30 Mr Antunez de Mayolo also stated that he had not been aware of opposition to the Project before he started work in April 2010, but learned of it soon after;31 and he confirmed that it was \"*likely*\" communities in the direct area who had employment in the exploration phase would be the ones \"*most supportive of the project*\"32 (with the obvious implication that he accepted that others would oppose), but that even these supportive communities \"*had concerns in connection with the Projects*.\"33 He stated too that he did not speak Aymara, the language of the communities concerned.34\n\nTranscript at 560:13-17.\n\nTranscript at 560:19-561:2.\n\nTranscript at 561:19- 562:6.\n\nTranscript at 573:19-574:2.\n\nTranscript at 574:9-11.\n\nTranscript at 576:16- 577:10.\n\nTranscript at 580:3-9.\n\nTranscript at 585:20-586:5.\n\nTranscript at 575:9-11.\n\n25.\n\nBy contrast to the apparently limited knowledge or expertise of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses and experts on matters Aymara, Professor Pe\u00f1a Jumpa offered assistance that I found to be on point, reliable and balanced. In summarising his reports, he explained that the Aymara community, which was pre-Inca and had been in this southern area of Peru for \"*a long time*\",35 had a significant relationship to the earth (Pachama in Aymara) which provides them with natural resources, and the mountains (Apus) which provide them with protection.36 The Santa Ana Project was located in an area known as Chucuito. It included several districts, of which two -Huacullani and Kelluyo - were \"*very important\"*.37 He stated that the Santa Ana Project *\"is exactly on the border between both Districts*\" but that it also goes beyond these two districts with regard to its effects, which reach into *\"adjacent areas such as Pisacoma... and... Desaguadero*\", both of which became \"*deeply involved in this conflict*\", along with other areas (Zepita, Pomata and Juli).38\n\nTranscript at 1289:14-18.\n\nTranscript at 1290:10-17.\n\nTranscript at 1292:6-7.\n\nTranscript at 1292:7-21.\n\n26.\n\nOn the limitations of the Claimant\u2019s outreach activities he stated without equivocation, on the basis of interviews he had conducted, that:\n\n\"*Bear Creek only worked with four communities and one Parcialidad in the area linked to the Mining Area. These four are Concepci\u00f3n de Ingenio, Challacollo, Ancomarca, and the urban community of Huacullani, and in addition, Condor Ancocahua is the Parcialidad. But the Company excluded ten communities identified by the mining company itself that were part of their area of influence and they were excluded as well as 12 communities from Kelluyo also located inside the area of influence that we see on the sketch.*\"39\n\nFor this reason, he concluded that:\n\n\"*Bear Creek\u2019s activities were not enough to obtain the communities\u2019 understanding and acceptance*\".40\n\nTranscript at 1293:11-22.\n\nTranscript at 1294:9-11.\n\n27.\n\nThe effect of exclusion was significant:\n\n\"*the members of the excluded communities began to protest against the Santa Ana Project. And these protests were part of a process. [which] entailed four stages: The looting and burning of the camp in 2008, the Public Hearing in 2011, the organized opposition later on after the Public Hearing, and the social explosion in the upcoming days and weeks*.\"41\n\nTranscript at 1294:13-20.\n\n28.\n\nMoreover, in his view on the basis of the materials he had reviewed, even before the looting and burning in 2008:\n\n\"*Bear Creek knew that the neighboring communities opposed the Project... [they] knew of the protests in advance... they had all this information, even a month in advance*.\"42\n\nIn his opinion the 2008 protest \"*was not an isolated terrorist act*\"43, and it was \"*not true*\" that it was an act carried out by outside forces.44 The protesters came from the Huacullani and Kelluyo districts, and others: \"*Only a small group from Huacullani supported the Project. Most of the members of the communities were against it, and that\u2019s why they participated in this act*.\"45\n\nTranscript at 1294:21-1295:1.\n\nTranscript at 1295:22.\n\nTranscript at 1296:6-8.\n\nTranscript at 1296:11-14.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimant then withdrew temporarily from the Project, returning with what they said was \"*a new strate gy*\".46 On Professor Pe\u00f1a\u2019s view, however,\n\n\"*there was no new strategy, they continued to work with the same communities and the conflict just deepened*. \"47\n\nIn other words, the evidence before the Tribunal made clear that the Claimant failed to take the lessons from a significant, early instance of protest.\n\nTranscript at 1296:15-18.\n\nTranscript at 1296:19-21.\n\n30.\n\nThe next stage commenced with the public hearing held on February 23rd, 2011. Professor Pe\u00f1a accepted that \"*a large number of members of the community participated*\", but based on interviews he concluded that \"*some were forced to go to offer tacit approval, but the great majority of the members showed discomfort and discontent with the Project*.\"48 One major problem with the meeting was that it was held in Spanish, not in Aymara.49 The evidence shows that at that meeting the affected population had \"*serious concerns*\".50\n\nTranscript at 1297:12-15.\n\nTranscript at 1297:16-1298:3.\n\nTranscript at 1298:4-6.\n\n31.\n\nThereafter,\n\n\"*[i]n March 2011, members of the Kelluyo, Huacullani, Desaguadero, Pisacoma, Zepita communities, among others met multiple times to organize the opposition and to call for the cancellation of the Santa Ana Project*.\"51\n\nMany complaints were made to public authorities, but \"*[t]here was no response by the local or regional Governments*\"52 This led to a \"*social explosion*\", starting with local protests in Huacullani in March 2011, which moved on to Desaguadero and Juli in April 2011, with the blockage of an international highway and closure of the bridge connecting Bolivia to Peru. A 48-hour regional strike followed, which offered \"*a serious warning*\" given the widespread participation, and then \"*the death of a protester from Kelluyo, [which] worsened the situation amongst the community members*. \"53 Thereafter,\n\n\"*Protests spread to cities with larger populations, they moved on to Juli, that was the capital of the Province [\u2026] finally, we see the third phase, that is the radicalization of protests, protests at the Juliaca Airport. [a]nd the Aymara protests took place in Lima.*\"54\n\nTranscript at 1298:9-13.\n\nTranscript at 1298:21-22.\n\nTranscript at 1299:3-22.\n\nTranscript at 1300:5-1301:7.\n\n32.\n\nThe narrative is a compelling one, fully supported by the totality of evidence that is available to the Tribunal. Finally, Professor Pe\u00f1a offered his conclusion as to the investor\u2019s appreciation of the situation it faced:\n\n\"*That Bear Creek, did not understand the Aymaras and they did not understand their communal relations. Despite opposition to the Project, Bear Creek continued using the same strategy that led to division amongst the communities. If Bear Creek had understood how to work properly with the communities - with the Aymara communities, the social conflict would not have reached crisis levels as we saw in the region*. \"\n\nHe adds:\n\n\"*If the mining activities had not been halted, the protests would have continued*. \"55\n\nTranscript at 1301:12-1302:2.\n\n33.\n\nIn summary, it is apparent from his testimony, which is not really contradicted by the Claimant, that the investor\u2019s outreach programme was inadequate: it failed to involve all the potentially affected communities, offering jobs only to some and engaging in consultations which were uneven and insufficient across the totality of communities. What should the Claimant have done? Professor Pe\u00f1a says the Claimant should have dealt with communities as a collective: \"*rather than focus on the communities that were close to the mining field. they should have included the other communities that they felt were affected*. \"56 He hazards the opinion that \"*had they discussed with the entire collective [of communities] and reached an agreement, it is quite likely that the answer. would have been different*.\"57 Equally, he argues, a more equal distribution of jobs, and a different approach to their being offered, would have had positive consequences:\n\n*\"The communities are interrelated. They are organized by district and province. There is a federation of comunidades campesinas in the South, and there is a federation in each of the districts. And you need to talk to the federations and say, 'This is a small project. It will focus here. We need your support so that we can distribute only 120, 150, 200 jobs. This is what we have available, and I'd like to coordinate with you how to best distribute them.*'\"58\n\nTranscript at 1357:5-8.\n\nTranscript at 1357:8-10.\n\nTranscript at 1358:11-19.\n\n34.\n\nThe lesson seems now to have been learned by the Claimant, but too late. During the hearing Mr Swarthout confirmed that in the later Corani Project the company had drawn a bigger radius for its consultations, now extending for over 50 kilometres, so as to \"*solidify a social license in a much bigger radius than normally we would feel that we should do*.\"59 I understood this as accepting, in effect, the force of Professor Pena\u2019s approach.\n\nTranscript at 539:3-13.\n\n35.\n\nFor my part, I was convinced by Professor Pe\u00f1a\u2019s testimony. I waited for an attack on its central core, but none came. On the basis of it, and the totality of the evidence before the Tribunal, it is clear that the Claimant did not do all it could have done to engage with all the affected communities, especially after the initial protests in 2008. That evidence also makes clear that the Claimant failed to acknowledge that those events were motivated, in significant part, by the fact that certain affected (or potentially affected) communities had serious concerns with the Project because of its potential environmental risks, and because they felt themselves to be excluded from its benefits. The Claimant failed to draw the obvious and necessary conclusions from the early indications of opposition in 2008, in particular the need to improve its community outreach and relations.\n\n36.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the helpful *amicus curiae* submission of DHUMA. This contended that Claimant\u2019s failure to engage in proper community relations contributed to the losses it suffered, noting also that members of certain communities felt unable to participate in the public meeting in February 2011, as there was only limited space available.60 In its Reply to the *amicus*, the Claimant criticised DHUMA\u2019s written submissions, *inter alia*, for being biased and unsubstantiated,61 and it described DHUMA as representing a \"*radical anti-mining position*\".62 Claimant is of course entitled not to share the policies or objectives of DHUMA, but given its investment in a project located thousands of miles from its home, in an area populated by local communities who are recognised by ILO Convention 169 and other rules of international law as having legitimate interests in the use of their lands, it may want to reflect on its approach to such interests. As an international investor the Claimant has legitimate interests and rights under international law; local communities of indigenous and tribal peoples also have rights under international law, and these are not lesser rights. In my view, DHUMA assisted the Tribunal \"*by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties*. \"63 Its participation in these proceedings was helpful and polite at all times, and added to perceptions of the legitimacy of ICSID proceedings of this kind.\n\nAmicus Curiae Brief, p. 6.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply to Amici (18 August 2016), p. 2.\n\nibid.\n\nICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, Rule 37(2).\n\n37.\n\nAs regards the role of the Respondent, it too has legitimate interests and rights, including respect for the rights of the Claimant under the Canada-Peru FTA. By the means in which Decree 032-2011 was adopted, and perhaps also for the failure to respond effectively to the complaints received in 2011, as noted by Professor Pe\u00f1a, it bears a significant share of the responsibilities. It may be the function of a State or its central government to deliver a domestic law framework that ensures that a consultation process and outcomes are consistent with Article 15 of ILO Convention 169, but it is not their function to hold an investor\u2019s hand and deliver a \"social license\" out of those processes. It is for the investor to obtain the \"social license\", and in this case it was unable to do so largely because of its own failures. The Canada-Peru FTA is not, any more than ICSID, an insurance policy against the failure of an inadequately prepared investor to obtain such a license.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s contribution to the events that led to Supreme Decree 032-2011-EM being adopted has implications for the amount of damages to be awarded. As set out in the Award,64 by the time Supreme Decree 032 was adopted the prospects for the Santa Ana Project were already dismal, if indeed they continued to exist at all. Many environmental and other permits were still to be granted, and the nature and extent of the opposition made it clear that there was no real possibility of the Project soon obtaining the necessary \"social license\". For this reason, the proper measure of damages for the unlawful effects of Supreme Decree 032 is, as the Award makes clear, to be assessed by reference to the financial contribution made to the Project.\n\nAward, paras. 155- 202.\n\n39.\n\nThat financial contribution amounted to US$ 18,237,592. I conclude that the Claimant\u2019s contribution was significant and material, and that its responsibilities are no less than those of the government. For this reason I would reduce the measure of damages by one half, to US$ 9,118,796.\n\n40.\n\nThis has consequences on the allocation of the costs of this arbitration. As I have laid out in this Dissenting Opinion, I am of the view that the actions of the Claimant and Respondent have contributed to the demise of the Project. It is for this reason that I do not share the Majority\u2019s reasoning at paragraphs 730-736 of the Award. Instead, I believe that the costs of these proceedings should be split equally between the Parties.\n\n41.\n\nThe only other point I wish to make concerns the legitimate right of a Party to the Canada-Peru FTA \"*to regulate and to exercise its police power in the interests of public welfare\"65* a point made by Canada in its submission.66 The Majority has ruled at paragraph 473 that Article 2201.1 of the FTA, which provides for a list of exceptions that fall within a State\u2019s legitimate exercise of its police powers, is exhaustive. I do not disagree with this analysis, but wish to make clear that my support for this conclusion is without prejudice to the application of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which deals with acts of Necessity. As the Annulment Committees in *CMS* and *Sempra* made clear, the operation of a *lex specialis* in a BIT does not have the effect (unless the BIT explicitly provides otherwise) of precluding the operation of Article 25, which continues to function as a \"*secondary rule of international law*\" operating even when an exception under the *lex specialis* is not available.67 In the present case, the conditions of Article 25 are not met because the act in question - the revocation of Supreme Decree 083-2007 - was not *\"the only way for [Peru] to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril*\". As noted above, and in the Award, other options were available, including suspension of Decree 83-2007. Nevertheless, whatever the requirements of the FTA, the possibility of having recourse to Article 25, as a rule precluding wrongfulness, is not excluded by the FTA.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, *Suez InterAgua v The Argentine Republic*, Decision on Liability (30 July 2010), para. 128.\n\nSubmission of Canada Pursuant to Article 832 of the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (9 June 2016), para. 5.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, *CMS Gas Transmission Company v The Argentine Republic*, Annulment Decision (25 September 2007), paras. 133-134;

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. THE DISPUTE AND THE PARTIES**\n----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 dispute concerns Claimant\u2019s alleged investments in Peru, including the Santa Ana silver mining project and the alleged associated legal and contractual rights. Claimant contends that Respondent has failed to afford Claimant\u2019s investment in Peru the protections set out in the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Peru (\"FTA\").1 Respondent contests the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and argues that Claimant\u2019s claims are unfounded on the merits.2\n\nRfA \u00b6 2.\n\nR.Prov.M.-I \u00b6 18, n. 37; *PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v. Independent State of Papua New Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, Jan. 21, 2015 \u00b6\u00b6 124 - 125 **[RLA-002]**.\n\n2.\n\nClaimant in this arbitration is Bear Creek Mining Corporation (\"Bear Creek\"), a company duly incorporated under the laws of Canada, with its headquarters located at 625 Howe Street, Suite 1050, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T5.\n\n3.\n\nRespondent in this arbitration is the Republic of Peru (\"Peru\"), a sovereign state with an address for service as Dr. Ricardo Ampuero Llerena, President, Special Commission Representing the Republic of Peru in International Investment Disputes, Ministry of Economy and Finance of Peru, Jr. Cuzco 177, Lima, Peru.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S TERMINOLOGY AND REASONING**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal has sought to make a consistent use of terminology. This does not reflect the Tribunal\u2019s understanding of a particular issue or a propensity to the views of one or the other party. Likewise, the order in which sources or references are presented is not intended to reflect a particular source\u2019s value. Instead, effort has been made to list the arguments, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, in a logical fashion and to format the footnotes consistently so as to reference all relevant exhibits presented by the Parties.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal has given careful consideration to the extensive factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their written and oral submissions. The Tribunal has also reviewed the submissions from *amicus curiae* and from the Government of Canada. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to reiterate all such arguments, but rather addresses those arguments which it considers most relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal\u2019s reasons, without repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties, address what the Tribunal considers to be the determinative factors required to decide on the requests of the Parties. The Tribunal considers, however, that a brief repetition of certain aspects of its conclusions in the context of particular issues is appropriate.\n\n**II. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn August 11, 2014, Claimant appointed Dr. Michael Pryles, a national of Australia, as arbitrator.

Which national and international legal provisions are applicable to informing that standard?*\n\n*ii. Insofar as the State authorities have any discretion in this regard, what are the limits?*\n\n*iii. What actions were legally required of Claimant in seeking to obtain a Social License, and did the Claimant take these actions?*\n\n*iv. In the present case, what were the State authorities\u2019 responsibilities in relation to obtaining a Social License?*\n\n*v. As a matter of law, what are the consequences that follow from an absence of support on the part of one or more relevant communities, or parts thereof, in relation to this investment?*\n\n*b) Did the Claimant make all required disclosures in making its application for a Public Necessity Decree? If not, what are the consequences for this case, including for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal?*\n\n*c) What was the basis for the decision to issue Supreme Decree 032, and on what evidence did the State authorities rely?*\n\n*d) Of the two reasons relied upon by Respondent for Decree 032, could that Decree also have been legally issued, if only one of the two reasons could be established:*\n\n*i. only the alleged illegality of the Claimant\u2019s Application?*\n\n*ii. or only the unrest as it existed at that time?*\n\n*e) What are the monetary amounts that the Tribunal should award to the Claimant if it were to conclude that:*\n\n*i. the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment was lawfully expropriated?*\n\n*ii. the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment was unlawfully expropriated?*\n\n*iii. Respondent breached its obligations under the FTA for FET or other obligations under other provisions of the FTA?*\n\n*iv. if the Tribunal was to find that the Claimant had contributed to the social unrest that occurred in the spring of 2011 - by act or omission - how should such a contribution be taken into account in determining matters of liability and/or quantum?*\n\n*f) Was the Claimant denied due process in the procedure leading to the promulgation of Supreme Decree 032, or otherwise?*\n\n97.\n\nOn September 29, 2016, DHUMA wrote to the Tribunal in response to the Hearing.\n\n98.\n\nOn November 2, 2016, the Parties submitted their agreed corrections to the Hearing transcripts.

A declaration that Peru has violated the FTA;*\n\n*ii. A declaration that Peru\u2019s actions and omissions at issue and those of its instrumentalities for which it is internationally responsible are unlawful, constitute a nationalization or expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation, failed to treat Bear Creek\u2019s investments fairly and equitably and to afford full protection and security to Bear Creek\u2019s investments and impaired Bear Creek\u2019s investments through unreasonable and discriminatory measures;*\n\n*iii.

The characterization of many events described herein is in dispute and, accordingly, each Party\u2019s views are separately summarized.\n\n120.\n\nOn August 31, 1999, Claimant incorporated under the name 4271 Investments Ltd. in Canada.14 It changed its name to EVEolution Ventures the following month.15 In 2002, EVEolution Ventures Inc continued on to Canada where it became Bear Creek Mining Corporation (\"Claimant\").16 In 2003, Claimant acquired Peru Exploration Ventures LLP - a company that was formed as a limited partnership in Arizona by senior geologists and mining executives led by Andrew T. Swarthout for the purpose of acquiring, exploring, developing, and selling mineral properties in Peru.17 In 2004, Claimant continued to British Columbia, Canada, where it is domiciled and has since been in good standing.18\n\nC-I \u00b6 104; Bear Creek Mining Corporation Annual Information Form for year ended Dec. 1, 2013, Apr. 3, 2014 at 1 **[C-0023]**.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.; C-I \u00b6 19; Press Release, Bear Creek Mining Corporation, TSX Venture Exchange, *EVEolution Ventures to acquire Peru Exploration Ventures LLP*, May 30, 2002 **[C-0022]** ; Witness Statement of Andrew T.

At the time, the Peruvian military opined that the Santa Ana investment did not constitute a public necessity due to concerns of security and national defense.23 The Parties dispute whether this denial was due to Apex being a Bolivian company.24\n\nTr. 1852 - 1853 (R.

Claimant explains that mining rights in Peru are granted to those who first request them, thereby generating the risk that, by applying for the Supreme Decree, Claimant would alert Peruvian individuals and companies to the existence of potential mineral deposits, thereby enabling them to obtain the corresponding rights before Claimant.28 Respondent, however, states that Claimant could have acquired the concessions by applying for them in its own name and then submitting the request for concessions, which would have paused the concession application until either Claimant obtained the public necessity decree or affirmatively abandoned its claim to the concessions. In doing so, Claimant would have maintained its priority *vis-\u00e0-vis* the concessions, but would have had to wait until the Article 71 Supreme Decree process had completed.29\n\nRfA \u00b6 13; R.Prov.M.-I \u00b6 7.\n\nR-II \u00b6 75.\n\n126.\n\nClaimant states that, in order to maximize its chances of ultimately securing the mining rights related to these deposits, Claimant agreed with Ms. Villavicencio that she would secure these mineral rights while Claimant requested and until it obtained the authorization required under Article 71 of the Peruvian Constitution.30 Respondent characterizes this as Claimant using Ms. Villavicencio to act as a front to hold the concessions for Claimant.31\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 390; RfA \u00b6 14; C-I \u00b6 25; R.Prov.M.-II \u00b6 7; R-I \u00b6 213; First Session at 21:19 - 21:36 (\"*Bear Creek agreed with Ms. Karina Villavicencio, a Peruvian national and employee of Bear Creek of Peru that she would secure these mineral rights while the company requested and until it obtained the authorization required under Article 71 of the Peruvian Constitution*.\"); *Ministry of Energy and Mines v.

Summary of Facts Presented by DHUMA and Dr. L\u00f3pez**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\n*Amici's* summary of their first submission is best taken from their own words:\n\n*1. [...] Bear Creek did not do what was necessary to understand the doubts, worries and anxieties and the Aymara culture and religiosity, and did not do the necessary to identify and assess the risks that their own operations could entail for the population and their rights over their lands and water. The company acted as if it were sufficient to promise benefits to some of the people and communities in the areas surrounding the project, to hold public meetings announcing their plans without needing to work closely with the communities, listening to their doubts and comments, explaining that the risks were minimal (if they truly were minimal), or that there would be benefits (if there really were). The actions that Bear Creek failed to carry out do not involve a simple strategy of community relations but correspond to international standards that Bear Creek should have known about and complied with but did not.*\n\n*2. Based on their own sources, conversations with the population itself and databases, the Amici can affirm that the communities, particularly those not directly affected by the project, in the districts of Huacullani, Kelluyo, Zepita, Desaguadero, Pisacoma and others, believed that Bear Creek was not being transparent and sincere with them, and that it was doing everything possible to carry out its project without regard to the concerns or opinions of the population. In those circumstances the communities felt compelled to fight to preserve their territories, their land (the Pachamama) and their sources of water, all of them necessary for their lives. If Bear Creek had approached the situation differently, perhaps the situation would also have been different.*\n\n*3. [\u2026] Bear Creek did not obtain the social license to develop its project at the time and at present still does not have it. [\u2026] there is no legitimacy, trust or consent of the parties. The conflict started due to a lack of transparency and misinformation on the part of Bear Creek (or Mrs. Villavicencio), a lack of respect for the peasant communities and respect for the rights of indigenous peoples. The population\u2019s frustration and anger only abated when the Santa Ana project was cancelled.*219\n\nAmicus Curiae Brief Submitted by the Association of Human Rights and the Environment - Puno (\"DHUMA\") and Dr. Lopez (Jun. 10, 2016) (Eng.), p. 17.\n\n219.\n\nThe districts of Huacullani and Kelluyo in the province of Chucuito are the two districts most directly affected by the Santa Ana Project. In Huacullani, 80.5% of the population is rural and 89.2% lives in poverty. In Kelluyo, 82% is rural and 79.4% lives in poverty. Approximately 80% of the population are native Aymara speakers and, although they state that they speak Spanish, they are not fluent in Spanish, especially with regard to professional or technical terms.220 The peasant communities in the south of Puno are made up of people that ethnically and culturally belong to the Aymara group. Their principal economic activities are agriculture, fishing, and livestock farming. They are aware that mining has impacted these kinds of activities in other parts of Peru.221\n\n*Id*. at p. 2 (*citing* Qui\u00f1ones, Patricia, \"Concesiones, participaci\u00f3n y conflicto en Puno. El caso del proyecto minero Santa Ana\", in: Los limites de la expansi\u00f3n minera en el Per\u00fa, Servicio de Educaci\u00f3n Rural- SER, 2013, p. 25 -26).\n\n*Id*. at p. 3.\n\n220.\n\nIn 2000, the province of Chucuito had no mining concessions. By 2011, it had 59. Thus, the province and population were not familiar with mining activities and did not have much information regarding mining. This unawareness and lack of information generated distrust and rejection of mining activities.222\n\n*Id*.\n\n221.\n\nThe Santa Ana Project was the first mining project to be developed in the south of Chucuito. Although the Project began in 2002, the authorities in Huacullani first began to be aware of the Project in 2004, when Ms. Villavicencio held a meeting with the mayor of Huacullani to request support for the annulment or resizing of the Lupaca Reserve, for mining. Ms. Villavicencio introduced herself as the owner of the concession, but actually did not obtain the mining titles until 2006. The information given in the meeting was misleading and confusing and Ms. Villavicencio never explained her relationship or intentions with Claimant. In 2008, most of the population knew about this and this provoked a widespread rejection of mining projects, especially the Santa Ana Project. Claimant failed to obtain the approval of the population for its then-current and future operations, and created distrust, misinformation, and conflict in the communities.223 This led to the social protest in the Aymara peasant communities during 2011, one of the central demands of which was the repeal of Supreme Decree 083.224\n\n*Id*. at p. 11.\n\n*Id*. at p. 3 - 4.\n\n222.\n\nDue to their ever-increasing fears and suspicions, a large number of people from peasant communities held a meeting on October 14, 2008 to speak with Claimant\u2019s representatives about the Santa Ana Project. Claimant\u2019s representatives did not attend the meeting, so those present decided to go to the Santa Ana mining camp. On the way there, their anger grew. This incursion ended with part of Claimant\u2019s mining camp being burned and destroyed.225\n\n*Id*. at p. 5 (*citing* police report in File No. 2009-0084-0-2104-JM-PE-01 of the First Mixed Jurisdiction Court of the Province of Chucuito).\n\n223.\n\nIn Aymara culture, the act of receiving a gift creates a moral obligation of reciprocity. A Lieutenant Governor remarked to DHUMA that Claimant\u2019s staff \"*had made personal invitations to communal authorities in their homes, offering them gifts such as bread and fruit*\" and that these authorities were reciprocating by attending the presentation of the ESIA.226\n\n*Id*. at p. 5.\n\n224.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, there was an information workshop on the ESIA, which DHUMA members attended. During the event, the population sought to clarify doubts about the Santa Ana Project. None of their doubts regarding social, environmental, or cultural impacts of the Project were dispelled. In addition, the building where the meeting was located was too small for many interested people to participate. Less than half of the number of people recorded actually attended. Participants were also turned off by having to register at the entrance and when doing so, receiving a gift bag containing a poncho and a cap with the company logo. Many did not understand the consequences or implications of registering. Hundreds of people were unable to participate and, thus, inhabitants protested and suggested that the workshop could be held in the main square in Huacullani so that they could participate. This request was denied.227 It is estimated that between 400 and 500 people who could not participate inside at the meeting protested the Project outside, worried about contamination to land and water.228\n\n*Id*. at p. 5 - 6.\n\n*Id*. at p. 7 - 8 (*citing* Brief addressed to Ministry of Energy and Mines, by the President of Lieutenant Governors of Kelluyo and another, dated 22 Mar. 2011).\n\n225.\n\nThe ESIA presentation was given in Spanish and used technical language. The translation into Aymara was poor. Claimant required that questions from participants be made in writing and in Spanish, which is not common practice in the Andean world, where daily communication is oral and in Aymara. This made it difficult for participants to express their views. When people did raise questions in oral form - questions related to contamination and to benefits from mining - the answers were highly technical and were poorly translated. During the hearing, many people expressed their distrust for the company. Although those present who opposed the Project were relatively quiet and did not interrupt the hearing or show their anger, it was clear that they were against the Project.229\n\n*Id*. at p. 6 - 7.\n\n226.\n\nThe Aymara have a deep respect for mother earth (*Pachamama*) and it is their responsibility to protect her. Concerns regarding change to the natural landscape, the integrity of their territories, and the negative effects on their sanctuaries and culture could not be attended at the presentation. These concerns, however, were shared by other communities that form part of the districts of Kelluyo, Pisacoma, Desaguadero, Zepita, and others. The possibility that the mining Project - an open pit - would have an impact on water was a great concern. Peru is concerned about water scarcity and the Aymara population depends on water resources.230\n\n*Id*. at p. 7 - 8 (*citing* Servindi 16 Jan. 2014).\n\n227.\n\nAlready in 2008 and 2011, a company was responsible for respecting all human rights and, as part of that responsibility, it had the obligation to obtain consent of the local population to its operations in order to ensure its own sustainability.231 Claimant knew or should have known about these human rights standards, but either ignored them or failed to put them into practice.232 The concept of a \"*social license*\" is closely related to the responsibilities of business enterprises to respect human rights. For a social license to exist, there must be legitimacy, trust, and consent - none of which existed or exist with regard to the Santa Ana Project.233\n\n*Id*. at p. 12 (*citing* Protect Respect and Remedy: a Framework for Business and Human Rights on the Issue of Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprizes, John Ruggie, UN Doc A/HRC/8/5, 7 Apr. 2008).\n\n*Id*. at p. 12 - 14.\n\n*Id*. at p. 16 (*citing* Morrison, John The Social License: How to Keep your Organization Legitimate. Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, p. 19).\n\n228.\n\nAs a result of the hearing on the ESIA, a number of communities decided to start a protest movement against mining in general and, particularly, against the Santa Ana Project.234 The indigenous socioenvironmental protest - the \"*Amyarazo*\" - began in March 2011. The Aymara population demanded repeal of Supreme Decree 083, application and respect for the right of prior consultation, and suspension of all mining concessions in southern Puno. Mr. Aduviri acted as a spokesman for the deep dissatisfaction and concern that already existed in the population due to information regarding other mining projects and the lack of information and transparency with regard to the Santa Ana Project. The protests took place away from the Santa Ana Project so that the protesters would be heard. DHUMA\u2019s role in the protests was to promote peace and non-violence. The protests would not end until the Santa Ana Project was cancelled.235\n\n*Id*. at p. 8.\n\n*Id*. at p. 9 - 10.\n\n229.\n\nCurrently, 18 of the leaders that participated in the protests are under criminal investigation.236\n\n*Id*. at p. 11 (*citing* Second Preparatory Investigation Court, File N 682-2011).\n\n230.\n\nAfter the Hearing and with the Tribunal\u2019s permission, DHUMA wrote to the Tribunal in response to statements made by Claimant. DHUMA confirmed its *Amici* submission and offered to provide copies of supporting documents and objects - including the ponchos and caps received at Claimant\u2019s 2011 public hearing - to the Tribunal. DHUMA conveyed the continuous and profound concern of the Comunidades Campesinas of Puno about the development of the Santa Ana Project and other mining projects in the Puno region, and the risk that those will contaminate the environment and threaten the existence and culture of indigenous communities.237\n\nLetter submitted by DHUMA (Sept. 29, 2016).\n\n**2.

Since DHUMA representatives have refused to appear as witnesses in these proceedings, Claimant will not have the opportunity to cross-examine them and the Tribunal will not have the opportunity to assess the veracity of their claims. The Tribunal should, therefore, not give any weight to the *Amicus* Submission.238\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply to Amici (Aug. 18, 2016) \u00b6 4; CPHB-I \u00b6 20; R.

The hearing was held at the largest available locale. Respondent\u2019s list of participants shows that at least 729 community members attended. Claimant set up a canopied area with chairs, giant screens, and speakers, more than doubling the venue\u2019s capacity. This enabled people who were not registered to see and hear all of the presentations and questions. There was no contemporaneous indication that the venue was insufficient. The translation was provided by a well-known Aymara professional who had provided interpretation services in other workshops. There were no restrictions on questions being asked orally or in writing and questions were accepted in Spanish and Aymara, and were translated accordingly. DHUMA\u2019s claim that there were many cases in which certain individuals were not allowed to speak or ask questions is unfounded and DHUMA has failed to indicate who has been prevented from speaking. It is unclear from where DHUMA has gathered its \"*facts*\" and it is unclear what basis DHUMA has for alleging that there was a deep feeling of dissatisfaction in most of the attendees at the public hearing. Claimant provided statements of other community members who were unaware of discontent. There is no support for DHUMA\u2019s contention that there was a demonstration of 400 or 500 people following the hearing. Contemporaneous documentation issued by Respondent indicates the opposite - it confirms that the public hearing \"*ended satisfactorily*.\"241\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply to Amici (Aug. 18, 2016) \u00b6\u00b6 6 - 12; CPHB-I \u00b6 21; Minutes of the Public Hearing - Mineral Subsector No. 007-2011/MEM-AAM - Public Hearing for the EIA of the \"Santa Ana\" Project, Feb. 23, 2011 **[C-0076]** ; Ministry of Energy and Mines, Press Release 093-2011, Mar. 2, 2011 **[C-0328]** ; Letter from Braulio Morales Choquecachua and Faustino Limatapa Musaja, Aug. 8, 2016 **[C-0329]** ; Letter from King & Spalding and Miranda & Amado, inviting Messrs.

According to *Amici*, it was Respondent\u2019s grant of a large number of mining concessions in the territories of the indigenous communities that triggered an anti-mining sentiment in the population of Puno. Even if *Amici's* allegations regarding failed communication about the grant of mining concessions to Ms. Villavicencio or the issuance of Supreme Decree 083 were true, it would be evidence of Respondent\u2019s failure. Respondent is responsible for informing its citizens of State decisions, acts of public administration, and their effects. If Respondent was required but failed to consult with local communities before granting rights over their lands, either by awarding the Santa Ana mining concessions to Ms. Villavicencio or by issuing Supreme Decree 083, and if Respondent failed to inform these communities after it granted these rights, then any resulting fallout from this lack of communication and transparency falls on Respondent, not Claimant. Ms. Villavicencio followed the procedures set forth under Peruvian law for applying for the mining concessions, and Claimant followed the mandated procedures for obtaining a declaration of public necessity.243\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply to Amici (Aug. 18, 2016) \u00b6\u00b6 13 - 15.\n\n237.\n\nThe *Aymarazo* highlights the local population\u2019s dissatisfaction with the Government, although *Amici* try to blame events on Claimant. Throughout, *Amici* repeat their position that the protests were intended to engage Peruvian authorities. On the *Amici's* own account, the protests were spawned by the failures of Respondent and sought to attract Respondent\u2019s attention. The political, antiGovernment nature of the protests is also confirmed by the looting and burning of various public institutions in Puno on May 26, 2011.

Respondent then developed a \"*Citizen Participation Process*\", through which the State and the mining company share information about the Project with local communities who may then voice their concerns to the State and the company.246 Respondent, through DGAAM, was responsible for guiding, directing, and conducting the Citizen Participation Process and for ensuring that the local communities fully participate in the process.247 Claimant followed the applicable Peruvian legal framework and Respondent approved of its activities, as evidenced by MINEM\u2019s endorsement of Claimant\u2019s CPP and its approval of the delimitation of the Project\u2019s Area of Influence.248 Respondent did not inform Claimant of any concern it may have had regarding community relations in Santa Ana.249\n\nPO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4 (a), *supra* \u00b6 96.\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6 1.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 27; CPHB-II \u00b6 25; Tr. 1066:19-21, 1083:3-17, 1089:9-19 (Ram\u00edrez Delpino); Ministerial Resolution Regulating the Citizen Participation Process in the Mining Subsector, Ministerial Resolution No. 304-2008-MEM-DM Art. 1 **[R-153]** ; Regulation on Citizen Participation on the Mining Subsector, Supreme Decree No. 028-2008-EM Art. 1, 2.2, 3, 7, 12, 17 **[R-159]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6 2; Tr. 1060:9-12, 1068 - 1069, 1073, 1080:20 - 1081:1 (Ram\u00edrez Delpino); Tr. 1159, 1222 (Flury); Informe No. 013-2011-MEM-AAM/WAL/AD/KVS, Jan. 7, 2011 **[C-0161]** ; Regulation on Citizen Participation on the Mining Subsector, Supreme Decree No. 028-2008-EM Art. 4 **[R-159]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6 6; Tr. 571:8-12 (Mayolo); Informe No. 013-2011-MEM-AAM/WAL/AD/KVS, Jan. 7, 2011 **[C-0161]** ; DGAAM\u2019s Observations to Bear Creek\u2019s EIA for Exploitation, Report No. 399-2011-MEM-AAM/WAL/JCV/CMC/JST/KVS/AD p. 7 **[R-040]**.\n\n239.\n\n*Amici* have failed to identify any concrete violations of specific legal requirements or standards. *Amici's* blanket statement that Claimant failed to engage in a positive relationship with surrounding communities ignores Claimant\u2019s outreach programs and efforts, which Respondent approved and certified as being in compliance with applicable standards and legal requirements.

In March 2011, representatives of the Huacullani District denounced FDRN protests and the March 20, 2011 ordinance purporting to prohibit all mining activities in the Department of Puno. Prior to Respondent\u2019s enactment of Supreme Decree 032, the Peruvian Government supervised and endorsed Claimant\u2019s community relations program for the Santa Ana Project every step of the way. Even after Respondent issued Supreme Decree 032, members of the communities asked OEFA about when the Santa Ana Project would return. Local authorities wrote to the Peruvian Government requesting the return of the Project. Community members maintain that Claimant\u2019s community relations programs were successful.270\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6 22; CPHB-II \u00b6\u00b6 37; Tr. 1124 - 1125 (Ram\u00edrez Delpino); DGAAM\u2019s Observations to Bear Creek\u2019s EIA for Exploitation, Report No. 399-2011-MEM-AAM/WAL/JCV/CMC/JST/KVS/AD pp. 2 - 6 **[R-040]**.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply to Amici (Aug. 18, 2016) \u00b6\u00b6 23 - 26; CPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 23; CPHB-II \u00b6\u00b6 30, 39; Bear Creek Mining Corporation, *Community Engagement* [ **C-067]** ; Bear Creek Mining Corporation, *Community Initiatives* **[C-068]** ; *Rechazan intervenci\u00f3n de dirigentes de zonas aleda\u00f1as en tema de minera Santa Ana,* LOS ANDES, Mar. 29, 2011 **[C-0083]** ; Memorandum from Members of the Huacullani District to the Prime Minister of Per\u00fa, MINEM and Bear Creek Mining, *Memorial Por El Desarollo y La Incluci\u00f3n*, May 15, 2013 **[C-0118]** ; Memorandum from Members of the Huacuallni District to MINEM, *Reactivaci\u00f3n del Proyecto Santa Ana*, Oct. 27, 2013 **[C-0119]** ; Memorandum from Members of the Huacuallni District to Prime Minister of Per\u00fa, MINEM and Bear Creek Mining, *Reiterativo Por El Desarollo y La Inclusi\u00f3n*, Jan. 24, 2014 **[C-0120]** ; Agreement between Condor Aconcagua and Bear Creek, May 23, 2009 **[C-0177]** ; Acta de Supervisi\u00f3n Ambiental, Nov. 25, 2011 **[C-0179]** ; OEFA Report No. 0011-2011 MA-SR/CONSORCIO STA regarding the Santa Ana Project, Dec. 31, 2011 **[C-0180]** ; Letter from the Primer Teniente Gobernador of the Huacullani District to Juan Jos\u00e9 Alvares Delgado, Puno Regional Council, Apr. 4, 2011 **[C-0181]** ; Letter from the Primer Teniente Gobernador of the Huacullani District to Mauricio Rodr\u00edguez Rodr\u00edguez, President of the Puno Regional Government, Apr. 4, 2011 **[C-0182]** ; *Comunidades de Huacullani Apoyan a Minera Santa Ana*, Correo Puno Prensa Peru, Mar. 23, 2011 **[C-0184]** ; *Huacullani en contra de marcha antiminera*, La Rep\u00fablica, Mar. 29, 2011 **[C-0185]** ; Acta de Asamblea General Extraordinaria de la Comunidad Campesina de Concepci\u00f3n de Ingenio, Apr. 2, 2011 **[C-0186]** ; 2013 MacCormick Social Responsibility Index **[C-0230]** ; Letter from Sixto Vilcanqui Mamani, Aug. 8, 2016 **[C-0331]**.\n\n245.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s allegation that Claimant only worked with 5 of the 26 communities that it had identified in its December 2006 Supreme Decree Application, Claimant states that it worked with 18 communities within the Project\u2019s direct and indirect areas of influence and held meetings with national, regional, and local authorities.271\n\nCPHB-II \u00b6\u00b6 31 - 32; CPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 13 - 14; RPHB-I \u00b6 39; Request from Bear Creek to MINEM soliciting the authorization to acquire mining rights located in the border area, Dec. 4, 2006 (UPDATE submitted with C-III) **[C-0017]** ; DGAAM\u2019s Observations to Bear Creek\u2019s EIA for Exploitation, Report No. 399-2011-MEM-AAM/WAL/JCV/CMC/JST/KVS/AD p. 7 **[R-040]** ; Bullard Second Report \u00b6 18 **[CEX-005]** ; Texto \u00danico de Procedimientos Administrativos del Ministerio de Energ\u00eda y Minas **[Bullard 034]**.\n\n246.\n\nIn its closing argument, Claimant maintained that it had the social license to operate: (1) MINEM had approved Claimant\u2019s CPP and the Executive Summary of its ESIA, (2) OEFA confirmed that the relationship was harmonious, (3) there were no problems with the Public Hearing, and (4) as of April 2011, there had been no protests against Claimant.

Consistent with the manual from MINEM, Claimant thus concentrated their outreach near the communities closest to the Project and so as not to create false expectations for those further away.274\n\nTr. 1781 - 1784, 1794 - 1795 (C.

Respondent\u2019s Response to** ***Amici*** **Submission and Tribunal\u2019s Question (a)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the DHUMA Submission presents a new perspective on two central points of dispute: (1) whether Claimant caused or contributed to the social unrest that engulfed the Puno region and (2) whether Claimant lived up to international norms for interactions with indigenous communities. DHUMA is clear on both points: Claimant failed to obtain approval of the local population for its current and future operations and, through its own actions, contributed to distrust, misinformation, and conflict in the communities.281 The summary of Respondent\u2019s response to the DHUMA Submission is best taken from its own words:\n\n*The DHUMA Submission, as a voice for the affected Aymara communities themselves, is a helpful resource for the Tribunal as it evaluates Claimant\u2019s conduct and its contributions to the events of 2011. DHUMA\u2019s Submission testifies directly to Claimant\u2019s insufficient social outreach and the dire consequences that that failure had for Claimant\u2019s Santa Ana project. From the beginning, Bear Creek\u2019s interactions with the communities have been defective, due to their myopic focus on delivering limited benefits to only those communities whose land Bear Creek needed to directly occupy for its project. Bear Creek ignored, or at the very least failed to address sufficiently, broadly held community concerns about environmental contamination and availability of scarce water resources. The DHUMA Submission makes it clear that Claimant failed to comply with international standards or to acquire the social license necessary to operate a large-scale mining project. DHUMA explains that the result of Claimant\u2019s conduct was that the Aymara communities rebelled violently against Bear Creek\u2019s presence in the Puno region. The DHUMA Submission is therefore a critical portion of the record before this Tribunal as it assesses Claimant\u2019s conduct.*282\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments to DHUMA Submission (Aug. 18, 2016) p. 1.\n\n*Id*. at p. 15; *see also* RPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9.\n\n252.\n\nAs DHUMA explained, it has worked directly with the Aymara communities for nearly 30 years. DHUMA\u2019s daily interactions with the Aymara communities make it uniquely qualified to understand the communities\u2019 rejection of the Santa Ana Project, and place it in a position to explain this rejection to the Tribunal. DHUMA staff also participated in the February 2011 public hearing and DHUMA\u2019s President, Sister Patricia Ryan, was in the city of Puno during the 2011 protests and actively sought to keep the Aymara protests peaceful and non-violent.283\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments to DHUMA Submission (Aug. 18, 2016) p. 2 - 3; *see also* RPHB-I \u00b6 6; Derechos Humanos y Medio Ambiente - Puno Website **[R-438]** ; Maryknoll Sisters Website.\n\n253.\n\nThe DHUMA Submission shows that Claimant caused the social unrest in Puno when it failed to alleviate community concerns about environmental degradation. From the outset, Claimant created a climate of misinformation and distrust in various groups of the Aymara communities in the area. This is clear from DHUMA\u2019s description of a May 18, 2004 meeting between Ms. Villavicencio and Huacullani authorities to discuss re-sizing the Aymara Lupaca Reserve. This distrust and misinformation continued and, according to DHUMA, several communities were unaware until February 2008 that their territory would soon be occupied by a mining company. DHUMA confirms that after the acquisition became known in October 2008, members of the communities sought dialogue with Claimant\u2019s representatives. When these requests were ignored, community members travelled to the Santa Ana campsite where they threatened Claimant\u2019s employees and set fire to the campsite. The DHUMA Submission makes it clear that, from the outset, Claimant failed to assuage community concerns about the presence of a large-scale mine on community lands.284\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments to DHUMA Submission (Aug. 18, 2016) p. 3 - 6; SUNARP Registration Notice of the Transfer Agreement for Santa Ana Concessions 9A, 1, 2 and 3, Feb. 1, 2008 **[C-0020]** ; Letter from Bear Creek to Mr. Ram\u00edrez, May 11, 2011 **[C-0172]** ; Letter from the Regional President of Puno to the Minister of Energy and Mines, Letter No. 520-2011-GR-PUNO/PR (4/26/2011) **[R-018]** ; Agreements Between Bear Creek and Local Communities **[R-043]** ; Directorial Resolution Granting KARINA 1 Mining Concession to Jenny Villavicencio, Directorial Resolution No. 1856-2006-INACC/J **[R-276]** ; Directorial Resolution Granting KARINA 9A Mining Concession to Jenny Villavicencio, Directorial Resolution No. 2459-2006-INACC/J (6/13/2006) **[R-277]** ; Letter from Bear Creek to the DGAAM on the 2008 Campsite Burning (Dec.11, 2008) **[R-294]** ; Meeting Minutes of the Public and Communal Authorities and the General Population of the District of Huacullani **[R-421]** ; Bear Creek Press Release **[R-429]** ; Swarthout First Statement \u00b6\u00b6 17 - 18 **[CWS-1]** ; Swarthout Second Statement \u00b6\u00b6 35 - 36 **[CWS-6]**.\n\n254.\n\nThe DHUMA Submission contradicts Claimant\u2019s assertion that it received overwhelming support during the February 2011 public hearing. DHUMA representatives attended this hearing and reject Claimant\u2019s assertion. DHUMA explains that many of the attendees were present only out of cultural and moral obligation. During the hearing, Claimant distributed a gift bag containing a hat and a poncho with the company\u2019s name on it to attendees, thereby generating a sense of obligation to stay and listen. DHUMA explains that the population was uneasy and worried about the development of the mining Project, and this unease manifested itself at the hearing. There were questions related to community concerns about environmental contamination, and linguistic barriers likely suppressed the number of questions asked. DHUMA\u2019s representatives who attended the meeting speak Aymara and witnessed attendees commenting about not trusting what the company was saying and voicing concern about harm. After the hearing, several communities wrote to regional and national authorities to express concerns about the public hearing and their opposition to the Santa Ana Project. The hearing apparently served as a catalyst for Aymara community action against the Santa Ana Project.285 To the extent that Claimant argues that they have a video showing local support, such a video has not been entered into the record here.286 Mr. de Mayolo\u2019s testimony that he had not seen the gifts provided at the hearing is implausible.287\n\nDHUMA\u2019s Response 1-3; Respondent\u2019s Comments to DHUMA Submission (Aug. 18, 2016) pp. 7 - 10; RPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 7 - 8; Tr. 589:2 - 595:14 (Mayolo); Letter from Braulio Morales Choquecachua and Faustino Limatapa Musaja, Aug. 8, 2016 **[C-0329]** ; Letter from Sixto Vilcanqui Mamani, Aug. 8, 2016 **[C-0331]** ; Memorial submitted by the Frente de Defensa and Kelluyo\u2019s *Comunidades Campesinas* to Congress, Memorial No. 0005-2011-CO-FDRN-RSP **[R-015]** ; Memorials submitted by the Frente de Defensa and Kelluyo\u2019s *Comunidades Campesinas* to the President of Peru, Memorial No. 0001-2011-CO-FDRN-RSP **[R-016]** ; Memorials submitted by the Frente de Defensa and Kelluyo\u2019s *Comunidades Campesinas* to Minister of Energy and Mines, Memorial No. 0002- 2011-CO-FDRN-RSP **[R-017]** ; Letter from Kelluyo Community Inquiring about the Project **[R-053]** ; Questions Raised at the Santa Ana Public Hearing **[R-054]** ; 2010 Environmental Impact Assessment Citizen Participation Plan (\"PPC\") **[R-227]** ; Letters from Kelluyo District on Santa Ana\u2019s Public Hearing **[R-304]** ; Map of Distances of *Comunidades Campesinas* Population Centers to the Santa Ana Area of Influence **[R-312]** ; AA Letter from Desaguadero Community **[R-411]** ; Memorial from Kelluyo Authorities to the Minister of Energy and Mines (Mar. 18, 2011) **[R-423]**.\n\nTr. 1906 (R.

This is evident from the protestors\u2019 demands, as well as from the protests not stopping until after Respondent issued Supreme Decree 032. The fact that the protests occurred in Puno and Desaguadero - the cities closest to the Santa Ana Project site - rather than on the site itself does not mean they were unrelated. DHUMA explains that the protests took place in the largest cities in order to capture the attention of the regional and national authorities for maximum impact. Mr. Aduviri was simply a spokesman for the communities\u2019 broadly held anger for the Santa Ana Project - while he may have helped organize the community movement, he did not create it. The protests had broad community opposition to the Santa Ana Project as their foundation. DHUMA personnel experienced first-hand the severity of social conditions in Puno and describe these food and water shortages and how this unsustainable crisis in Puno was a critical reason for the Council of Ministers\u2019 issuance of Supreme Decree 032.288\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments to DHUMA Submission (Aug. 18, 2016) p. 10 - 11; Human Rights and Environment Association, Chronology: Antimining Protests in the South Region-2011 **[R-058]**.\n\n256.\n\nDHUMA and Dr. L\u00f3pez are experts in public international law and international human rights, and DHUMA also works to put international human rights law into practice. DHUMA and Dr. L\u00f3pez explain that Claimant failed to live up to international standards for community engagement and, as a result, Claimant failed to obtain the necessary social license for an extractive project of this nature. The internationally-accepted concept of the \"*social license*\" aligns closely with the requirements under Peruvian law. It is clear that Claimant failed to comply with internationally recognized norms, including the 2008 UN Framework and Guiding Principles and Convention 169 of the ILO. It was Claimant\u2019s responsibility to address community concerns. It is irrelevant whether their concerns were based in sound scientific or technical evidence - it was Claimant\u2019s job to educate and to correct misimpressions, rather than simply dismiss them.289\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments to DHUMA Submission (Aug. 18, 2016) p. 11 - 15; International Labor Organization Convention Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (No. 169) **[R-029]** ; Questions Raised at the Santa Ana Public Hearing **[R-054]** ; Regulation on Citizen Participation on the Mining Subsector, Supreme Decree No. 028-2008-EM **[R-159]** ; Bear Creek Press Release **[R-429]** ; United Nations Human Rights Council, Resolution 8/7 **[R-430]** ; United Nations Human Rights Council, Document No. A/HRC/8/5, Protect, Respect and Remedy: A Framework for Business and Human Rights **[R-431]** ; United Nations Human Rights Council, Document No. A/HRC/17/31, Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations \"Protect, Respect and Remedy\" Framework **[R-432]** ; United Nations Human Rights Council, Resolution 17/4 **[R-433]** ; International Organization of Employers, International Chamber of Commerce, and Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD, \"Joint initial views of the International Organization of Employers (IOE), the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD (BIAC) to the Eighth Session of the Human Rights Council on the Third report of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Business and Human Rights\" **[R-434]** ; International Council on Mining and Metals, \"ICMM welcomes Ruggie report,\" **[R-435]** ; United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples **[R-437]**.\n\n257.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s question (a)290, Respondent explained that, as Claimant has recognized, a company obtains the necessary social license if and only if it is generally accepted by the relevant communities. The sufficiency of a company\u2019s efforts to obtain this license is not measured by the procedural steps it follows or the minimum legal requirements it fulfills; rather, the license must actually be obtained and maintained. The sufficiency of a company\u2019s outreach is measured by the standard of success. It is not a question of discretion of the State.291 Procedural steps - be it the carrying out of 130 workshops, organizing a rotational work program, or completion of other procedural steps cannot substitute for actually obtaining a social license.292 Here, Claimant did not have \"*general acceptance*\" from the relevant communities - it did not have a social license.293 Although Claimant tries to narrow the scope of \"*relevant communities*\", its approach misunderstands the Aymara communities\u2019 collective social organization.294 The protestors were not outside agitators; they were community members who objected to Claimant\u2019s presence in the area, to its Project, and to the effects that they feared the Project would have on their lives, lands, culture, and environment.295\n\nPO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4 (a), *supra* \u00b6 96.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 10 - 15, 33 - 34; RPHB-II \u00b6 2; Tr. 432 - 433 (Swarthout); Tr. 1064 - 1065, 1132 (Ram\u00edrez); 1294 -1297, 1301 - 1302 (Pe\u00f1a); Swarthout First Statement \u00b6 40 n. 31 **[CWS-1]** ; Regulation on Citizen Participation on the Mining Subsector, Supreme Decree No. 028-2008-EM Art. 2.1 **[R-159]** ; Davis and Franks, \"Costs of Company-Community Conflict in the Extractive Sector,\" Harvard Kennedy School of Government **[R-272]** ; Business for Social Responsibility, \"The Social License to Operate\" 3 - 4 **[R-273]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6 17; RPHB-II \u00b6 3 - 4; C-II \u00b6 73; CPHB-I \u00b6 1; Ant\u00fanez de Mayolo Second Statement \u00b6 14 **[CWS-7]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6 16.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id.*\n\n258.\n\nSince the social license is a *de facto* acceptance of the Project, there are few legal standards that can be applied to it. None of the international or national instruments supplies a formula that guarantees that such a license will be obtained. Rather, some procedures are recommended.296 ILO Convention 169 promotes a transparent, effective and integrated consultation process by giving communities the right to be consulted (Article 6), demanding that communities\u2019 cultural relationships with their land will be respected (Article 13), and stating that communities have the right to participate in the use, management, and conservation of the natural resources within their lands (Article 15). The UN Declaration on Indigenous Peoples, in particular Article 32, also speaks to the proper process for obtaining a social license and reinforces ILO Convention 169.297 Pursuant to these, while the State must ensure that companies obtain free and informed consent from the affected communities, the company must do what is necessary to achieve that result.298 Article 15 of ILO 169 obligates Respondent to specifically safeguard the communities\u2019 ability to make decisions about the resources on their lands, which Respondent did by requiring and monitoring the CPP process. The CPP process focuses on the quality of communication, ensuring that a company can only proceed with the consent of the communities. The CPP process is not a simple matter of ticking boxes or fulfilling certain steps.299\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 18 - 19; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 124, 140 - 142; Regulation on Citizen Participation on the Mining Subsector, Supreme Decree No. 028-2008-EM Art. 5 **[R-159]** ; International Council on Mining and Metals, \"Position Statement, Mining and Indigenous Peoples\" 2, 3 **[R-178]** ; International Council on Mining and Metals, \"Good Practice Guides, Indigenous Peoples and Mining\" 4 **[R-179]** ; Government of Canada, Doing Business the Canadian Way: A Strategy to Advance Corporate Social Responsibility in Canada\u2019s Extractive Sector Abroad 3-4 **[R-180]** ; Government of Canada, Building the Canadian Advantage: A Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Strategy for the Canadian International Extractive Sector 1 **[R-181]** ; International Council on Mining and Metals Website, About Us, *available at* http://www.icmm.com/about-us/about-us **[R-182]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 20 - 22; International Labor Organization Convention Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (No. 169) Art. 6, 13, 15.2 **[R-029]** ; United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples **[R-108]** ; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui First Report \u00b6 49 **[REX-003]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6 23; RPHB-II \u00b6 5; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 810 **[C-0001]** ; International Labor Organization Convention Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (No. 169) Art. 6 **[R-029]** ; United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Art. 32 **[R-108]** ; Government of Canada, Doing Business the Canadian Way: A Strategy to Advance Corporate Social Responsibility in Canada\u2019s Extractive Sector Abroad 1 **[R-180]** ; Government of Canada, Building the Canadian Advantage: A Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Strategy for the Canadian International Extractive Sector 1, 5, 6 **[R-181]** ; Davis and Franks, \"Costs of Company-Community Conflict in the Extractive Sector,\" Harvard Kennedy School of Government 11 **[R-272]** ; Business for Social Responsibility, \"The Social License to Operate\" 3-4 **[R-273]**.\n\nTr. 1888 - 2893 (R.

The legal requirements, such as in Legislative Resolution No. 26253 of 1993, do not dictate a strict or specific path for a company to seek a social license.300 The citizen participation process for a mining project is covered by 2 principle legal norms: Supreme Decree 028 and Ministerial Resolution No. 304. These set out the necessary - but not sufficient - steps toward securing a social license.301 In 2001, MINEM published a Guide advising on best practices for designing and executing a community outreach program to develop mining activities.302 In 2011, Peru adopted the \"Law on the Right to Prior Consultation to Indigenous Peoples, Recognized in Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization\", which adopted all of the recommendations of ILO Convention 169.303 Finally, in addition to these procedures, the company must reach agreements with all land owners and possessors on the mine sites. Here, that would amount to 99 agreements.304 That the DGAAM reviewed Claimant\u2019s CPP and did not instruct Claimant to expand upon it is not proof of the plan\u2019s sufficiency to obtain a social license.305\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 26 - 27; Regulation on Citizen Participation on the Mining Subsector, Supreme Decree No. 028-2008-EM Art. 2.1, 3 **[R-159]** ; Flury First Report \u00b6\u00b6 72 - 73 **[CEX-006]** ; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui First Report \u00b6 49 **[REX-003]** ; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui Second Report \u00b6 141 **[REX-009]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 28 - 29; RPHB-II \u00b6 6; CPHB-I \u00b6 2; Tr. 1497:15-19 (Clow); Ministerial Resolution Regulating the Citizen Participation Process in the Mining Subsector, Ministerial Resolution No. 304-2008-MEM-DM Arts. 2, 20, 24 **[R-153]** ; Regulation on Citizen Participation on the Mining Subsector, Supreme Decree No. 028-2008-EM 3, 5.6 **[R-159]** ; General Law on the Environment, Law No. 28611 Art. 46 - 47 **[R-285]** ; Ram\u00edrez Second Statement \u00b6 17 **[RWS-6]** ; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui First Report \u00b6 58 **[REX-003]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 30, 36; Ausenco Vector, *Plan de Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana* (\"PPC\") de Bear Creek Annex 2.1 **[C-0155]** ; Ministerial Resolution Regulating the Citizen Participation Process in the Mining Subsector, Ministerial Resolution No. 304-2008-MEM-DM Art. 12, 13 **[R-153]** ; Ministry of Energy and Mines of Peru, General Direction of Environmental Affairs, \"Guide on Community Relations\" **[R-172]** ; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui First Report \u00b6\u00b6 53, 58 **[REX-003]** ; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui Second Report \u00b6 142 **[REX-009]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6 31; Ley del derecho a la consulta previa a los pueblos ind\u00edgenas u originarios, reconocido en el Convenio 169, Ley No. 29785 del 7 de setiembre de 2011 **[Flury 028]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6 32; R-II \u00b6 330; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 109 - 111 **[REX-009]**.\n\nRPHB-II \u00b6 10; CPHB-I \u00b6 6; Ram\u00edrez Second Statement \u00b6 16 **[RWS-6]**.\n\n260.\n\nMerely meeting the formalistic requirements of the law is not an indication of meeting the law\u2019s objective: consensus and a social license from the affected communities.

Here, Claimant began by mis-defining the number of communities in its \"*area of influence*\", contrary to the MINEM guidance.307 In Observation 7, MINEM observed that the area of influence needed to be broadened. Claimant had failed to appreciate that the individual communities were indeed part of the collective Aymara community.308 Claimant further disparaged members of the Kelluyo and other neighboring districts as \"*outsiders*\" or \"*agitators.*\"309 This created division and hostility among the communities when Claimant only offered jobs to some and not to others. This fueled protest in 2008 and this continued.310 Further, Claimant did not provide all of the relevant information to the communities. Although Claimant carried out more than 130 workshops, this does not answer the question of whether Claimant addressed the communities\u2019 concerns. Records indicate that more information and better ways to communicate that information were needed. Communication was also overly technical and poorly translated.311 Claimant also failed to provide the necessary room in its schedule for the communities to decide whether to support the Project, in accordance with Aymaran decision-making.312\n\nTr. 1888 - 1893 (R.

The State has the neutral role of an independent facilitator.313 Here, the State fulfilled its responsibilities, even going beyond simply reviewing consultation plans on paper and attending workshops. The Government warned Claimant that the outreach activities were not effective.314 Claimant\u2019s allegations that the Government was inadequately involved are without merit: the Government was adequately involved and was not responsible for rescuing Claimant from its own failings. In fact, where the State tried to correct Claimant\u2019s misconceptions about its area of social influence, Claimant ignored that guidance. Claimant\u2019s complaint that Respondent\u2019s management of the social unrest in Puno exacerbated the conflict is also meritless.315\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 46 - 47; RPHB-II \u00b6 13; Tr. 1079:9-10 (Ram\u00edrez); Ram\u00edrez Second Statement \u00b6 6 **[RWS-6]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 48 - 50; Ausenco Vector, *Plan de Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana* (\"PPC\") de Bear Creek pp. 2, 25, 53, 70 **[C-0155]** ; Regulation on Citizen Participation on the Mining Subsector, Supreme Decree No. 028-2008-EM Art. 3 **[R-159]** ; 488-295 EIA Observations 04-19-2011 **[SRK-022]**.\n\nRPHB-II \u00b6\u00b6 14 - 15; CPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 27 - 29; Tr. 774, 787 (Gala); Ausenco Vector, *Plan de Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana* (\"PPC\") de Bear Creek Annex 3 pp. 2, 25, 53 **[C-0155]** ; DGAAM\u2019s Observations to Bear Creek\u2019s EIA for Exploitation, Report No. 399-2011-MEM-AAM/WAL/JCV/CMC/JST/KVS/AD Observation 7 **[R-040]** ; Bear Creek\u2019s Responses to DGAAM\u2019s Observations to the Environmental Impact Study of the Santa Ana Project (without Annexes) **[R-184]** ; \"Santa Ana Mine Leaves Huacullani Because of Protests\" *La Republica-Gran Sur* **[R-428]** ; Bear Creek Press Release **[R-429]** ; Gala First Statement \u00b6 41 **[RWS-1]** ; Fern\u00e1ndez Statement \u00b6\u00b6 10-26 **[RWS-4]**.\n\n263.\n\nThere are two classes of consequences that follow from a company\u2019s lack of a social license: (1) those that are within the discretion of State authorities when faced with a situation where a mining project does not have a social license or (2) those under the FTA if the Tribunal finds that Claimant did not have a social license.316 Regarding the first class, and as experts from both Parties confirmed, when a community or important stakeholders decides that it does not accept a mining project on their land, it cannot be imposed against the will of the people.317 With respect to Claimant, it was also still required to reach agreements with 5 communities who owned the land and the 94 families who were in possession of it - if any of these 99 agreements were to fail (and Claimant had obtained 0 by the date of Supreme Decree 032), it would be fatal to the Project.318 Other consequences are a matter of State discretion - the State can undertake its own outreach, require the company to carry out additional outreach, delay the approval of the ESIA or suspend the process altogether.319 For a mining project within a border region, the State possesses a high degree of discretion under Article 71 of the Constitution. The State may reassess the public necessity of the project and rescind a prior public necessity decree, if necessary.320 Although there is no specific provision in the Peruvian legal system that authorizes the revocation of a concession, this is beside the point: here, Respondent did not revoke Claimant\u2019s concessions.

Nothing in Article 803 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with the establishment of covered investments, such as a requirement that investments be legally constituted under the laws or regulations of the Party, provided that such formalities do not materially impair the protections afforded by a Party to investors of the other Party and covered investments pursuant to this Chapter.*\n\n*2. Notwithstanding Articles 803 or 804, a Party may require an investor of the other Party, or its covered investments, to provide information concerning that investment solely for informational or statistical purposes, provided that such requests are reasonable and not unduly burdensome. The Party shall protect any confidential information from any disclosure that would prejudice the competitive position of the investor or the covered investment.

An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that the other Party has breached:*\n\n*(a) an obligation under Section A, other than an obligation under paragraph 4 of Article 802, Articles 809, 810 or 816;*\n\n*(b) an obligation under subparagraph 3(a) of Article 1305 (Competition Policy, Monopolies and State Enterprises - Designated Monopolies) or paragraph 2 of Article 1306 (Competition Policy, Monopolies and State Enterprises - State Enterprises), only to the extent that a designated monopoly or state enterprise has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party\u2019s obligations under Section A, other than an obligation under paragraph 4 of Article 802, Articles 809, 810 or 816; or*\n\n*(c) a legal stability agreement referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n***Article 824: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration***\n\n*1. Except as provided in Annex 824.1, a disputing investor who meets the conditions precedent in Article 823 may submit the claim to arbitration under:*\n\n*(a) the ICSID Convention, provided that both the disputing Party and the Party of the disputing investor are parties to the Convention;*\n\n*(b) the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, provided that either the disputing Party or the Party of the disputing investor, but not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention;*\n\n*(c) the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or*\n\n*(d) any other body of rules approved by the Commission as available for arbitrations under this Section.*\n\n*2.

WHETHER AN INVESTMENT CONFERRING JURISDICTION ON THE TRIBUNAL EXISTS**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n275.\n\nEven if the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over unlawful and bad-faith investments, Claimant\u2019s alleged investment is invalid under Peruvian law, which means that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction as there is no investment upon which to base a Treaty claim. Concessions obtained in violation of Article 71 of the Constitution revert to the State. Claimant\u2019s scheme is presently being examined in a domestic court, and could result in Claimant being stripped of its concession rights entirely, as required by Article 71. The Tribunal need not wait for a decision from the Peruvian judiciary - rather, it may determine for itself that the Santa Ana acquisition violated Peruvian law.335\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 215 - 216; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 421 - 423; RPHB-I \u00b6 94; Constitution of Peru, Art. 71, Art. 138 - 139 **[R-001]** ; Executive Power Organic Law, Law No. 29158 **[R-103]** ; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui Second Report \u00b6 15 **[REX-009]**.\n\n276.\n\nAfter the Hearing and in response to the Tribunal\u2019s questions \"*(d) Of the two reasons relied upon by Respondent for Decree 032, could that Decree also have been legally issued, if only one of the two reasons could be established: (i) only the alleged illegality of the Claimant\u2019s Application? or only the unrest as it existed at that time?*\" and \"*(f) Was the Claimant denied due process in the procedure leading to the promulgation of Supreme Decree 032, or otherwise?*\"336 Respondent explained that the State has the discretionary right to reconsider and repeal earlier declarations of public necessity. A repeal does not take property away from the concession owner, rather it simply prevents the concession holder from using it during the ensuing court proceedings.337 Here, Respondent discovered that (1) Claimant had violated the Constitution in obtaining the public necessity declaration and (2) that the premise that the Santa Ana Project would improve the public welfare of local communities was gravely mistaken. The elimination of either of these bases of support could have justified the decision to repeal the public necessity declaration.338 Respondent only took the action that was immediately necessary to address both circumstances.339\n\nPO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4 (d), (f).\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6 94; RPHB-II \u00b6\u00b6 28 - 29; Eguiguren First Report \u00b6 70, Section IV **[REX-001]** ; Danos Report Section IV.A **[REX-006]** ; Eguiguren Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 19 -20, 23 - 30, 36 - 38 **[REX-007]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 11.D; R-II \u00a7 II.D.4; RPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 95 - 98; Tr. 924:3-7 (Zegarra); Tr. 811:15-20 (Gala); Statement of Reasons for Supreme Decree No. 083 of 2007 at 2 **[R-032]** ; Eguiguren First Report \u00b6 33 **[REX-001]** ; Fern\u00e1ndez Witness Statement \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26 **[RWS-4]**.\n\nRPHB-II \u00b6 29.\n\n**2. Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n277.\n\nNo support whatsoever exists for Respondent\u2019s position. The FTA and the ICSID Convention are the relevant legal instruments that govern this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, including the definition of \"*investment*.\" Respondent\u2019s domestic law has no impact on the definition of \"*investment*\" for the purposes of obtaining protections under the FTA. Thus, Respondent\u2019s argument that this Tribunal should make a jurisdictional finding based on the legality of the Santa Ana investment as a matter of Peruvian law should be dismissed summarily.340\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 231, 232; C-III \u00b6\u00b6 154, 160; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 421 - 423; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA \u00a7\u00a7 824 - 825, 847 **[C-0001]** ; *Asian Agric.

Peru* expressly rejected Peru\u2019s contention and applied the definition of \"*investment*\" contained in the relevant BIT and ICSID Convention, without reference to Peruvian law, to assess whether an investment existed within the meaning of that treaty.341 The *Saba Fakes* tribunal expressly rejected the argument that an *\"illegal\"* investment or one not made in *\"good faith\"* did not fall within Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\u2019s definition of \"*investment*. \"342 Here, the FTA and the ICSID Convention are the relevant instruments to determine whether an investment exists. They are *lex specialis* and prevail over any other source of law applicable to the dispute. This Tribunal should not look to Peruvian law, especially since the FTA does not require application of Peruvian law to the definition of \"*investment*\" and does not contain an express legality requirement. Importing such a requirement into the FTA and the ICSID Convention would do violence to both agreements.343\n\nC-III \u00b6 155; *Saba Fakes v.

Even Respondent\u2019s expert agreed that a violation of Article 71 does not justify expropriation, and certainly without due process or compensation.349 Further, and also in response to the Tribunal\u2019s question (b) \"*Did the Claimant make all required disclosures in making its application for a Public Necessity Decree?

The Article provides as follows:\n\n***investment** means:*\n\n*(a) an enterprise;*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*(g) real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes; and*\n\n*(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under:*\n\n*(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor\u2019s property in the territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or [\u2026]* Archived Title of Entry N\u00b0 C00011 of File N\u00b0 11352728 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Rigistry Office of Lima **[C-0206]** ; *The new CEO of Monterrico had an audience with Peru\u2019s minister of Energy & Mines*, The Zijin Consortium Press Release, Jun. 11, 2007 **[C-0207]** ; *China\u2019s ambassador in Peru Gao Zhengyue investigated Majaz company*, The Zijin Consortium Press Release, Jun. 11, 2007 **[C-0208]** ; Peruvian Congress, *Legality and Problems of the company Minera Maiaz in the Territories of the Segunda y Cajas, and Yanta Rural Communities in the Provinces of Huancabamba and Ayabaca in the Piura Region*, May 9, 2008 **[C-0254]** ; Tr. 1261:21 - 1262:7 (Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui).\n\n283.\n\nAs is undisputed, at the time of the alleged breach of the FTA by Supreme Decree 032 published 25 June 2011, Claimant held, by Supreme Decree 083, a declaration of public necessity expressly authorizing Claimant to acquire and possess concessions and rights over mines and supplementary resources, to acquire mining rights, and to engage in mining activities. It is also undisputed that, after the adoption of Supreme Decree 083 in 2007, Claimant acquired seven mining concessions and proceeded with a great number of activities in the local communities (though these were not sufficient in the view of Respondent). As reflected in both Parties\u2019 submissions on the calculation of damages, Respondent concedes that Claimant spent approximately USD $18 million after November 2007.351\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 106 - 107.\n\n284.\n\nThese governmental authorizations and the resulting costs incurred by Claimant must be considered as \"*interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under: (i) contracts involving the presence of an investor\u2019s property in the territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or*\n\n285.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant made \"*investments*\" within the meaning of the FTA, and that it is to be treated as an \"*investor*.\"\n\n**B. WHETHER CLAIMANT HELD THE RIGHTS ON WHICH IT BASES ITS CLAIM**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n286.\n\nThis Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimant does not own the investments upon which it bases its claim. Even if this Tribunal determines that Claimant lawfully obtained some rights at Santa Ana, Claimant never acquired the right to operate a \"*mining project*\" or a \"*right to mine*\", upon which it bases its claim. At most, Claimant held an exclusive right to seek a right to mine and to pursue a mining project. Since Claimant cannot establish that it owned or controlled the right to mine at Santa Ana, the Tribunal cannot assert jurisdiction.352\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 217, 220; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 424 - 425; *Vito G.

Claimant has never undertaken any \"*mining*\" in Santa Ana, nor has it ever had the right to do so. Claimant has never constructed or operated a mine in Peru or elsewhere - it is in the mineral exploration business and has put forward no evidence that it has the capabilities to build and operate a mine.354\n\nR-I \u00b6 218; *Vito G.

Claimant\u2019s failure to establish that it held the rights upon which it bases its claim persists and is fatal to jurisdiction.358\n\n*Id*.\n\nR-II \u00b6 426.\n\nR-I \u00b6 221.\n\n*Id*.; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 426 - 427.\n\n**2. Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n289.\n\nThere are four reasons that this Tribunal should reject Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimant purportedly never obtained the right to operate a mining project in Santa Ana. First, in investment law, it is uncontroversial that an investment typically consists of several interrelated economic activities that should not be viewed in isolation. In making its argument, Respondent seeks to limit and minimize the scope and nature of Claimant\u2019s protected investment in Respondent State. This argument misconstrues and ignores (1) the finding of public necessity that expressly authorizes Claimant to acquire mining rights in the border region, (2) Claimant\u2019s acquisition of mining concessions comprising the Santa Ana Project and the Corani Project, (3) the years Claimant engaged in expensive exploration and development efforts in Respondent State, and that these efforts (4) resulted in the discovery of significant economic silver mineralization in the area. Respondent\u2019s attempt to focus on one single aspect of Claimant\u2019s investment, to the exclusion of the entirety of its investment should be rejected.359\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 235 - 236; C-III \u00b6\u00b6 166 - 167; Supreme Decree No. 083-2007-EM adopted Nov. 29, 2007 **[C-0004]** ; Contracts for the Transfer of Mineral Rights between Jenny Karina Villavicencio Gardini and Bear Creek Mining Company, Sucursal del Per\u00fa, Dec. 3, 2007 **[C-0015]** ; Request from Bear Creek to MINEM soliciting the authorization to acquire mining rights located in the border area, Dec. 4, 2006 (UPDATE submitted with C-III) **[C-0017]**.\n\n290.\n\nSecond, at all relevant times, Claimant held the rights on which it bases its claim. As Prof. Bullard explains, Claimant acquired the property rights over the mining concessions after it obtained the declaration of public necessity in compliance with Peruvian law, through valid option contracts. As confirmed by Peruvian mining law expert and former Minister of Energy and Mines, Hans Flury, the concessions entailed many rights, including the right to own exploit mineral concessions, which form the basis of its claim here.360 Respondent conflates the existence of these rights with the need to obtain permits and licenses to build and operate a mine. However, Respondent has admitted in these proceedings that Claimant owned the mining concessions and mining rights in Respondent State, having explained that \"*one possible outcome of the MINEM lawsuit was reversion of the mineral rights to Peru.*\"361 That rights were granted was also confirmed by the Lima First Constitutional Court.362\n\nC-II \u00b6 237; Organic Law for the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources, Law No. 26821 **[R-142]** ; Ley de Promoci\u00f3n de Inversiones en el Sector Minero, Decreto Legislativo No. 708, de fecha 13 de noviembre de 1991 **[Flury-002]** ; Supreme Decree 014-92-EM **[Bullard-31]**.\n\nC-II \u00b6 238; R.Prov.M.-II \u00b6 30.\n\nC-II \u00b6 238; Amparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]**.\n\n291.\n\nRespondent\u2019s argument ignores the statutory language, Respondent\u2019s own legal experts, and the facts of the case - each demonstrate that Claimant held an ascertainable set of rights that form the basis of this claim.363 The Peruvian General Mining Act provides that concessions grant \"*[the] holder the right to explore and exploit the mineral resources*.\"364 The Organic Law for Sustainable Development of Natural Resources states that \"*the concession grants its holder the right to use and enjoyment of the natural resources granted*\" and, consequently, the property of the fruits and products to be extracted.365 The Parties\u2019 experts are also in agreement that the holder of a concession has the exclusive right to explore for and produce the mineral resources in question.366 Claimant does not dispute that there is a permitting process. But, the issue here is whether, by virtue of owning the concessions, Claimant owned the rights of exploration and exploitation within the concession areas. The answer to that question is yes. Respondent\u2019s other expert, Mr. Jorge Danos Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, opines that Supreme Decree 083 granted Claimant the right to acquire property, which Claimant has explained at length that it lawfully did through exercise of the Option Agreements after issuance of Supreme Decree 083.367\n\nC-III \u00b6\u00b6 161 - 162.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 163; Supreme Decree 014-92-EM **[Bullard-31]**.\n\nC-III \u00b6 163; The More Than 30 hours That Walter Aduviri Spent in Panamericana **[R-0124]**.\n\nC-III \u00b6 164; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 9, 11, 19, 21 **[REX-009]**.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 165, 167.\n\n292.\n\nThird, even if Claimant only had a mining exploration project, that would still be a protected investment because it falls within the FTA\u2019s definition of investment.368\n\nC-II \u00b6 239; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

In that case, which is inapposite, claimant provided no written evidence showing the date on which he purportedly acquired an investment and the tribunal concluded that claimant had failed to prove the date on which he acquired ownership and control of the investment. Here, however, Claimant has submitted conclusive evidence of ownership, including written documentation and witness testimony.371\n\nC-III \u00b6 169.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nRespondent argues that \"*[e]ven if the Tribunal somehow determines that Claimant lawfully obtained some set of rights at Santa Ana, Claimant never acquired the right to operate a \"mining project\" or a \"right to mine,\" upon which it bases its claims[\u2026].372* But, Respondent concedes expressly that *\"[a]t most, [Claimant] held an exclusive right to seek a right to mine and to pursue a mining project.*\"373 In the view of the Tribunal, the latter is sufficient to confirm the jurisdiction to the Tribunal.\n\nR-II \u00b6 424.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 425.\n\n296.\n\nIndeed, it is uncontroversial that an investment typically consists of several interrelated economic activities which, step by step, finally lead to the implementation of a project such as mining activity. As Claimant points out, the steps already obtained and completed were (1) the finding of public necessity that expressly authorized Claimant to acquire mining rights in the border region, (2) Claimant\u2019s acquisition of mining concessions comprising the Santa Ana Project and the Corani Project, (3) the years Claimant engaged in expensive exploration and development efforts in Respondent State, and that these efforts (4) apparently resulted in the discovery of significant economic silver mineralization in the area.\n\n297.\n\nThere can be no doubt that these acts give rise to \"*interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under: (i) [\u2026] concessions,...\"*, within the meaning of Article 847 of the FTA. Though the relevant definition of investment must be drawn from the FTA, it should be noted that in the domestic law of Peru, the Peruvian Constitution (Article 66) and the General Mining Law (Article 10) both define concession rights as a \"*right in rem*.\"374\n\nPolitical Constitution of Peru Enacted on 29th December, 1993, Official Edition and English Translation, Art. 66 **[C-0024];** Supreme Decree 014-92-EM **[Bullard-31]**.\n\n298.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Claimant held rights providing jurisdiction to the present Tribunal for the claims raised.\n\n**C. THE LEGAL STANDARD: WHETHER LEGALITY OR GOOD FAITH IS A PREREQUISITE TO THE TRIBUNAL'S EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n299.\n\nInvestment arbitration tribunals lack jurisdiction over claims that are based on investments made in violation of (1) domestic law or (2) the international law principle of good faith. Claimant\u2019s purported investment violates both. The *Inceysa* tribunal, cited by *Plama*, recognized that extending treaty protections to investments made in bad faith or in violation of domestic law would reward investors\u2019 misconduct, in violation of the principle of *nemo auditor propriam turpitudinem allegans* - no one can benefit from his or her own wrongdoing. It would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to grant jurisdiction because doing so would violate the international law principle that a claimant cannot benefit from its own wrongdoing.375\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 199 - 204, 206; R-II \u00b6 365; RPHB-I \u00b6 75; *Plama Consortium Limited v.

In this respect, Claimant has cited Article 816 of the FTA - a provision that has nothing to do with the international law principle requiring lawful investments. At most, Article 816 does nothing more than declare that, if one of the treaty parties were to create \"*special formalities*\" specifying how investments must be established in the host State, these rules would not give rise to a violation of the national treatment standard, unless they \"*materially impair*\" the protections otherwise afforded to investors in the FTA. Conceptually, Article 816 of the FTA is a carve-out to the FTA\u2019s national treatment provision. Contrary to Claimant\u2019s position, the language does not \"*explicitly exclude*\" the legality requirement from the FTA.387\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 377 - 379; Free Trade Agreement Between Canada and the Republic of Per\u00fa (Excerpts) Art. 816 **[R-390]** ; Chester Brown, *Commentaries on Selected Model Investment Treaties*, Oxford University Press (2013) 810 - 811 **[CL-0179]**.\n\n306.\n\nIn response to questions from Arbitrators Sands and Pryles about whether Claimant\u2019s alleged failure reaches the threshold of seriousness so as to justify this Tribunal not to exercise jurisdiction, Respondent explained that first, the failure is the violation of Article 71 of the Constitution, where Claimant acquired the Concessions through a proxy or strawman. Second, in making this representation, Claimant also began lying to the local populations about who owned the land and who would provide the benefits - Claimant or Ms. Villavicencio. Claimant understood the seriousness of its statements to the communities and to the Government. As a matter of law, this was a constitutional violation, one which cannot be cured by a subsequent Public Necessity Decree. The breached constitutional provision is one that involves internal and external security and even prompted response from Bolivia.388 Respondent does not see the Option Agreements as the core of the constitutional violation. Rather, from 2004 - 2007 and even assuming that the ownership was indirect rather than direct (due to Ms. Villavicencio\u2019s position as Claimant\u2019s employee), the entire scheme was in violation of the Constitution and this scheme went to the heart of the investment. Claimant spent millions of dollars that they would not have, had they been acting lawfully. This unlawful scheme robbed Respondent of the opportunity to exercise its sovereignty in terms of national security from 2004 - 2007. Although there is no evidence of a factual impact on national security here, that is likely because there was no assessment of the same, due to there being no application for a Public Necessity Decree from 2000 - 2006. In 2000, the Ministry of Defense found that the presence of foreign investors in that area would be a threat to Respondent\u2019s national security. The grant of a Public Necessity Decree in 2007 does not cure the past violations, as one cannot know what the Government would have said in 2004, 2005, or 2006. When the Decree was granted, the Government did not know about the constitutional violation. Evidence has been presented demonstrating that if the Government had known of the violation, the Public Necessity Decree would not have been granted.389\n\nTr. 1926 - 1932 (R.

If not, what are the consequences for this case, including for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal?*\"390, Respondent indicated that it does not need to prove \"*fraud*\" in the strict legal sense of the term to show that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction.391 Respondent need not even prove that Claimant acted in bad faith - it is sufficient that Claimant\u2019s investment was unlawful to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.392 Faced with investors acting in bad faith at the time they acquired their investments, in particular by making misrepresentations to the Government in connection with the making of that investment, international tribunals have declined jurisdiction or declared the investor\u2019s claims inadmissible.393 To deny Treaty protection on grounds of international public policy is entirely appropriate here. Having deprived Respondent of the right to admit or reject the investment, Claimant should not benefit from the status of a protected investor.394\n\nPO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4 (b).\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6 74; RPHB-II \u00b6\u00b6 22; *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich A.G. et al. v.

Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n308.\n\nThe FTA does not contain a legality or good faith requirement. Article 816 of the FTA suggests that the Contracting Parties agreed that the legality requirement would be excluded from the scope of the FTA. Article 816 identifies the legality requirement as a special formality that the host State is entitled to adopt if it so wishes. Thus, it is neither an express nor implied requirement under the FTA.395\n\nC-II \u00b6 213; Peru - Bilateral Investment Treaties: Peru-Australia BIT \u00a71, Peru-China BIT \u00a7 1, Peru-Switzerland BIT \u00a7 2(e) **[CL-0079]** ; Rudolf Dolzer and Christopher Schreuer, PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW (Oxford University Press, 2nd ed. 2012) 93 **[CL-0168]**.\n\n309.\n\nUnder international law, the Tribunal may not import a requirement that limits its jurisdiction when none is specified by the parties themselves. In *Flughafen Zurich*, *Hamester*, and *Phoenix Action*, the applicable BITs expressly and unambiguously required compliance with the host State\u2019s law. Those tribunals\u2019 musings on general requirements of international law are, therefore, *dicta*. *Hamester* and *Phoenix Action* also have been heavily criticized for their lacking reasoning on the question of illegality as a jurisdictional hurdle. Likewise, although the tribunal in *SAUR* opined on the existence of an implicit requirement of legality and good faith, it undertook no analysis to substantiate this opinion and, in any event, declined to find illegality. In *Inceysa*, the Tribunal expressly noted that it could only declare its incompetence to hear Inceysa\u2019s complaint because the treaty parties had intended to limit their consent to arbitration only to investments made in accordance with the laws in force in each state party. The *Plama* tribunal did not find that the investor\u2019s deliberate deception and active misrepresentations deprived the tribunal of jurisdiction. Rather, although the allegations of illegality raised questions on the merits, they did not affect respondent State\u2019s consent to arbitration under the treaty. Similarly, the tribunal in *Malicorp* found that allegations of investor wrongdoing do not necessarily deprive the tribunal of jurisdiction and are better suited to an analysis on the merits. The doctrines of separability and competence-competence mandate that pleas of illegality be regarded as questions on the merits of an investor\u2019s claim, rather than jurisdictional hurdles. In determining whether to consider the allegations as a matter of jurisdiction or merits, the *Minnotte* tribunal urged consideration of whether the alleged fraud is \"*so manifest, and so closely connected to the facts (such as the making of an investment) which form the basis of a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as to warrant a dismissal of claims* in limine *for want of jurisdiction\"* Facts matter, and it would be wrong to simply draw a legalistic conclusion without careful attention to the circumstances surrounding the alleged illegality. Accordingly, this Tribunal should consider Respondent\u2019s allegations of fraud, deceit, and bad faith in the context of the merits of the claim.396\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 212 - 215, 220 - 226; C-III \u00b6\u00b6 116 - 122; R-II \u00b6 369; Peru - Bilateral Investment Treaties: Peru-Australia BIT \u00a7 1, Peru-China BIT \u00a7 1, Peru-Switzerland BIT \u00a7 2(e) **[CL-0079]** ; *Anatolie Stati et al. v.

The *Mamidoil* tribunal nonetheless found that it had jurisdiction over that claimant\u2019s claim, even though it found that investment to be tainted by procedural illegality. Likewise, the *Yukos* tribunal declined to decide whether alleged illegality operates as a bar to jurisdiction or as a bar to substantive protections. The *Khan Resources* tribunal deferred the question of whether that claimant had breached host State law to the merits.397\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 216 - 218; *Mamidoil Jetoil Greek Petroleum Products Societe S.A. v.

No tribunal has ever denied jurisdiction or declared inadmissible the entirety of a claimant\u2019s case where claimant did not act fraudulently or corruptly. Thus, it is practical to examine the totality of Claimant\u2019s claims together with Respondent\u2019s illegality defense.398\n\nC-III \u00b6\u00b6 123 - 125; Ori Herstein, *A Normative Theory of the Clean Hands Defense*, 17 Legal Theory 171 (2011) **[CL-0219]**.\n\n312.\n\nThere are at least three situations where a tribunal may assess the substance of a claimant\u2019s case, in spite of a breach of national law in the making of the investment: (1) where an investor\u2019s unlawful actions attend the making of an investment, and the host State\u2019s law provides that the illegality renders the investment voidable rather than void *ab initio* ;399 (2) where the allegedly unlawful conduct is minor, procedural, or a good faith mistake;400 and (3) where a State\u2019s actions and representations to the investor create a legitimate expectation on the part of the investor that his investment will be protected.401\n\nC-III \u00b6 125.\n\n*Id*. at 131; Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, May 23, 1969 **[CL-0039]** ; *Plama Consortium Limited v.

Kazakhstan*, where the tribunal distinguished between a transaction that was void or invalid, and a transaction which is merely voidable, casts serious doubt on the propriety of treating violations of national law as a jurisdictional issue *per se*.402 In the present case, Article 71 of the Peruvian Constitution contemplates that rights obtained in contravention thereof revert to the State - they are not void *ab initio*, and the State must take affirmative action to re-acquire rights a putative investor unlawfully obtained. Claimant must, therefore, be held to have made a protected investment, and the Tribunal may proceed to consider the merits of Claimant\u2019s claims. Following *Liman Caspian Oil*, even if a violation of Article 71 rendered a transaction void, an investment would nonetheless have been made and a case based on a violation of the FTA would fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.403\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 125 - 128; *Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v.

There, the tribunal agreed that it does not have jurisdiction over investments made in violation of international public policy, including fraud and bribery, which must be proven by respondent. Thus, even if the Tribunal found that a violation of Article 71 had occurred, that alone would be insufficient: Respondent would need to demonstrate that Claimant knowingly and fraudulently misrepresented its relationship with Ms. Villavicencio. Respondent cannot meet this burden, given Claimant\u2019s transparent disclosure of the Option Agreements and its following of Estudio Grau\u2019s legal advice.404\n\nC-III \u00b6\u00b6 130, 134; *Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v.

In each case on which Respondent relies, the tribunal found an independent basis of bad faith to support a finding that it lacked jurisdiction due to investor wrongdoing. If the Tribunal finds that Claimant acted in accordance with Peruvian law, Respondent\u2019s allegations of bad faith cannot defeat the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.405\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 227 - 230; Aloysius Llamzon and Anthony C. Sinclair, *Investor Wrongdoing in Investment Arbitration: Standards Governing Issues of Corruption, Fraud, Misrepresentation and Other Investor Misconduct* in Albert Jan van den Berg (ed), Legitimacy: Myths, Realities, Challenges, ICCA Congress Series, Volume 18 (\u00a9 Kluwer Law International; Kluwer Law International 2015) **[CL-0171]** ; *Saba Fakes v.

Georgia*, here, Respondent\u2019s actions and representations *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimant created in Claimant the legitimate expectation that it had made a lawful investment that would be protected under the FTA in case of breach. This expectation stems from Respondent\u2019s own conduct and is entitled to treaty protection.406\n\nC-III \u00b6\u00b6 135 - 137; *Ioannis Kardassopolos v. Georgia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, Jul. 6, 2007 \u00b6\u00b6 184, 192 **[RLA-092]**.\n\n317.\n\nThe summary of Claimant\u2019s arguments is best taken from its own words:\n\n*[...] Respondent has built its entire jurisdictional objection on an erroneous assumption: that its allegations of illegality and fraud in the making of Bear Creek\u2019s investment must necessarily deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction or render Claimant\u2019s claims inadmissible. The law is not binary, however, and it accords this Tribunal ample discretion to decide whether the nature of the alleged illegality merits outright dismissal or a weighing of any investor wrongdoing against the respondent State\u2019s own violations of international law*.407\n\nC-III \u00b6 138.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nAs the Parties\u2019 submissions show, the case law does not offer a clear basis regarding the standard to be applied to determine jurisdiction. This Tribunal considers that such determination should be made on the basis of conclusions that can be drawn from the applicable treaty.\n\n319.\n\nIn this context, the following wording of Article 816 of the FTA is of particular relevance: \"*Nothing in Article 803 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with the establishment of covered investments, such as a requirement that investments be legally constituted under the laws or regulations of the Party, [\u2026].\"* Thus, Article 816 identifies the legality requirement as a \"*special formality*\" that the host State is entitled to adopt if it so wishes. Since nowhere in the FTA or otherwise in the record is there an express or implied provision of law to the effect that Peru made use of this option, it can only be concluded that there is no jurisdictional requirement that Claimant\u2019s investment was legally constituted under the laws of Peru.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that under international law, the Tribunal may not import a requirement that limits its jurisdiction when such a limit is not specified by the parties. Indeed, the above considerations distinguish the FTA from the treaties applicable in *Flughafen Zurich*, *Hamester*, *Inceysa*, and *Phoenix Action*, which expressly required compliance with the host State\u2019s law. In fact, the wording of the FTA provides further clarity, because not only does it not mention such a limit, but, by the wording cited above, provides that such a limit is considered a *formality* which would have to be expressly included to be effective. Here, no such formality was expressly included.\n\n321.\n\nIn view of the above cited text, the words \"*such as*\" indicate that this would apply also to other limits to jurisdiction. Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider that the alleged good faith of the investor is a further condition under the FTA for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n322.\n\nAs can be seen from case law, further considerations may be necessary in case of fraud by the investor. However, the Tribunal does not have to enter into the question of whether the relevant case law may support a finding that an investor\u2019s fraud may exclude jurisdiction, since fraud by Claimant has not been alleged by Respondent, and the Tribunal indeed does not see evidence for fraud from the file.\n\n323.\n\nThe above conclusions make it unnecessary for the Tribunal to examine the Parties\u2019 arguments or decide on (1) whether Claimant obtained the Concessions and made the investment in good faith and in accordance with Peruvian law and (2) whether Respondent is estopped from asserting illegality or bad faith408 in the context of jurisdiction.\n\n*Compare* PO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4 (b) and (d)(i).\n\n324.\n\nThe above conclusion does not exclude the possible relevance of illegality or lack of good faith with respect to the merits.\n\n**VIII. ADMISSIBILITY OF CLAIMANT'S CLAIMS**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n325.\n\nRespondent\u2019s arguments were also repeated in relation to its submissions on the Tribunal\u2019s questions (a)(v) \"*As a matter of law, what are the consequences that follow from an absence of support on the part of one or more relevant communities, or parts thereof, in relation to this investment?*\" and (b) \"*Did the Claimant make all required disclosures in making its application for a Public Necessity Decree?

As explained in Respondent\u2019s arguments related to jurisdiction, Claimant\u2019s very acquisition of the Santa Ana mineral concessions violated Article 71 of the Constitution - a longstanding legal provision that is specifically directed at controlling natural resource investments by foreigners in the border zone.410 To repeat from above, the conclusion that this Tribunal should take from the *Plama*, *Yukos*, and the *Khan Resources v. Mongolia* decisions is that, regardless of whether the Tribunal decides the case on grounds of jurisdiction or on grounds of inadmissibility, Claimant is not entitled to any of the substantive protections afforded by the FTA.411\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 5, 362, 364, 365; RPHB-I \u00b6 76; RPHB-II \u00b6 22.\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 371, 373, 398; RPHB-II \u00b6 23; *Plama Consortium Limited v.

CLAIMANT'S ARGUMENTS**\n---------------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal should take the legality of the investment and good faith into account when adjudicating the merits of the case, without limiting itself to the analysis of the question of the admissibility of Claimant\u2019s claims.415 Claimant\u2019s jurisdictional arguments are incorporated by reference.\n\nC-III \u00b6 114.\n\n330.\n\nRespondent assumes that in the face of illegality, the Tribunal must either dismiss on jurisdiction or on the grounds of inadmissibility.416 Respondent has not, however, cited any case where a violation of national law without fraudulent intent results in the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for the inadmissibility of claims.417\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 122.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 122, 123.\n\n331.\n\nThere are situations where a tribunal may find illegality, yet nonetheless consider the substance of claimant\u2019s case and reach a decision on the merits of the claim. A claim of illegality cannot become a \"*trump*\" in all instances, which would render an unlawful expropriation without redress.418 Rather, a finding of fraud before illegality is treated as peremptory and is supported by case law.419 In *Plama*, the investor was guilty of fraud and it was on that basis that the investor\u2019s claims were inadmissible. The *Plama* tribunal did not state that a violation of national law, without fraud, bears the consequence of inadmissibility.420\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 124.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 125.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 117, 132.\n\n332.\n\nIn *Plama* and *Inceysa*, the tribunals found that, but for the unlawful conduct, the host State would not have permitted the investment. Where the allegedly unlawful conduct is minor, procedural, or a good faith error, the investor may still benefit from treaty protections and the tribunal may consider the substantive merits of the case. Only grave violations of national law which were decisive to the host State\u2019s decision to allow the investment may justify a finding of inadmissibility. The issue, as explained by the *Minnotte* tribunal, is whether Respondent has proven that there was a fraud and/or deception that was of such a kind as to disentitle claimant of treaty protection. The *Khan Resources* tribunal further noted that \"*it would undermine the purpose and object of the Treaty to deny the investor the right to make its case before an arbitral tribunal based on the same alleged violations the existence of which the investor seeks to dispute on the merits*.\" Here, Respondent enacted Supreme Decree 032 to impose sanctions available under local law upon Claimant. It forms the core of Claimant\u2019s case on jurisdiction and the merits. It would undermine the object and purpose of the FTA to deny Claimant the right to make its case before this Tribunal based on the same alleged violations the existence of which Claimant seeks to dispute on the merits.421\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 131 - 133; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 219, 220.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING**\n-------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nAs is frequently the case in investment disputes, the Parties\u2019 arguments regarding admissibility overlap to a certain degree with those regarding jurisdiction. This is also the case with Respondent\u2019s objection to admissibility.\n\n334.\n\nRespondent bases its objection to admissibility on two main arguments: (1) that all claims rest on an unlawfully obtained investment and (2) that Claimant did not have a social license.\n\n335.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal recalls its considerations and conclusions regarding jurisdiction. For the same reasons as discussed above for jurisdiction, an alleged illegality of the investment is not sufficient to deny admissibility, though it will have to be considered and may become relevant in the examination of the merits. Likewise, the relevance of a social license for Claimant will have to be considered in the merits and in the quantification of possible damages.\n\n**IX. THE MERITS**\n------------------\n\n**A. WHETHER RESPONDENT EXPROPRIATED CLAIMANT'S INVESTMENT IN THE SANTA ANA CONCESSION**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe Parties have submitted that expropriation is addressed by Article 812 and Annex 812.1 of the FTA, submitted as Exhibits C-0001 and R-0390. The sections of these provisions are reproduced here for reference and convenience and without prejudice to their meaning or applicability:\n\n***Article 8123: Expropriation***\n\n*1. Neither Party may nationalize or expropriate a covered investment either directly, or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\"), except for a public purpose4, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and on prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\n\n*2. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place (\"date of expropriation\"), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.*\n\n*3. Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the date of expropriation until date of payment.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*Footnote 3. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 of Article 812 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 812.1*\n\n*Footnote 4. The term \"public purpose\" shall be interpreted in accordance with international law. It is not meant to create any inconsistency with the same or similar concepts in the domestic law of either Party.*\n\n***Annex 812.1 Indirect Expropriation***\n\n*The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:*\n\n*(a) Indirect expropriation results from a measure or series of measures of a Party that have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure;*\n\n*(b) The determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Party constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:*\n\n*(i) the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred,*\n\n*(ii) the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and*\n\n*(iii) the character of the measure or series of measures;*\n\n*(c) Except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, non-discriminatory measures of a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.*\n\n337.\n\nRespondent has submitted that Chapter 22 of the FTA is also relevant:\n\n***Article 2201: General Exceptions***\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*3. For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investments or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:*\n\n*(a) to protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;*\n\n*(b) to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Agreement; or*\n\n*(c) for the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.*\n\n**1. Arguments from the Government of Canada and Party Responses**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe views of the Government of Canada are best taken from its own words:\n\n*3. [\u2026] An analysis of breach of Article 812 requires as a first step the identification of the investment alleged to have been expropriated. For there to be an expropriation, there must be a taking of fundamental ownership rights, either directly or indirectly, that causes a substantial deprivation of economic value of the investment.*\n\n*4. In the case of an alleged indirect expropriation, Annex 812.1 provides guidance on how to distinguish between whether an indirect expropriation and bona fide regulation that does not amount to an expropriation. Whether a measure constitutes a nondiscriminatory, regulatory measure designed to protect public welfare - as opposed to an indirect expropriation - requires a case-by-case, fact based inquiry that considers various factors. The Parties have articulated certain of these factors in Annex 812.1 to guide the Tribunal, including the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the measure or series of measures (for example if the measure is general in nature as opposed to targeting a particular investment). None of these factors will be determinative on its own. Together, they must be weighed along with any other relevant factors.*\n\n*5. A State is not required to compensate an investment for any loss sustained by the imposition of a non-discriminatory, regulatory measure designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives. As the tribunal in Suez InterAgua v. Argentina stated, \"in evaluating a claim of expropriation it is important to recognize a State\u2019s legitimate right to regulate and to exercise its police power in the interests of public welfare and not to confuse measures of that nature with expropriation.\"*\n\n*6. A non-discriminatory measure that is designed to protect legitimate public welfare objectives does not constitute indirect expropriation except in rare circumstances where its impacts are so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith.*422\n\nSubmission of Canada Pursuant to Article 832 of the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (Jun. 9, 2016) \u00b6\u00b6 3 - 6; *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Whether Supreme Decree 032 Effected an Indirect Expropriation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n341.\n\nSupreme Decree 032 indirectly expropriated Claimant\u2019s investment in Santa Ana, in violation of Annex 812.1 of the FTA, which specifically defines \"*indirect expropriation*.\"425 Applying the tests from Annex 812.1 of the FTA, this Tribunal will find that, under Annex 812.1(b), Supreme Decree 032 constitutes an \"*indirect expropriation*\" and that, under Annex 812.1(c), it was \"*so severe in light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith*.\"426\n\nC-II \u00b6 246; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 812(1) n.3; Annex 812.1 **[C-0001]**.\n\nC-II \u00b6 247; Anthony Sanders, *Of All Things Made in America Why are We Exporting the Penn Central Test* ?, 30 NW. J. INT' L. & BUS. 339, 344, 364 (2010) **[CL-0178]**.\n\n**(i) Arguments Related to Annex 812.1(b)**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nStarting with the \"*case-by-case, fact based inquiry*\" mandated by Annex 812.1(b) - which Respondent does not address - it is readily apparent that Supreme Decree 032 was expropriatory. Supreme Decree 032 had a substantial, adverse impact on the value of Claimant\u2019s investment. This, in the words of the *Tecmed* tribunal, is relevant in distinguishing between a regulatory measure and a *de facto* expropriation that deprives assets and rights of real substance. By reducing Claimant\u2019s investment to mining concessions to which Claimant no longer possessed clean title, Supreme Decree 032 rendered Claimant\u2019s investment worthless and incapable of sale. It also caused a US$ 170.6 million reduction in the value for the Corani Project, which has always been linked to the Santa Ana Project.427\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 56, 244 C-II \u00b6\u00b6 247 - 250; R.Prov.M.-II \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Claimant purchased seven mining concessions on the basis of Supreme Decree 083. Claimant invested tens of millions of dollars in developing the Santa Ana Project and reasonably expected that Respondent would not interfere with Claimant\u2019s right to engage in mining activity for economic benefit arbitrarily, discriminatorily, and without due process of law. Claimant reasonably expected that the authorization granted in Supreme Decree 083 would last as long as Claimant did not pose an external threat to Respondent\u2019s national security. These expectations were shattered by Supreme Decree 032.428\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 251 - 252; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Supreme Decree 032 did not arise from a public program and is not an abstract measure of general regulatory character. Rather, Supreme Decree 032 was issued when Respondent caved to electoral interests, outside of the legal process for administrative acts and in violation of Claimant\u2019s due process rights.429\n\nC-II \u00b6 253; *El di\u00e1logo primar\u00e1 en Puno*, EL PERUANO, May 27, 2011 **[C-0236]** ; Chester Brown, *Commentaries on Selected Model Investment Treaties*, Oxford University Press (2013) [ **CL-0179]** ; Bullard Second Report \u00b6 130 **[CEX-005]**.\n\n**(ii) Arguments Related to Annex 812.1(c) and the Tribunal\u2019s Questions (c) and (f)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nApplication of Annex 812.1(c) does not exonerate Respondent from liability for this indirect expropriation. Although Claimant need only prove one of the three elements of Annex 812.1(c) to prevail, Claimant has proven all three: Supreme Decree 032 (i) represents a \"*rare circumstance*\", (ii) is discriminatory, and (iii) was not designed to protect public safety.430\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 254 - 255 (*citing* R-I \u00b6\u00b6 254 - 255).\n\n346.\n\nThe language of Annex 812.1(c) is broad and requires a case-by-case factual inquiry. Regarding the first element of *\"rare circumstances'\"*, although Respondent acknowledges that the FTA does not define \"*rare circumstances*\", Respondent seeks to set out an \"*elevated standard*\" that is not supported by the express text of the FTA or the Contracting Parties\u2019 intent to afford protections against expropriation, in order to stimulate investment. Annex 812.1(c) does not impose a high burden in proving that the circumstances were rare. Rather, Annex 812.1(c) is intended to reflect that ordinary regulatory measures will not lead to international liability, except in rare circumstances. \"*Rare*\" is commonly defined as something \"*not occurring very often*.\" Here, Supreme Decree 032 is no general regulatory measure: it is a targeted administrative decision. This type of decree is not a regular occurrence under Peruvian law, and the expert, Mr. Flury, is unaware of the Ministry of Mines ever issuing a similar decree.431\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 255 - 259; R-I \u00b6\u00b6 224, 255; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Preamble **[C-0001]** ; OEFA Report No. 0011-2011 MA-SR/CONSORCIO STA regarding the Santa Ana Project, Dec. 31, 2011 **[C-0180]** ; Anthony Sanders, *Of All Things Made in America Why are We Exporting the Penn Central Test* ?, 30 NW.

Instead, Annex 812.1(c) requires proportionality between the impact of the measure and its purpose - and proportionality is wholly lacking in Supreme Decree 032. The severity of Supreme Decree 032 is beyond question: it permanently deprives Claimant of its ability to own and operate its lawfully-acquired mining concessions. The disproportionality between this and the stated goal of quelling political pressure and social protests is evident, and Respondent could have enacted a temporary measure instead. Indeed, when a nondiscriminatory measure that is designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives is \"*so severe in light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith*\", that constitutes an indirect expropriation.432\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 135 - 138; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 255, 260 - 263; R-I \u00b6\u00b6 255, 256; *MEM: Ejecutivo sigue abierto al di\u00e1logo con poblaci\u00f3n de Puno*, RPP NOTICIAS, May 27, 2011 **[C-0096]** ; *El di\u00e1logo primar\u00e1 en Puno*, EL PERUANO, May 27, 2011 **[C-0236]** ; *Alan Garc\u00eda: Hay oscuros intereses pol\u00edticos en protestas en Puno*, La Republica.pe, Jun. 25, 2011 **[C-0242]** ; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Although other foreign investors have used similar structures to acquire mining concessions within 50 km of the Peruvian border, Respondent never challenged the way in which these investors acquired their concessions.433 Again, Mr. Flury is not aware of MINEM ever issuing a similar decree.434\n\n*See e.g.* C-II \u00b6 46 - 65 (*citing* Supreme Decree 024-2008-DE, Dec. 27, 2008 **[C-0204]** ; Monterrico Metals Plc\u2019s Annual Report 2007 **[C-0205]** ; Archived Title of Entry N\u00b0 C00011 of File N\u00b0 11352728 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Rigistry Office of Lima **[C-0206]** ; *The new CEO of Monterrico had an audience with Peru\u2019s minister of Energy & Mines*, The Zijin Consortium Press Release, Jun. 11, 2007 **[C-0207]** ; *China\u2019s ambassador in Peru Gao Zhengyue investigated Majaz company*, The Zijin Consortium Press Release, Jun. 11, 2007 **[C-0208]** ; Copy of the file with the administrative procedure which led to Supreme Decree 024-2008-DE 3 - 8, 75 - 76, 98 **[C-0209]** ; *President of Peru Alan Garcia: No reason not to succeed in project Rio Blanco*, The Zijin Consortium Press Release, Mar. 21, 2008 **[C-0210]** ; Supreme Decree 021-2003-EM, Jun. 26, 2003 **[C-0211]** ; INGEMMET Unique File for mining concession \"Don Jos\u00e9\" N\u00b0 01-01751-00 2 - 5, 31 - 33, 39 - 40 **[C-0212]** ; Archived File of Entry N\u00b0 8 of File N\u00b0 11564463 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Registry Office of Lima at 6 **[C-0213]** ; Archived File of Entry C00001 of File 11564463 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Registry Office in Lima at 12 **[C-0214]** ; Entry C00005 of File 11564463 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Registry Office in Lima at 3 **[C-0215]** ; INGEMET Unique Files for mining concessions \"Don Miguel Alberto\" N\u00b0 01-00059-01 **[C-0216]** ; Supreme Decree 041-94-EM, Oct. 6, 1994 **[C-0217]** ; Archived File of Entry N\u00b0 10 of File N\u00b0 01186245 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Registry Office of Arequipa **[C-0218]** ; File 02002531 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Registry Office in Lima **[C-0219]** ; Entry N\u00b0 4 of File N\u00b0 01186245 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Registry Office of Arequipa **[C-0220]** ; INGEMET Unique Files for mining concessions \"La Soluci\u00f3n\" N\u00b0 14003327x01 **[C-0221]** ; Archived File of Entry N\u00b0 001 of File N\u00b0 02021527 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Registry Office of Lima **[C-0222]** ; Profile Rubio, Legu\u00eda & Normand: http://rubio.pe/Nosotros, http://rubio.pe/Abogados/Details/7 **[C-0223]** ; INGEMET Unique Files for mining concessions \"Mojica 1\" N\u00b0 0102296-93 **[C-0224]** ; Memorial to Gale Curtis Knutsen, Geological Society of America Memorials, Dec. 1996 **[C-0225]** ; File N\u00b0 02021527 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Registry Office of Lima 1, 3, 5, 8, 12 **[C-0226]** ; Monterrico Metals Plc\u2019s 2002 Annual Report **[C-0227]** ; Archived File of Entry N\u00b0 0010 of File N\u00b0 02021527 of the Corporate Registry of the Public Registry Office of Lima **[C-0228]** ; Entry N\u00b0 1 of the File N\u00b0 03026941 of the Registry of Powers of Attorney granted by foreign companies of the Public Registry **[C-0229]**).\n\nC-II \u00b6 264; Art. 812.1(c) Canada-Per\u00fa FTA **[C-0001]** ; Flury First Report \u00b6 64 **[CEX-006]**.\n\n349.\n\nAs Claimant\u2019s Witness, then-Minister of Mines Gala confirms, Supreme Decree 032 was not designed and applied to protect a legitimate public welfare objective. It was championed by Mr. Aduviri of the FDRN as part of his political platform. Respondent implemented Supreme Decree 032 in an effort to placate political pressure, which is not a legitimate public welfare objective. That Respondent adopted Supreme Decree 032 with other interconnected measures intended to address the full range of the protests is nothing more than a veiled attempt to legitimize the admittedly unconstitutional decree.435 Even Respondent\u2019s government officials have stated that cancellation of the Santa Ana Mining Concession due to political protests was illegal and unconstitutional.436 The Tribunal should also recall that the Constitutional Court of Lima found that the protests were not attributable to actions or omissions by Claimant.437\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 130 - 138; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 137 - 140, 255, 264 - 266; R-I \u00b6\u00b6 130, 255; Tr. 1758 (C.

Respondent was under a duty to protect both its citizens and foreign investors in its territory. Instead, it issued Supreme Decree 032, in violation of its Constitution, without due process, for political reasons. It is \"*rare*\" that a State will so blatantly and knowingly disregard its own legal framework, its international legal obligations, and all semblance of due process - and that should compel the Tribunal to find that Supreme Decree 032 constitutes an indirect expropriation.438\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 255, 267 - 268; R-I \u00b6 255; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA **[C-0001]** ; Supreme Decree No. 032-2011-EM adopted Jun. 25, 2011 **[C-0005]** ; Amparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]** ; *Di\u00e1logo no prosper\u00f3 en Puno debido a intransigencia de los dirigentes*, MINISTERIO DE ENERG\u00cdA Y MINAS, May 26, 2011 **[C-0095]** ; *Huelga de aymaras termina en \"cuarto intermedio*,\" LOS ANDES, Jun. 1, 2011 **[C-0099]** ; Acta de Supervisi\u00f3n Ambiental, Nov. 25, 2011 **[CL-0179]** ; Bullard First Report \u00b6\u00b6 121, 122, 126, 165 [ **CEX-003]**.\n\n351.\n\nTo the extent that Respondent has argued that Supreme Decree 032 was issued as part of a comprehensive set of good faith measures439 and that other concessions were also impacted, Claimant notes that there is a material difference when concessions are not merely \"*impacted*\" but are \"*taken*.\"440 Testimony confirmed that no other concession owners permanently lost their mining rights as Claimant did.441\n\nTr. 340 (R.

Although the Government considered the protesters\u2019 demands unconstitutional, officials met with protesters without Claimant, despite Claimant\u2019s repeated requests to join these meetings.443 Based on documents allegedly presented on the final days of meetings - documents which have not been produced in this hearing and which Claimant likewise never viewed or had the opportunity to respond to, Respondent considered that Claimant had engaged in a possible constitutional violation.444 Within hours, the Government decided to expropriate Claimant\u2019s investment.

It argues that the *Quiborax* tribunal held that State action would need only \"*have the effect of transferring the title*\" to amount to a direct expropriation.461 In that case, and unlike the case here, the State expressly revoked claimant\u2019s mining concessions by decree.462 In *Quiborax*, there was a transfer of title and the tribunal held that \"*for a direct expropriation to occur, there must be a forcible taking or transfer of title to the State that deprives the investor of its investment*.\"463\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 469 - 470 (*citing* C-II \u00b6 316, *quoting* *Quiborax S.A. et al. v.

Second and more importantly - Supreme Decree 083 granted Claimant no specific mining rights. Instead, it granted Claimant permission to acquire mining concessions. The concessions - not the public necessity declaration in the Supreme Decree - allow Claimant to apply for permits and authorizations. Here, since Claimant still holds title to the concessions, no specific valuable rights have been transferred and Claimant has no claim for direct expropriation.465\n\nR-II \u00b6 473; *Saluka v.

This is a high threshold - and there is nothing \"*rare*\" about a sovereign State acting to protect its citizens.468 A rare circumstance might include a showing of bad faith on the part of the State.469 Although Claimant alleges bad faith, its allegations are baseless, especially in light of the legal standard, which presumes that the regulatory authority acts in good faith.470 Respondent was not aware of the scope or details of the illegal scheme through which Claimant acquired the Santa Ana Concessions until June 2011, when protestors raised the issue with the Government.471 Claimant\u2019s reading of the \"*rare circumstances*\" language is outlandish. Under Claimant\u2019s theory, any would-be claimant could pass the \"*rare circumstances*\" test simply by presenting a handful of facts that are unique to its case. This cannot be what the Contracting Parties intended when they agreed to the language in Annex 812.1(c) of the FTA and Claimant\u2019s argument must, therefore, be rejected.472\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 479; R-I \u00b6 255; *Tza Yap Shum v.

Rather, Respondent took a specific action related to Santa Ana based on its unique circumstances, namely, its dubious acquisition and its status as a lightning rod for protest.473 Although Claimant points out that no other mining company lost its right to own and operate mining concessions, Claimant does not identify a single comparable mining company that was the target of protests or that used a scheme similar to Claimant\u2019s to acquire concession rights. Unless and until Claimant can identify another mining company in similar circumstances, its discrimination argument merits no consideration.474 The protests in southern Puno focused directly on the Santa Ana Project and, therefore, taking actions with respect to Santa Ana in particular was a rational regulatory choice. In any event, Respondent\u2019s actions in the mining sector were not limited to Claimant. Respondent suspended all new mining projects in Puno for 36 months and required prior consultation for all projects in the region, including those not owned by foreigners.475\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 482.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 482 - 483.\n\nR-I \u00b6 259; Tr. 1885 - 1887 (R.

The facts were deemed to be truthful at the time (and in hindsight, they also were). Claimant could have questioned former Prime Minister Rosario Fern\u00e1ndez, who chaired the Council of Ministers and the Minister of Justice at the time, for more information about the deliberative process leading to Supreme Decree 032, but Claimant chose not to.478\n\nTr. 1874 - 1875 (R.

That proceeding is still pending.490 Although Claimant now claims that Supreme Decree 032 was an act of expropriation, they had already vacated the site and complete the required actions for approval of the ESIA.491\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 118; Tr. 830:1 - 832:3 (Gala); Tr. 1883 - 1884 (R.

In substantial part, the source of the social crisis was community opposition to the Santa Ana Project.497 Time was of the essence and it was clear that Claimant has lost all community support.498\n\nPO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4(c).\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6 79.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 82 - 84; Tr. 801, 808 (Gala); Tr. 923 (Zegarra); \"Juliaca: Six People Dead After Violence During Protests\" *La Republica Newspaper* **[R-050]** ; Gala Second Statement \u00b6 20 **[RWS-5]** ; Fern\u00e1ndez Statement \u00b6 24 **[RWS-4]** ; Gala Second Statement \u00b6 17 **[RWS-5]** ; Zegarra Second Statement \u00b6 20 **[RWS-7]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 83, 85, 86; Tr. 231 - 232 (R.

For greater certainty, paragraph 1 of Article 812 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 812.1*\n\n*Footnote 4. The term \"public purpose\" shall be interpreted in accordance with international law. It is not meant to create any inconsistency with the same or similar concepts in the domestic law of either Party.*\n\n371.\n\nFurther, Annex 812.1 referred to in footnote 3 provides:\n\n***Annex 812.1 Indirect Expropriation***\n\n*The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:*\n\n*(a) Indirect expropriation results from a measure or series of measures of a Party that have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure;*\n\n*(b) The determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Party constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:*\n\n*(i) the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred,*\n\n*(ii) the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and*\n\n*(iii) the character of the measure or series of measures;*\n\n*(c) Except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, non-discriminatory measures of a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.*\n\n372.\n\nWith these provisions, the FTA contains more extensive and detailed definitions and rules than do most other BITs. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that its examination of whether Supreme Decree 032 was an indirect expropriation by Respondent must focus on these specific provisions, which are applicable in the present case.\n\n373.\n\nSupreme Decree 032, in its Article 1, expressly derogates Supreme Decree 083 which, expressly:\n\n\u2022 in its Article 1 declared that Claimant\u2019s private investment in mining activities \"*is a public necessity*\" as required under Article 71 of the Constitution of Peru,\n\n\u2022 in its Article 2 authorized Claimant to acquire seven defined mining rights located in the Puno department,\n\n\u2022 in its Article 3 ruled that Respondent\u2019s mining authority \"*shall grant the authorizations*\" for Claimant\u2019s mining activities listed in Article 2.\n\n**(i) Examination of the \"factors\" provided by Annex 812.1 FTA**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal will now examine whether these effects of Supreme Decree 032 fall under the \"*factors*\" that Annex 812.1 of the FTA mentions in its subsection (b) for the determination of whether a measure constitutes an indirect expropriation.\n\n375.\n\nApplying the **first of these factors** mentioned in subsection (i), the Tribunal finds that there was an obvious \"*economic impact*\" of Supreme Decree 032 by revoking the above-mentioned authorizations of Supreme Decree 083, which deprived Claimant of all the major legal rights it had obtained and needed for the realization of its mining Project.\n\n376.\n\nApplying the **second of these factors** mentioned in subsection (ii), the Tribunal finds that \"*distinct, reasonable expectations*\" which Claimant could base on the rulings in Supreme Decree 083 were \"*interfered with* [\u2026]\" As Claimant points out499 and as is obvious to the Tribunal, Claimant relied on the express governmental authorization by Supreme Decree 083, when it exercised its options to acquire the Karina Mining Concessions in December 2007. Without these authorizations, Claimant could not have been expected to invest the amounts it undisputedly invested between 2007 and 2011.\n\nC-II \u00b6 208.\n\n377.\n\nApplying the **third of these factors** mentioned in subsection (iii), the Tribunal will hereafter examine in detail the \"*character of the measure*\" by considering the wording and reasoning provided in Supreme Decree 032 and the circumstances under which it was decided and issued.\n\n**(ii) Summary of the Factual Circumstances leading to Supreme Decree 032**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nAs a first step, the Tribunal will now summarize the **factual** circumstances leading to Supreme Decree 032 as it evaluates and concludes from the evidence available from the file and from the Hearing.\n\n379.\n\nUp to the meeting of June 23, 2011, all authorities speaking for Respondent had said that they considered the procedure adopted by Claimant and the authorizations granted to Claimant to be legal. Claimant\u2019s application for the declaration of public necessity included the Option Agreements and disclosed Claimant\u2019s relationship with Ms. Villavicencio. MINEM500, the Ministry of Defence501, and the Vice-Minister Secretary General of Foreign Affairs502 all reviewed the application. After approximately one year of review, Supreme Decree 083 was issued. It expressly included the authorizations and rights mentioned above and was signed by the Constitutional President of Peru, the President of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Justice, the Minister of Defence, and the Minister of Energy and Mines.503 Over a period of approximately three years thereafter, as will be addressed in some more detail later in this Award, Respondent supported Claimant\u2019s Project in various ways. Respondent approved Claimant\u2019s CPP and publicly acknowledged that revoking Supreme Decree 083 would be \"*completely illegal* [\u2026]\"504 Further, Respondent\u2019s witness, ViceMinister Gala, conceded in an interview that the social unrest in the Puno region was not a sufficient reason to derogate Supreme Decree 083.505\n\nResolution issued by MINEM to the Ministry of Defense for the Authorization to Acquire Mineral Rights filed by Bear Creek Mining Company, Mar. 12, 2007 **[C-0044]**.\n\nLetter from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Peruvian Armed Forces to the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense, Jul. 26, 2007 **[C-0045]**.\n\nLetter from the Vice-Minister Secretary General of External Relations to the Ministry of Mines, Sept. 26, 2007 **[C-****0046]**.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 083-2007-EM adopted Nov. 29, 2007 **[C-0004]**.\n\n*Di\u00e1logo no prosper\u00f3 en Puno debido a intransigencia de los dirigentes*, MINISTERIO DE ENERG\u00cdA Y MINAS, May 26, 2011 **[C-0095]**.\n\nEntrevista al Ing. Fernando Gala, Presidente del Consejo de Miner\u00eda, Pontifica Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa, Nov. 18, 2013 **[C-0197]**.\n\n380.\n\nWhen from June 17 - 23, 2011, the Prime Minister and other government officials met with representatives of the protesters in Lima, these meetings and particularly the meeting of June 23, 2011 were undisputedly organized to deal with the social unrest. The Tribunal appreciates that, at that time, the Government was under strong political pressure and was urgently looking for steps that could be hoped to improve the situation. The Tribunal also finds it politically plausible that the Government did not invite Claimant to attend the meeting because such attendance might indeed have made the discussion at the meeting more difficult. From the evidence, it is clear that Respondent\u2019s representatives as well as the other participants were desperately looking for a helpful decision, but had great difficulties in agreeing on one. Under these circumstances, when around 9 or 10 pm Congressman Lescano intervened and alleged that Claimant had illegally obtained Supreme Decree 083 by involving Ms. Villavicencio without disclosing that to Respondent, it seems that those at the meeting \"*jumped*\" on that reason in order to derogate Supreme Decree 083. Respondent alleges that Congressman Lescano presented new documents which for the first time showed this allegation. The testimony of Respondent\u2019s witnesses Vice-Minister Gala and Mr. Zegarra provide some details of what occurred in this regard at the meeting on June 23, 2011.506 Mr. Zegarra testified that, in his position as the Director of the Office of the Legal Advisor of the Ministry of Mines, he participated in the meeting as an observer and gave legal advice at the meeting. He also testified that the documents were reviewed \"*very quickly*\"507 and that he did not recall \"*exactly the sequence of events*.\"508\n\nTr. 762:1-4 (Gala), and 930 *et seq*. (Zegarra).\n\nTr. 973:18 (Zegarra).\n\nTr. 974:20 - 977 (Zegarra, questions and answers with Chairman Bockstiegel).\n\n381.\n\nNeither the nature of these documents nor the persons who examined them thereafter could be fully clarified at the Hearing. Respondent has not been able to produce such documents and has claimed that these were lost in the subsequent process. This is difficult to understand in view of the alleged high relevance of the documents as a basis for an important decision of the Government, *i.e.* Supreme Decree 032. The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that Respondent has not fulfilled its burden of proof in this regard and it cannot rely on such documents.\n\n382.\n\nIt is undisputed that, after the alleged documents had been shown in the meeting around 9 or 10 pm on June 23, according to Respondent\u2019s witness Mr. Zegarra, by 1 or 2 in the morning, the first and final versions of Article 1 of Supreme Decree 032 (which derogated Supreme Decree 083) were drafted by a person he could not identify. He assumes, though he could not provide any details, that by 1:30 am, 15 to 19 ministers of the Council of Ministers could be reached, were contacted, approved the draft without seeing the alleged documents, and that the President of the Republic signed the Supreme Decree. Neither Mr. Gala nor Mr. Zegarra could provide any details of this process as it occurred during these hours of the night.509\n\nTr. 863 (Gala) and 1019 - 1025 (Zegarra).\n\n383.\n\nIt is undisputed that Claimant was not contacted and given an opportunity to comment before Supreme Decree 032 was issued.\n\n**(iii) Legal Evaluation**\n--------------------------\n\n384.\n\nTaking into account the above summary of the factual development until Supreme Decree 032 was issued, the Tribunal will now turn to the **legal evaluation**.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Questions in section 2.1.4 (c) and (d) of PO-10 address the legal basis of Supreme Decree 032 and the Parties replied to these questions in their Post-Hearing Briefs.\n\n386.\n\nSupreme Decree 032 expressly contains the following references regarding the evidence it relies on:\n\n*In view of the documents submitted, Supreme Decree No. 083-2007-EM was issued;*\n\n*Circumstances have been made known that would imply the disappearance of the legally required conditions for the issuance of the mentioned act;*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*As such, given the existence of these new circumstances, it is necessary to issue the corresponding act; [...]*\n\n387.\n\nIt is not quite clear whether this reference refers to the documents allegedly presented at the meeting of June 23, 2011. This seems probable in view of the references to \"*Circumstances have been made known*\" and \"*these new circumstances.*\" As the Tribunal concluded above, the existence and content of such documents has not been shown and the Tribunal, thus, cannot rely on them. Further, no other new documents have been presented by Respondent to which the above cited reference may be directed. Therefore, the Tribunal has to conclude that the above cited reference in Supreme Decree 032 to \"*documents*\" and \"*circumstances*\" provides no evidentiary justification for the Decree.\n\n388.\n\nFurther, Supreme Decree 032 provides expressly two legal reasons on which it relies:\n\n1) the existence of the alleged \"*new circumstances*\" already addressed above.\n\n2) \"*Additionally, it was deemed pertinent to provide that the Executive Power, for the purpose of safeguarding the environmental and social conditions in the areas of the Huacullani and Kelluyo districts in the Chucuito province of the Puno department\"*\n\n389.\n\nAs will be elaborated below, neither justification was sufficient to justify the derogation of Supreme Decree 083.\n\n**(iv) Did Claimant\u2019s Involvement of Ms. Villavicencio Justify the Derogation of Decree 083?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nThe first reason, the \"*new circumstances*\", relies on the allegedly newly discovered unconstitutionality of Supreme Decree 083 due to the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio.\n\n391.\n\nAs already mentioned above, the evidence provided by Respondent does not show that any new documents were produced at the meeting of June 23, 2011 which showed new circumstances. Accordingly, the Tribunal has to examine whether the existing file in this arbitration would justify the allegation of unconstitutionality.\n\n392.\n\nIn this context, it is helpful to recall the timetable of relevant events submitted by Claimant510 and available from the file:\n\nC-III pp. 30 - 34.\n\n393.\n\nThe public necessity approval by Supreme Decree 083 by the President of the Republic was granted on the basis of Claimant\u2019s Request for Authorization to Acquire Mining Rights Located at the Border Zone received by the MINEM on December 5, 2006.511 The Application and its Annexes I to XI contained all of the details that were expressly required by the relevant legal provisions regarding the Santa Ana mining concessions, including documents confirming that Ms. Villavicencio was a Bear Creek representative *(apoderada)* and owned these concessions, and that Claimant had entered into Option Agreements with Ms. Villavicencio in November and December 2004, which provided that Claimant could acquire the concessions if a Declaration of Public Necessity was received from Respondent. Copies of the documents regarding the Option Agreements were attached in Annexes VIII and IX of the Application. By letter dated February 8, 2008, MINEM confirmed having received the Application and requested further information. But, neither in that letter, nor later, did MINEM request any further information regarding or objecting to the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio.\n\nRequest from Bear Creek to MINEM soliciting the authorization to acquire mining rights located in the border area, Dec. 4, 2006 (UPDATE submitted with C-III) **[C-0017]**.\n\n394.\n\nAfter nearly one year of what Respondent itself characterizes as \"*careful consideration by the government authorities\"*512, on November 28, 2007 Respondent approved the Application by Supreme Decree 083 signed by the Constitutional President of Peru, the President of the Council of Ministers, the Minister of Energy and Mines, and the Minister of Defence. The Decree was published the following day and expressly gave the declaration of Public Necessity required under Article 71 of the Constitution and authorized Claimant to acquire the seven mining concessions. Thereafter, Ms. Villavicencio transferred to Claimant the concessions as was provided in the seven option agreements.513 These transfer agreements were registered by SUNARP on February 1 and 28, 2008.514\n\nR-I \u00b6 29.\n\nContracts for the Transfer of Mineral Rights between Jenny Karina Villavicencio Gardini and Bear Creek Mining Company, Sucursal del Per\u00fa, Dec. 3, 2007 **[C-0015]** ; Notarized Contracts for the Transfer of Mineral Rights between Jenny Karina Villavicencio Gardini and Bear Creek Mining Company, Sucursal del Per\u00fa, Dec. 6, 2007 **[C-0019]**.\n\nSUNARP Registration Notice of the Transfer Agreement for Santa Ana Concessions 9A, 1, 2 and 3, Feb. 1, 2008 **[C-0020]** ; SUNARP Registration Notice of the Transfer Agreement for Santa Ana Concessions 5, 6 and 7, Feb. 28, 2008 **[C-0021]**.\n\n395.\n\nFrom this evidence, it is clear that the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio was disclosed in the Application when it was examined by the various government authorities. Respondent does not deny having received this information, but claims that it was \"*given in separate bits and pieces to separate entities or divisions within MINEM. No one official knew the full extent of Bear Creek\u2019s relations and agreements with Ms. Villavicencio\"515* and that *\"only [...] a single piece of paper buried on page 83 of some 200 pages of the application showed that she was a legal representative of Bear Creek for limited matters - but* not *that she was an employee. \"*516 The Tribunal is not persuaded by these objections. Ms. Villavicencio had been registered as an employee of Bear Creek with the Peruvian Ministry of Labor since 2003. Also in 2003, SUNARP registered the Power of Attorney for Ms. Villavicencio as legal representative of Claimant in certain matters. The Option Agreements submitted with the Application demonstrated that Ms. Villavicencio, a Peruvian citizen, was to transfer the concessions to Claimant, a foreign investor, once the Government had confirmed the public necessity in accordance with Article 71 of the Constitution. Respondent has not been able to point to any legal disclosure requirement disregarded by Ms. Villavicencio or by Claimant in its Application. Regardless, during the \"*careful consideration by the government authorities'*517 over a period of almost one year, the above mentioned available information regarding Ms. Villavicencio\u2019s involvement could not be neglected by the government agencies involved in the process and at the very least should have been noted. The alleged oversight, if it existed, must be attributed to Respondent and not to Claimant. Therefore, the Tribunal does not see any reason why the process as conducted would make the Application or the resulting Supreme Decree 083 unconstitutional.\n\nR-II \u00b6 66.\n\n*Id*. at\u00b6 68.\n\nR-I \u00b6 29.\n\n396.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the Decision of the First Specialized Constitutional Court of Lima of May 12, 2014.518 Its dispositive has the following wording:\n\n*DECLARE IN FORCE:*\n\n*1. The acknowledgement of the private investment to be carried out by BEAR CREEK in the development of the Santa Ana mining project as a public necessity; and*\n\n*2. The ownership of BEAR CREEK of the following mining rights located in the Puno department, in the border zone with Bolivia: i) KARINA 9A under code 01-0146204; ii) KARINA 1 under code 01-01463-04; iii) KARINA 2 under code 01-0146404; iv) KARINA 5 under code 01-03676-04; v) KARINA 6 under code 01-0367804; and vi) KARINA 7 under code 01-03677-04.*\n\nAmparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]**.\n\n397.\n\nAnd in particular, its reasoning in section 11.3. expresses:\n\n*In this case, claimant was granted mining rights for Karina 9A, Karina 1, Karina 2, Karina 3. Karina 5, Karina 6 and Karina 7 after complying with the legally required requirements to obtain the same within the fifty kilometers from the border, and (the investment) declared a public necessity which resulted in the investment of the Santa Ana project that bore the authorization of the General Director of Mining Environmental Matters* [...]\n\n398.\n\nRespondent filed an appeal against the decision, but the appeal was not continued because Claimant withdrew its action upon commencing this ICSID arbitration. However, the present Tribunal considers this decision as relevant for its own examination. It serves at least as a confirmation by a court with special expertise and jurisdiction for the Constitution of Peru for the Tribunal\u2019s own conclusion that Supreme Decree 083 was not unconstitutional due to the application process of Claimant.\n\n399.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the first reason given in Supreme Decree 032 and in Respondent\u2019s arguments, *i.e.* that Claimant had illegally obtained the public necessity declaration by Supreme Decree 083 through to the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio, is not valid.\n\n**(v) Did the Social Unrest Justify the Derogation of Supreme Decree 083?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nThe Tribunal will now examine the **second reason** given in Supreme Decree 032 and in Respondent\u2019s arguments, *i.e.* that the **social unrest** in the Puno department required the derogation of Supreme Decree 083.\n\n401.\n\nIt is undisputed that this social unrest existed and indeed that it was the reason for the meetings in Lima which ended by the decisions in the evening of June 23 and in the early morning of June 24, 2011. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls its summary of the factual situation above regarding the strong political pressure on Respondent at that time. The Tribunal appreciates that the Government was desperately searching for a solution that would solve the unrest. However, while it is politically plausible for a government to take any action which it hopes to produce such an effect, the issues for the present Tribunal are whether the unrest was caused by or can be attributed to Claimant and whether Respondents action depriving Claimant of the rights it had been granted by Supreme Decree 083 was legally justified.\n\n402.\n\nIn PO-10, the Tribunal requested that the Parties to reply to the following question at section 2.1.4. (a) (iii): *What actions were legally required of Claimant in seeking to obtain a Social License, and did the Claimant take these actions?* Further, in PO-10, the Tribunal requested that the Parties to reply to the following question 2.1.4.(a) (iv): *In the present case, what were the State authorities\u2019 responsibilities in relation to obtaining a Social License?*\n\n403.\n\nIn response to that first question, Claimant describes in detail the actions it undertook519 and the Tribunal appreciates that its many efforts included a variety of actions of outreach to the local communities both on its own and in cooperation with Respondent\u2019s authorities. Respondent argues that these actions were not sufficient to fulfill the legal requirements.520\n\nCPHB-I pp. 5 - 18.\n\nRPHB-I pp. 20 - 25.\n\n404.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal considers that actions beyond those that Claimant undertook would have been possible and feasible.\n\n405.\n\nThe events in 2008 show that opposition to the Project was expressed clearly and repeatedly by certain sectors of the local community, and that opposition focused not only on the Project but also on the role of Claimant:\n\n\u2022 May 4, 2008: one of Claimant\u2019s staff members was attacked and threatened in the Kelluyo District, in the course of efforts to explain the company\u2019s environmental management programme;521\n\n\u2022 September 4, 2008: Claimant\u2019s employees were physically detained in the Ancomarca Community for several hours, as more support and extra services for local communities were demanded;522\n\n\u2022 October 14, 2008: There was continued unrest, including looting and burning of a campsite of Claimant's. In the process, the Community Relations Manager at Santa Ana was forced to crawl and say (while being filmed) that \"*the foreigners must leave and not return*.\"523 In the interview he also states that since he joined the company in 2004, there had always been opposition to Santa Ana from the leaders/groups that caused the disturbances in October 2008.524\n\nDeposition of Leon Jorge Aguilar Gomez, in Criminal File No. 277-2008-PE of the Second Provincial Prosecutors Office Chucuito Desaguadero (10/20/2008) \u00b6 8 **[R-342]**.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 6.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 4.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 6.\n\n406.\n\nEven though the concept of \"*social license*\" is not clearly defined in international law, all relevant international instruments are clear that consultations with indigenous communities are to be made with the purpose of obtaining consent from all the relevant communities.525 In its application for a public necessity declaration, Claimant listed 5 communities as falling within the Project\u2019s area of direct influence and 21 communities within the Project\u2019s indirect area of influence.526 Claimant continuously emphasized - including at the Hearing - that it went far beyond the minimum requirements of Article 4 of Ministerial Resolution No. 304527 by, amongst others, conducting over 130 community outreach workshops. Still, the question remains whether Claimant took the appropriate and necessary steps to engage all of the relevant and likely to be affected local communities, and whether its approach contributed significantly to the nature and extent of the opposition that followed. Relevant evidence includes, for example:\n\n\u2022 Exhibit C-155: report on workshops held in 2009, it was recommended that more workshops be carried out to avoid social conflict,528 as \"*the community does not trust*\" the company, due to a lack of information and workshops.529\n\n\u2022 The jobs/rotational programme was implemented in a manner that purposely sought to benefit only those communities in close proximity to the Project, and appears to have been implemented as a means to compensate those local communities for land use rights. More distant communities, including those likely to be affected by water use and contamination, were not brought into the process and offered work or other forms of recompense.530\n\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Art. 32 **[R-108]**.\n\nRequest from Bear Creek to MINEM soliciting the authorization to acquire mining rights located in the border area, Dec. 4, 2006 (UPDATE submitted with C-III) **[C-0017]** ; Map of Distances of *Comunidades Campesinas* Population Centers to the Santa Ana Area of Influence **[R-312]** (Map taken directly from Claimant\u2019s ESIA for exploration.

Another letter followed later in November 2010, indicating that another meeting would take place on January 9, 2011 and requesting that a mining activities workshop be conducted. In the letter, the community still referred to Claimant as \"*a mining company called 'Proyecto Santa Ana'*\".531 This appears to confirm that even at that late stage, a number of relevant communities were being contacted only for the first time, that the process of obtaining the necessary \"*social license*\" was far from complete, and that some communities were still unclear about who was driving the Project.\n\n\u2022 March 2011: a memorial to the President, submitted by communities from Chucuito, El Collao, Puno and Yunguyo requesting (amongst others) that the EIA be cancelled, on grounds of fears of pollution:532 \"*the permanent withdrawal of the Bear Creek Mining Company (Santa Ana Mining Project) and their removal from the area to prevent confrontations with the local residents that could later occur in all above-mentioned jurisdictions[]*\";533\n\n\u2022 March 11, 2011: letter from Kelluyo/Alto Aracachi Quluyo Community to Puno officials534 stating that a certain public meeting was a closed-door meeting, which meant that not everyone could participate, that questions were not sufficiently addressed, and that Claimant had not previously offered information on developments;\n\n\u2022 April 25, 2011: a previously threatened strike began in City of Desaguadero, after the Regional President refused to sign an ordinance prohibiting all mining activities in the south of Puno;\n\n\u2022 April 26, 2011: Regional President of Puno asked the central Government to intervene by suspending the activities of the Santa Ana Project run by Claimant; the letter to Minister of Energy and Mines, referenced discontent and rejection in district of Kelluyo and reported concerns voiced by affected communities, which included lack of transparency and due consultation.535\n\nLetters from Kelluyo to *Defensor\u00eda* Requesting Information on Santa Ana Project **[R-347]**.\n\nMemorials submitted by the Frente de Defensa and Kelluyo\u2019s *Comunidades Campesinas* to the President of Peru, Memorial No. 0001-2011-CO-FDRN-RSP **[R-016]**.\n\nMemorials submitted by the Frente de Defensa and Kelluyo\u2019s *Comunidades Campesinas* to Minister of Energy and Mines, Memorial No. 0002- 2011-CO-FDRN-RSP **[R-017]** (dated March 10, 2011: same memorial as Exhibit R-016, but addressed to MINEM); Memorial submitted by the Frente de Defensa and Kelluyo\u2019s *Comunidades Campesinas* to Congress, Memorial No. 0005-2011-CO-FDRN-RSP **[R-015]** (dated March 10, 2011: same memorial, but addressed to Congress).\n\nList of Participants at the Public Hearing **[R-055]** ; Letter from Kelluyo Community Inquiring about the Project **[R-053]** ; Letters from Kelluyo District on Santa Ana\u2019s Public Hearing **[R-304]**.\n\nLetter from the Regional President of Puno to the Minister of Energy and Mines, Letter No. 520-2011-GR-PUNO/PR (4/26/2011) **[R-018]**.\n\n410.\n\nFor its legal evaluation, the Tribunal agrees with the *Abengoa* Award, in which the tribunal held: \"*For the international responsibility of a State to be excluded or reduced based on the investor\u2019s omission or fault, it is necessary not only to prove said omission or fault, but also to establish a causal link between [the omission or fault] and the harm suffered. In other words, for the argument to succeed, there must be evidence that if a social communication program had been timely implemented since 2003, the 2009 and 2010 events that led to the loss of the Claimants\u2019 investment would not have occurred.*\"536\n\n*Abengoa S.A. y Cofides S.A. v.

Rather, the evidence shows that Respondent\u2019s various authorities involved in the procedure were aware of and did not object to Claimant\u2019s outreach activities and, from the very beginning until before the meeting of June 2011, approved and often even endorsed these:\n\n\u2022 At the Hearing, Claimant\u2019s witness Ant\u00fanez de Mayolo testified: \"*One last question: Prior to the enactment of Supreme Decree 032, did the Peruvian Government ever advise Bear Creek that the execution of its citizen-participation mechanisms was inadequate? A. Never. We were never told anything.*\"537\n\n\u2022 Claimant worked with MINEM, DREM, and health and education representatives of the Puno region to organize activities for the communities to improve their education and training.538\n\n\u2022 At MINEM\u2019s request, DREM or the local authorities at DREM\u2019s direction, chaired the five workshops organized by Claimant.539 As confirmed by Respondent\u2019s witness Ram\u00edrez Delpino, neither MINEM nor DREM ever informed Claimant of any concerns they may have had regarding the workshops.540\n\n\u2022 Supreme Decree 028 provided that DGAAM was responsible for reviewing, in the first instance, both the executive summary and the CPP, and had the authority to make \"*observations or order[] any amendments or changes that may be required*.\"541 By December 2010, Claimant had conducted over 130 workshops in a total of 18 communities within the direct and indirect areas of influence, as well as meetings with national, regional, and local authorities, to the district of Huacullani, the district of Kelluyo, province of Chucuito as confirmed by Respondent\u2019s witness Ant\u00fanez de Mayolo.542 On December 23, 2010, Bear Creek submitted to DGAAM its ESIA for the exploitation phase, along with the Executive Summary and the CPP.543\n\n\u2022 In December 2010, the OEFA visited Santa Ana and the OEFA Report No. 0082010 expressly stated: \"*Relations with the communities located around the Santa Ana Exploration Project area have not caused any kind of social conflict, in what can be construed as a very friendly relationship.*\"544\n\n\u2022 On January 7, 2011, DGAAM approved Claimant\u2019s CPP and the Executive Summary of its ESIA for exploitation.545 Mr. Ram\u00edrez Delpino testified that DGAAM could have rejected the Executive Summary or the CPP instead of approving either, but that in this case, both documents complied with all applicable regulations, and DGAAM had raised no concerns.546 In this context, the Tribunal notes that DGAAM determined expressly that the citizen participation mechanisms that Claimant proposed to implement during the evaluation of the ESIA and during the execution of the mining project were \"*appropriate to the particular characteristics of the mining activity area of influence, of the project and its magnitude and the relevant population in accordance with Article No. 6 of Supreme Decree No. 028[\u2026]*\"547\n\n\u2022 In preparation of the Public Hearing, on January 21, 2011, Mr. Ant\u00fanez de Mayolo informed DGAAM that Claimant had complied with all requirements.548\n\n\u2022 The public hearing took place on February 23, 2011. It was chaired by Kristiam Veliz Soto, a MINEM attorney, who was assisted by Jes\u00fas Obed Alvarez Quispe, President of DREM. A Special Prosecutor for Environmental Matters, Dr. Alejandro Tapia G\u00f3mez, also attended. By the contemporaneous accounts in the evidence, the public hearing was a success. MINEM even issued a press release after the public hearing indicating that the event had ended satisfactorily.549 Respondent has alleged that the hearing was not satisfactory, but it has neither produced the video made of the hearing or produced evidence of any participant in the hearing.550 Therefore, the Tribunal sees no sufficient evidence which would show that the conduct and results of the hearing would not comply with the legal requirements.\n\n\u2022 Vice-Minister of Energy and Mines Fernando Gala wrote in his aide-memoire that Claimant \"*had no problems when it held the public hearing for the [ESIA] of the Santa Ana project in Huacullani on February 23, 2011.*\" *551*\n\n\u2022 At a meeting on May 17, 2011, Mr. Ram\u00edrez Delpino described \"*the harmonious development of the presentation of the environmental impact study*.\"552\n\n\u2022 At the Hearing in this arbitration, Mr. Ram\u00edrez Delpino confirmed that if DGAAM had believed that further information needed to be communicated to the local communities to clear up any misunderstanding or alleviate any concern, it would have ordered Claimant to hold additional workshops after the public hearing.553\n\n\u2022 In May 2011, Vice-Minister Gala publicly acknowledged that revoking Supreme Decree 083 would be \"*completely illegal* [\u2026]\"554\n\nTr. 571:8-12.\n\nAusenco Vector, *Plan de Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana* (\"PPC\") de Bear Creek p. 6 Section 2.4.3 **[C-0155]**.\n\nResolution Approving First Amendment to the EIA for Exploration for the Santa Ana Project, Directorial Resolution No. 216-2008-MEM/AAM **[R-036]** ; Resolution Approving Second Amendment to the EIA for Exploration for the Santa Ana Project, Directorial Resolution No. 310-2009-MEM/AAM **[R-037]** ; Resolution Approving Third Amendment to the EIA for Exploration for the Santa Ana Project, Directorial Resolution No. 280-2010-MEM/AAM **[R-038]**.\n\nTr. 1090:4-7 (Ram\u00edrez Delpino) (\"*Q.

While, as mentioned above, further actions by Claimant would have been feasible, on the basis of the continued coordination with and support by Respondent\u2019s authorities, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant could take it for granted to have complied with all legal requirements with regard to its outreach to the local communities. Respondent, after its continuous approval and support of Claimant\u2019s conduct, cannot in hindsight claim that this conduct was contrary to the ILO Convention 169 or was insufficient, and caused or contributed to the social unrest in the region.\n\n413.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the decision of First Constitutional Court of Lima which confirmed the validity of Supreme Decree 083 and, in particular, in its reasoning in the chapter titled *NINTH: Concerning the hindrance of the principle of legal security the following is set out:* expressed in subsection 5 *:*\n\n*The issuance of Supreme Decree No. 032-2011-EM that derogates the decree cited in the previous paragraph, as previously analyzed, does not impute responsibility whatsoever upon the claimant, rather it lacks proper reasoning, as it attributes its issuance to 'circumstances that would imply the disappearance of the legally required conditions for the issuance of the mentioned act.' Namely, it does not set out the circumstances (based on the publications one deduces that these would be the violent demonstrations and illicit attacks on public and private property in the Puno department) and, with respect to the disappearance of the conditions, the cited decree is drafted using an uncertain conditional [conjugation] 'would imply'; therefore the issuance of Supreme Decree No. 032-2011-EM is an action by the State that is not found within the margins of reasonability and proportionality, required not to violate the principle of legal security. Given that, as mentioned, these circumstances are not attributable to the claimant, in which case, the issuance of a decree such as the one issued would be justifiable if it had been the claimant who committed or omitted actions that implied the disappearance of the required conditions and from the reading thereof one cannot observe in the cited decree any of these reasons. Namely, there is no justified purpose for bringing an action by the State to reverse the rights granted to BEAR CREEK MINING COMPANY SUCURUSAL DEL PERU, which were granted in fulfillment of the corresponding procedures and complying with the necessary requirements.*555\n\nAmparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]**.\n\n414.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the **Tribunal concludes** that also the **second reason** given in Supreme Decree 032, *i.e.* \"*the purpose of safeguarding the environmental and social conditions*\", discussed by the Parties as \"*social unrest*\", does not justify the derogation of Supreme Decree 083 and that, therefore, neither of the two reasons given in the Decree can be a basis for the derogation.\n\n**(vi) Conclusion regarding the indirect expropriation**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nFrom the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the three \"factors\" expressly provided in Annex 812.1(b) of the FTA for the identification of an indirect expropriation are fulfilled:\n\n\u2022 in application of subsection (i), there is an \"*economic impact*\" as Supreme Decree 032 has an adverse effect on the economic value of Claimant\u2019s investment,\n\n\u2022 in application of subsection (ii), Supreme Decree 032 interferes with Claimant\u2019s distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations,\n\n\u2022 in application of subsection (iii), the character of the measure did not justify the taking, because Supreme Decree 032 was based on reasons which have been found to be illegal according to Peruvian law and do not justify a breach of the FTA.\n\n416.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Supreme Decree 032 was an indirect expropriation in the sense of Article 812 and Annex 812.1 of the FTA.\n\n**3. Whether Supreme Decree 032 Effected a Direct Expropriation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n417.\n\nRegardless of whether it is classified as a direct or an indirect expropriation, Supreme Decree 032 constitutes an illegal taking of property.556 Supreme Decree 032 revoked Claimant\u2019s right to acquire and own the Santa Ana concessions that Supreme Decree 083 embodied. Supreme Decree 083 was the *sine qua non* of the entire Santa Ana Project - and, as Prof. Bullard explains, it was an intrinsic and essential component of Claimant\u2019s property right in the Santa Ana Project. Without Supreme Decree 083, Claimant is not permitted to conduct any activity in connection with the concessions. According to Respondent, Claimant has nothing more than an inoperative nominal title.557 Respondent\u2019s revocation of Supreme Decree 083 constitutes a forcible and unlawful taking of Claimant\u2019s property, for which Respondent must compensate Claimant.558 The legality of Respondent\u2019s direct expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment must be measured against Article 812, and Claimant incorporates its arguments related to these legal requirements by reference.559\n\nC-II \u00b6 242.\n\nTr. 1778 - 1779 (C.

It granted Claimant the right to acquire, own, and possess the Santa Ana concessions after making a finding that the Santa Ana Project constituted a public necessity. Respondent\u2019s own official documents - including the Lima First Constitutional Court\u2019s decision - confirm that Supreme Decree 083 granted Claimant a distinct set of rights to:\n\n\u2022 *\"[E]xplore and exploit mineral resources granted.\"*\n\n\u2022 *\"[U]se and enjoyment of the natural resource granted and, consequently, the property of the fruits and products that are extracted.\"*\n\n\u2022 *\"[A] right in rem... consist[ing] of the sum of the attributes that this law recognizes in favor of the concessionaire.*\n\n\u2022 *These rights are irrevocable provided the holder meets the obligations that this law or special legislation requires to maintain its validity.561*\n\nC-I \u00b6 123; C-II \u00b6 312; R-I \u00b6\u00b6 250 - 251.\n\nC-II \u00b6 322; R-II \u00b6 226; Bullard Second Report \u00b6 10 **[CEX-005]** ; Supreme Decree 014-92-EM **[Bullard-031]** (updated); Ley de Promoci\u00f3n de Inversiones en el Sector Minero, Decreto Legislativo No. 708, de fecha 13 de noviembre de 1991 **[Flury-002]** ; Organic Law for the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources, Law No. 26821 **[R-0142]**.\n\n419.\n\nSupreme Decree 083, thus, is a fundamental component of Claimant\u2019s property right.562\n\nC-I \u00b6 123; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 312 - 313, 322 - 324; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Supreme Decree 032 involves no transfer of ownership - it merely revokes Supreme Decree 083, which authorized Claimant to acquire mining concessions. Claimant retains title to the Santa Ana concessions, albeit under the cloud of MINEM\u2019s lawsuit which, if successful, would revert the concessions to Respondent as Article 71 specifies. Claimant has not argued that the MINEM Lawsuit is an expropriatory act.570\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 250 - 251; Supreme Decree No. 083-2007-EM adopted Nov. 29, 2007 **[C-0004]** ; Supreme Decree No. 032-2011-EM adopted Jun. 25, 2011 **[C-0005]** ; *El Paso v.

First, the MINEM case is years away from resolution, and a claim based on a possible future deprivation is unripe. Second, MINEM is seeking annulment - *i.e*., a ruling that Claimant did not lawfully receive the concession rights in the first place. Should MINEM prevail, the ruling would not take anything from Claimant, as it would declare Claimant never lawfully received the Santa Ana concessions. There can be no claim for expropriation of property that one never owned. Thus, neither the MINEM suit nor Supreme Decree 032 can amount to a direct expropriation.571\n\nR-I \u00b6 252; Claim filed by MINEM against Bear Creek and Ms. Villavicencio before the Civil Court in Lima, Jul. 5, 2011 **[C-0112]** ; *El Paso v.

At the time of the alleged expropriation, Claimant had obtained none of the approvals necessary for the exploitation phase of the Project - it was in the early stages of applying for the regulatory approvals and land use agreements (from 4 affected communities and more than 90 land possessors) that would be necessary to build and operate a mine. The regulatory path is difficult and most junior mining companies never progress beyond the regulatory approval phase. As other stalled mining projects in Peru illustrate, community opposition can thwart a project even when the mining company has an ESIA approval in hand.572\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 225 - 226; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 486 - 488; Ram\u00edrez First Statement \u00b6 2 **[RWS-2]** ; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui First Report \u00b6 \u00b6 40, 47, 67, 107 - 108 **[REX-003]** ; Expert Technical Report of SRK Consulting (Oct. 6, 2015) (\"SRK First Report\") \u00b6\u00b6 90 - 92 **[REX-005]** ; Rodr\u00edguez-Mari\u00e1tegui Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 74, 111, 133 **[REX-009]**.\n\n427.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant\u2019s argument that it *\"owned\"* the rights to *\"Explore and exploit mineral resources granted*\" and \"*Use and enjoyment of the natural resource granted and, consequently, the property of the fruits and products that are extracted.'\"573* Claimant\u2019s argument appears to be that, although it is not allowed to build or operate a mine and could not be sure of obtaining permission to do so even in the absence of Supreme Decree 032, Claimant nonetheless owns the right to do so.

Therefore, there is no need to examine whether it also constituted a direct expropriation. The Parties have not presented arguments related to the legal consequences of a finding of a direct expropriation, and such a finding indeed would not change or add to those that follow from an indirect expropriation.\n\n**4. Whether Supreme Decree 032 was Lawful under Article 812 of the FTA**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n430.\n\nThe following discussion was also relevant to Claimant\u2019s answer to the Tribunal\u2019s question (e) \"*What are the monetary amounts that the Tribunal should award to the Claimant if it were to conclude that: (i) the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment was lawfully expropriated?*\"576 Pursuant to Article 812 of the FTA, an expropriation can only be lawful if it is carried out for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner, and upon payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. None of these elements has been met here.577\n\nPO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4 (e).\n\nC-II \u00a7 IV; CPHB-I \u00b6 87.\n\n431.\n\nRegarding the first element, an expropriation cannot be lawful unless it is taken for a *\"public purpose*\", interpreted in accordance with international law.578 Respondent cannot determine unilaterally what public purpose means by reference to its own domestic legal order. The need for a public purpose or public interest to legitimatize an expropriation has long been considered part of customary international law, and the requirement can be found in almost all investment agreements.579 It is a genuine requirement, and the *ADC v. Hungary* tribunal cautioned against considering a \"*mere reference to 'public interest'*\" as sufficient evidence.580*British Petroleum v. Libya* concluded that an expropriation was unlawful because it had been adopted for purely extraneous political reasons and, hence, not for a public purpose. In *LETCO v. Liberia*, an ICSID tribunal found that the revocation of a concession was not for a public purpose because there was no stated policy that concessions could be taken for the public good.581 Here, Respondent cobbles together a series of events that appear to have the veneer of legitimate public purpose, so as to justify the issuance of Supreme Decree 032. Not one of Respondent\u2019s *ex post facto* justifications for issuing Supreme Decree 032 - including (1) protecting health and safety of citizens, (2) preserving relations with neighboring states, and (3) protecting the integrity of Respondent\u2019s constitutional process - was actually considered when Supreme Decree 032 was issued. Even Respondent admits that, it was not \"*until a Congressman presented documents disclosing*\" a purported non-compliance with Article 71 that Respondent found a reason to issue Supreme Decree 032. Thus, all of the important purposes that Respondent referenced for its issuance of Supreme Decree 032 are nothing more than *ex post facto* justifications that the Tribunal should disregard.582\n\nC-II \u00b6 270; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 812.1, 812 fn. 4 **[C-0001]** ; A.

Mr. Aduviri announced a suspension of the indefinite strike until June 7, 2011, to prevent interference with voting in the run-off presidential election opposing Ollanta Humala to Keiko Fujimori. Mr. Aduviri continued to urge the Peruvian Government to revoke Supreme Decree 083 and, when he resumed the strikes on June 7, 2011, this directly led to the issuance of Supreme Decree 032 on June 25, 2011.584 The *Amparo* Decision makes it clear that Respondent did not enact Supreme Decree 032 for a public purpose, but rather that the Santa Ana Project remained a public necessity at all relevant times and that it did not cause any environmental issue or social unrest in the area. The violent demonstrations had nothing to do with Claimant\u2019s actions or omissions.

Respondent failed to observe due process when enacting Supreme Decree 032 in five ways:\n\n*(i) Supreme Decree 032 was not the proper way to repeal Supreme Decree 083\u2014an administrative act that could not be derogated\u2014and rescind Bear Creek\u2019s right to own mines and mining rights in Santa Ana;*\n\n*(ii) Supreme Decree 032 was not issued in the context of any defined legal procedure within MINEM;*\n\n*(iii) Bear Creek never received advance notice of Supreme Decree 032 or an opportunity to be heard;*\n\n*(iv) the Government did not provide any credible justification for Supreme Decree 032; and*\n\n*(v) Supreme Decree 032 violated the legal principles of legal security and prohibition of arbitrariness, as recognized by the Lima First Constitutional Court.591*\n\nC-II \u00b6 287.\n\n*Id*. at 288 - 289; C-I \u00b6 139; Amparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]** ; Letter from E.

Further, as confirmed in the *Amparo* decision, Supreme Decree 032 lacks proper reasoning and motivation and thus violates the principles of reasonability, proportionality and legal security - all parts of a broader principle of due process. Since it violates the legal principle of juridical certainty and proportionality, it violates the prohibition on arbitrariness. Accordingly, this Tribunal should find that Respondent acted arbitrarily and in violation of due process of law when it issued Supreme Decree 032, which expropriated Claimant\u2019s rights.593\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 141 - 144; Amparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]** ; Bullard First Report \u00b6\u00b6 120, 124.b, 161, 178, 181, 196, 199 **[CEX-003]**.\n\n439.\n\nRegarding the third element of Article 812 of the FTA, discriminatory measures are not lawful.

Articles 812.2 and 812.3 provide conditions that such compensation must meet in order to be considered \"*prompt, adequate, and effective*.\" Pursuant to these, Respondent is required to pay, without delay, compensation to Claimant in the amount of the FMV of the Santa Ana Project, plus interest from the date of the expropriation until payment. It is undisputed that Respondent has not paid any form of compensation to Claimant and, therefore, Respondent\u2019s expropriation of the Santa Ana Project is an unlawful act under the FTA and international law.595\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 127 - 129; C-II \u00b6 269; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA **[C-0001]** ; *Siemens A.

Respondent denies all allegations not specifically admitted.596\n\nR-II \u00b6 36.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n--------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nArticle 812.1 of the FTA provides:\n\n*Neither Party may nationalize or expropriate a covered investment either directly, or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\"), except for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and on prompt, adequate and effective compensation*.597\n\nCanada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 812.1 **[C-0001]** (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n443.\n\nThe conditions set out in Article 812.1 are cumulative. By this wording, it is clear that if there is no due process of law or if there has not been payment of \"*prompt, adequate and effective compensation*\", a direct or indirect act of expropriation will violate the FTA.\n\n444.\n\nThe Tribunal has already indicated above its appreciation that Respondent did not invite Claimant to the meetings between June 20 and 23, 2011, on the basis that Claimant\u2019s attendance might have made the discussion with the groups organizing the social unrest more difficult and the Government was under strong political pressure to find an agreeable solution.\n\n445.\n\nBut the Tribunal has also described the rushed procedure during the meeting of June 23, 2011. On the basis of new documents allegedly presented between 9 and 10 p.m. -and which are said to have been lost thereafter so that they could not be produced by Respondent in this arbitration - after an examination by unidentified persons, according to Respondent by 1:30 a.m., between 15 and 19 Ministers of the Council of Ministers had been reached. Those Ministers were apparently contacted and then approved the draft without seeing the alleged documents. Thereafter, the President of the Republic signed the Supreme Decree. It is not disputed that no effort was made to contact Claimant in advance, and that Claimant was given no opportunity to comment before Supreme Decree 032 was issued.\n\n446.\n\nAs concluded above, the Supreme Decree 032 effected an indirect expropriation by revoking Supreme Decree 083. The Tribunal considers that, even in the face of the obvious political pressure to which the demonstrations and unrest gave rise, Claimant was entitled to be heard before such a fundamental decision was to be considered and taken. This is all the more so in circumstances in which the decision taken was expressly - in Supreme Decree 032 - based on allegedly unconstitutional conduct by Claimant in the process of obtaining the rights granted by Supreme Decree 083. Respondent should have made an effort to contact and hear Claimant, even in the face of political pressure to come to an expeditious solution. The Tribunal has been presented with no evidence to explain why this could not have happened, and why it did not happen. It has also not been shown whether, rather than a derogation, a mere suspension of Claimant\u2019s rights, as it was shortly thereafter ordered by Supreme Decree 033, which suspended all other new mining concession requests in Puno, might have been sufficient to calm the social unrests. It is not this Tribunal\u2019s task to determine whether under Peruvian law such a procedure might have been legally possible for other reasons as those given in Supreme Decree 032. The Tribunal, however, has to apply Article 812.1 of the FTA, which expressly provides that an expropriation must be done in accordance with due process of law. The process of issuing Supreme Decree 032 does not comply with this requirement.\n\n447.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent is in breach of the FTA by issuing Supreme Decree 032 without granting Claimant due process of law.\n\n448.\n\nFurther, Article 812.1 of the FTA provides that an expropriation, in order to be lawful, must be effected in a non-discriminatory manner and on prompt, adequate and effective compensation. It is undisputed that Supreme Decree 032 did not provide for any compensation to Claimant. Therefore, also for this reason, the Decree is a breach of the FTA. In view of the above conclusions, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to examine whether it was also issued in a non-discriminatory manner, because such a finding would not change or add to the legal consequences of the measure.\n\n449.\n\nIn view of its above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Supreme Decree 032 constituted an unlawful indirect expropriation, in violation of Article 812.1 of the FTA.\n\n**5. Whether Supreme Decree 032 was a Valid Exercise of Police Powers**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n450.\n\nInternational arbitral tribunals have the jurisdiction - and the duty - to determine whether the measures issued violate international obligations.598\n\nC-II \u00b6 290.\n\n451.\n\nRespondent\u2019s defense that Supreme Decree 032 was not expropriatory because it is a legitimate exercise of Respondent\u2019s police powers fails. The exercise of sovereign police powers is not a complete defense to expropriation under the FTA and, in any event, the State\u2019s police powers are not unlimited. A lawful expropriation under the FTA must comply with Article 812(1) of the FTA, which expressly circumscribes any exercise of Respondent\u2019s police powers to so-called regulatory conduct.599 Supreme Decree 032 cannot be considered an appropriate exercise of police powers, as it was issued without notice to Claimant, in violation of Claimant\u2019s right of defense, and without payment of compensation and the application of due process.600\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 244, 308; Entrevista al Ing.

Contrary to Respondent\u2019s arguments, the *Tecmed* tribunal acknowledged the existence of the police powers doctrine on the domestic plane and affirmed its duty to examine whether the measures there at issue violated the treaty or international law. That tribunal then interpreted the BIT and found that regulatory actions and measures will not be initially excluded from expropriatory acts.601 To determine whether the sovereign powers doctrine has any role to play in the present analysis, the Tribunal must interpret and apply the FTA, which does not excuse expropriations resulting from the exercise of police powers.602 Interpreting the FTA according to its ordinary meaning, as per Article 31(1) of the VCLT, there are four specific elements that must be met for an expropriation to be deemed lawful: the expropriation must be effected (i) for a public purpose, (ii) in accordance with due process of law, (iii) in a nondiscriminatory manner and (iv) on prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. Regulatory actions are not excluded from the definition. Absent this express carve-out, the legality of Respondent\u2019s expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment can only be assessed against these four elements. Since Respondent failed to comply with these four requirements, it is liable for carrying out an unlawful expropriation.603\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 291 - 293; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Since there is no legislation to cancel lawfully granted concessions, there is no factual or legal analysis whatsoever. A measure derogating Supreme Decree 083 would be inadmissible and unconstitutional. Supreme Decree 032 was condemned - not confirmed - by the Lima First Constitutional Court.

As recognized as early as 1941 by Prof. Herz, the State\u2019s right to exercise its police power has been recognized by general international law.625 Prof. Christie626 explained that a State\u2019s reasons for a taking pursuant to the police powers doctrine need only be \"*valid and bear some plausible relationship to the action taken*\" and that \"*no attempt may be made to search deeper to see whether the State was activated by some illicit motive*.\" The academic literature also recognizes that the police powers doctrine allows the State to regulate for the common good without compensating impacted property owners.627 Today, the doctrine is a fixture of international investment arbitration.628 Claimant\u2019s argument that this fundamental principle does not apply because the FTA contains no express carve-out ignores the scope and reach of the police powers doctrine, which provides an overarching exception for certain exercises of State action, beyond any carve-out that might appear in a treaty. The *Saluka* tribunal even affirmed the applicability of the police powers doctrine as a matter of customary international law. International tribunals have repeatedly confirmed that the police powers exception applies, regardless of whether an explicit treaty provision is present.629 Such an approach is consistent with the VCLT, which requires that the interpretation of the FTA take into account \"*any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties*. \"630\n\nR-I \u00b6 227; *Chemtura Corporation v.

Claimant misrepresents *Tecmed*, which confirmed that in addition to the provisions of a treaty, the tribunal must resolve a dispute by applying international law provisions. *Tecmed* considered whether the State action was expropriatory based on \"*the principle that the State\u2019s exercise of its sovereign powers within the framework of its police power may cause economic damage to those subject to its powers as administrator without entitling them to any compensation*.\" *Tecmed* does not support Claimant\u2019s argument - it confirms the opposite.631\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 439 - 441; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

This is precisely the kind of explicit, textual exception that Claimant states is necessary for the police powers doctrine to apply.632\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 442 - 443; Free Trade Agreement Between Canada and the Republic of Per\u00fa (Excerpts) Art. 2201.3 **[R-390]**.\n\n463.\n\nThe police powers doctrine applies to regulation of general application, as well as to measures that enforce generally applicable statutes. Claimant\u2019s argument that the police powers exception cannot apply to measures directed at specific investors has no legal or factual support - and the Tribunal should reject it for its lack of legal foundation. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that although Supreme Decree 032 had elements that were specific in application, it (1) enforced the generally applicable Article 71 of Peru\u2019s Constitution and (2) provided that all mineral extraction in the districts of Puno would be prohibited under forthcoming regulations. It is unclear how the police powers exception would attach to Article 71 of the Constitution (as Claimant would admit), but not to Supreme Decree 032, a measure designed to uphold and enforce Article 71.633\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 444 - 446; Supreme Decree No. 032-2011-EM adopted Jun. 25, 2011 **[C-0005]**.\n\n464.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position that the police powers doctrine applies to measures of specific application finds support in investment treaty jurisprudence. For example, in *Invesmart*, the tribunal held that the State\u2019s cancellation of a single banking license was a non-expropriatory, regulatory act, based on \"*the customary international law notion that a deprivation can be justified if it results from the exercise of regulatory actions aimed at the maintenance of public order.'\"* It is clear that the *Invesmart* tribunal applied the police powers doctrine to the specific license revocation and concluded that the State did not expropriate the investment.634\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 233 - 235; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 447 - 449; *Invesmart, B.

Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award (Redacted), Jun. 26, 2009 \u00b6 520 **[RLA-040]**.\n\n466.\n\nIn *Saluka*, the tribunal found that a regulatory action against a single bank constituted substantial deprivation, but that no compensation was due. Even if it were true that the procedures followed in *Saluka* were more transparent than those followed by Respondent in revoking Claimant\u2019s public necessity declaration, that is wholly irrelevant to Claimant\u2019s argument that the police powers exception does not apply. The *Saluka* tribunal found that the measure that applied specifically to that claimant was lawful. Thus, even if Supreme Decree 032 could be characterized as a specific regulatory act, Claimant has failed to provide any basis to exclude specific regulatory acts from the ambit of the police powers exception.636\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 236 - 237; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 452 - 454; *Saluka v.

Accordingly, Respondent\u2019s decision to enact Supreme Decree 032 should be granted a \"*presumption of legitimacy*\" or a \"*margin of appreciation*.\" The propriety of such deference is evidence in these circumstances, where the Constitution confers upon the State\u2019s highest Executive body the discretion to assess questions of \"*public necessity*\" in light of external and internal national security interests.637\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 238 - 239; R-II \u00b6 455; *Invesmart, B.V. v.

Per\u00fa*, the tribunal agreed that \"*it is unacceptable for an Arbitral Tribunal to 'step into the shoes\u2019 of any [State] organ and to 'second-guess\u2019 its actions*.\" Claimant, however, is asking this Tribunal to step in the shoes of Peruvian authorities - a task beyond the Tribunal\u2019s mandate. Claimant\u2019s so-called constitutional law expert argues that Respondent should have instead \"*imposed order through the intercession of the National Police*.\" Not only is this after-the-fact second-guessing rejected in international law, it demonstrates a lack of understanding of the policy decisions that Peruvian authorities faced and a lack of consideration of Respondent\u2019s historic use of its National Police, which has escalated conflicts and led to increasing injuries and deaths.638 Claimant\u2019s suggestion that Respondent should have issued a temporary measure is misleading: Respondent issued temporary measures, including the 1-year suspension the DGAAM\u2019s review of Claimant\u2019s ESIA and the 1-year suspension of the granting of mining concessions in the Puno area via Supreme Decree 026. These failed to quell the protests. The protests continued until the Government enacted Supreme Decree 032.639 It is inappropriate for Claimant to suggest that Respondent should have relied on temporary measures only, especially considering that Claimant challenged the temporary suspension of its ESIA in Peruvian administrative courts and continues to challenge the same today as a breach of the FET protections of the FTA.640\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 239 - 240; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 456 - 458, 462; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 2201(3), 2202 **[C-0001]** ; \"Strike Results With 6 People Dead,\" *La Rep\u00fablica Newspaper South Edition (Spanish)* **[R-085]** ; \"Tia Maria\u2019s Environmental Study Approval Causes Reaction in Per\u00fa,\" *Americaexonomica* **[R-333]** ; \"Tia Maria, The Long Conflict for the South,\" *La Rep\u00fablica* **[R-334]** ; \"Protests in Per\u00fa Against Copper Mine Project Leaves One Dead,\" *The Wall Street Journal* **[R-335]** ; *Saluka v.

The issuance of Supreme Decree 032 was necessary to maintain international comity with Bolivia. These are legitimate justifications for the invocation of the State\u2019s police powers, and the Tribunal should reject Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim. Respondent\u2019s sovereign, discretionary choice deserves deference under international law. Claimant\u2019s position that Supreme Decree 032 was adopted merely to placate a small political minority led by Mr. Aduviri is simply nonsense. Supreme Decree 032 was issued by an outgoing Government with only one month remaining in office. Claimant has not explained what political gain an outgoing Government could have received from enacting the decree.641\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 242 - 244, 247 - 249; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 428, 431, 432, 463 - 465, 493; Request from Bear Creek to MINEM soliciting the authorization to acquire mining rights located in the border area, Dec. 4, 2006 (UPDATE submitted with C-III) **[C-0017]** ; Office of the Ombudsman of Per\u00fa, Social Conflict Report No. 56 (10/31/2008) **[R-049]** ; Resolution No. 468-2008-MP-2da-FPMCH-DESAGUADERO (10/17/2008) **[R-051]** ; Note of Protest from the Government of Bolivia (6/7/2011) **[R-075]** ; *Invesmart, B.V. v.

Public opposition to the Santa Ana Project grew and came to a violent head between March and June 2011. Faced with escalating violence, increasingly widespread protests, and mounting threats to public safety, Respondent took the appropriate actions. These included not only Supreme Decree 032, but also Supreme Decree 033, which suspended all new mining concession requests in Puno.

For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investments or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:*\n\n*(a) to protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;*\n\n*(b) to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Agreement; or*\n\n*(c) the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.*\n\n473.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that already the title of Article 2201 *\"General Exceptions\"* shows that otherwise Chapter Eight (investment) remains applicable including its Articles 812 and, by the express footnote to the title of Article 812, as well as Article 812.1. Further, the list is not introduced by any wording (e.g. \"*such as*\") which could be understood that it is only exemplary. It must therefore be understood to be an exclusive list. Also in substance, in view of the very detailed provisions of the FTA regarding expropriation (Article 812 and Annex 812.1) and regarding exceptions in Article 2201 expressly designated to \"Chapter Eight (Investment)\", the interpretation of the FTA must lead to the conclusion that no other exceptions from general international law or otherwise can be considered applicable in this case.\n\n474.\n\nThere is, thus, no need to enter into the discussion between the Parties regarding the jurisprudence concerning any police power exception for measures addressed to investments.\n\n475.\n\nEven if, in view of the social unrest existing at the time one was to interpret Supreme Decree 032 as falling under the above cited exception by Article 2201 as protecting human life or health, the Tribunal takes particular note of the fact that Supreme Decree 032 makes no mention of such a protection being the justification for the Decree. Rather, Supreme Decree 032 refers expressly only to \"*circumstances\"* and *\"new circumstances\"* which allegedly have been made known at the meeting of June 23, 2011, and to social unrest. As found above, neither of the two reasons relied upon in this context justify Respondent\u2019s derogation of Supreme Decree 083 and of the rights awarded to Claimant therein, and Respondent cannot claim the social unrest to have been caused or contributed to by Claimant.\n\n476.\n\nIt could be argued that Supreme Decree 032, which is addresses only the investment of Claimant by derogating Supreme Decree 083, is not covered by Article 2201 because it may qualify for the express exception from the Exception as an *\"arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination between investments or between investments[\u2026]\"* But indeed, there was a provision in the Decree which, at least for the future, envisaged more general application:\n\n*Supplementary Provision*\n\n*Sole.-Provide that, under responsibility, in a term no greater than sixty (60) calendar days, provisions are to be enacted for the purpose of prohibiting mining activities in the areas of the Huacullani and Kelluyo districts in the Chucuito province of the Puno department.*645\n\nSupreme Decree No. 032-2011-EM adopted Jun. 25, 2011 **[C-0005]**.\n\n477.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal notes that Respondent issued not only Supreme Decree 032, but also Supreme Decree 033, which suspended all new mining concession requests in Puno, and that Respondent\u2019s interventions seem to have been effective in stopping the protests, strikes, and violence that had paralyzed the region. However, even if these two Decrees together would have to be considered as justified by the exception in Article 2201 of the FTA, Respondent does not explain the other reasons found above to be in breach of Article 812 of the FTA: Respondent has not explained that it was not possible to hear Claimant before issuing Supreme Decree 032 and that the exception also justified the breach of the due process obligation in Article 812 of the FTA. And, since the exception in Article 2201 does not offer any waiver from the obligation in Article 812 to compensate for the expropriation, Respondent has also failed to explain why it was necessary for the protection of human life not to offer compensation to Claimant for the derogation of Supreme Decree 083.\n\n478.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that, irrespective of a possible applicability of the Exception in Article 2201 of the FTA, two of the breaches of Article 812 of the FTA found above remain and thus Supreme Decree 032 must be considered a breach of the FTA.\n\n**B. WHETHER RESPONDENT AFFORDED CLAIMANT FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n479.\n\nThe sections of the FTA that are referenced by the Parties are reproduced here for reference and convenience and without prejudice to their meaning or applicability:\n\n***Article 105: Definitions of General Application***\n\n*For purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified:*\n\n*[...]*\n\n***measure** includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice;*\n\n***Article 804\u00b2: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment***\n\n*1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.*\n\n*2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of investors of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.*\n\n*3. For greater certainty, the treatment accorded by a Party under this Article means, with respect to a sub-national government, treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that sub-national government to investors, and to investments of investors, of a non-Party.*\n\n*[Footnote 2: Article 804 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 804.1]*\n\n***Article 805: Minimum Standard of Treatment***\n\n*1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.*\n\n*2. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" in paragraph 1 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.*\n\n*3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.*\n\n***Article 808: Reservations and Exceptions***\n\n*1. Articles 803, 804, 806 and 807 do not apply to:*\n\n*(a) # any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by*\n\n*(i) # a national government, as set out in its Schedule to Annex I, or*\n\n*(ii) # a sub-national government;*\n\n*(b) # the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a); or*\n\n*(c) # an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a) to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with Articles 803, 804, 806 and 807.*\n\n*2.

To establish the content of the MST, one must turn to customary international law. The burden of proving a rule of customary international law under Article 805 rests with the party invoking that provision, who must prove that a specific rule regarding the treatment of the investor or its investment has crystallized into widespread and consistent State practice flowing from a sense of legal obligation. The decisions and awards of international courts and tribunal do not constitute instances of State practice, but are relevant to the extent that they include an examination of State practice and *opinio juris*. In the words of the tribunal in *Cargill v. Mexico*, these awards \"*do not create customary international law but rather, at most, reflect [it]*.\"647\n\nSubmission of Canada Pursuant to Article 832 of the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (Jun. 9, 2016) \u00b6\u00b6 7 - 10; *Case Concerning Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco (Fr. v.

The MST, thus, protects investors from State conduct that is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, discriminatory, involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends juridical propriety, or contravenes an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. This general standard was elaborated by the *Waste Management II* tribunal and has been recognized by the recent *Bilcon v. Canada* and *Teco v. Guatemala* tribunals as particularly influential. It is less burdensome than *Neer* and contains no requirement that the challenged conduct reach the level of \"*shocking*\" or \"*outrageous*\" behavior, though it holds that \"*a basic obligation of the State under Article 1105(1) [NAFTA] is to act in good faith and form, and not deliberately set out to destroy or frustrate the investment by improper means'\"* The MST standard grants a number of procedural rights to investors, including the right to access to courts, the right to unbiased hearings, the right to participate in hearings, and the right to a judgment in accordance with the law of the State within a reasonable time. Respondent has violated each of these standards.650\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 147 - 151; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 330, 351 - 356; *GAMI Investments, Inc. v.

The Tribunal, however should see this for what it is: an admission that Respondent violated the MST and an attempt to escape liability through a regression of MST that would empty it of any real meaning.651\n\nC-II \u00b6 331.\n\n484.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position that *Neer* articulated any conception of the MST is flawed, as both case law and scholarship reject the proposition that the *Neer* standard was ever an accurate statement of MST. Even if it had generated an accurate statement of MST when it was decided in 1926, the standard has evolved since then. The facts of *Neer* bear no relationship to the protection of foreign investment. Rather, the issue in that case was whether a denial of justice had occurred. Far from reflecting the MST, *Neer* is relevant only in cases of failure to arrest and punish private actors of crimes against aliens. It may at most provide a statement of the customary international law understanding of denial of justice in 1926. In its decision, the *Neer* tribunal stated that \"*the treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize the insufficiency*.\" The *Neer* tribunal never intended to lay down a precise formula for determining when a State\u2019s conduct is internationally unacceptable. Leading scholars have considered that *Neer* and its progeny cannot be construed as a reflection of the MST under customary international law. It analyzed neither State practice nor *opinio juris* and the entirety of its reasoning and decision spans three pages.652\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 335 - 339; The International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Art. 35 (2001) (Updated 2008) **[CL-0030]** ; *ADF Group Inc. v.

For example, the tribunal in *Mondev v. USA* - on the basis of State practice and *opinio juris* as distilled from a survey of arbitral decisions, BITs, and many treaties of friendship and commerce - analyzed MST in the context of a NAFTA claim and rejected the idea that MST today is the same as the standard articulated in *Neer*. The tribunal in *ADF Group v. U.S.* agreed and relied on *Mondev*. In *ADF*, the Government of Canada - a Contracting Party - submitted in that proceeding that the MST has evolved since *Neer*, though it is still a high threshold. Based on its thorough analysis of State practice, decisions and commentary on MST under NAFTA and other international law authorities, the *Merrill & Ring* tribunal concluded that MST is broader today than the standard defined in *Neer* and its progeny - and other tribunals, scholars, and practitioners agree.654\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 340 - 344, 349; *GAMI Investments, Inc. v.

In any event, *Glamis* cannot revive the *Neer* standard. In the most recent investment treaty award that analyzed MST, *Bilcoin v.

Claimant explains that, \"*[r]egarding the content of MST, Canada submits that customary international law does not recognize a general duty of transparency or an obligation to protect the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. In other arbitrations, Canada has clarified its position, stating that transparency and legitimate expectations are not standalone rights entitled to protection, but may be considered in the overall analysis of alleged MST breaches.*\" This stands in contrast to Respondent\u2019s position, where legitimate expectations and transparency are irrelevant. MST, however, protects against a complete lack of transparency, and an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations are relevant to assess a breach of MST.658\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response to Canadian Submission (Aug. 18, 2016) \u00b6\u00b6 10 - 12; (*citing* C-II \u00a7\u00a7 V.A, V.B.; \u00b6\u00b6 329, 332 - 375; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 525 - 526, 528; *GAMI Investments, Inc. v.

The MST represents a low bar for States, but a high hurdle for would-be claimants. As explained by Prof. Borchard and confirmed by the *Al Tamimi v. Oman* tribunal, MST sets up an absolute floor of treatment, which ensures that State action does not \"*fall below a civilized standard*.\" Tribunals take a deferential approach when assessing State action under the MST, and the principle of deference to a State\u2019s sovereign choices should guide this Tribunal\u2019s analysis.659\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 264 - 268; R-II \u00b6 497 - 499; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 805 **[C-0001]** ; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v.

This collective jurisprudence - including cases like *Thunderbird v*. *Mexico* (2006), *Glamis Gold* (2009) and even cases outside of the NAFTA context, like *Genin v.

Under *Neer*, establishing a breach of MST requires action that amounts to \"*an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency*.\"662 Respondent has never claimed that bad faith is required to substantiate a MST breach.

The cases cited, however, support Respondent\u2019s position that MST presents a high hurdle for claimants.664 For example, *Waste Management II* (2004) does not support Claimant\u2019s argument. By using adjective modifiers that evidence a strict standard, like \"*grossly*\", \"*manifest*\", and \"*complete*\", the *Waste Management II* tribunal recognized that claimants alleging violations of the MST face a high burden. That tribunal dismissed claimant\u2019s FET claims, reasoning that the evidence presented did not support the conclusion that respondent acted in a \"*wholly*\" arbitrary or \"*grossly unfair*\" manner.

For example, *Mobil v. Canada* (2012) held that the MST standard is *\"set [...] at a level which protects against egregious behavior*.\"666 The strong language used in the *Al Tamimi v.

Respondent failed to respect Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations, failed to treat Claimant\u2019s investment transparently, and failed to act in good faith with respect to Claimant\u2019s investment.673 The Tribunal must view Respondent\u2019s conduct in the full context of the Parties\u2019 relationship, starting with (1) their extensive environmental and socio-economic assessments and negotiations at the beginning of the Project, (2) Claimant\u2019s December 5, 2006 request for a Supreme Decree, (3) Respondent\u2019s nearly year-long thorough review of Claimant\u2019s request during a lengthy application process involving multiple governmental agencies, including the Ministry of Defense, (4) Claimant\u2019s prompt cooperation with all aspects of the application process, and (5) Respondent\u2019s issuance of Supreme Decree 083 declaring the Santa Ana Project a public necessity and authorizing Claimant to acquire the Santa Ana concessions and to proceed with the Santa Ana Project.674\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 176 - 181, n. 449 (*noting* Claimant\u2019s reservation of rights to assert a claim for denial of justice in connection with Respondent\u2019s pursuit of the MINEM Lawsuit); Request from Bear Creek to MINEM soliciting the authorization to acquire mining rights located in the border area, Dec. 4, 2006 (UPDATE submitted with C-III) Annex VI **[C-0017]**.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 176, 180; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 357 - 359; Supreme Decree No. 083-2007-EM adopted Nov. 29, 2007 **[C-0004]** ; Request from Bear Creek to MINEM soliciting the authorization to acquire mining rights located in the border area, Dec. 4, 2006 (UPDATE submitted with C-III) Annex II - XI **[C-0017]** ; Letter from J.C.

On the following day, without notice or opportunity for Claimant to be heard, MINEM issued Supreme Decree 032, revoking Supreme Decree 083 and expropriating Claimant\u2019s investment.678 Supreme Decree 032 provided no explanation for the Government\u2019s decision to reverse Supreme Decree 083. This overnight revocation stands in stark contrast to the months of detailed assessment and vetting that Respondent required Claimant to undergo to obtain approval for the Santa Ana Project. The revocation was also a manifest violation of Peruvian law and, as expert Mr. Flury and the Lima First Constitutional Court confirm, evidence *\"a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process*.\" This is what *Waste Management II* stated would constitute a violation of MST and demonstrate a violation of Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations. That the revocation was accomplished without notice to Claimant and without providing reasons to Claimant is a serious and self-evident due process and fair treatment violation.679\n\nC-II \u00b6 361; Flury First Report \u00b6 81 **[CEX-006]**.\n\nC-II \u00b6 362; *Elaboran cinco normas legales que resuelven crisis en Puno*, Jun. 24, 2011 **[C-0108]**.\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 161, 178 - 179; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 363 - 364; Supreme Decree No. 032-2011-EM adopted Jun. 25, 2011 **[C-0005]** ; Amparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]** ; Memorandum from Members of the Huacullani District to the Prime Minister of Per\u00fa, MINEM and Bear Creek Mining, *Memorial Por El Desarollo y La Incluci\u00f3n*, May 15, 2013 **[C-0118]** ; Memorandum from Members of the Huacuallni District to MINEM, *Reactivaci\u00f3n del Proyecto Santa Ana*, Oct. 27, 2013 **[C-0119]** ; Memorandum from Members of the Huacuallni District to Prime Minister of Per\u00fa, MINEM and Bear Creek Mining, *Reiterativo Por El Desarollo y La Inclusi\u00f3n*, Jan. 24, 2014 **[C-0120]** ; R.

Unlike in that case, Respondent did not simply fail to respect contractual obligations or to adequately enforce a city ordinance. Here, Respondent violated national and international law by unjustifiably, arbitrarily, and grossly unfairly revoking Claimant\u2019s rights to operate the concessions without affording Claimant basic due process rights, such as notice or an opportunity to be heard, even though there was no change in circumstances.680 Likewise, *Thunderbird* is not factually analogous, as that tribunal found that Thunderbird was given a full opportunity to be heard and had made use of this opportunity. By contrast, Claimant was not informed of the Government\u2019s intent to revoke Supreme Decree 083 and it was not given an opportunity to be heard. In *Thunderbird*, the Mexican authorities\u2019 decision was 31 pages long and contained detailed reasoning. Here, Supreme Decree 032 only contains one sentence that circumstances have changed, and MINEM was unable to produce any evidence that the decision was grounded in reasoning or an assessment. Thus, comparisons with *Thunderbird* actually serve to support Claimant\u2019s position that Respondent violated the MST.681\n\nC-II \u00b6 373.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 374 - 375; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, Jan. 26, 2006 \u00b6 198 **[CL-0073]**.\n\n503.\n\nThe facts before this Tribunal are similar to those assessed by the *Metalclad* tribunal. Immediately after revoking Supreme Decree 083 without notice, Respondent filed a lawsuit to attempt to formally annul Claimant\u2019s concessions. These facts alone would sustain a finding of a violation of the MST. In addition, insofar as reasons were provided, Respondent\u2019s only justification for its arbitrary act was that circumstances had allegedly changed. In response to Claimant\u2019s request for documents related to the issuance of Supreme Decree 032, however, Respondent, through MINEM, responded that no such documents existed. This inability to produce records to demonstrate an analysis of the circumstances underlying the revocation of Supreme Decree 083 confirms the arbitrary nature of the Government\u2019s act, and its lack of respect for due process *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimant. Respondent\u2019s own court, the Lima First Constitutional Court, agreed. This confirms the *ex post facto* nature of the justifications that Respondent purports to advance today, namely (1) that politically motivated protests 135 km north of Santa Ana justified the revocation of Supreme Decree 083 and (2) that Claimant allegedly acquired its investment in Santa Ana unlawfully and in bad faith. Respondent only began advancing its argument with respect to (2) after it had unlawfully expropriated Claimant\u2019s investment and, as explained, it lacks any basis in fact or law.682\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 365 - 368; Supreme Decree No. 032-2011-EM adopted Jun. 25, 2011 **[C-0005]** ; Amparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]** ; Letter from R.

Similar facts led the *Bilcon v. Canada* tribunal to find a violation of the MST. That tribunal held that the investor had a legitimate expectation that its Project would be assessed on the merits in accordance with the Canadian legal standard, not \"*community core values*\" - a factor not noted in the applicable law as a basis for denying the application to mine. The facts of the present case are far more egregious than those in *Bilcon*. Unlike in *Bilcon*, Claimant in this matter had no opportunity to be heard prior to the overnight revocation of its mining rights. Respondent\u2019s arbitrary and unlawful conduct toward Claimant lacks even a pretense of FET and observance of basic due process rights, and constitutes a breach of Respondent\u2019s MST obligations.683\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 369 - 372; Draft letter Remitted by Minister J.

Here, the Government itself is the party that mistreated the investor\u2019s rights in violation of its national and international legal obligations. As explained above, Respondent\u2019s actions following the expropriation - the 2011 MINEM Lawsuit - further demonstrate that it was acting in bad faith.684\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 376 - 380; *Di\u00e1logo no prosper\u00f3 en Puno debido a intransigencia de los dirigentes*, MINISTERIO DE ENERG\u00cdA Y MINAS, May 26, 2011 **[C-0095]** ; Judge Stephen M.

In the words of *Al Tamimi v. Oman*, Respondent\u2019s actions were in no way \"*egregious*\" or \"*flagrant*. \"685 Far from \"*outrageous*\" or \"*shocking*\", Respondent\u2019s action with respect to Santa Ana were rational, non-discriminatory measures taken to protect public safety and the integrity of its regulatory regime for natural resources.686 There was nothing unfair or inequitable about the measures Respondent enacted - Claimant was treated fairly and equitably and in accordance with Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations.687\n\nR-II \u00b6 528; *Adel A Hamadi Al Tamini v. Sultanate of Oman,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/33, Award, Oct. 27, 2015 \u00b6 390 **[RLA-076]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 282.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 283; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 528 - 529, 538, 546.\n\n507.\n\nClaimant correctly points out that the Tribunal\u2019s FET analysis will hinge largely on Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations.688 The *National Grid v. Argentina* tribunal concluded that the protection of a claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations was subject to two qualifications: (1) an investor should not be shielded from ordinary business risk and (2) the investor\u2019s expectations must have been reasonable and legitimate in the context in which the investment was made.689 Respondent\u2019s actions did not violate any legitimate expectation that Claimant may have had. First, Claimant\u2019s alleged expectation that it \"*would be permitted to mine*\" has no reasonable foundation. Given the illegal manner with which Claimant obtained its rights in Santa Ana, Claimant had no reasonable or legitimate basis to expect Respondent to honor the investment indefinitely. Rather, it should have expected Respondent to rescind its rights once it uncovered Claimant\u2019s scheme to circumvent Respondent\u2019s constitutional restrictions on border zone investments. Second, Claimant had no basis to assume that its special permission to hold concession rights in Peru\u2019s border zone was perpetual or could not be revisited under dramatically changed circumstances. Supreme Decree 083 was premised on a \"*public necessity*\" and Claimant should have known that, if Respondent\u2019s national interest was threatened under changed circumstances, the Government could revoke the Decree, as it did. Third, Claimant\u2019s alleged certainty that it would be \"*permitted to mine*\" ignores the ordinary business risks associated with the mining sector. Before Respondent could even consider permitting Claimant to mine, Claimant had to clear regulatory, legal, and social hurdles - the likes of which stall many mining projects in this phase of development.690\n\nR-I \u00b6 284; C-I \u00b6\u00b6 177, 181.\n\nR-II \u00b6 530; *National Grid v.

It did not violate any reasonable expectation, and the legitimate expectations doctrine does not shield investors from ordinary business risks. Claimant knew or should have known that the regulatory process for mining projects is complex and prone to delay, especially where indigenous populations are involved. The ESIA review was suspended temporarily in the face of paralyzing social protests against the Santa Ana Project, out of concern that the hostile circumstances would affect the integrity of the review process. The suspension was in Claimant\u2019s interest because a grant of the ESIA would have started a ticking clock on the Project -during a time when Claimant had no hope of obtaining the necessary social license from the communities to proceed with it.691\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 286 - 287; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 535 - 536; *National Grid v.

The testimony and the documents presented at the Hearing, however, show that Santa Ana was a central focus of the protests. The protests were genuine and based on the legitimate concerns of the population. Simply put: the population did not trust Claimant and was anxious about the possible impact of the Project on their lands.692\n\nTr. 1855 - 1857 (R. Closing).\n\n510.\n\nRespondent agrees that Claimant had a legitimate expectation that \"*should any dispute regarding the Concession arise in the future, due process would be followed to resolve any such dispute in accordance with applicable laws*.\" Claimant has failed to explain how this expectation was thwarted. Both the ESIA suspension and the issuance of Supreme Decree 032 were carried out in accordance with Peruvian law. Claimant \"*(i) pursued challenges against the government\u2019s actions in Peruvian courts; (ii) has never alleged any impropriety in those proceedings; and (iii) is not pursuing a denial of justice claim in this arbitration*\", and (iv) relies on the analysis of the Peruvian courts repeatedly in its submissions to this Tribunal. It is difficult to see how Claimant\u2019s expectations regarding dispute resolution have been frustrated.693\n\nR-II \u00b6 537; C-II \u00b6 367.\n\n511.\n\nRespondent\u2019s actions were not arbitrary. Claimant appears to base its claim of arbitrariness on alleged procedural shortcomings. Such claims under the MST face a high burden. According to *Cargill*, an \"*arbitrary*\" procedure breaches the MST when it constitutes an \"*unexpected and shocking repudiation of a policy\u2019s very purpose*\", \"*grossly subvert[s] a domestic law or policy; [\u2026] or involves an utter lack of due process so as to offend judicial propriety*.\" While Respondent recognizes that Claimant might have appreciated advanced notice and an opportunity to be heard, that preference does not entitle Claimant to those courtesies as a matter of customary international law.694\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 539 - 540; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 2202(3) and 2202 **[C-0001]** ; *Cargill, Incorporated v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, Sept. 18, 2009 \u00b6 296 **[RLA-053]**.\n\n512.\n\nThe *Metalclad* award did not turn on a finding of arbitrariness. *Metalclad* is a case about legitimate expectations and focused on claimant\u2019s expectations derived from Mexico\u2019s assurance that the investor needed no further permits to operate its landfill. Those expectations were frustrated when, after construction was nearly complete, the local municipality denied a subsequent permit and prevented the Project from moving forward. *Metalclad* did not turn on procedural inadequacies or arbitrariness. Likewise, *Bilcon v. Canada* is about legitimate expectations and not about inadequate notice or a lack of an opportunity to be heard.695\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 541 - 542; *Metalclad v.

Salacuse, THE LAW OF INVESTMENT TREATIES 238 **[RLA-039bis]**.\n\n513.\n\nAlthough neither *Metalclad* nor *Bilcon* is particularly relevant, it is noteworthy that each concerned public hearings, during which it would be customary for the applicants to appear, present their project, and engage in discussion. Here, however, there was no public forum that Claimant could have joined to contest the issuance of Supreme Decree 032. It is unclear what specific \"*due process*\" Claimant was denied. Claimant cannot have expected to be a participant in the discretionary, high-level deliberations at the Council of Ministers that were aimed at debating options for quelling the protests. Claimant has also provided no benchmark for the notice it was supposed to have received. Absent any legal support for its due process argument, Claimant\u2019s arbitrariness claim cannot stand.696\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 543 - 544.\n\n514.\n\nThe procedural facts of this case are similar to those examined in *Genin v*. *Estonia*, where respondent revoked the Estonian Innovation Bank\u2019s license. Like Claimant here, the Estonian Innovation Bank received no notice of the revocation, no invitation to attend the Government session discussing the revocation, and no chance to challenge the decision prior to the revocation\u2019s issuance. That tribunal disagreed that this violated the MST. Like claimant in *Genin*, Claimant cannot prove facts sufficient to meet the elevated burden for demonstrating unfair or inequitable treatment under the MST.697\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 288 - 291; R-II \u00b6 545; *Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. as A.S.

United States held, arbitral tribunals applying 'autonomous standard[s] provide[ ] no guidance inasmuch as the entire method of reasoning does not bear on an inquiry into custom.' Such awards are therefore not relevant to ascertaining the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for the purposes of Article 805 of the FTA because they apply a different standard based on the treaty practice of States that have extended investor protection beyond what is required by customary international law*.\"699\n\nSubmission of Canada Pursuant to Article 832 of the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (Jun. 9, 2016) \u00b6 11; *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v.

Apart from the MST that Respondent is obliged to accord Claimant under the FTA, Respondent is obliged to accord Claimant autonomous FET protections by operation of the MFN Clause of the FTA, contained in Article 804. Respondent has committed to treating Canadian investors and investments in a manner no less favorable than investors and investments from third States. In at least twenty-three other investment treaties to which it is a party, Respondent accords investors FET available under the autonomous standard - *i.e*., without any treaty-imposed equivalence of the protection the MST. Claimant is entitled to import those protections through the MFN Clause. Accordingly, through Article 804 of the FTA, Claimant imports the FET standard that is provided in Art 2(2) of the Peru-United Kingdom BIT: \"*Investments of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment*.\"700\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 154 - 156; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 381 - 383; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 804 **[C-0001]** ; R.

Contrary to Respondent\u2019s arguments, the terms of the FTA do not prevent the application of the MFN Clause to pre-existing treaties. Accordingly, Claimant may import such more favorable substantive protections from pre-existing treaties, including the autonomous FET.701\n\nC-II \u00b6 383; *Sr. Tza Yap Shum v.

Interpreting this text in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context in light of their object and purpose, as required by Article 31(1) of the VCLT, it is apparent that Article 804 permits covered investors and investments to benefit from more favorable treatment that is afforded to investors and investments from other States.702 The express limitation to the MFN Clause in the corresponding Annex 804.1 clarifies only that the MFN treatment does not extend to dispute resolution mechanisms. The clarification is silent about MFN treatment not encompassing substantive standards of treatment, such as the FET standard. As such, no limit is imposed.703\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 384 - 385; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA **[C-0001]** ; Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, May 23, 1969 Art. 31(1), (2) **[CL-0039]**.\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 386 - 387; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Annex 804.1 **[C-0001]**.\n\n520.\n\nRespondent\u2019s argument that it \"*reserved the right to accord investors from Canada 'differential treatment'*\", such that the MFN Clause cannot be used to import more favorable treatment standards from pre-existing treaties hinges on Respondent\u2019s \"*Peru\u2019s First Reservation*.\" Respondent, however, misrepresents this reservation\u2019s reach and its role in the FTA. The reservation to the MFN Clause in Article 808 concern only existing and future non-conforming measures that either Canada or Peru may have, may maintain, or may adopt. The text of Article 808 does not contain a reservation or other limitation to the MFN Clause as it concerns important more favorable standards of treatment. As Respondent understands, the terms \"*measure*\" and \"*treatment*\" are conceptually distinct. In the Canada-Peru BIT, Respondent\u2019s reservations under the MFN Clause therein contained clearly referred to the standards of treatment contained in pre-existing international agreements. This demonstrates that the two Contracting States knew how to use clear and unequivocal language to limit the scope of the MFN Clause as it applies to more favorable \"*treatment*\", as opposed to \"*measures*.\" The deliberate absence of such language in the FTA confirms that no such limitation exists. Accordingly, there is nothing in the FTA that prevents Claimant from relying on the MFN Clause to avail itself of more favorable standards of treatment afforded to other investors and investments in pre-existing treaties.704\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 388 - 392; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Annex 808(1), (2) **[C-0001]** ; Agreement Between Canada and The Republic of Peru for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"Canada-Peru BIT\") **[C-0247]** ; Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement - Annex I: Reservations for Existing Measures and Liberalization Commitments (Sept. 11, 2013) **[CL-0191]** ; Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement - Annex I: Schedule of Peru (Jul. 31, 2015 and Schedule of Canada (Sept. 11, 2013) **[CL-0192]** ; Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement - Annex II: Reservations for Future Measures (Sept. 11, 2013) **[CL-0193]** ; Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement - Annex II: Schedule of Peru (Dated Sept. 11, 2013 and Schedule of Canada (Sept. 29, 2013) **[CL-0194]**.\n\n521.\n\nBecause the MFN Clause extends to standards of treatment, Claimant may use the MFN Clause to import the autonomous FET that is not linked to the MST. The autonomous FET requires that Respondent (1) protect Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations, (2) treat Claimant\u2019s investment transparently, (3) guarantee Claimant procedural propriety and due process, and (4) not deny justice to Claimant or its investment. The autonomous FET standard also protects Claimant from State conduct that (1) falls short of good faith, (2) breaches the State\u2019s contractual obligations, (3) is disproportionate, (4) constitutes coercion or harassment, or (5) violates the State\u2019s obligation to \"*do no harm*.\"705 The FET is inherently flexible and applicable to both acts and omissions.706\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 157 - 158; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 393 - 395; *Siemens A.

The case *Tecmed v. Mexico* is considered to be the seminal decision on FET and *Saluka v. Czech* Republic found that legitimate expectations forms the dominant element of FET. Investment case law identifies several situations where host State conduct gives rise to an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. An example of where tribunals agree that an expectation is \"*legitimate*\" where the host State has assumed a specific legal obligation for the future. The *Suez v*. *Argentina* tribunal emphasized the importance of the investor\u2019s reliance on the stability of the host State\u2019s business or legal environment as an element to legitimate expectations. Once legitimate expectations are found to exist, host State conduct to the contrary constitutes a breach of the FET. Bad faith on the part of the host State, however, is not required. Recently, the *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* tribunal held that changes in a government\u2019s mining sector policy did not excuse conduct in violation of the FET - rather, politically-driven policy changes violate the FET. Thus, it cannot be disputed that State conduct violates the FET if it eviscerates the arrangements in reliance upon which the foreign investor was induced to invest.707\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 159 - 166; *Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v.

Similarly, Respondent\u2019s attempt to avoid answering for its unlawful actions by baselessly accusing Claimant of acquiring its investments in an irregular manner and attempting to annul the concessions through MINEM\u2019s civil action amount to bad faith. Claimant faced a similar situation to that in the *Bayindir* case - the supposed justifications that Respondent has offered for its unlawful conduct only mask the true motivation - the Government\u2019s political interest in expropriating Claimant\u2019s investment.

Claimant\u2019s shift in its emphasis and arguments demonstrates that it recognizes that the MST, and not an autonomous FET, applies to this dispute.715\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 547 - 548.\n\n530.\n\nAutonomous FET standards only appear in treaties that Respondent signed prior to the FTA, and Respondent exempted pre-existing treaty obligations from the scope of FTA\u2019s MFN Clause. Through its reservation, Respondent excludes \"*measure[s] that accord[] differential treatment*\" under (2) \"*any bilateral or multilateral international agreement in force or signed prior to the date of entry into force of [the FTA].*\" The FTA defines \"*measures*\" as \"*any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice*.\" Through its reservation, Respondent reserved the right to accord investors from Canada \"*differential treatment*\" as compared to investors from other countries who are subject to pre-existing treaties. Claimant\u2019s semantic argument regarding the use of the term \"*treatment*\" has highlighted a distinction without a difference. Any treatment that Respondent might provide is necessarily directly tied to a \"*measure*\" - *i.e*., a \"*law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice*\" that accords treatment. Respondent specifically carved out this type of \"*measure that accords treatment*\" from the FTA\u2019s MFN Clause. Accordingly, Respondent\u2019s reservation excludes the requirement to provide or the practice of providing an autonomous standard of FET under a pre-existing BIT. Claimant cannot leverage the MFN Clause to import an autonomous FET standard from a treaty that pre-dates the 2009 FTA.716\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 549 - 551; R-I \u00b6\u00b6 292 - 297; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 804 **[C-0001]** ; Annex II to Peru-Canada FTA, Peru\u2019s First Reservation **[R-056]** ; UNCTAD List of Bilateral Investment Treaties to which Peru is a Party **[R-088]** ; Free Trade Agreement Between Canada and the Republic of Per\u00fa (Excerpts) **[R-390]**.\n\n531.\n\nImporting an autonomous FET standard would conflict with the will of the Contracting Parties. When the Parties negotiated the FTA, they specifically and purposefully agreed in Article 805 to limit their FET obligations to the MST, and this choice was consistent with a broader change in Respondent\u2019s treaty practice that began after 2000. If successful, Claimant\u2019s argument would render meaningless a clear and deliberate shift in Respondent\u2019s treaty practice. Claimant has not attempted to challenge the fact that the Contracting Parties intended, as stated in Article 805, to guarantee FET only up to the MST under international law. This Tribunal must enforce the will of the Contracting Parties and reject Claimant\u2019s attempt to import a more favorable standard.717\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 298 - 301; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 559 - 562; UNCTAD List of Bilateral Investment Treaties to which Peru is a Party **[R-088]** ; NAFTA Free Trade Commission, Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions, Art.

Canada was clear that the investment chapter in the FTA would be consistent with the BIT. Respondent understands that both the BIT and the FTA exclude the importation of more favorable standards from pre-existing treaties, even though each provision uses different language. The two texts are consistent with one another - it would be highly unlikely that the treaty parties would fundamentally reverse their positions in the 11 months in between signing the BIT and the later FTA. Furthermore, it would also be inconsistent with the practice of most other States at the time that previous agreements would not be excluded, in that BIT and FTA parties typically work to tighten limitations on MFN Clauses, not loosen them.718 Canada also shares Respondent\u2019s understanding that an MFN Clause cannot alter a treaty\u2019s explicit FET standard. This is clear from Canada\u2019s interpretation of its FET obligations under NAFTA. By invoking the MST, Canada and its NAFTA Co-signatories clarified that the FET standard in NAFTA is equivalent to the FET standard in the FTA.719 Later, Ms. Kinnear, then of the Canadian Government\u2019s Trade Law Division, confirmed that a claimant cannot invoke NAFTA\u2019s MFN Clause to circumvent the parties\u2019 express limitation of their FET obligations to the MST. Canada made its position clear: once contracting parties define the scope of a treaty\u2019s FET protection, a claimant cannot expand those protections by invoking an MFN Clause. This Tribunal must give effect to this interpretation and reject Claimant\u2019s attempt to import an autonomous FET standard.720\n\nR-I \u00b6 295; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 552 - 558; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 804 **[C-0001]** ; Agreement Between Canada and The Republic of Peru for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"Canada-Peru BIT\") Art. 9(3) and Annex III(1) **[C-0247]** ; Annex II to Peru-Canada FTA, Peru\u2019s First Reservation **[R-056]** ; An FTA with the Andean Community countries of Colombia and Per\u00fa: Qualitative Economic Analysis, Jun. 2007 **[R-298]** ; Canada - Andean Community Free Trade Negotiations, Initial Environmental Assessment Report, Jan. 2008 **[R-299]** ; Free Trade Agreement Between Canada and the Republic of Per\u00fa (Excerpts) Art. 105 **[R-390]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 301 - 302; NAFTA Free Trade Commission, Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions, Art.

The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n533.\n\nThe Tribunal has found above that Supreme Decree 032 constituted an unlawful indirect expropriation. Therefore, there is no need to examine whether it also constituted a breach of a duty to afford Claimant fair and equitable treatment. The Parties have not presented arguments related to the legal consequences of such a finding, and such a finding indeed would not change or add to those that follow from an unlawful indirect expropriation.\n\n**C. WHETHER RESPONDENT AFFORDED CLAIMANT FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY (\"FPS\")**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n534.\n\nThe sections of the FTA that are referenced by the Parties are reproduced here for reference and convenience and without prejudice to their meaning or applicability:\n\n***Article 8042: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment***\n\n*1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.*\n\n*2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of investors of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.*\n\n*3. For greater certainty, the treatment accorded by a Party under this Article means, with respect to a sub-national government, treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that sub-national government to investors, and to investments of investors, of a non-Party.*\n\n*[Footnote 2: Article 804 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 804.1]*\n\n***Article 805: Minimum Standard of Treatment***\n\n*1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.*\n\n*2. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" in paragraph 1 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.* Tribunal **[R-132]**.\n\n*3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.*\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n535.\n\nThe MFN Clause contained in Article 804 of the FTA permits Claimant to benefit from other substantive standards of treatment that Respondent offers investors under other international treaties to which it is a party. Respondent has entered into at least seven BITs where it promises to afford covered investors and investments full protection and security (\"FPS\") - the standalone standard of treatment that is not linked to the customary international law MST. Through Article 804 of the FTA, Claimant is entitled to the FPS standard provided in Article 2(2) of the Peru-United Kingdom BIT: *\"Investments of nationals or companies in each Contracting Party [...] shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party*.\"721\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 154 - 155, 182 - 183; C-II \u00b6 402; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA **[C-0001]** ; Peru - Bilateral Investment Treaties: (Bilateral investment treaties to which Peru is a party and that grant full protection and security: Peru-Czech Republic, Art. 2(2); Peru-Denmark, Art. 3(1); Peru-France, Art. 5(1); Peru-Germany, Art. 4(1); Peru-Malaysia, Art. 2(2); Peru-Netherlands, Art. 3(2); and Peru-United Kingdom, Art. 2(2)) **[CL-0079]** ; Treaty Between The United States of America And The Oriental Republic of Uruguay Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment **[CL-0121]**.\n\n536.\n\nFPS requires Respondent to take every reasonable measure necessary to protect and ensure the legal and physical security of the investments made by a protected investor in its territory. FPS protects investors and their investments from physical threats, as well as from unjustified administrative and legal action taken by a government that injure the legal rights of the investor or investment. The *Siemens v. Argentina* tribunal defined legal security as \"*the quality of the legal system which implies certainty in its norms and, consequently, their foreseeable application*.\" While the FPS imposes an obligation of vigilance and due diligence upon the government, there is no requirement to show malice or negligence to establish a breach of the FPS.722\n\nC-I \u00b6 186, C-II \u00b6\u00b6 402 - 404; *Siemens A.

As Prof. Bullard explains, allowing the Government to change its decision on a public necessity declaration on reasons of mere political convenience would contravene the principle of legal security. Respondent breached the FPS when it expropriated Claimant\u2019s investment by enacting Supreme Decree 032.723\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 177, 187; C-II \u00b6 405; Amparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]** ; Bullard Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 163 - 165 **[CEX-005]**.\n\n538.\n\nWhile Respondent has the power to revoke a previously issued Supreme Decree, it must do so in accordance with Peruvian law. As Prof. Bullard explains, such a limitation to property rights must respect the grounds set forth in Article 203.2 of Law 27444 and must not be in response to the authorities\u2019 reasons of opportunity, merit, or convenience. As Prof. Bullard and the Lima First Constitutional Court have confirmed, there is no reasonable motive for Supreme Decree 032: Claimant\u2019s rights have been violated by this \"*clearly arbitrary act; all the more so, because upon its issuance, the Claimant was not provided with the opportunity to accredit that the circumstances relating to its assumed obligations had not been neglected*.\"724 Even assuming for the sake of argument that Respondent had a valid reason to revoke Supreme Decree 083, this arbitrary revocation through unlawful processes is not a \"*reasonable measure of prevention [that] a well-administered government could be expected to exercise under similar circumstances*\", as required by the FPS standard.725 Respondent\u2019s attempt to annul Claimant\u2019s concessions through MINEM\u2019s 2011 civil action is another illustration of its violation of the FPS standard.726\n\nC-II \u00b6 407; Amparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]** ; Bullard First Report \u00b6\u00b6 124(b) **[CEX-003]**.\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 177, 187; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 406 - 408; Amparo Decision No. 28, Lima First Constitutional Court in Case, May 12, 2014 **[C-0006]** ; *Asian Agric.

Each of the agreements referenced by Claimant was signed and entered into force before the FTA went into force on August 1, 2009.

Claimant has failed to make such a showing and has not cited a single case analyzing the FPS under the MST.

Supreme Decree 032 was a reflection of the same broad discretionary authority under which Supreme Decree 083 was issued, and Claimant had no claim to \"*security*\" under Peruvian law that a discretionary determination could never be revisited.

The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nThe Tribunal has found above that Supreme Decree 032 constituted an unlawful indirect expropriation. Therefore, there is no need to examine whether it also constituted a breach of a duty to afford Claimant full protection and security. The Parties have not presented arguments related to the legal consequences of such finding, and such a finding indeed would not change or add to those that follow from an unlawful indirect expropriation.\n\n**D.

Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of investors of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.*\n\n*3. For greater certainty, the treatment accorded by a Party under this Article means, with respect to a sub-national government, treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that sub-national government to investors, and to investments of investors, of a non-Party.*\n\n*[Footnote 2: Article 804 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 804.1]*\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n546.\n\nRespondent is party to at least fourteen international agreements where it promises covered investors and investments protection against UDM. By means of the MFN Clause contained in Article 804 of the FTA, Claimant is entitled to the protection against UDM that is provided at Article 2(2) of the Peru-United Kingdom BIT: \"*Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party\"* Respondent has breached this substantive protection.732\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 154 - 155, 182, 184, 185; C-II \u00b6 402; Peru - Bilateral Investment Treaties: (Peru-Argentina, Art. 2(3); Peru-Bolivia, Art. 3(1); Peru-Cuba, Art. 3(1); Peru-Denmark, Art. 3(1); Peru-Ecuador, Art. 3(1); Peru-Finland, Art. 2(2); Peru-Germany, Art. 2(2); Peru-Italy, Art. 2(3); Peru-Netherlands, Art. 3(1); Peru-Paraguay, Art. 4(1); Peru-Spain, Art. 3(1); Peru-Sweden, Art. 2(2); Peru-Switzerland, Art. 3(1); Peru-United Kingdom, Art. 2(2); and Peru-Venezuela, Art. 3(1)) **[CL-0079]** ; Treaty Between The United States of America And The Oriental Republic of Uruguay Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment **[CL-0121]**.\n\n547.\n\nProtection against UDM is generally understood to mean that the State must afford protection against any measure that, in the words of the oft cited *EDF v. Romania* award \"*inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose; a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference; a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker; or a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure*.\"733 Violation of any one of these facets of protection against UDM would suffice to show that Respondent violated the FTA. Respondent violated all of them.734 With regard to unreasonable measures, the *AES v. Hungary* tribunal explained that the measure must be reasonable, having a correlation between the State\u2019s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it. In respect of discriminatory measures, the *Ulysseas v. Ecuador* tribunal noted that two similar situations would be treated differently - discriminatory intent is not required.735\n\nC-II \u00b6 409; *Joseph Charles Lemire v.

Accordingly, this Tribunal should find that Respondent breached its obligations under the FTA to afford Claimant and its investment protection against arbitrary and discriminatory measures.740\n\nC-II \u00b6 411.\n\n550.\n\nIn addition, Supreme Decree 032 was unreasonable because it, rather than serve a legitimate public purpose, *\"had the effect of depriving local communities and Peru as a whole of much-needed revenue and opportunities*\", and \"*was decided for the purpose of appropriating at no cost a world-class mining project*.\"741\n\nC-I \u00b6 191.\n\n551.\n\nThe enactment of Supreme Decree 032 and MINEM\u2019s 2011 initiation of its civil action impaired the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of Claimant\u2019s investment in Peru and were discriminatory. Claimant\u2019s arrangement with Ms. Villavicencio to acquire the concessions *via* Option Agreements is a common arrangement in Peru\u2019s mining sector, used to avoid interference by others while obtaining the authorization to acquire title as mandated by Article 71 of the Constitution. Respondent has not targeted any other investor that acquired mining rights in frontier areas in a comparable way. Claimant has been the sole focus of Respondent\u2019s breaches of international law.742\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 192 - 193.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n552.\n\nThe FTA does not contain a stand-alone UDM clause, and Claimant cannot manufacture such protection by invoking the MFN Clause. First, the MFN Clause does not apply to protections in treaties signed before the FTA entered into force on August 1, 2009. Each of the treaties Claimant relies upon for its UDM claim went into force before that date.743 None of the investment agreements that Respondent entered into after the FTA went into force includes a UDM provision.744 Claimant has not refuted these points and, accordingly, its UDM claim must fail.745\n\nR-I \u00b6 314; R-II \u00b6 574; UNCTAD List of Bilateral Investment Treaties to which Peru is a Party **[R-088]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 315; R-II \u00b6 575; Free Trade Agreement between Peru and the European Free Trade Association States, signed on Jul. 14, 2010 **[R-090]** ; Free Trade Agreement Between Peru and Korea, signed on Nov. 14, 2010 **[R-092]** ; Free Trade Agreement Between Peru and Mexico, signed on Apr. 6, 2011 **[R-101]** ; Free Trade Agreement Between Peru and Costa Rica, signed on May 21, 2011 **[R-125]** ; Free Trade Agreement Between Peru and Panama, signed on May 25, 2011 **[R-126]** ; Free Trade Agreement Between Peru and Japan, signed on May 31, 2011 **[R-127]** ; Free Trade Agreement Between Peru and Guatemala, signed on Jun. 12, 2011 **[R-128]** ; Free Trade Agreement Between Peru, Colombia and the EU, signed on Jun. 26, 2012 **[R-129]** ; Additional Protocol to the Pacific Alliance Framework Agreement, signed on Feb. 10, 2014 **[R-130]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 576.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe Tribunal has found above that Supreme Decree 032 constituted an unlawful indirect expropriation. Therefore, there is no need to examine whether it also constituted a breach of a duty to afford Claimant protection against unreasonable or discriminatory measures. The Parties have not presented arguments related to the legal consequences of such finding, and such a finding indeed would not change or add to those that follow from an unlawful indirect expropriation.\n\n**E. ARGUMENTS RELATED TO CONTRIBUTORY FAULT AND LIABILITY**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nThe following arguments were made in response to the Tribunal\u2019s questions during the Hearing and to the following question contained in PO-10:\n\n*(e) (iv) if the Tribunal was to find that the Claimant had contributed to the social unrest that occurred in the spring of 2011 - by act or omission - how should such a contribution be taken into account in determining matters of liability and/or quantum?746*\n\nPO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4 (e)(iv).\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n555.\n\nThe theory of contributory fault cannot excuse or reduce Respondent\u2019s liability for its breach of the FTA, as Claimant did not cause the social unrest in Southern Puno. Nonetheless, if the Tribunal were to find that Claimant had contributed to the social unrest, the doctrine of contributory fault under international law requires that the party advocating for its application demonstrate - in addition to contribution to the investor\u2019s harm - that the investor\u2019s willful or negligent conduct or omission materially and significantly contributed to its harm, directly causing it. There must also be a sufficient causal link between the negligent or willful act or omission and the harm, in accordance with ILC Article 31. Respondent cannot meet its burden of proof for such a finding.747\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 93 - 96, *compare* CPHB-I \u00b6 95 (*showing* how respondent in the *Copper Mesa* case demonstrated that claimant\u2019s contribution to poor community relations through an armed conflict that was planned and sponsored by claimant itself); CPHB-II \u00b6 62; Tr. 550 (Swarthout); 887 (Gala); Entrevista al Ing.

Even Respondent\u2019s Constitutional Court found that Claimant was not at fault for the social unrest in Southern Puno.752 Given that protestors demanded cancellation of all concessions of all holders, Respondent cannot establish that \"*but for*\" Claimant\u2019s outreach program, there would never have been social unrest in the area.753 Given the totality of the circumstances, Respondent let events get out of control and did not try to mediate, failing in its responsibilities under Supreme Decree 028 and its implementing Ministerial Resolution No. 304.754 In particular, Respondent failed in its Supreme Decree 028 obligations to \"*guide, direct, and conduct citizen-participation processes, promote or conduct, together with the owner of the Mining Rights, activities to inform the populations involved\"755* That did not happen - the State abandoned the investor, with the consequences we have seen.756\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 101, 102 (*compare* to *Abengoa* case, where the Tribunal held that the social unrest was caused by the aggressive and deceitful actions of those who opposed the investment, and not be claimant\u2019s allegedly insufficient outreach efforts.

Supreme Decree 032 was not adopted on a whim - it was a consequence of Claimant\u2019s misrepresentations.759 There can be no liability because the withdrawal was not arbitrary - rather, it was the only reasonable thing that the Government could do in the circumstances.760 There are also serious consequences for Claimant\u2019s misrepresentations to the communities.761 Claimant\u2019s witness, Mr. Swarthout, confirmed in oral testimony that there was confusion as to who would be responsible for providing what to the affected populations.762\n\nTr. 1941 - 1945 (R. exchange with Arbitrator Sands).\n\n*Id*. at 1945 (R.

Respondent believes that its role was to approve mechanisms and processes or to approve the path through which the Company could obtain the trust and confidence of the communities. Approval of a CPP, however, is not approval of how it was implemented. Implementation is in the company\u2019s sphere of responsibilities. Local authorities were heavily involved in assisting Claimant. While there must be cooperation between the authorities, the issue is not whether the population trusts the Government: the issue is whether the population trusts the particular investor and the particular project.

The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n565.\n\nThe Parties disagree regarding their respective roles and obligations in the outreach to the local communities and the application of Supreme Decree 028.766\n\nRegulation on Citizen Participation on the Mining Subsector, Supreme Decree No. 028-2008-EM **[R-159]**.\n\n566.\n\nRespondent concedes that \"*[its] role was to approve mechanisms and processes or to approve the path through which the Company [could] obtain the trust and confidence of the communities.*\"767 But Respondent qualifies that role, explaining that approval of a CPP is not approval of how it was implemented. Implementation is in the company\u2019s sphere of responsibilities. Local authorities were heavily involved in assisting Claimant.768\n\nTr. 1970 (R. Exchange with Arbitrator Pryles).\n\n*Id*. at 1970 - 1973 (R. Exchange with Arbitrator Pryles).\n\n567.\n\nIt is recalled that, when the Tribunal examined the outreach activities of Claimant in more detail, the conclusion above was:\n\nRegarding the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio: *in a \"careful consideration by the government authorities\" over a period of almost one year, the above mentioned available information regarding Ms. Villavicencio\u2019s involvement could not be neglected by the government agencies involved in the process and at the very least should have been noted. The alleged oversight, if it existed, must be attributed to Respondent and not to Claimant. Therefore, the Tribunal does not see any reason why the process as conducted would make the Application or the resulting Supreme Decree 083 unconstitutional*.\n\nAnd regarding Claimant\u2019s outreach activities: \"*The evidence summarized above shows clearly that from the very beginning until the time before the meeting of June 23, 2011 all outreach activities by Claimant were known to Respondent\u2019s authorities and were conducted with their approval, support, and endorsement, and that no objections were raised by the authorities in this context. While, as mentioned above, further actions by Claimant would have been feasible, on the basis of the continued coordination with and support by Respondent\u2019s authorities, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant could take it for granted to have complied with all legal requirements with regard to its outreach to the local communities and that Respondent, after its continuous approval and support with Claimant\u2019s conduct, cannot in hindsight claim that this conduct was contrary to the ILO Convention 169 or was insufficient, and caused or contributed to the social unrest in the region*.\"\n\n568.\n\nAs correctly pointed out by Claimant769, Respondent has the burden of proof that its breaches of the FTA, which the Tribunal found in its considerations above in this Award, were to some extent caused by Claimant. In view of the above cited conclusions of the Tribunal, Respondent has not met that burden.\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 93 - 96.\n\n569.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that there was no contributory fault and liability of Claimant.\n\n**X. DAMAGES**\n--------------\n\n570.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s question in section 2.1.4 (e) of PO-10 was as follows:\n\n*What are the monetary amounts that the Tribunal should award to the Claimant if it were to conclude that* :\n\n*i. the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment was lawfully expropriated?*\n\n*ii. the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment was unlawfully expropriated?*\n\n*iii. Respondent breached its obligations under the FTA for FET or other obligations under other provisions of the FTA?*\n\n*iv. if the Tribunal was to find that the Claimant had contributed to the social unrest that occurred in the spring of 2011 - by act or omission - how should such a contribution be taken into account in determining matters of liability and/or quantum?770*\n\nPO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4 (e)(i) - (iii).\n\n571.\n\nThe relevant sections of the FTA provide as follows:\n\n***Article 8123: Expropriation***\n\n*1. Neither Party may nationalize or expropriate a covered investment either directly, or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\"), except for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and on prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\n\n*2. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place (\"date of expropriation\"), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.*\n\n*3. Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the date of expropriation until date of payment.*\n\n**A. THE STANDARD OF COMPENSATION / WHETHER COMPENSATION IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS INVESTED / ANSWERS TO TRIBUNAL'S QUESTIONS (e)(i) - (iv)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n572.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal award Claimant at least US$ 296.6 million if it finds that Santa Ana was lawfully expropriated. If the Tribunal finds another Treaty breach or an unlawful expropriation, the Tribunal should award at least US$ 522.2 million. **771**\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 78, 88.\n\n573.\n\nClaimant is entitled to the monetary equivalent of the investments unlawfully taken by Respondent.772 To determine the compensation that Respondent owes to Claimant, the Tribunal should first look to any *lex specialis* in the FTA and, in the absence of *lex specialis*, to the rules of customary international law. For a lawful expropriation, the *lex specialis* is contained in Article 812 of the FTA. For an unlawful expropriation or any other breach, the FTA is silent and customary international law fills the *lacuna*.773\n\nC-I \u00b6 195; The International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Art. 35 (2001) (Updated 2008) Art. 31 **[CL-0030]**.\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 127 - 129, 198 - 200, 223 - 231; CPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 88, 92; CPHB-II \u00b6 59; Tr. 141 - 142 (C.

This would include not only damage caused to Bear Creek concerning the Santa Ana Project itself, but also damages for losses sustained with respect to the Corani Project, which resulted from Peru\u2019s expropriation of the Santa Ana Project and other FTA violations.

In *CME*, the tribunal observed that the aim of such provisions in BITs is to assure \"*that when a State takes foreign property, full compensation must be paid*.\"783 This interpretation is supported by other tribunals, which observed that \"*full*\" compensation refers to \"*prompt, adequate and effective*\" compensation.784 Claimant\u2019s expert defines FMV as \"*the price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a hypothetical willing and able seller, acting at arms-length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts*.\"785 This definition is non-controversial between the Parties786 and Respondent *\"does not dispute that fair market value is the appropriate standard in this case*.\"787 The cases submitted by both Parties establish that (1) awarding amounts invested is not an appropriate measure of FMV and (2) the DCF method provides a reliable estimate of FMV, especially given that this is a mineral property/project.788\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 214 - 217; Canada-Per\u00fa FTA Art. 812(1) - (3) **[C-0001]** ; FTI Expert Report (May 29, 2015) (\"FTI First Report\") \u00b6 7-3 **[CEX-001]**.\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. v.

To overcome a lack of history of profitability, a claimant would need to produce convincing evidence of its ability to produce profits in the particular circumstances it faced. Such evidence could include experience (of its own or of experts) or corporate records that establish on the balance of probabilities it would have produced profits from the concession in the face of the risks involved.801\n\nTr. 1802 - 1803 (C.

In *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela*, the tribunal applied a DCF valuation, awarding US$ 713 million for two mining concessions that had never entered production at the time of their wrongful revocation. There, Venezuela accepted that DCF is an appropriate and valid tool to measure the FMV.802 Both experts submitted valuations using the DCF method, even though the expropriation occurred prior to the Project\u2019s construction and entry into production.803 Here, the experts have also agreed that DCF is appropriate.804 Like the tribunal in *Gold Reserve*, this Tribunal has sufficient data to prefer the DCF model over any other method, enabling the Tribunal to determine Claimant\u2019s hypothetical cash flows, but for Respondent\u2019s unlawful action.805 At the Hearing, Claimant was unaware of any further case where the DCF methodology has been used for another project that reached a level of development similar to the Santa Ana Project.806\n\nC-II \u00b6 422; CPHB-II \u00b6 51; *Gold Reserve Inc. v.

There, like here, claimants submitted a DCF model and a Comparable Transactions Model. Although that tribunal rejected the DCF approach, the value awarded was nonetheless consistent with the DCF Approach. In *Al-Bahoul*, although the tribunal did not use the DCF method, the tribunal did say that it might be appropriate when the investment had not started operation but sufficient data allowing for future cashflow projections was available. This case has such projections.808*SPP v. Egypt* and *Gemplus v. Mexico* rejected the cost-based approach.809 In *Gemplus v. Mexico*, the tribunal rejected non-DCF methods because they failed to take account of the most valuable asset: future income streams that were reasonably anticipated, and these were not reflected in the share price. While the *Gemplus* tribunal rejected a pure DCF approach, it applied a modified form of the income-based approach.810 In *SPP v. Egypt*, the tribunal noted that it was \"*incontestable*\" that Claimant\u2019s investment had a value that exceeded its out-of-pocket costs.811\n\n*Id*. at 1798 (C.

As the Parties experts agreed, an award of amounts invested is distinct from FMV - the Tribunal cannot award FMV as required by the FTA through an award of the cost of investment.813 According to the CIMVAL standards, which require either the Income or Market Approach,814 a cost-based approach is not appropriate for Development Properties like Santa Ana, nor is it consistent with the valuation principles set forth in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*. Such an award would incorrectly imply that the investment was made risk-free and with no expected return. The analysis shows that Respondent\u2019s cost-based approach would award Claimant less than 25% of Santa Ana\u2019s value, allowing Respondent to unjustly capture the increase in value of the Santa Ana Project that Claimant created.815 The cost-based methodology should be rejected in favor of FTI\u2019s DCF.816\n\n*Id*.; CPHB-I \u00b6 81; CPHB-II \u00b6 57; Brattle Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 21, 31, 32 **[REX-010]**.\n\nTr. 1812 (C.

Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n588.\n\nRespondent initially argued that the Tribunal, if it awards anything, should award Claimant its amounts invested for Santa Ana: US$ 21,827,687.822 In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent amended this, arguing that regardless of whether the Tribunal determines that there was a lawful or unlawful expropriation or a non-expropriatory Treaty breach, the Tribunal should award Claimant no more than US$ 18,237,592: the amount Claimant invested after the public necessity declaration.823 This amount should be reduced, depending on the breach. For a non-expropriatory breach - like Claimant\u2019s alleged FET violation - there can be no damages, as the facts upon which Supreme Decree 032 was based were true.824 Non-expropriatory breaches require individualized damages analyses and none have been provided to date.825\n\nR-I \u00b6 331; R-II \u00b6 594; Brattle First Report \u00b6 39 **[REX-004]** ; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 248 **[REX-010]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 110 - 111.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 112 - 113.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 113; RPHB-II \u00b6 47.\n\n589.\n\nRespondent does not dispute that the FMV is the appropriate standard of compensation in this case. This issue is how one can approximate FMV for a project like Santa Ana - a project that never (1) advanced beyond project planning, (2) received the requisite permits, (3) obtained a social license and community support, (4) proceeded to construction, or (5) operated profitably. These are all features that make any measure other than the value of amounts invested highly speculative.826 Even assuming that the Tribunal finds that Respondent\u2019s measures breached the FTA, witness testimony demonstrated that the lack of social license alone would have led to the Santa Ana Project\u2019s failure.827\n\nR-I \u00b6 326; R-II \u00b6 590.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 100, 101; RPHB-II \u00b6 40.\n\n590.\n\nAccording to longstanding international law precedent, calculating damages using an income-based method - like FTI\u2019s DCF approach - is too speculative and, therefore, inappropriate, for an asset that is not a \"*going concern*\" or that lacks a history of profitability.828 In *Wena v. Egypt*, that tribunal noted that a hotel that had been in operation for a year-and-a-half had an insufficient basis for predicting growth or expansion of the investment. That tribunal held that \"*the proper calculation of market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation is best arrived at, in this case, by reference to Wena\u2019s actual investments*.\"829 In *PSEG v. Turkey*, where claimant\u2019s future income was established in contracts, the tribunal rejected income based approaches and awarded damages based on the amount claimant had invested.830 This jurisprudence cannot be dismissed as a \"*small sample*\"831 or as \"*not a meaningful source of law*.\"832 In speculative situations, the proper way to compensate an injured claimant is to award it the amount it invested in the asset, making it whole on its out-of-pocket losses.833 These decisions reveal the untenable nature of Claimant\u2019s claim: if multi-year profitable business histories are insufficient to support a DCF analysis, then the unapproved, incomplete business plans upon which Claimant relies cannot support an income based valuation.834 Awarding the sunk costs for the FMV of a still-on-paper project like Santa Ana is supported by numerous tribunals, including *Metalclad v. Mexico* and *Mobil v. Venezuela*.835 To be clear: no Investor-State Tribunal has ever awarded damages based on a DCF model for a non-producing asset.836\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 321, 325 - 328; R-II \u00b6 583; RPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 101 - 102; RPHB-II \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43 - 45; Slide 90 (R.

That case, however, involved a far more predictable asset that Claimant\u2019s non-existent silver mines: a water services utility that had been in operation for over two years under a 30-year concession contract.838\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 584, 589.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 585 - 586; *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v.

Venezuela*, both parties used the DCF method for assessing the quantum of damages and agreed on the DCF model used. That tribunal merely applied the agreed-upon valuation method. As to the question of why Venezuela accepted the DCF method, a close reading of the award reveals that Venezuela likely agreed to the DCF approach because the cash flow analysis that its expert put forward produced a negative valuation. Thus, Venezuela\u2019s support of the DCF analysis in that case was a strategic choice to reduce its liability, not a principled decision rooted in a belief that the DCF valuation is appropriate for assets with no history of profitable operation. *Gold Reserve* is, therefore, irrelevant to the question of whether a DCF analysis is preferable to awarding amounts invested for a non-producing asset like the hypothetical mines here.839 Finally, Claimant\u2019s citation of *Gemplus v.

The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it found above that Respondent is liable for an unlawful indirect expropriation. The FTA does not provide any rules regarding the damages to be awarded in case of such a breach of the FTA. Accordingly, the standard provided under general international law is applicable. The Tribunal notes that Article 812.2 of the FTA provides a specific provision on compensation in respect of a lawful expropriation:\n\n*Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place (\"date of expropriation\"), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.*\n\n596.\n\nBoth Parties agree and have argued in this context to use the FMV to quantify the damages that should be awarded in case the Tribunal finds -as it has - that there was an unlawful expropriation.845 Since damages for an unlawful expropriation should at least be as much as the compensation for a lawful expropriation, in view of the joint approach by both Parties and the guidance provided by Article 812.2 of the FTA, the Tribunal agrees that the standard of FMV can be an appropriate method of quantification in the present case.\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 214 - 217; R-I \u00b6 325; R-II \u00b6 590.\n\n597.\n\nThe Parties appear to agree with the definition of FMV provided by Claimant\u2019s expert as \"*the price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a hypothetical willing and able seller, acting at arms-length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts*.\"846 The Tribunal sees no reason to adopt a different approach. However, the Parties disagree as to whether, in order to meet that definition in the present case, the calculation should rely on the amounts invested or, alternatively, on the potential profitability of the investment as calculated by the DCF method.\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6 79; FTI First Report \u00b6 7.3 **[CEX-001]** ; R-II \u00b6 590.\n\n598.\n\nThe jurisprudence on which the Parties rely does not provide a general rule in this respect, although it does emphasize the need to have regard to specific factual situation of each particular case. With this in mind, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to focus on whether, having regard to the factual circumstances of this case, a willing buyer might have been found who would have paid a price calculated by the DCF method, as Claimant alleges. The Tribunal considers that Claimant has the burden of proof with regard to damages it alleges.\n\n599.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimant has provided sufficient evidence in support of its claim that a hypothetical purchaser of the Santa Ana Project would have been able to obtain the necessary social license to be able to proceed with the Project, if it had been provided an opportunity to invest the necessary time and resources. Given the extent of the opposition, and the reasons for it, the Tribunal doubts that the Project could, in the short term at least, be considered to be viable by the time Supreme Decree 032 was adopted.\n\n600.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Santa Ana Project was still at an early stage and that it had not received many of the government approvals and environmental permits it needed to proceed. On the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal concludes that there was little prospect for the Project to obtain the necessary social license to allow it to proceed to operation, even assuming it had received all necessary environmental and other permits. The Tribunal notes that no similar projects operated in the same area, and there was no evidence to support a track record of successful operation or profitability in the future.\n\n601.\n\nClaimant points out that in investment treaty cases some tribunals have endorsed DCF for early-stage projects. In this context, Claimant refers to *Vivendi v. Argentina*, in which, although the tribunal rejected the DCF model, it nonetheless explained how such a model could be accepted in appropriate circumstances.847 That tribunal noted that an absence of a history of profitability does not absolutely preclude the use of DCF methodology, but clarified the necessity that \"*claimants might be able to establish clearly that an investment, such as a concession, would have been profitable by presenting sufficient evidence of its expertise and proven record of profitability of concessions it (or indeed others) had operated in similar circumstances*.\"848 In the present case, Claimant concedes that to overcome a lack of history of profitability, it would need to produce convincing evidence of its ability to produce profits in the particular circumstances it faced. Such evidence could include experience (of its own or of experts) or corporate records that establish on the balance of probabilities it would have produced profits from the concession in the face of the risks involved.849\n\nTr. 1802 - 1803 (C. Closing).\n\n*Id*. at 1803 (C. Closing).\n\nC-II \u00b6 421; *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v.

Beyond the above-mentioned uncertainties regarding the realization of the Project, the Tribunal notes that, in view of the widespread social unrest related to the Project, Respondent not only issued Supreme Decree 032, but, right after on June 25, 2011, also issued a general suspension of admissions of mining petitions for the Department of Puno by Supreme Decree 033850 for a period of 36 months and later continued that suspension by Supreme Decree 021-2014.851\n\nSupreme Decree on the Adjustments of Mining Petitions and Suspension of Admissions of Mining Petitions, Supreme Decree No. 033-2011-EM **[R-011]**.\n\nDecree that Extends the Suspension of Admissions of Mining Petitions, Supreme Decree No. 021-2014-EM **[R-****140]**.\n\n603.\n\nA realization and assurance of the profitability of Claimant\u2019s Santa Ana Project could therefore not be expected in the foreseeable future, if at all. Thus, Claimant has not fulfilled the test introduced by Claimant itself by its reference to *Vivendi*, as it has not been \"*able to establish clearly that an investment, such as a concession, would have been profitable by presenting sufficient evidence of its expertise and proven record of profitability of concessions it (or indeed others) had operated in similar circumstances*.\"852\n\nTr. 1803 (C. Closing).\n\n604.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the calculation of Claimant\u2019s damages in the present case cannot be carried out by reference to the potential expected profitability of the Santa Ana Project and the DCF method. The Project remained too speculative and uncertain to allow such a method to be utilized. Instead, the Tribunal concludes that the measure of damages should be made by reference to the amounts actually invested by Claimant.\n\n**B. ARGUMENTS RELATED TO THE DCF ANALYSIS / CLAIMANT'S DAMAGES ANALYSIS RELATED TO THE SANTA ANA PROJECT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n605.\n\nClaimant\u2019s experts, Messrs. Rosen and Milburn of FTI, determined Santa Ana\u2019s FMV value to be **US$ 224.2 million** on June 23, 2011 or, under the alternative long-term commodities price, **US$ 333.7 million**.853\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 239 - 240, C-II \u00b6\u00b6 428 - 429; CPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 74, 80; CPHB-II \u00b6 54; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 7.27, 7.45 - 7.47, 7.53, 7.54, 7.57 Fig. 28 **[CEX-001]** ; Reply Report of FTI Consulting (Jan. 8, 2016) (\"FTI Second Report\") \u00b6\u00b6 2.8 - 2.10, Figure 1 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n**(a) The Valuation Date**\n--------------------------\n\n606.\n\nPursuant to Article 812(2) of the FTA, compensation for expropriation \"*shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investments immediately before the expropriation took place*.\"854 The most straightforward and objective way of excluding the effects of the June 24, 2011 public announcement is to value Santa Ana on June 23, 2011 as FTI has done.855\n\nTr. 1797 (C. Closing).\n\nC-II \u00b6 426.\n\n607.\n\nBy insisting that June 24, 2011 should be the valuation date without proposing any method to exclude the effects of the expropriation announcement, Respondent and its expert add confusion to what should be straightforward and noncontroversial: the State may not benefit from any reduction in value resulting from prior knowledge of the expropriation before it was formalized.856 By arguing that the valuation date must be June 24, 2011, Brattle seeks to pretend that a 1% drop in the price of silver would account for the dramatic drop (nearly 25%) in Claimant\u2019s share price by the end of the day on June 24, as the market quickly processed the announcement of the imminent expropriation decree.857\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 425; Kenneth J.

FTI\u2019s experts relied in part on the expert report prepared by RPA, widely recognized as the specialty firm of choice for resource and reserve work, which has performed valuations of more than one thousand mineral exploration properties over its nearly 30 years of existence.858 RPA reviewed and assessed the reasonableness of the cost assumption used in connection with the Santa Ana Project.859 RPA concluded that an appropriate economic analysis of Santa Ana can be conducted using the detailed information in the Revised Feasibility Study and available data.860 To calculate the compensation due to Claimant for Respondent\u2019s breaches of the FTA, FTI and RPA used the DCF methodology, which is widely used as a measure of damages in investment treaty arbitration.861 The DCF methodology utilizes forecasted future cash flows and discounts them to a present date by applying a risk adjusted discount rate.862\n\nC-I \u00b6 233; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b61.5, 1.7 **[CEX-001]** ; RPA First Report 4-1, \u00a7 18 **[CEX-002]**.\n\nC-I \u00b6 234; RPA First Report \u00a7\u00a7 6 - 10 **[CEX-002]**.\n\nC-I \u00b6 237; FTI First Report \u00b6 7.19 **[CEX-001]** ; RPA First Report 3-1 **[CEX-002]**.\n\nC-I \u00b6 236; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 6.3, 7.18 **[CEX-001]**.\n\n*Id*.\n\n609.\n\nFTI calculated the FMV of the Santa Ana Project as of June 23, 2011 based on a cash flow model provided by RPA. While the RPA \"*Revised Base Case*\" model only included reserves, FTI calculated the FMV of the Santa Ana Project based on the RPA \"*Extended Life Case*\", which included both reserves and resources and is therefore consistent with CIMVAL\u2019s requirement of inclusion of resources in valuation models.863 RPA\u2019s extended life of mine case increases the life of the mine from 11 to 24 years and includes additional \"*mineable Resources*\", bringing the total volume of ore to be processed to 81.3 million tonnes containing 107.3 million ounces of silver.864 FTI applied silver futures contract prices from 2013 - 2015 in the DCF analysis because futures prices represent actual market-based prices for the sale of silver during those years through December 31, 2015. From 2016 onward, FTI applied a long-term price estimate of US$ 22.21 per ounce (in 2011 dollars) based on a PwC survey of how metal prices would be determined by industry participants in evaluating mining projects.865 As Claimant explains:\n\n*428. FTI forecasted short-term commodities prices based on the futures curve on June 23, 2011. FTI based long-term commodities prices on indicators upon which market participants relied, according to a survey of silver miners. FTI also provided an alternative long-term price methodology based on the latest available futures curve as of June 23, 2011. The discount rate that FTI applied was a weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") developed under a capital asset pricing model (\"CAPM\") approach, resulting in a discount rate of 10.0%.*866\n\nC-II \u00b6 427; FTI First Report \u00b6 2.7 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nC-I \u00b6 238; FTI First Report \u00b6 4-32 **[CEX-001]** ; RPA First Report 14-3 **[CEX-002]**.\n\nC-I \u00b6 239; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 7.27, 7.45 - 7.47, 7.53 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 428 - 429 (bold added); FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 2.8 - 2.10 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n610.\n\nFTI\u2019s analysis is reasonable. FTI used alternative valuation methodologies to check the reasonableness of its damages calculation using the DCF methodology. FTI analyzed Claimant\u2019s share price data over the period leading up to the Valuation Date and reports of analysts covering Claimant. Claimant\u2019s share price declined by 48% more than market indicators over the period immediately prior to and after the issuance of Supreme Decree 032 (US$ 260.9 million). FTI considers that this decline in value was incurred as a result of Respondent\u2019s unlawful actions.867\n\nC-I \u00b6 241; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 7.67, 7.78, 7.82, 7.84 - 7.86 **[CEX-001]**.\n\n611.\n\nSRK was incorrect in all of its criticism of RPA\u2019s analysis.868 RPA has made no adjustment to its cost estimates and, in turn, FTA has made no adjustments to its DCF model. The Tribunal should disregard the criticisms of Respondent and its experts as unfounded.869 For example, the 35% reduction in operating costs in the RPA Report reflects a change in cost that occurred between the Feasibility Study and the Feasibility Study Update, from 5.36 to 4.20.870 As neither Brattle nor Respondent will dispute, FTI\u2019s silver price projection results in a lower valuation than does Brattle's.871\n\nC-II \u00b6 430.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 448.\n\nTr. 1813 - 1814 (C.

There are two types of cut-off grade: the \"*breakeven*\" cutoff grade (*i.e*., the external or mine cut-off grade) and the \"*internal or mill*\" cutoff grade. The breakeven cutoff grade is the amount of revenue-bearing material that will cover the cost of mining, processing side administrative costs, and off-site transport and smelting and refining costs. The \"*internal or mill*\" cutoff grade, \"*applies when a tonne of material needs to be moved from an open pit in order to access material above the breakeven cutoff grade*.\" The internal or mill cutoff grade only applies once mining costs are covered and, thus, excludes mining costs. Contrary to SRK\u2019s argument that the breakeven cutoff grades should be used to report mineral resources and reserves, RPA confirms that the accepted practice in the mining industry is to first estimate the volume of material that can be mined and processed at the breakeven cutoff grade and then to report mineral resources and reserves from within that volume at the internal or milling cutoff grade. Since SRK\u2019s comments regarding the use of cutoff grades in determining mineral resources and mineral reserves are founded in practice that are not used or accepted in the industry, RPA made no adjustment to its calculation of the Santa Ana resources and reserves.872 In closing, Claimant noted that the cutoff grade is largely irrelevant because in the Extended Life case that is used for valuation, it is ultimately the same tonnage of ore production.873\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 430 - 431, 434 - 438; Brattle First Report \u00b6 100 **[REX-004]** ; RPA, Response Report on the Santa Ana Project and Corani Project, Puno Peru (Jan. 6, 2016) (\"RPA Second Report\") \u00b6\u00b6 32 - 36, 52 - 59, 65 - 79, 124 **[CEX-007]**.\n\nTr. 1814 - 1815 (C.

RPA provides detailed explanation of this in its report and concludes that the estimated silver recovery recommendation of 75% should be maintained.875\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 439 - 440; SRK First Report \u00b6 83 **[REX-005]** ; RPA Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 97 - 103 **[CEX-007]**.\n\n*Id.*\n\n614.\n\nThe Santa Ana permitting, construction, and ramp up schedules are reasonable. RPA/FTI assume that construction would have commenced in 2011 and entered production by the end of 2012. This includes nine months for Respondent to review the ESIA and an additional six months to procure permits, which exceeds the 6 to 12 months that SRK mentions. Regarding the social unrest, while it is true that Respondent has experienced opposition to a number of mining projects, a number have also proceeded without delays. RPA also points to projects in Peru of similar magnitude that achieved a production schedule in line with Claimant's.876\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 441 - 442; RPA Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 113 - 118 **[CEX-007]**, RPA First Report Figure 5 - 6; Table 13-1 **[CEX-002]**.\n\n615.\n\nIn response to SRK\u2019s criticism of Claimant\u2019s construction and ramp up schedule for Santa Ana, RPA explained that \"*'it is totally incorrect to compare the detailed Gantt chart for Corani, which is a milling operation, with the production schedule for Santa Ana, which is a simple heap leaching operation' because '[m]illing operations are much more complicated processing circuits that contain a number of larger, more expensive, and more intricate unit operations such as crushing, grinding, flotation, leaching, thickening, filtration, and tailings storage requirements*.'\"877 RPA reviewed the contractor quotes by San Martin - who has operated in Peru for 23 years and has worked in high altitudes - and those quotes incorporate allowances for the remote location and the altitude (overall rate of US$ 1.68/t).878\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 443 - 445; SRK First Report \u00b6\u00b6 91 - 92 **[REX-005]** ; RPA Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 8 - 9, 85, 87 - 88, 122 **[CEX-007]**.\n\nC-II \u00b6 444; RPA Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 85 - 88 **[CEX-007]**.\n\n616.\n\nSRK\u2019s recommended operation cost of US$ 2.50 per tonne mined, rather than RPA\u2019s US$ 2.10, was justified only with SRK\u2019s suggestion that higher altitudes would lead to higher costs and lower labor and equipment productivity. As indicated above, however, San Martin is aware of production costs on a project at high altitudes and quoted those rates regarding Santa Ana accordingly. RPA, thus, makes no adjustment to its operating cost assumptions.879\n\nC-II \u00b6 446; SRK First Report \u00b6 80 **[REX-005]** ; RPA Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 86 - 89 **[CEX-007]**.\n\n617.\n\nRegarding capital costs, although Brattle argues that they were understated, Respondent\u2019s technical experts at SRK made no such criticism. In response, Claimant states that \"*FTI offers a number of reasons why Brattle\u2019s proposed increase in capital costs should be rejected*.\"880\n\nC-II \u00b6 447; Brattle First Report \u00b6 101 **[REX-004]** ; FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 7.35 - 7.39 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n618.\n\nAs in any mining project, a hypothetical FMV purchaser would account for the risk that local opposition may delay or prevent the full development of a project.881 Respondent\u2019s argument that a \"*social license risk*\" of 27 or 80% should be imposed on the Santa Ana Project undervalues Santa Ana.882 If a 27 or 80% social license risk were truly justified it would be reflected in the contemporaneous evidence. Instead, Respondent\u2019s proposed adjustment is created with hindsight information.883 FTI\u2019s DCF valuation properly adjusts for risks inherent to the mining industry and adjusts for social license risk through (1) the discount rate, (2) the country risk premium for operating in Peru, and (3) up-front annual operating expenses for community relations efforts at Santa Ana.884\n\nCPHB-II \u00b6 49; Tr. 757:3-15 (McLeod Seltzer).\n\nCPHB-II \u00b6 53.\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6 85; Tr. 1668 - 1669 (Brattle, F.

Brattle merely cites a few papers where the \"*modern*\" DCF is mentioned - one of which, from CIMVAL, notes that it is not widely used or understood, but it is gaining in acceptance. According to FTI, no analyst appears to have valued Santa Ana using a \"*modern*\" DCF. Despite Brattle\u2019s preference for the \"*modern*\" DCF, it has used a standard DCF in every published award where it has acted as an expert.

On any given day, the share price would reflect investor sentiment for a block of shares, not for the underlying assets. Furthermore, it is also common for insiders and institutional investors to make long-term investments in shares of a junior mining company and to hold the shares and not trade them on an active basis, such that it is most common to see trading activity in shares of junior being made up of retail investors.888 In contrast, the market for buyers for 100% of Claimant\u2019s shares would predominantly consist of larger mining companies who would be willing to pay a premium for the mining properties due to their lower cost of capital. According to Mergerstat data, at the Valuation Date, acquisition *premia* averaging 63.7% over trading prices were being paid for mining companies, due to the efficiency of the larger firm\u2019s capital or some other synergy that can uniquely be enjoyed by the buyer. FTI\u2019s calculation of the intrinsic value of Santa Ana employed a discount rate of typical buyers of these types of assets and, thus, included this premium.889\n\nC-II \u00b6 449; FTI First Report \u00b6 7.68 - 7.70 **[CEX-001]** ; FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 6.1 - 6.48, 6.5 **[CEX-004]**.\n\nC-II \u00b6 450; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 7.18 - 7.57 **[CEX-001]** ; FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 6.22 - 6.25 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n623.\n\nOn the Valuation Date, Claimant\u2019s Projects were undervalued, due to noise in the marketplace relating to political issues and anti-mining protests in Peru. From the date of the ESIA suspension to the first trading date after expropriation, Claimant\u2019s share price dropped by 56.5%, compared to a 7.3% and 9.8% decline in the price of silver and the S&P/TSX Global Mining Index, respectively. This is equivalent to a decrease in enterprise value of US$ 260.9 million. In the \"*but for*\" analysis of damages, Santa Ana is built and, therefore, these issues must be ignored to restore Claimant to the economic position it would have been in absent Respondent\u2019s breaches.890\n\nC-II \u00b6 451; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 7.77 - 7.78 **[CEX-001]** ; FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 6.26, 6.54 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n624.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant explained that Brattle\u2019s \"*modern*\" DCF is essentially a Market Approach masquerading as an Income Approach. A Market Approach, however, is not an appropriate valuation method because Claimant\u2019s share value is not an accurate reflection of Santa Ana\u2019s FMV and it ignores Claimant\u2019s acquisition of US$ 130 million in financing.891 Even when companies are consensually acquiring one another, they do not rely on share price on that date - neither offeror nor target company bases its price assessment on a share price, but rather forms a committee to perform an evaluation.892\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6 84; Tr. 1816 (C.

These values support FTI\u2019s DCF and stand in marked contrast to Brattle\u2019s cost-based and stock-price analyses, as well as its adjusted DCF.896 Further adjustments can be made on the Tribunal\u2019s demand.897\n\nC-I \u00b6 241; C-II \u00b6 452; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 7.67, 7.78, 7.82, 7.84 - 7.86, Appendix 8 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nTr. 1820 - 1823 (C.

To account for increased expenditures to obtain the social license, the Tribunal could subtract those assumed additional costs from the total damages.902 FTI\u2019s valuation provides the Tribunal the flexibility to make adjustments as it finds necessary.903 Claimant is willing to provide further calculations as necessary.904\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6 105.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 106.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 105 - 106; CPHB-II \u00b6 56.\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6 106.\n\n629.\n\nArbitrator Sands asked how the Tribunal should treat a situation where there was drilling - not the mere hammering of rocks as suggested by Claimant- occurring at the site, assuming that such activity was impermissible and was not disclosed by Claimant in its December 2006 Public Decree of Necessity Application.905 In response, Claimant stated that - considering the totality of the Application - \"*one could draw the conclusion that something doesn't seem quite right here*.\"906 According to Mr. Zegarra, the Government could have requested more information to correct a good faith error.907 In any event, Article 71 would not have applied to \"*exploration*\" but rather only to \"*exploitation*\" or production.908 After Arbitrator Sands pointed out that page 28 of the relevant Application expressly stated that \"*to date, no explorations in the area of the Santa Ana Mining Project have been conducted*\", even though nearly US$ 1 million of exploration work had been completed,909 Claimant explained that it was advised by top mining counsel in Peru in preparing the application.910 In any event, the issuance of Supreme Decree 032 was an extreme response.911 Even Respondent\u2019s expert agreed that a violation of Article 71 does not justify expropriation, and certainly without due process or compensation.912\n\nTr. 1952 - 1953 (Question by Arbitrator Sands).\n\n*Id*. at 1953 (C.

The Tribunal should reject FTI\u2019s simple DCF analysis as unreliable, methodologically weak, and based on false pretenses. While Brattle\u2019s modern DCF analysis is more reliable and transparent than FTI's, the DCF method is still inappropriate. This analysis, although an improvement upon FTI\u2019s simple DCF, further confirms that DCF analysis is unsuited for a non-producing asset. This Tribunal should, therefore, reject the use of DCF valuation for this non-producing asset.917\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 618, 629; RPHB-I \u00b6 101; RPHB-II \u00b6 41; *see also Phelps Dodge Corp. and Overseas Private Investment Corp. and The Islamic Republic of Iran*, Award No. 217-99-2 (Mar. 19 1986), reprinted in 10 IRAN-US.

As Brattle explains, FTI\u2019s approach to DCF analysis was vulnerable to large swings in valuation from minor tweaks in the applied discount rate.921\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 333, 337; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 596 - 597; Brattle First Report \u00b6\u00b6 88 - 89, 91 **[REX-004]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 335; R-II \u00b6 597; Brattle First Report \u00b6\u00b6 88 - 89, 91 **[REX-004]**.\n\n637.\n\nFTI\u2019s approach relies on estimated technical inputs - including operating costs and metal recovery rates - as opposed to actual technical inputs that would have been available, had Santa Ana ever reached production. FTI relies entirely on estimates adopted from RPA that contain further inaccuracies in key technical inputs that further inflate Claimant\u2019s claims and render FTI\u2019s simple DCF analysis even more inaccurate and unreliable. Most saliently, these inputs are (1) overstated mineral reserves and resources, (2) understated mining costs, (3) overly ambitious production timelines, and (4) overstated silver prices.922 Without endorsing FTI\u2019s DCF approach, Brattle re-ran FTI\u2019s model with proper, corrected values for (1) a \"*base case*\" considering only mineral reserves and (2) an \"*extended life case*\" considering mineral reserves and mineral resources. Correcting just the flawed parameters, FTI\u2019s Santa Ana damages estimate drops from US$ 191 million to **US$ 54 million** in the base case and from US$ 224 million to **US$ 70 million** in the extended life case.923 These numbers, however, do not account for any risk to the Santa Ana Project due to community opposition.924 This failure to account for social unrest is another reason the Tribunal should reject FTI\u2019s DCF valuation.925 Mr. Milburn\u2019s suggestion that a line item for $200,000 per year in the annual cash flows might represent the social-license risk should be rejected.926\n\nR-I \u00b6 338; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 599 - 600; Brattle First Report **\u00a7** II(D)(2) **[REX-004]** ; SRK First Report \u00b6\u00b6 8 *et seq*. **[REX-005]** ; Brattle Second Report \u00a7 II.E **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 601; Brattle First Report Tables 1 & 6 **[REX-004]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 617; RPHB-I \u00b6 101; Brattle Second Report Tables 1 & 6 **[REX-010]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 103 - 105; Tr. 1908 - 1910 (R.

It would have been more appropriate to have a breakeven cut-off grade of 30 grams per metric ton and an internal/milling cutoff grade of 27 grams per metric ton, as was applied in Claimant\u2019s 2011 Feasibility Study for Santa Ana. Using the lower cut-off grade, the base case reserves are inflated by 24%, *i.e.* from the 37 million metric tons stated in Claimant\u2019s 2011 Feasibility Study to 46 million metric tons claimed in RPA\u2019s reports. From that inflated base, RPA generated an even more speculative extended life case, with mineral potential of 81 million metric tons. SRK confirms that RPA made errors in both the nature of the cutoff grade applied and the quantum of the cut-off grade, as a result of using inflated silver prices and unrealistic silver metallurgical recoveries. This resulted in a gross overstatement of resources and reserves in both the base case and the extended life case.929 FTI\u2019s incorporation of these figures into its DCF valuation inflated its estimate.930\n\nR-II \u00b6 603; SRK First Report \u00b6 33 **[REX-005]** ; Second Expert Technical Mining Report of SRK Consulting (Apr. 13, 2016) (\"SRK Second Report\") \u00b6\u00b6 10 - 14 **[REX-011]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 340; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 602 - 603; SRK First Report \u00a7\u00a7 4, 6, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 67 **[REX-005]** ; SRK Second Report \u00a7 2.1, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20-21 **[REX-011]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 341; R-II \u00b6 604; Ausenco Vector, Revised Feasibility Study - Santa Ana Project - Puno, Per\u00fa - NI 43-101 Technical Report, Update to the Oct. 21, 2010 Technical Report, Apr. 1, 2011 **[C-0061]** ; SRK First Report \u00b6\u00b6 67, 70, 74, 79 **[REX-005]** ; SRK Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20 - 21, 27, 31, 40 **[REX-011]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 605; Brattle First Report \u00b6\u00b6 100, 128 **[REX-004]**.\n\n639.\n\nThe mining cost projections that RPA recommended and that Claimant adopted are unrealistically low. SRK noted that RPA\u2019s analysis overlooked Claimant\u2019s plan to use a contract miner at Santa Ana - one that would have to charge the costs actually incurred in order to generate a profit.931 Furthermore, Santa Ana is more than 4000 meters above sea level in the remote high Andes. This extreme environment can lead to health problems for workers and mechanical equipment failure which result in lower labor and equipment productivity and, therefore, higher operating costs.932 SRK maintains its recommended increase in the projected mining costs from US$ 2.10 per tonne of material to US$ 2.50 per tonne of material.

Using this adjusted extended case in FTI\u2019s DCF model reduced FTI\u2019s extended life case from US$ 224 million to US$ 178 million and the base case from US$ 191 million to US$ 166 million.934\n\nR-I \u00b6 344; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 605 - 606; Brattle First Report \u00b6\u00b6 100, 128, Table 1 **[REX-004]**.\n\n641.\n\nBrattle also includes a 14% increase in capital costs that corrects (using empirical studies of mining cost overruns) for the tendency within the industry to significantly understate project costs in mining feasibility studies. Brattle rejects FTI\u2019s objection to this adjustment noting, *inter alia*, that the Chairman of RPA, Mr. Graham Clow, shares Brattle\u2019s view that feasibility studies typically underestimate capital costs (in his estimate, by 20-25%).935 This adjustment further reduces the value of the extended case from US$ 178 million to US$ 170 million and the base case value from US$ 166 million to US$ 158 million.936\n\nR-II \u00b6 610; Brattle First Report \u00b6 101 **[REX-004]** ; Brattle Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 219 - 223 **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 345; Brattle First Report \u00b6 101, Table 10 **[REX-004]**.\n\n642.\n\nBrattle, SRK, and Respondent\u2019s Peruvian mining law expert all agree that FTI\u2019s DCF analysis adopts an unrealistic and overly aggressive production timeline that failed to account for delays due to (1) permitting, (2) social unrest and protests, and (3) operational issues and construction problems.937 SRK reaffirms that permitting delays are to be expected. As of June 2011, Claimant had obtained none of the necessary land use agreements with communities or land holders and still needed to receive approximately 40 permits and approvals before proceeding to production. Approval of these permits and approvals was not automatic or assured.

FTI ignored the potential impact of social unrest, pursuant to an unsupportable legal instruction to attribute social unrest to the Government. Community opposition arises independently of the Government and, as other stalled projects in Peru have shown, community opposition can thwart a mining project even when it received permits.939 Given the long history of popular uprisings against the mining industry in Peru and that Santa Ana was already the target of protests, it is implausible to assume away social opposition.940 Social unrest was the biggest challenge facing the Project and it is nowhere to be found in RPA\u2019s or FTI\u2019s calculations.941\n\nR-I \u00b6 348; R-II \u00b6 613; Brattle First Report \u00b6 105 **[REX-004]** ; FTI Second Report \u00b6 6.51 **[CEX-004]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 614; Pe\u00f1a First Report \u00b6\u00b6 96 *et seq*. **[REX-002]** ; Brattle First Report \u00b6 105 **[REX-004]** ; SRK First Report \u00b6 90 **[REX-005]** ; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 226 **[REX-010]** ; FTI Second Report \u00b6 7.42 **[CEX-004]**.\n\nTr. 1910 - 1911 (R.

This further lowers the value of Santa Ana under FTI\u2019s model.943 Factoring this additional delay into FTI\u2019s DCF model further lowers the value of Santa Ana to US$ 54 million in the base case and to US$ 70 million in the extended life case.944\n\nR-I \u00b6 349; R-II \u00b6 615; SRK First Report \u00b6 92 **[REX-005]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 349 - 350; R-II \u00b6 616; Brattle First Report \u00b6 105, Table 6 **[REX-004]** ; SRK First Report \u00b6 92 **[REX-005]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 350; Brattle First Report \u00b6 105, Table 6 **[REX-004]**.\n\n645.\n\nFTI embraces silver pricing models that exaggerate forward looking process. In FTI\u2019s first pricing method, FTI projects prices by combining commodity futures prices with projections of silver spot prices - Brattle explains that this is inconsistent with finance principles.945 FTI\u2019s flawed pricing leads to absurd results. FTI\u2019s projected silver price for 2015 is US$ 30.78 per ounce. For 2016, FTI abandons futures pricing and adopts pricing based on forecasted price projections, dropping the price to US$ 22.21 per ounce. This dramatic one year drop does not reflect any anticipated drop in prices - it results solely from the inconsistent methodology FTI adopts.946 In FTI\u2019s second pricing method, FTI isolates the last available silver futures price as of the date of valuation and holds that price constant in perpetuity. FTI fails to adjust its discount rate to account for this self-evidently imprecise approach, even though the use of futures prices accounts for pricing risks that FTI purports to include in its discount rate.947 Both pricing methods are inaccurate and inappropriate.\n\nR-I \u00b6 351; Brattle First Report \u00b6 116 **[REX-004]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 352; FTI First Report Figure 21 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 353; Brattle First Report \u00b6 119 **[REX-004]** ; SRK First Report \u00b6 78 **[REX-005]**.\n\n646.\n\nBrattle did not perform an independent silver price projection, but the April 2011 Updated Feasibility Study for Santa Ana used a silver price of US$ 13 per ounce - far lower than both of FTI\u2019s projections.

The modern approach is well suited for mining projects because clear market indicators exist for many of the key individual cash flow streams.951\n\nR-I \u00b6 356; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 596, 598; Brattle First Report \u00b6 90 **[REX-004]** ; Brattle Second Report \u00a7 II.B **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 336; Brattle First Report \u00b6\u00b6 92 *et seq*. **[REX-004]**.\n\n*Id*.\n\n648.\n\nBrattle\u2019s modern (\"*real options*\") DCF identifies and corrects for risks to cash flows that FTI\u2019s simple DCF analysis cannot detect. First, Brattle\u2019s approach takes advantage of market inputs to forecast cashflows and transparently quantify risks that might impact those cash flows. Second, Brattle\u2019s approach is calibrated to consider the FMV of the asset as measured by reference to Claimant\u2019s enterprise value (share price).952 Calibration using the share price is essential to incorporate the substantial and enduring \"*social license*\" risk on Santa Ana\u2019s value. FTI ignores this risk altogether, leading it to overvalue Santa Ana.953\n\nR-II \u00b6 618.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 619 - 620; Brattle Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 71, 113, 115, 119 - 121, Table 2 **[REX-010]**.\n\n649.\n\nSince Claimant\u2019s share price reflects the value of both Santa Ana and Corani, Brattle valued Corani as well. Regarding Corani, SRK and Brattle uncovered a technical risk related to metallurgy that could render the Corani Project infeasible or reduce its market value.954 Taking these values, Brattle calculated Santa Ana\u2019s value as of June 23, 2011 as ranging from **US$ 32 - US$ 119 million** and on May 27, 2011 as ranging from **US$ 40 million to US$ 113 million**.955 When combined with the value of Corani, these values - although a broad range - are consistent with Claimant\u2019s share price.956\n\nR-II \u00b6 623; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 116 **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-II 621; Brattle Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 121, 123, Table 2, 3 **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 622.\n\n650.\n\nBrattle has refuted each of FTI\u2019s arguments against the modern DCF approach.957 CIMVAL - the preeminent professional organization in the field of mineral valuation - recognizes the modern DCF approach as a primary valuation method. FTI claims to conduct its valuation consistently with its standards and guidelines, making FTI\u2019s suggestion that the modern DCF approach can be ignored nonsensical.958 Modern DCF methodology is mainstream in academic circles and in valuations by large mining companies and royalty companies.959 FTI\u2019s criticism of the alleged \"*subjectivity*\" of the modern DCF approach is invalid, as the modern approach requires fewer assumptions than FTI\u2019s model and Brattle\u2019s analysis replaced FTI\u2019s assumptions about metal prices and the Project discount rate with market-based forecasts of the same.960 Some of FTI\u2019s criticisms, however, apply to all income-based approaches, including FTI\u2019s own DCF model. Imprecision exists in any cash flow based valuation, and these imprecisions only intensify when valuing an asset with no history of operational cash flows, significant but unquantified social license risk, or where the share price includes other values - here, like Santa Ana and Corani.961\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 624; FTI Second Report \u00b6 7.11 - 7.14, 7.16 **[CEX-004]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 625; Brattle Second Report \u00a7 II.B., \u00b6\u00b6 85, 88 **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 626; Brattle Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 91, 95 **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 627; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 104 **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 628; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 104 **[REX-010]**.\n\n**(d) Arguments Related to Brattle\u2019s Stock Analysis**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n651.\n\nStock analysis further confirms that FTI has drastically overvalued Santa Ana.962 Brattle presented a market-based benchmark valuation based on Claimant\u2019s enterprise value (calculated as Claimant\u2019s share price - a direct measure of the combined FMV of all of the company\u2019s assets - multiplied by the number of outstanding shares on the day in question) multiplied by the percentage of Claimant\u2019s total value attributable to Santa Ana alone.963 The only uncertainty is the apportionment of value between Claimant\u2019s two assets, Santa Ana and Corani.964 Brattle adopted the same estimates that FTI used to value Corani, *i*. *e*., that it accounted for on average 19.2% of Claimant\u2019s total market value.965 Using the average of the analyst allocations, the Santa Ana portion of Claimant\u2019s total value corresponded to **US$ 89.1 million** on June 23, 2011 (where Claimant\u2019s enterprise value was US$ 464 million) and **US$ 104.3 million** on May 27, 2011 (where Claimant\u2019s enterprise value was US$ 543.5 million).966\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 596, 633.\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 630 - 631; Brattle First Report \u00b6 51 **[REX-004]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 631; Brattle First Report \u00b6 51 **[REX-004]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 360; Brattle First Report \u00b6\u00b6 56, 61 - 62 **[REX-004]** ; FTI First Report \u00b6 8.8 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 361 - 366; R-II \u00b6 632; Brattle First Report \u00b6 58, Tables 3 & 4 **[REX-004]** ; FTI First Report \u00b6 10.1 **[CEX-001]**.\n\n652.\n\nFTI tries to explain the more than US$ 130 million disconnect between its US$ 224.2 million valuation and the average US$ 89.1 million benchmark based on Claimant\u2019s stock price by arguing that the market-analysis fails to account for the \"*acquisition premium*.\"967 This criticism is meritless. When acquisitions occur at a premium, it reflects perceived synergies created through the sale. Not only do these not materialize in every sale, but Brattle noted and Prof. Damodaran agrees, the possibility of a synergistic acquisition is already reflected in Claimant\u2019s share price, because a buyer of the shares would stand to benefit from an acquisition at a premium.968 The application of acquisition premiums to any valuation based on share price is controversial among valuation professionals and must take specific circumstances of the valuation target into account. FTI, however, has used the average acquisition premium in other mining transactions.969 In doing so, FTI has assigned a value to Santa Ana that is about 250% higher than the global market thought it was worth.970\n\nR-II \u00b6 634; FTI Second Report \u00b6 4.3(i) **[CEX-004]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 635 - 636; Brattle Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 49, 55 **[REX-010]** ; FTI First Report Appendix 4 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 637; Brattle Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 49, 58 **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 638.\n\n**(e) The Impact of a Finding of Contributory Negligence and/or Fault (Tribunal\u2019s Question (e)(iv))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n653.\n\nThe following arguments were presented in response to Members of the Tribunal\u2019s questions during the Hearing, and in response to the Tribunal\u2019s question \"*What are the monetary amounts that the Tribunal should award to the Claimant if [...] the Tribunal was to find that the Claimant had contributed to the social unrest that occurred in the spring of 2011 - by act or omission - how should such a contribution be taken into account in determining matters of liability and/or quantum*\" contained at section (e) of PO-10.971\n\nPO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4 (e)(iv).\n\n654.\n\nIf the Tribunal agrees that the social unrest was a direct consequence of Claimant\u2019s conduct -including Claimant\u2019s unlawful scheme to acquire rights and its failure to win the support of local communities - it should not award damages at all.972 Alternatively, if the Tribunal concludes that Claimant\u2019s conduct contributed to Claimant\u2019s damages, the Tribunal must reduce any award in proportion to that contribution.973 The cases cited by Claimant demonstrate that the Tribunal may consider any contributory fault - not just \"*but for*\" harm - and may reduce damages accordingly.974\n\nRPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 100, 114, RPHB-II \u00b6 40; *MTD Equity v.

The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n656.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it has concluded that it is not possible in the present case to calculate the damages by relying on the expected profitability and the DCF method. Having so concluded, the Tribunal will not address the Parties\u2019 discussions related to the DCF method for its conclusions on damages. Rather, this Award will focus on the value of what Claimant actually invested.\n\n657.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes that those members of the indigenous population that opposed the Santa Ana Project have achieved their wishes: the Project is well and truly at an end. However, this does not relieve Respondent from paying reasonable and appropriate damages for its breach of the FTA. The Project was supported by the Government until the end when the Government panicked and arbitrarily put it at an end. The Government purportedly acted on a document, the existence of which could not be shown. The Government did not put its concerns to or otherwise hear Claimant. However, neither the FTA nor general international law provides an option to award punitive damages. Therefore, the only further option to calculate damages, as the DCF method cannot be applied, is the one also discussed by the Parties, *i.e.* the costs invested by Claimant. The Tribunal considers that this is indeed the appropriate method to calculate damages in the present case.\n\n658.\n\nIt appears to be undisputed that Claimant invested a total of US$ 21,827,687 for the Santa Ana Project as shown by the following table in the First Brattle Report (Exhibit REX-004) on page 62 using the sources cited from Claimant as follows:\n\nTable 7; Santa Ana Investment Costs (US$)\n\nTotal 2004-2011Q2\n\n[1] Drilling 7,994,832\n\n[2] Salaries and consulting 7,404312\n\n[3] Assaying and sampling **750,537**\n\n[4] Travel 1,878,520\n\n[5] Supplies es and general 2,302,516\n\n[6] Arquisition an d claim fees [ Maintenance costs J 508,149\n\n[7] Geophysics 57,407\n\n[8] Total Exploration Costs 20,896,273\n\n[9] Capitalized Costs (Land Acquisition) 931,414\n\n[10] Cumulative Asset Reirement ment ObIigations -\n\n[11] Total Cost of Investments 21,827,687\n\nSources:\n\nSources: Bear Creek Mining Corp., 2004 Annual Report fBR-04), p. 19 **;** Bear Creek Mining Corp., 2006 Annual Report (BR-05), p. 23; Bear Creek Mining Corp., Consolidated Financial Statements 31 December 2006 and 2005 (BR-06), p. 6; Bear Creek Mining Corp., Consolidated Financial Statements 31 December 2007 and 2006 (BR-07), pp, 6,13; Bear C reek Mining Corp., Consolidated Financial Statements 31 December 2008 and 2007 (BR-08), pp, &, 20; Bear Creek Mining Corp., Consolidated Financial Statements 31 December 2009 and 2008 (BR-09), pp. 15, 27; Bear Creek Mining Corp., Consolidated Financial Statements 31 December 2010 and 2009 (BR-10), pp. 13, 21; BearCreek Mining Corp., Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 (BR-12), pp. 10. 12.\n\nNotes:\n\nAll expenses and costs are annual data, except for \"Cumulative Asset Retirement Obligations,\" which is reported as a cumulative balance-\n\n2011 Q2 numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\nThe line Item \"salaries and consulting\" is split Into \"saIaries and consulting\" and \"engineering and consulting\" in the 2009 and 2010 annual reports and in the 2011Q2 **report.**\n\nThe line item \"supplies and general\" is split Into \"supplies and general\" and \"community relations\" in the 2010 annual report.\n\n[8]; Sum of [1] through [7]; expensed as operating expense every year,\n\n[11]: Sum of [8] through [10].\n\n659.\n\nRespondent initially argued that the Tribunal, if it awards anything, should award Claimant these US$ 21,827,687 as the amounts Claimant invested for Santa Ana.979 In its Post-Hearing Brief, however, Respondent adopted a different approach, arguing that regardless of whether the Tribunal determines that there was a lawful or unlawful expropriation or a non-expropriatory treaty breach, the Tribunal should award Claimant no more than US$ 18,237,592 as the amount Claimant invested after the issuance of Supreme Decree 083.\n\nR-II \u00b6 594.\n\n660.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant is not claiming for its expenditures prior to the issuance of Supreme Decree 083.980 In that respect, the Tribunal accepts the calculation presented by Respondent that these expenditures amount to US$ 3,590,095.981 Therefore, the remaining amount of the above total of US$ 21,827,687, *i.e.* US$ 18,237,592 is now undisputed between the Parties.\n\nTr. 1950 - 1951 (C.

Co-Arbitrator Prof. Sands, while agreeing that Respondent breached the FTA and is liable, as discussed in his Dissenting Opinion, concludes that the assessment of damages should be reduced. The majority of the Tribunal feels it cannot agree and shortly comments on the major arguments on which our colleague Sands relies.\n\n664.\n\n*First*, as Prof. Sands concedes, the ILO Convention 169 imposes direct obligations only on States. Contrary to Respondent\u2019s arguments, private companies cannot \"*fail to comply*\" with ILO Convention 169 because it imposes no direct obligations on them. The Convention adopts principles on how community consultations should be undertaken, but does not impose an obligation of result. It does not grant communities veto power over a project. The relevant examination is whether the consultations were conducted in good faith, adjusted to the circumstances of the Project and the affected community, and conducted with the objective of reaching agreement. As concluded above in this Award, Claimant has not breached that expectation.\n\n665.\n\nSecond, the majority cannot agree with Prof. Sands\u2019s evaluation of the evidence. Regarding the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio, the Tribunal recalls its conclusion above in this Award *:* \"*In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the first reason given in Supreme Decree 032 and in Respondent\u2019s arguments, i.e. that Claimant had illegally obtained the public necessity declaration by Supreme Decree 083 through the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio, is not valid.*\"\n\n666.\n\nThird *,* regarding particularly the testimony of Respondent\u2019s expert witness Prof. Pe\u00f1a Jumpa on which Prof. Sands heavily relies and which he accepts, while discarding Claimant\u2019s witnesses and experts as having limited knowledge and expertise, the majority recalls its conclusion above in this Award: \"*The evidence summarized above shows that from the very beginning until the time before the meeting of June 23, 2011, all outreach activities by Claimant were known to Respondent\u2019s authorities and were conducted with their approval, support, and endorsement, and that no objections were raised by the authorities in this context. While, as mentioned above, further actions by Claimant would have been feasible, on the basis of the continued coordination with and support by Respondent\u2019s authorities, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant could take it for granted to have complied with all legal requirements with regard to its outreach to the local communities. Respondent, after its continuous approval and support of Claimant\u2019s conduct, cannot in hindsight claim that this conduct was contrary to the ILO Convention 169 or was insufficient, and caused or contributed to the social unrest in the region.*\" The indigenous communities, irrespective whether they were in favor of or against the Project, are not respondent party in this arbitration. Rather, the State of Peru and its Government are Respondent and it is their conduct which the Tribunal has to decide upon.\n\n667.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal recalls its conclusions above when considering contributory fault and liability: \"*Respondent has the burden of proof that its breaches of the FTA, which the Tribunal found in its considerations above in this Award, were to some extent caused by Claimant. In view of the above cited conclusions of the Tribunal, Respondent has not met that burden. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that there was no contributory fault and liability of Claimant.*\"\n\n668.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the above damages amount of US$ 18,237,592 is not to be reduced due to contributory fault or liability of Claimant.\n\n**C. Compensation For the Corani Project and the Tribunal\u2019s Question (e)(ii)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n669.\n\nMany of the arguments summarized below were also repeated in response to the Tribunal\u2019s question:\n\n*e) What are the monetary amounts that the Tribunal should award to the Claimant if it were to conclude that:*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*ii. the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment was unlawfully expropriated?*982\n\nPO-10 \u00b6 2.1.4 (e)(i) - (iii).\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n670.\n\nFTI calculated the reduction in value of Corani immediately following the expropriation date in a range from **US$ 59.6 million** (deducting the full FMV of Santa Ana Project) to **US$ 276.3** (without ascribing any value to the Santa Ana Project).983 FTI quantified the reduction in value of Corani resulting from Respondent\u2019s taking of Santa Ana at **US$ 170.6 million** (19.2%).984\n\nC-I \u00b6 244; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 8.11 - 8.12, Fig. 27 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00b6 74; FTI Second Report Figure 1 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n671.\n\nRespondent\u2019s expropriation of Santa Ana and other FTA violations caused substantial additional damage to Claimant by irretrievably hindering the development of the Corani Project.985 The harm and causation are self-evident: immediately following Respondent\u2019s suspension of the Santa Ana ESIA and immediately following the expropriation, Claimant\u2019s enterprise value plummeted, as a direct result. Mr. Swarthout unambiguously explains that these actions precluded Claimant from obtaining financing for the Corani Project and, \"*unless [Claimant] receives compensation in this arbitration for Peru\u2019s taking of Santa Ana*\", Claimant will not be able to finance Corani.986 His testimony confirms the basic economics that the increased cost of capital implies that future expansion projects will not be economically viable. The company\u2019s future cash flows are much less valuable, in that they are discounted more heavily. This leads to a loss in value.987 FTI established a causal link between the additional cost of financing and the increased risk-profile of the Project and the decrease in Corani\u2019s value. The losses asserted by Claimant are based on an undisputed decrease in Claimant\u2019s enterprise value between the last day of trading prior to the ESIA suspension and the first day of trading following the announcement of Supreme Decree 032.988 Respondent acknowledges that this decrease in Claimant\u2019s enterprise value was caused by its actions, though it characterized this damage as not \"*lasting*.\"989 Four and a half years later, however, Claimant\u2019s share price sits close to its historical low and the Corani Project remains undeveloped, due to lack of financing and the Project\u2019s increased risk profile.990 Regardless of future events, Claimant will not be able to recover this loss.991\n\nC-II \u00b6 453; CPHB-I \u00b6\u00b6 73, 89; CPHB-II \u00b6 46; Tr. 1823 (C.

Here, the chain of causation follows two steps, which Claimant has established on the balance of probabilities:\n\n*a) As a consequence of Peru\u2019s expropriation of Santa Ana, Claimant has to raise more money at a higher financing rate, while having fewer options than if it retained control of the Santa Ana project; the Corani project has become riskier to develop; and the development of Corani has been delayed, leading to a permanent loss of income for the period of delay*\n\n*b) These events caused a direct, normal and foreseeable financial loss to Bear Creek measured by FTI as the decrease in Bear Creek\u2019s enterprise value between the last trading day prior to the ESIA suspension and the first trading day after the expropriation\u2019s announcement.992*\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 473 - 474; Sergey Ripinsky with Kevin Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law* (British Institute of International Comparative Law 2008) **[CL-0213]**.\n\n673.\n\nClaimant\u2019s position is supported by case law in other instances where Investor-State tribunals have grappled with causation issues. For example, in *Inmaris Perestoika v. Ukraine*, the tribunal found that the wrongful ban that prevented the ship from leaving Ukrainian territorial waters and the ensuing lack of revenue was a proximate or foreseeable cause of claimants\u2019 bankruptcy in Germany. Following steps in a chain of causation, that tribunal awarded lost profits for the additional ten years of operation that would have followed had claimants not gone into bankruptcy.993*Lemire v. Ukraine* is also instructive. There, the tribunal recognized the uncertainty and the assumptions in the causation chain and awarded damages because, to do otherwise, would reward Ukraine for its unlawful conduct. This Tribunal need not go as far as the *Inmaris* or *Lemire* tribunals were willing to go in order to find a causal link between Respondent\u2019s conduct and Claimant\u2019s Corani damages. Respondent\u2019s arguments on causation are unsupported and must be rejected.994\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 475 - 476; *Inmaris Perestroika Sailing Maritime Services GmbH and Others v.

Pursuant to *Chorz\u00f3w* and as reflected in Article 36 of the ILC Articles, compensation should include both (1) the monetary equivalent of restitution and (2) additional damages for loss sustained that would not otherwise be covered by restitution or its monetary equivalent. Corani falls under this second category.995 Applying this principle, various investment tribunals have awarded damages in addition to compensation for expropriated assets. In *Sedco v. NIOC*, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal awarded compensation for the replacement value of the expropriated old rigs, as well as other losses in the form of lost income not generated due to the expropriation. In *Vivendi II*, the tribunal awarded compensation for full destruction of value, as well as additional losses that included cost of sponsored debt and management fees. Tribunals have also awarded compensation for the additional cost of financing sustained as a result of a State\u2019s wrongful conduct.996\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 459 - 460, 462; The International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Art. 35 (2001) (Updated 2008) Art. 36(1) **[CL-0030]** ; *Case Concerning The Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germ. v.

This Tribunal should not punish Claimant by allowing Respondent to benefit from this wrongful conduct. Rather, Claimant refers the Tribunal to the tribunal\u2019s decision in *Gemplus & Talsud v. Mexico* and states that assessing damages attributable to Corani is a complex exercise that involves estimation and approximation. The damages could not be more real and are compensable under international law.998\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 465 - 466; *Gemplus, S.A., SLP, S.A. and Gemplus Industrial, S.A. de C.V. v.

FTI\u2019s calculations are based on real, undisputed market event: the change in value before the ESIA suspension until after the expropriation, amounting to US$ 307.2 million. The conservative range provided by FTI reflects an allocation of enterprise value that the market could have placed on Santa Ana on May 27, 2011, prior to the ESIA suspension.999\n\nC-II \u00b6 455; *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v.

Without the development of Santa Ana, the sources of capital that will be available to develop Corani, if any, will come from the issuance of equity of a much smaller company with a lower market capitalization. The resulting dilution to investors and the cost of this equity will undoubtedly exceed the cost of capital that would have been available had Santa Ana been allowed to proceed as anticipated. The damage to Corani is tangible, has been experienced, and is permanent.1000\n\nC-II \u00b6 481; FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 8.2 - 8.3 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n679.\n\nFTI was unable to prepare a DCF analysis for Corani because it would require subjective assumptions that would not support an objective opinion on damages. Claimant explains that \"*while [Claimant's] share price does not provide a reliable measure of FMV of the underlying assets (both Santa Ana and Corani), and understates the adverse effect on the value of Corani of [Respondent's] actions against Santa Ana, FTI concludes that the only available objective measure of the change in perceived value to Corani is the change in the price of [Claimant's] shares at the Valuation Date*.\"1001\n\nC-II \u00b6 482; FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 8.3 - 8.5 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n680.\n\nFTI calculated the reduction in value of Corani immediately following the expropriation date in a range from **US$ 59.6 million** (deducting the full FMV of Santa Ana Project) to **US$ 276.3** (without ascribing any value to the Santa Ana Project).1002 FTI quantified the reduction in value of Corani resulting from Respondent\u2019s taking of Santa Ana at **US$ 170.6 million**. This is the point estimate for FTI\u2019s damages conclusion because FTI did not believe that the market would have priced the full Santa Ana FMV into Claimant\u2019s share price at the time. Thus, FTI deducted 19.2% for value attributable to Santa Ana (representing the average net asset value, which ranged from 9.1% to 32.2%) and adjusted for the 7.3% decline in the S&P/TSX Global Mining Index over the referenced period. FTI also deducted the full enterprise value attributable to Corani on June 27, 2011, which FTI equated to the retained value of Corani following the expropriation.1003 This method likely understates the effect of the damages on the value of Corani substantially. The consensus of independent industry analysts placed a value of approximately US$ 1.1 billion on Corani. Given the share price at the current time, the diminution appears to be in excess of FTI\u2019s calculation of damages. Although Claimant\u2019s share price understates the FMV of Corani, and hence the observed decrease in Claimant\u2019s enterprise value after the expropriation will also understate the damages to Corani, the calculation in the FTI Report provides the best estimate with the information available.1004\n\nC-I \u00b6 244; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 8.11 - 8.12, Fig. 27 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nC-I \u00b6\u00b6 242 - 243; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 483 - 484; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 8.4 - 8.11, fn. 126 Fig. 27 **[CEX-001]** ; FTI Second Report \u00b6 8.6 **[CEX-004]**.\n\nC-II \u00b6 485; FTI First Report \u00b6 8.8 **[CEX-001]** ; FTI Second Report \u00b6 8.9 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n681.\n\nFTI addresses Brattle\u2019s concerns in its second report.1005 Brattle\u2019s assertion that Claimant has not experienced an increase in financing costs to date is hollow, especially in light of Mr. Swarthout\u2019s testimony. Common sense dictates that the loss of Santa Ana made Corani more difficult to finance and this financing difficulty has caused the Project to be delayed. The delay was not the result of a managerial decision due to technical factors or market conditions, nor did it result in a net benefit, as Brattle argues. Technical optimization studies were clearly contemplated and were independent of market conditions.1006\n\nC-II \u00b6 486; FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 8.15 - 8.27 **[CEX-004]**.\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 487 - 490; Swarthout Second Statement \u00b6\u00b6 43 - 46, 53 **[CWS-6]** ; Brattle First Report \u00b6\u00b6 140, 146 **[REX-004]**.\n\n682.\n\nThe market has recognized that Claimant\u2019s ability to raise the nearly US$ 700 million needed to develop Corani has been permanently diminished and has accordingly reduced its view of the value of the Corani Project. The events in Santa Ana also increased Corani\u2019s risk profile beyond the threat of Corani itself being expropriated. FTI noted that Brattle agrees that an increased risk profile would reduce Corani\u2019s value.1007\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 491 - 492; FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 8.35 - 8.39 **[CEX-004]** ; Swarthout Second Statement \u00b6 55 **[CWS-6]**.\n\n683.\n\nFTI was not inconsistent in using the more reliable and precise DCF method to determine the FMV of Santa Ana on the one hand, and then using the change in Claimant\u2019s share price to estimate the permanent damage to Corani caused by the alleged breaches on the other. Since the alleged wrongful actions themselves have caused the uncertainty that forced FTI to use a less precise approach to measure the damages to Corani, it would not be proper to ignore the permanent and ongoing damages to Corani merely due to the inherent difficulties in estimating its quantum.1008\n\nC-II \u00b6 493; Tr. 1824 - 1825 (C. Closing).\n\n684.\n\nRPA\u2019s conclusion that the Corani Feasibility Study work was thorough and diligent remains unchanged. Corani is one of the ten largest silver deposits in the world and it is beyond doubt that it is a world-class mining project. While the valuation date for expropriation of Santa Ana is June 23, 2011, there is no requirement under the FTA that damages must have the same valuation date. The 2015 Final Feasibility Study demonstrates that the information that existed in 2011 is and was valid. Contrary to SRK\u2019s statement, the 2011 Feasibility Study incorporated allowances for Corani\u2019s remote location and altitude. The projected metallurgical recoveries contained in the 2011 Feasibility Study are not overstated. Claimant has completed work to support silver recovery estimates at 70%, rather than 55% as SRK asserts. SRK\u2019s claims with regard to scheduling and construction are speculative and without warrant, especially since Corani\u2019s Project schedule of 17 months from ESIA preparation and permitting is five months longer than the 12 months suggested by SRK.1009\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 494 - 497; CPHB-I \u00b6 73; RPA Direct Presentation Sl. 19, 27; Tr. 1421:2 - 1423:21 (RPA, R.

Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n685.\n\nThroughout, Claimant\u2019s request for Corani damages has been a \"*throw away*\" claim, designed to inflate damages in the hopes that the Tribunal would split the difference and arrive at a higher midpoint.1010 Claimant\u2019s claim for Corani damages rests on the assumption that the Santa Ana measure reduced Corani\u2019s market value in three ways: (1) by increasing financing costs by requiring Claimant to obtain more outside investment, (2) by delaying development of Corani, and (3) by increasing the market\u2019s perception of risk associated with the Corani Project.1011 Claimant\u2019s Corani claim must fail because Claimant cannot prove the fundamental elements of its claim - *i.e*., (1) that it suffered enduring harm to its Corani investment and (2) that a sufficiently direct and proximate link exists between the measures Respondent took *vis-\u00e0-vis* Santa Ana and the alleged Corani damage s.1012\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 367 - 368, 401; R-II \u00b6 687.\n\nR-I \u00b6 369; FTI First Report \u00b6 8.1 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 369; R-II \u00b6 644; RPHB-I \u00b6 109; Tr. 502:21 - 526:12 (Swarthout).\n\n686.\n\nClaimant\u2019s entire case for the existence of damages to Corani rests on an insufficient factual foundation: Mr. Swarthout\u2019s self-serving witness testimony - testimony that is contradicted by Mr. Swarthout\u2019s contemporaneous statements.1013 The key tenants of Mr. Swarthout\u2019s uncorroborated testimony are that Respondent\u2019s actions regarding Santa Ana (1) made it difficult for Claimant to finance Corani, (2) delayed development of Corani, and (3) increased investor\u2019s perception of risk regarding Corani. First, if these allegations were true, one would expect additional supporting, substantiating documentation would have been submitted. Mr. Swarthout was and remains obligated under Canadian securities regulations to disclose material information to investors - including any negative impact that Supreme Decree 032 might have had on the Corani Project.1014 Although it would have been in Claimant\u2019s interest to submit such documentation, none has been provided.1015Second, from June 2011 - September 2015, Mr. Swarthout made repeated public statements that contradict his witness testimony. He repeated that Santa Ana events had not interfered with Corani\u2019s advancement or timeline. Either Mr. Swarthout and Claimant violated Canadian securities regulations by hiding massive Corani-related losses in 2011, or they are asserting baseless claims before this Tribunal. The Tribunal cannot put any faith in Mr. Swarthout\u2019s credibility in the face of this inconsistency.1016\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 645 - 646, 667; Swarthout Second Statement \u00b6\u00b6 45, 58 **[CWS-6]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 380; M3 Engineering, Corani Project Form NI 43-101F1 Technical Report Feasibility Study, Dec. 2011 **[C-0066]** ; TSX Venture Corporate Finance Manual (excerpts) \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 3.1 **[R-187]** ; Bear Creek Mining 2011 Annual Report **[R-188]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 668 - 669; Swarthout First Statement \u00b6 46 **[CWS-1]** ; Swarthout Second Statement \u00b6\u00b6 43 - 45, 52 **[CWS-6]** ; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 256 **[REX-010]** ; FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 8.16 - 8.19 **[CEX-004]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 379 - 381; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 670 - 674; RPHB-I \u00b6 109; Tr. 502:21 - 526:12 (Swarthout); M3 Engineering, Corani Project Form NI 43-101F1 Technical Report Feasibility Study, Dec. 2011 **[C-0066]** ; Transcript of Bear Creek Mining Corporation Special Call (6/27/2011) pp. 3, 7 **[R-186]** ; TSX Venture Corporate Finance Manual (excerpts) **[R-187]** ; Bear Creek Mining 2011 Annual Report **[R-188]** ; Daily Gold Podcast, *available at* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Ik3MNrzjY (at 5:31) **[R-383]** ; Andrew Swarthout, \"Speech before the Precious Metals Summit Conference,\" **[R-384]** ; Bear Creek Mining Corp, \"Special Call,\" May 14, 2014 **[BR-134]** ; Swarthout First Statement \u00b6 46 **[CWS-1]**, Swarthout Second Statement \u00b6\u00b6 45, 48 **[CWS-6]**.\n\n687.\n\nFurther, even if the Tribunal were to accept his testimony, issues that relate only to Claimant - like difficulties financing the Corani Project - cannot decrease the FMV of Corani.1017 Markets value an asset at its most profitable use in the hands of the most efficient owner.1018 If Claimant faced financing difficulties at Corani, this would not lower Corani\u2019s market value if another mining company could have bought and developed the site without these financial problems. Brattle explains that a robust market exists for mining properties similar to Corani. Claimant can, therefore, mitigate any financing-related damages by selling Corani at fair market price to a buyer who is able to finance the Project. After all, if Corani indeed lost value because of Claimant\u2019s inability to finance Corani in light of its Santa Ana experience, it would be within Claimant\u2019s fiduciary duty to its shareholders to sell the asset for its FMV.1019 Contrary to Claimant\u2019s mitigation argument, the FTA does not compensate in accordance with an investor\u2019s alleged \"*intentions*\" and \"*strategies*\" - it provides compensation in accordance with losses in market value, which do not turn on one owner\u2019s plans.1020\n\nR-II \u00b6 675.\n\n*Id*., R-I \u00b6\u00b6 376 - 377; Brattle First Report \u00b6 154 **[REX-004]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 378; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 675 - 676; Brattle First Report \u00b6 155 **[REX-004]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 677; Swarthout Second Statement \u00b6 50 **[CWS-6]**.\n\n688.\n\nContrary to Claimant\u2019s argument, Corani would not be sold at a \"*fire sale*\", depressed price.1021 As Brattle notes and FTI overlooks, a forced sale occurs when the seller has no time to adequately assess the market. Here, Claimant has had adequate liquidity to conduct business for more than four years since the issuance of Supreme Decree 032, during which time it has continued to develop Corani and during which time it would have had sufficient opportunity to conduct an orderly and valuemaximizing sale.1022\n\nR-II \u00b6 678; *Tenaris S.A. and Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/26, Award, Jan. 28, 2016 \u00b6\u00b6 564 - 565 **[RLA-096]**.\n\n*Id*.\n\n689.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Corani claim fails because Claimant has not proven that Respondent\u2019s actions regarding Santa Ana caused any lasting damage to Corani\u2019s market value or an increased perception of market risk.1023 As the tribunal in *Rompetrol v. Romania* observed, the purpose of a damages award is to *\"make good in monetary terms some enduring alteration for the worse in the economic, financial or commercial position of the foreign investor which can be traced, in a sufficiently direct and proximate way, to the host State\u2019s unlawful course of action*.\"1024 Here, Claimant has not proven any enduring harm. Claimant\u2019s decline in stock price in the wake of Supreme Decree 032 was nothing more than a temporary dip, after which Claimant\u2019s share price quickly rebounded. This quick rebound makes sense, given that Respondent enacted Supreme Decree 032 for reasons inapplicable to Corani, which was not the target of violent protests and had not been illegally acquired.1025 Claimant asks that the Tribunal consider Claimant\u2019s low share price of today as being caused by Claimant\u2019s depressed share price immediately following Supreme Decree 032. Claimant ignores the five years of history occurring in between - in particular, that Claimant\u2019s share price was higher on July 21, 2011 than it was before Supreme Decree 032 was issued. Thus, if today were July 21, 2011, following Claimant\u2019s argument, Claimant would be paying Respondent for its \"*good fortune*\" caused by Supreme Decree 032.1026\n\nR-II \u00b6 646.\n\nR-II \u00b6 648; *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award, May 6, 2013 \u00b6 287 **[RLA-068]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 649 - 652; Brattle First Report Figure 6 **[REX-004]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 371 - 373, 387 - 389; R-II \u00b6 652; FTI First Report \u00b6\u00b6 8.2, 8.5 **[CEX-001]** ; Brattle First Report \u00b6\u00b6 160 *et seq*., 170, 174, Figure 6, \u00a7 III(B)(2) **[REX-004]** ; Swarthout First Statement \u00b6 46 **[CWS-1]**.\n\n690.\n\nBrattle explains that the true driver of the poor performance of Claimant\u2019s stock price was the general downturn in the global mining sector.1027 An additional factor affecting Claimant\u2019s stock price may be the market\u2019s perception of risks to the viability of the Corani Project. Brattle explains that it may not even be possible to produce lead and zinc ore at Corani that is sufficiently concentrated to undergo metallurgical processing. Without marketable lead and zinc concentrates at Corani, it will not be possible to produce silver at Corani, as the latter depends on the former.1028 Claimant failed to resolve this issue - it told the market in 2009 and 2011 that the risk existed and could only be eliminated by successful metallurgical testing, but then Claimant declined to conduct those tests in the following 4 years or even in its 2015 Updated Feasibility Study. The market likely anticipates that Claimant expects that the results would be negative. Thus, the market is aware of the unresolved, fundamental risk to the Corani Project\u2019s viability and has discounted Claimant\u2019s stock price accordingly.1029 This tribunal should decline Claimant\u2019s invitation to hold Respondent liable for deteriorating market conditions in the global metals sector or the market\u2019s declining confidence in Corani\u2019s technical feasibility.1030\n\nR-II \u00b6 653; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 278 **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 654 - 655; Brattle Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 186 - 189 **[REX-010]** ; SRK Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 70 - 73, 100 **[REX-011]**.\n\n*Id*.\n\nR-II \u00b6 656.\n\n691.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Corani claim also fails because Claimant has not proven that the actions regarding Santa Ana were direct and proximate causes of its alleged Corani damages.1031 Claimant does not deny that it carries the burden of proof on causation, but instead cites a string of inapposite cases that do not address the situation where, as here, claimant requested and received damages for one project and for an entirely separate, second endeavor.1032 In *Sedco v. NIOC*, that tribunal awarded income related to the expropriated asset - not damages from the allegedly expropriated asset and a separate, second asset, as Claimant proposes here.1033 Likewise, in Claimant\u2019s *Suez v. Argentina*, the tribunal only awarded damages related to the asset that was directly impacted by the measures.1034 In *Inmaris v. Ukraine*, the tribunal\u2019s ruling was a statement in the obvious: impounding a company\u2019s only asset causes that company to go bankrupt. That claimant was not requesting damages related to a separate project and, thus, the case is not helpful to Claimant.1035 Finally, Claimant cites *Lemire v*. *Ukraine*, where the tribunal held that if the tendering process had been proper, claimant would have received certain radio frequencies, enabling claimant to create successful radio stations. In order for *Lemire* to be helpful to Claimant, the tribunal would have had to have awarded claimant damages for additional radio stations that claimant might have hoped to develop using the profits from the successful operation of the initial stations. *Lemire*, accordingly, does not advance Claimant\u2019s case.1036\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 646, 657, 658; *S.D.

There, claimant sought FMV of the asset directly impacted by the measures at issue, as well as additional damages for supposed impacts to its other business ventures.

The Tribunal should accept the wisdom of the *Metalclad* tribunal and reject Claimant\u2019s Corani damages claim.1038\n\nR-II \u00b6 665; *Metalclad v.

If one assumes that Claimant was able to generate all of the free cash flows it projected for Santa Ana, and that Claimant devoted all of that free cash to Corani, it would take more than 8 years of operations at Santa Ana to finance Corani\u2019s initial capital needs. Thus, Claimant would have nonetheless needed to attract substantial outside funding to develop Corani.1040 Supreme Decree 032 enabled Claimant to avoid spending US$ 71 million in construction costs, as it did not build the Santa Ana mine. This amount exceeds the free cash flow that Claimant projected from the first year of production at Santa Ana, freeing those funds to be deployed at Corani. Brattle notes that the majority of the US$ 71 million has been used by Claimant for purposes other than Santa Ana and that thus, contrary to Mr. Swarthout\u2019s statement, the terms of the equity offering did not prevent Claimant from using the proceeds for other purposes, such as advancing Corani.1041\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 647, 679.\n\nR-I \u00b6 383; R-II \u00b6 680; Ausenco Vector, Revised Feasibility Study - Santa Ana Project - Puno, Per\u00fa - NI 43-101 Technical Report, Update to the Oct. 21, 2010 Technical Report, Apr. 1, 2011 **[C-0061]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 384; R-II \u00b6 681; Ausenco Vector, Revised Feasibility Study - Santa Ana Project - Puno, Per\u00fa - NI 43-101 Technical Report, Update to the Oct. 21, 2010 Technical Report, Apr. 1, 2011 **[C-0061]** ; Swarthout Second Statement \u00b6 54 **[CWS-6]** ; Brattle First Report \u00b6 159 **[REX-004]** ; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 262 **[REX-010]**.\n\n694.\n\nBrattle explains that it is not more costly to finance a project with outside funds than with internal funds. To argue otherwise conflicts with basis economic principles - while borrowing has explicit costs, using internal funds is also costly because of opportunity costs.1042\n\nR-I \u00b6 385; R-II \u00b6\u00b6 682 - 683; Brattle First Report \u00b6 156 **[REX-004]** ; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 258 **[REX-010]**.\n\n695.\n\nSince Claimant has failed to prove causation, Respondent has not addressed Claimant\u2019s Corani damages calculation in depth.1043 There is, however, one glaring inconsistency in FTI\u2019s valuation approaches: FTI adopts a stock-market based method for valuing the alleged damages to Corani, in direct contradiction with its methodology for valuing Santa Ana. There, \"*FTI refuses to calibrate its DCF results to align them with reality, i.e., the actual market value of Santa Ana as reflected in Bear Creek\u2019s share price.*\" FTI discredits the value of share price data when applied to Santa Ana and at one point even states that the \"*share price does not provide a reliable measure of the FMV of either Santa Ana or Corani*.\" Yet, FTI bases its US$ 170 million Corani damages estimate entirely on changes in share price.1044 This inconsistency has not yet been resolved.\n\nR-I \u00b6 390; R-II \u00b6 685.\n\nR-II \u00b6 686; FTI Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 8.6 *et seq* **[CEX-004]**.\n\n696.\n\nFTI has estimated the Corani damages to range from US$ 59.6 million to US$ 267.3 million. First, FTI took Claimant\u2019s enterprise value on May 27, 2011 and subtracts the market value of Santa Ana (calculated in 3 different ways), to arrive at the remainder as an estimated market value for Corani as of May 27, 2011. Second, FTI project this estimated value forward to June 27, 2011 using a stock market index to arrive at the estimated \"*but for\"* value of Corani on June 27, 2011. Third, FTI subtracts from this \"*but for\"* number the actual value of Claimant on June 27, 2011 - which in theory no longer included Santa Ana - to arrive at the loss of value for Corani.1045 The key error and internal inconsistency lies in the first step of this analysis. Applying a higher value for Santa Ana yields a lower valuation and lower potential damages for Corani, and vice versa. When Claimant applies its preferred US$ 224.2 million Santa Ana DCF valuation to its Corani damages calculation, it reaches an estimated value for Corani of US$ 59.2 million.1046 When Claimant uses analysis reports that suggest that Santa Ana only accounted for 19.2 % of Claimant\u2019s total enterprise value, it arrives at figures valuing Santa Ana at US$ 104.3 million - half of FTI\u2019s estimate based on its DCF calculations - and tripling the Corani damages estimate to US$ 170.6 million.1047 FTI further suggested that the market may have considered that Santa Ana had zero value - thereby producing a damages estimate for Corani of US$ 267.3 million - a number that is five times higher than FTI\u2019s estimate for Corani when applying its own Santa Ana valuation.1048\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 391 - 392; FTI First Report at \u00b6 8.5 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 393 - 397; Brattle First Report \u00b6\u00b6 176 *et seq*. **[REX-004]** ; FTI First Report Figure 27 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6 398; FTI First Report Figure 27 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 399 - 401; FTI First Report Figure 27 **[CEX-001]**.\n\n697.\n\nIn its closing argument, Respondent pointed out that Claimant introduced new testimony at the Hearing. Confronted with the fact that Claimant had never disclosed to the market that it suffered losses at Corani, Mr. Swarthout claimed that he told unnamed stock analysts during an undated phone call that actions at Santa Ana harmed Corani. If it was true that this connection was felt at the time, surely the Tribunal would have learned of this phone call prior to the Hearing.1049\n\nTr. 1904 (R. Closing).\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n698.\n\nAs is undisputed, Claimant has the burden of proving not only the alleged damages to the Corani Project, but also for the requisite causal link between Respondent\u2019s breach of the FTA regarding the Santa Ana Project and the alleged damages to the Corani Project.\n\n699.\n\nIn this regard, Claimant argues that in the present case the following two steps provide the required chain of causation:\n\n*a) As a consequence of Peru\u2019s expropriation of Santa Ana, Claimant has to raise more money at a higher financing rate, while having fewer options than if it retained control of the Santa Ana project; the Corani project has become riskier to develop; and the development of Corani has been delayed, leading to a permanent loss of income for the period of delay;*\n\n*b) These events caused a direct, normal and foreseeable financial loss to Bear Creek measured by FTI as the decrease in Bear Creek\u2019s enterprise value between the last trading day prior to the ESIA suspension and the first trading day after the expropriation\u2019s announcement.*1050\n\nC-II \u00b6\u00b6 473 - 474; Sergey Ripinsky with Kevin Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law* (British Institute of International Comparative Law 2008) **[CL-0213]**.\n\n700.\n\nRespondent denies such causal link and points out that Brattle explains that the true driver of the poor performance of Claimant\u2019s stock price was the general downturn in the global mining sector, and that an additional factor affecting Claimant\u2019s stock price may be the market\u2019s perception of risks to the viability of the Corani Project.1051\n\nR-II \u00b6\u00b6 653 - 654; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 278 **[REX-010]**.\n\n701.\n\nIn the evidence before it, the Tribunal takes note of several aspects of the conduct of Claimant by reference to the testimony of its witness, Mr. Swarthout:\n\n1) In 2011, Mr. Swarthout and Claimant, in its Interim Financial Statement and its Annual Report, did not include or otherwise inform its investors regarding any loss in the Corani Project due to what happened to its Santa Ana Project.1052\n\n2) After protests subsided on June 27, 2011, Mr. Swarthout indicated that he did not see the Corani Project as being affected by the protests or the governmental measures.1053\n\n3) In his 2nd Witness Statement, Mr. Swarthout testifies that clearly there were significant losses in the Corani Project due to what happened to the Santa Ana Project.1054\n\n4) In reply to a question regarding the fact that Claimant had not disclosed to the market that it suffered losses at Corani, Mr. Swarthout claimed that he told unnamed stock analysts during an undated phone call that actions at Santa Ana harmed Corani.1055\n\n*Bear Creek Mining Corporation Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, Second Quarter ended June 30, 2011,* August 15, 2011 **[BR-12]** ; Bear Creek Mining 2011 Annual Report **[R-188]** ; Tr. 507 - 511 (*confirming* exhibits BR-12 and R-188).\n\nTr. 516 - 518 (Swarthout); Transcript of Bear Creek Mining Corporation Special Call (6/27/2011) **[R-186]**.\n\nSwarthout Second Statement \u00b6\u00b6 43 - 58 **[CWS-6]**.\n\nTr. 524 - 526 (Swarthout).\n\n702.\n\nThe Tribunal considers Mr. Swarthout\u2019s testimony to be contradictory and not providing adequate proof of causation for any losses in the Corani Project due to Respondent\u2019s breach of the FTA with regard to the Santa Ana Project.\n\n703.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal has been unable to find any compelling evidence before it in the FTI expert reports as regards the required causation. Therefore, there is no need to examine the submissions by Claimant or FTI regarding the quantification of any loss to the Corani Project.\n\n704.\n\nSince Claimant has failed to provide sufficient proof of causation of any losses in the Corani Project due to Respondent\u2019s breach of the FTA with regard to the Santa Ana Project, the Tribunal concludes that the claim must be dismissed.\n\n**XI. INTEREST**\n----------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANT'S ARGUMENTS**\n---------------------------\n\n705.\n\nClaimant requests an award of post-award interest, until the date Respondent pays in full, at the highest possible lawful rate, such as Respondent\u2019s borrowing rate. Respondent\u2019s failure to pay compensation to Claimant is effectively a loan to Respondent. Hence, Claimant should be compensated like any other lender to Respondent during this period and should receive interest at a rate equivalent to Respondent\u2019s external cost of debt financing from private lenders.1056\n\nC-I \u00b6 247.\n\n706.\n\nInternational law - as confirmed by decisions of investment arbitration tribunals - recognizes that compound interest is the generally accepted standard in international investment arbitrations.1057 Several reasons have been suggested for requiring an award of compound interest, including that it aids in making the injured claimant whole, prevents unjust enrichment, and promotes and efficiency.1058\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 248 - 253; Siemens Award \u00b6 399 **[CL-0031]** ; Middle East Cement Award \u00b6 174 **[CL-0037]** ; Vivendi II Award \u00b6 9.2.6 **[CL-0038]** ; Tecmed Award \u00b6 196 **[CL-0040]** ; ADC Award \u00b6 522 **[CL-0060]** ; Azurix Award \u00b6 440 **[CL-0082]** ; MTD Award \u00b6 251 **[CL-0083]** ; PSEG Award \u00b6 348 **[CL-0088]** ; Metalclad Award \u00b6 128 **[CL-0105]** ; S.D.

The Parties dispute the rate at which such interest would be calculated.1059\n\nC-II \u00b6 498.\n\n708.\n\nThe FTA requires that interest be based on a commercial rate.1060 Thus, the Tribunal should reject Respondent\u2019s argument that interest should be at the borrowing rate of 0.65% or the risk-free rate of 0.16%, because neither is commercial. The risk-free rate is not a commercial rate because Respondent could not borrow and Claimant would not lend at that rate.1061 Respondent\u2019s proposed borrowing rate - derived from adding to the interest rate on a one-month US Treasury bill to the sovereign spread on Peruvian certificates of deposit with a one-year maturity - does not accurately represent Respondent\u2019s cost of borrowing.1062 The Peruvian Ministry of Economics and Finance calculates the country\u2019s emerging market bond index spread to be 2.0% and its coupon rates and bond rates on US$-denominated debt were 9.9% and 6.0%, respectively.1063 FTI, however, concludes that Respondent\u2019s likely borrowing rate was in the range of 5.1% (the weighted yield to maturity at the expropriation date) and 5.6% (the coupon rate of the most recently issued bond). Accordingly, the Tribunal should reject Brattle\u2019s proposed rate of 0.65% and adopt FTI\u2019s conservative rate of 5%.1064\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 499.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6\u00b6 498 - 499.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 500; Second FTI Expert Report \u00b6 9.8, Figure 12 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n*Id*.\n\nC-II \u00b6 501; Tr. 1824 - 1825 (C.

RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n710.\n\nIn principle, Respondent agrees with Claimant that the appropriate interest rate is \"*a rate equivalent to Peru\u2019s external cost of debt financing from private lenders*.\"1066 Brattle has calculated the appropriate interest rate using the average spread for Respondent\u2019s sovereign credit default swaps, plus a risk-free rate adjustment. Using this, Brattle arrived at an interest rate of 0.72% annually.1067\n\nR-I \u00b6 402 - 403; R-II \u00b6 688; C-I \u00b6 247.\n\nR-II \u00b6 690; R-I \u00b6 405; Brattle Report \u00b6 196 **[REX-004]** ; Brattle Second Report at \u00b6 289 **[REX-010]**.\n\n711.\n\nClaimant initially applied a rate of 5%, the interest rate for domestic court judgments, as the appropriate rate of interest in this case.1068 In its later submission, Claimant argued that its 5% rate is correct because it is a reflection of Claimant\u2019s cost of borrowing.1069 Claimant\u2019s proposed 5% rate, however, is not equivalent to and is in no way indicative of Respondent\u2019s external cost of debt.1070 Using Claimant\u2019s cost of borrowing is inconsistent with Claimant\u2019s theory of interest (which is based on Respondent\u2019s cost of borrowing) and with Claimant\u2019s instruction to FTI to use a Peruvian Central Bank reference rate.1071\n\nR-I \u00b6 404; FTI First Report at \u00b6 9.3 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 689; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 500 - 501; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 295 **[REX-010]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 688; R-I \u00b6 404; FTI First Report at \u00b6 9.3 **[CEX-001]**.\n\nR-II \u00b6 689; C-II \u00b6\u00b6 500 - 501; Brattle Second Report \u00b6 295 **[REX-010]**.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING**\n-------------------------------\n\n712.\n\nArticle 812.3 of the FTA provides: \"*Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the date of expropriation until date of payment.*\"\n\n713.\n\nRespondent agrees with Claimant that the appropriate commercially reasonable interest rate is \"*a rate equivalent to Peru\u2019s external cost of debt financing from private lenders*.\"1072\n\nR-I \u00b6\u00b6 402 - 403; R-II \u00b6 688; C-I \u00b6 247.\n\n714.\n\nHowever, the Parties disagree regarding the calculation of this rate. The Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent\u2019s argument that interest should be at the borrowing rate of 0.65% per annum or the risk-free rate of 0.16% per annum. Neither of these rates are commercial, because Respondent could not borrow and Claimant would not lend at that rate. Claimant correctly points out that the Peruvian Ministry of Economics and Finance calculates the country\u2019s emerging market bond index spread to be 2.0% per annum and its coupon rates and bond rates on US$-denominated debt were 9.9% and 6.0% per annum, respectively.1073 FTI, however, concludes that Respondent\u2019s likely borrowing rate was in the range of 5.1% (the weighted yield to maturity at the expropriation date) and 5.6% (the coupon rate of the most recently issued bond) per annum. In view of this, the Tribunal agrees that FTI\u2019s conservative rate of 5% per annum1074 is most appropriate in the present case.\n\nC-II \u00b6 500; Second FTI Expert Report \u00b6 9.8, Figure 12 **[CEX-004]**.\n\nSecond FTI Expert Report \u00b6 9.9 **[CEX-004]**.\n\n715.\n\nThe Tribunal also accepts that compound interest is generally accepted in the practice of investment arbitration for any damages awarded.1075\n\n*Siemens* Award \u00b6 399 **[CL-0031]** ; *Middle East Cement* Award \u00b6 174 **[CL-0037]** ; *Vivendi II* Award \u00b6 9.2.6 **[CL-0038]** ; *Tecmed* Award \u00b6 196 **[CL-0040]** ; *ADC* Award \u00b6 522 **[CL-0060]** ; *Azurix* Award \u00b6 440 **[CL-0082]** ; *MTD* Award \u00b6 251 **[CL-0083]** ; *PSEG* Award \u00b6 348 **[CL-0088]** ; *Metalclad* Award \u00b6 128 **[CL-0105]** ; *S.D.

COSTS**\n--------------\n\n717.\n\nSince the filing of their costs submissions, ICSID has requested further deposits from the Parties, and these increase the Parties\u2019 costs. The total costs deposits requested by ICSID amount to US$ 1,249,925.00. Of these, the final calculation of the total of the arbitration costs amount to US$ 1,122,460.54.\n\n**A. CLAIMANT'S ARGUMENTS**\n---------------------------\n\n718.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal award it all of its costs and expenses associated with this arbitration, including attorneys\u2019 fees. But for Respondent\u2019s breach of its obligations under the FTA, Claimant would not have incurred these arbitration costs. Thus, in order to place Claimant in the same position it would have been in the absence of Respondent\u2019s breaches, Claimant should be awarded all costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred herein.1076\n\nC-I \u00b6 246; C-II \u00b6 502; C.Costs-II \u00b6\u00b6 3 - 7.\n\n719.\n\nA full costs award is appropriate, given the reasonableness of Claimant\u2019s costs.1077 Claimant\u2019s costs were necessary for the proper conduct of this case and are reasonable and appropriate given its complex circumstances and duration, as well as the damage that Respondent\u2019s violations of the FTA caused to Claimant\u2019s investment.1078 Claimant also presented its case efficiently by (1) forgoing a document exchange and production phase, (2) agreeing not to bifurcate proceedings, (3) deciding -in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s suggestion - not to call some witnesses for cross examination, and (4) agreeing to a procedure to expedite the examination of the legal, mining, and quantum experts.1079\n\nC.Costs-II \u00b6\u00b6 1, 8 - 9, 12.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 8.\n\n*Id*. at \u00b6 10.\n\n720.\n\nEach Party\u2019s costs are similar, the difference between the two results from the fact that Claimant worked with counsel to build a case and evidentiary record for this proceeding against Respondent.

For example, Claimant\u2019s international counsel ran up additional fees and expenses that exceeded those of Respondent by more than US$ 2.2 million. In addition, Claimant paid its local Peruvian counsel three times as much as did Respondent. Claimant should not be permitted to look to Respondent to mitigate its own overspending.1087\n\n*Id.*\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING**\n-------------------------------\n\n727.\n\nThe FTA provides in Article 841.1: \"*Where a Tribunal makes a final award against the disputing Party, the Tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only: [...] The Tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.*\"\n\n728.\n\nThe applicable arbitration rules are Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. They allow the Tribunal a degree of discretion.1088\n\n*Hrvatska Elektroprivreda d.d. v. Republic of Slovenia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/24, Award, December 17, 2015, \u00b6 598 **[CL-0239]** ; *Pezold v. Republic of Zimbabwe*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15, Award, July 28, 2015, \u00b6 1001 **[CL-0240]**.\n\n729.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the question of how the arbitration costs shall be apportioned between the Parties, because the evaluation of the amounts claimed by a party will only be relevant insofar as the Tribunal finds that a party has to reimburse to the other party some of the costs that party incurred.\n\n730.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal takes into account the following. While Claimant lost its request for provisional measures, Claimant has prevailed regarding jurisdiction, liability, and damages in the sum of US$ 18,237,592. Claimant, however, had claimed damages of an amount of \"*at least US$ 522.2 million.*\" Thus, it only prevailed regarding about 3% of its total claim by value. However, regarding the arbitration costs involved, it has to be noted that this considerable difference is only due to two factors: (1) with respect to the Santa Ana Claim, the Tribunal has not accepted the DCF method of calculation, and (2) the Corani Claim has been dismissed in its entirety. As the submissions of the Parties, the conduct of the hearing, and this Award show, these two issues caused only a very small portion of the work, costs, and time for the Parties and the Tribunal in this procedure. The vast majority of the arbitration costs were caused by the issues on which Respondent did not prevail, and in particular the violation of the FTA by the circumstances in which Supreme Decree 032 was adopted.\n\n731.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, using its discretion for cost decisions in awarding costs, the Tribunal considers that Respondent should bear its own costs and reimburse Claimant for 75% of the reasonable costs it incurred.\n\n732.\n\nNow, the Tribunal will address the question whether or to which extent the arbitration costs claimed by Claimant must be considered reasonable.\n\n733.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent, in its 2nd Cost Submission, has argued as follows:\n\n*Respondent also notes that Claimant\u2019s costs and expenses are high in several respects that would confirm the inappropriateness of requiring Respondent to pay any portion of them. While Claimant (properly) claims only the portion of its international counsel\u2019s fees actually paid by the company ($4.5 million), Claimant\u2019s international counsel apparently ran up actual fees and expenses that exceeded those of Respondent by more than $2.2 million. Likewise, Claimant paid its local Peruvian counsel some three times as much as did Respondent. Claimant should not be permitted to look to Respondent to mitigate its own overspending. [internal footnotes omitted]*\n\n734.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by these objections. The higher fees and expenses for Claimant\u2019s international counsel are not unreasonable, in particular since they had to research and deal with the factual and legal situations of considerable complexity, while Respondent could provide its counsel with such information by using its own resources in its own country. For the same reason, it is understandable that Claimant had to rely to a greater extent on and pay more for its Peruvian counsel. Further, as Claimant points out,1089 it drafted and submitted two more memorials, *i.e.* the Request for Arbitration and the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, that Respondent did not need to prepare.\n\nC-Costs II \u00b6 11.\n\n735.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that the arbitration costs claimed by Claimant are reasonable for the case at hand.\n\n736.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has to bear its own costs of arbitration, and has to reimburse 75% of the arbitration costs requested by Claimant, *i.e.* **US$ 5,986,183.29.**\n\n737.\n\nThe rate of interest found above to be applicable for the damages awarded also has to be applied to this payment for arbitration costs, however only from the date this amount is due, *i.e.* from the date of this Award.\n\n**XIII. DISPOSITIF**\n--------------------\n\n738.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n**1. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims raised.**\n\n**2. Respondent shall pay to Claimant damages amounting to US$ 18,237,592.**\n\n**3. Respondent shall bear its own costs of arbitration and shall reimburse Claimant 75% of Claimant\u2019s arbitration costs,** ***i.e.*** **US$ 5,986,183.29**\n\n**4. Respondent shall pay, on the above amount of damages awarded,** ***i.e.*** **US$ 18,237,592, compound interest at a rate of 5% from the date of publication of Supreme Decree 032,** ***i.e.*** **June 25, 2011, until date of payment.**\n\n**5. Respondent shall pay, on the above amount of arbitration costs awarded, i.e. 5,986,183.29, compound interest at a rate of 5% from the date of this Award.**\n\n**6. All other claims are dismissed.**"}]}
