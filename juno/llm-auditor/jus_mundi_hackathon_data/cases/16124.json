St John's Bay Development Company LLC and Pr\u00f3spera Arbitration Center LLC (collectively, \"**Pr\u00f3spera Group**\" or \"**Claimants**\") on 12 March 2024, in English, together with Exhibits C-91 to C-99 and Legal Authorities CL-8 to CL-28 (\"**Response**\");\n\n\u2022 Mr. Rivkin's statement of 13 March 2024 in English (\"**Statement**\");\n\n\u2022 Respondent's reply of 20 March 2024 submitted in Spanish (\"**Honduras' Reply**\"); and\n\n\u2022 Claimants' reply of 20 March 2024 submitted in English together with Legal Authorities CL-27 and CL-28 (resubmitted) and CL-29 to CL-45 (\"**Pr\u00f3spera's Reply**\").\n\n3.\n\nMoreover, I take note of the fact that the Parties refer to the following instruments in their written submissions: (i) the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**Convention**\"); (ii) the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States (\"**U.S.**\") Free Trade Agreement (\"**CAFTA-DR**\" or \"**Treaty**\"); and (iii) the ICSID Arbitration Rules of July 2022 (\"**Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n4.\n\nBelow, I will summarize the positions of the Parties in **Section II**. Subsequently, I will analyze the Proposal under the applicable rules in **Section III**. Finally, I will issue my recommendation in **Section IV**.\n\n**II. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n5.\n\nHonduras proposes the disqualification of Mr. David Rivkin (a U.S. national) as arbitrator appointed by the Claimants (three U.S. companies) based on three grounds.\n\n6.\n\nFirst, Honduras argues that both the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules prohibit the appointment of arbitrators who are nationals of a party without the agreement of the other party1\u2014 agreement which did not exist in this case:2\n\n- Article 39 of the ICSID Convention imposes a limitation on the constitution of the arbitral tribunal with respect to the nationality of the arbitrators, namely:3\n\n\"The majority of the arbitrators shall be nationals of States other than the Contracting State party to the dispute and the Contracting State whose national is a party to the dispute; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this Article shall not apply if the sole arbitrator or each individual member of the Tribunal has been appointed by agreement of the parties.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n- Similarly, Rule 13(3) prohibits the appointment of arbitrators who are nationals of one of the parties to the dispute absent an agreement between them, by providing that:4\n\n\"A party may not appoint an arbitrator who is a national of the State party to the dispute or the State whose national is a party to the dispute without agreement of the other party.\" (Emphasis added)\n\nProposal, para. 21.\n\nProposal, para. 45.\n\nProposal, para. 19; ICSID Convention, Article 39.\n\nProposal, para. 20; Arbitration Rules, Rule 13(3).\n\n7.\n\nSecond, Honduras rejects Claimants' argument that Article 10.19.4(a) of the CAFTA-DR allegedly contains a waiver by the State of Article 39 of the ICSID Convention or Rule 13(3). Honduras submits that it has not expressed its agreement to Mr. Rivkin's appointment, let alone waived in advance its right to object to his appointment as arbitrator on the ground of nationality.5 According to Honduras, an interpretation of Article 10.19 of the CAFTA-DR in accordance with the rules of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\") shows that there is no waiver by the State.6\n\nProposal, paras. 22 and 45.\n\nProposal, para. 24.\n\n8.\n\nArticle 10.19.4(a) provides that:\n\n\"4. For purposes of Article 39 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7 of Schedule C to the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, and without prejudice to an objection to an arbitrator on a ground other than nationality:\n\n(a) the respondent agrees to the appointment of each individual member of a tribunal established under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n9.\n\nAccording to Honduras, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 19 apply *only* in the specific scenario in which the ICSID Secretary-General must serve as appointing authority for an arbitration under Section B of Chapter Ten of the CAFTA-DR.7 This is because paragraph 2 of Article 10.19 of the CAFTA-DR provides that:8\n\n\"2. The Secretary-General shall serve as appointing authority for an arbitration under this Section.\"\n\nProposal, para. 27.\n\nProposal, para. 27.\n\n10.\n\nBased on a literal interpretation, Article 10.19.4(a) refers exclusively to the appointment of arbitrators by the ICSID Secretary-General; *i.e.*, the respondent State waives its right to object to the appointment of an arbitrator by the Secretary-General on the ground of nationality, provided that there is no majority prohibited by Article 39 of the ICSID Convention. However, this does not entail a waiver of the right to object to the appointment of an arbitrator *by the claimant party.*9\n\nProposal, para. 34.\n\n11.\n\nA systematic interpretation of Section B of the Treaty supports the literal interpretation. Indeed, Article 10.19 of the CAFTA-DR follows:10\n\n- Article 10.16, which deals with the submission of a claim to arbitration and sets forth claimant's obligation to provide the name of the arbitrator appointed by it;\n\n- Article 10.17, which addresses the consent of each party to arbitration; and\n\n- Article 10.18, which refers to the conditions and limitations on consent of each party.\n\nProposal, paras. 38-43.\n\n12.\n\nThis sequential arrangement confirms that Article 10.19 refers *only* to the procedural scenario in which, in the event that one of the parties fails to appoint an arbitrator or there is no agreement between them, the Secretary-General is to act as the appointing authority for arbitrators not yet appointed.\n\n13.\n\nFinally, Honduras notes that failure to comply with the nationality requirement could result in the annulment of the award for improper constitution of the tribunal. It is worth taking into account that this arbitration addresses one of the most substantial disputes in investment arbitration and is also a case that is widely known and awaited by the Honduran population.11\n\nProposal, para. 46.\n\n14.\n\nIn sum, Honduras argues that the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the CAFTA-DR unequivocally prohibit one of the parties from appointing an arbitrator having the same nationality as that State, unless there is an agreement between the parties\u2014which there was not in the present case; therefore, Mr. Rivkin should be disqualified from serving as arbitrator.\n\n**2. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n15.\n\nClaimants consider that the Respondent has consented to Mr. Rivkin's appointment and that the Proposal should thus be dismissed.\n\n16.\n\nFirst, Claimants allege that the Proposal lacks merit. An arbitrator may only be disqualified for a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14 of the ICSID Convention, or for ineligibility under Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention. Respondent has not alleged that Mr. Rivkin lacks independence, or any other qualities required by Article 14.12\n\nResponse, para. 12.\n\n17.\n\nSecond, Respondent misinterprets the scope and meaning of Article 39 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 13(3). Nothing in Article 39 of the ICSID Convention prohibits a single arbitrator on a three-member tribunal from having the same nationality as one of the parties; the provision merely requires that a *majority* of the arbitrators (*i.e.*, two out of three) shall be from a third State.13 Similarly, nothing in Arbitration Rule 13 absolutely prohibits a single arbitrator on a three-member tribunal from having the same nationality as the parties.14\n\nResponse, paras. 17-18; Pr\u00f3spera's Reply, para. 14.\n\nResponse, para. 25.\n\n18.\n\nFurthermore, the nationality limitation ser forth in Article 39 of the ICSID Convention and in Rule 13 does not apply where there is an agreement between the parties to the contrary. Article 10.19.4(a) of the CAFTA-DR contains precisely such an agreement by Honduras.15 A good faith interpretation of this Article, in accordance with its ordinary meaning, context, object and purpose (pursuant to the VCLT16), demonstrates that Honduras provided advance consent to the appointment of national arbitrators and waived any objection to an arbitrator on the ground of nationality.17\n\nResponse, para. 27.\n\nResponse, para. 15.\n\nResponse, para. 29.\n\n19.\n\nNumerous ICSID Member States have interpreted Article 39 as allowing pre-agreements to the appointment of national arbitrators (*i.e.*, without requiring an agreement on the identity of particular arbitrators), including the ICSID Member States parties to CAFTA-DR, the North America Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\") and its successor treaty, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"**USMCA**\"), and other treaties with provisions similar to Article 10.19.4.18\n\nPr\u00f3spera's Reply, para. 18.\n\n20.\n\nThird, Article 32 of the VCLT provides that, to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal may rely on \"supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.\"19 Similarly, the Tribunal may look at the preparatory work of other treaties with identical provisions.20\n\nResponse, para. 34.\n\nResponse, para. 34, citing CL-13, *LaGrand Case*.\n\n21.\n\nThe publicly available *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the CAFTA-DR shed little light on the object and purpose of Article 10.19.4 However, the Tribunal can rely on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of Article 1125(a) of the NAFTA, which Article 10.19.4 of the CAFTA-DR replicates verbatim.21\n\nResponse, para. 35.\n\n22.\n\nThe negotiation history of Article 1125 of the NAFTA demonstrates that its object and purpose was to ensure that parties would be allowed to appoint their own nationals in ICSID arbitrations.22 Likewise, the ICSID Secretary-General has recognized that Article 1125 circumvents nationality limitations in the ICSID Convention.23\n\nResponse, para. 36.\n\nResponse, para. 37, citing CL-16.\n\n23.\n\nIn Claimants' view, if this were not the case, and the parties to an arbitration still needed to agree to the appointment of every specific individual arbitrator on the tribunal, Article 10.19.4 and similar provisions would have no *effet utile*.24 This would also imply that close to 60 ICSID Member States parties to the NAFTA, the CAFTA-DR and many other treaties containing provisions similar to Article 1125 of the NAFTA and Article 10.19.4 have misinterpreted Article 39.25\n\nPr\u00f3spera's Reply, para. 20.\n\nPr\u00f3spera's Reply, paras. 21, 30.\n\n24.\n\nMoreover, a decision to the contrary would be a devastating precedent. Finding that Article 10.19.4 and all similar provisions run afoul of Article 39 would mean that arbitrator appointments in dozens of cases could be called into question.26\n\nPr\u00f3spera's Reply, para. 30.\n\n25.\n\nFourth, Claimants assert that nothing in Article 10.19 refers to two distinct moments of procedure.27 Article 10.19.4 does not refer to paragraphs 10.19.2 and 10.19.3 and is not subjected to them, or otherwise suggests that the agreement in Article 10.19.4 applies only to arbitrators appointed by the ICSID Secretary-General.28 Thus, the provisions of Article 10.19.4(a) of the CAFTA-DR also apply to arbitrators appointed by the parties and not just to arbitrators appointed by the Secretary-General, as alleged by Respondent.\n\nResponse, para. 51.\n\nResponse, para. 51.\n\n26.\n\nFifth, Claimants argue that Respondent could easily have cured any perceived unfairness had it simply appointed an arbitrator having its own nationality, as has occurred in several ICSID cases. Respondent had the opportunity to participate in the constitution of the Tribunal but refused to do so.29\n\nResponse, para. 63.\n\n27.\n\nSixth, Honduras has submitted no authorities to support its arguments; such arguments are contrary to a significant volume of authoritative source, as well as the consistent practice of both investors and respondent States in ICSID arbitrations.30\n\nResponse, paras. 6, 44, 45.\n\n28.\n\nFinally, Respondent does not question Mr. Rivkin's competence to serve as arbitrator;31 on the contrary, it requests his disqualification resorting to arguments such as the potential impact of the arbitration on the Honduran population,32 which shows that the Respondent's real intention is to politicize, distract and paralyze the proceedings by means of wholly irrelevant matters.33\n\nProposal, para. 48.\n\nProposal, para. 46.\n\nResponse, paras. 70, 77.\n\n**3. Respondent's Reply**\n-------------------------\n\n29.\n\nIn response to Claimants' arguments, Respondent adds several arguments.\n\n30.\n\nFirst, Respondent states that it has not clearly and unequivocally waived the provisions of ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(3). Even assuming that there was a waiver of the nationality requirement of Article 39 of the ICSID Convention, this would not imply an *ipso facto* waiver of the nationality requirement under the ICSID Arbitration Rules.34\n\nHonduras' Reply, para. 14.\n\n31.\n\nRespondent notes that Article 10.19.4 refers exclusively to the majority rule of Article 39 of the ICSID Convention. Therefore, it does not extend to ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(3).35\n\nHonduras' Reply, paras. 8, 10.\n\n32.\n\nMoreover, Rule 13(3) does not contain an express reference to Article 39 of the ICSID Convention and, thus, it cannot be inferred that, by making a statement for the purposes of Article 39 of the Convention, a statement for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 13(3) is being made.36\n\nHonduras' Reply, para. 15.\n\n33.\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that the appointments of nationals by Guatemala under the CAFTA-DR, as mentioned by Claimants, do not constitute subsequent practice in the application of the Treaty.37 The commentaries to the VCLT state that what should be considered is not the subsequent practice of a single party to the treaty; instead, what should be examined is the subsequent practice in the application of the treaty by all parties or the acceptance of such practice by all parties, which is not the case here.38\n\nHonduras' Reply, paras. 21-26.\n\nHonduras' Reply, para. 23.\n\n34.\n\nThird, Honduras alleges that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the NAFTA cannot serve as preparatory works of the CAFTA-DR for the purposes of Article 32 of the VCLT, since Mexico's and Canada's intent or understanding cannot be transferred to the CAFTA-DR.39 As the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has pointed out, the interpretation of similar provisions in different treaties may not yield the same results. Furthermore, the NAFTA's text of is not identical to the CAFTA-DR's text.40\n\nHonduras' Reply, para. 27.\n\nHonduras' Reply, paras. 30-31.\n\n35.\n\nFourth, Respondent argues that, in any event, Article 1125 of the NAFTA does not constitute a waiver of the provisions of Article 39 of the ICSID Convention. According to Prof. Schreuer, although Article 1125 of the NAFTA \"attempts to preserve the right to appoint national arbitrators,\"41\n\n\"[...] [t]his provision simply provides for the appointment of each arbitrator by agreement. It neither constitutes nor makes superfluous a specific agreement on each arbitrator under Art. 39 of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\nHonduras' Reply, paras. 38-39.\n\n36.\n\nIn conclusion, Respondent submits that Article 10.19.4(a) cannot be considered a clear and unequivocal waiver of the prohibition from appointing nationals of the other party as arbitrators because a proper interpretation of the terms of the Treaty leads to the conclusion that its content only extends to the majority rule of Article 39 of the ICSID Convention and never to Rule 13(3).42\n\nHonduras' Reply, para. 40.\n\n**4. Mr. Rivkin's Statement**\n-----------------------------\n\n37.\n\nOn 13 March 2024, Mr. Rivkin provided the following Statement:\n\n\"In response to the Proposal for Disqualification submitted by the Republic of Honduras, I simply confirm that I am a US national. I also confirm that I remain independent and impartial and that, if the Proposal is rejected, I will judge the case fairly based on the facts and law presented.\"\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n38.\n\nArticle 10.19 of the CAFTA:43\n\n\"**Article 10.19: Selection of Arbitrators**\n\n1. Unless the disputing parties otherwise agree, the tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each of the disputing parties and the third, who shall be the presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the disputing parties.\n\n2. The Secretary-General shall serve as appointing authority for an arbitration under this Section.\n\n3. If a tribunal has not been constituted within 75 days from the date that a claim is submitted to arbitration under this Section, the Secretary-General, on the request of a disputing party, shall appoint, in his or her discretion, the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed.\n\n4. For purposes of Article 39 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7 of Schedule C to the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, and without prejudice to an objection to an arbitrator on a ground other than nationality:\n\n(a) the respondent agrees to the appointment of each individual member of a tribunal established under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules;\n\n(b) a claimant referred to in Article 10.16.1(a) may submit a claim to arbitration under this Section, or continue a claim, under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, only on condition that the claimant agrees in writing to the appointment of each individual member of the tribunal; and\n\n(c) a claimant referred to in Article 10.16.1(b) may submit a claim to arbitration under this Section, or continue a claim, under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, only on condition that the claimant and the enterprise agree in writing to the appointment of each individual member of the tribunal.\"\n\nCL-2, Article 10.19.\n\n39.\n\nArticle 39 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"The majority of the arbitrators shall be nationals of States other than the Contracting State party to the dispute and the Contracting State whose national is a party to the dispute; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this Article shall not apply if the sole arbitrator or each individual member of the Tribunal has been appointed by agreement of the parties.\"\n\n40.\n\nArbitration Rule 13:\n\n\"**General Provisions Regarding the Establishment of the Tribunal**\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall be constituted without delay after registration of the Request for arbitration.\n\n(2) The majority of the arbitrators on a Tribunal shall be nationals of States other than the State party to the dispute and the State whose national is a party to the dispute, unless the Sole Arbitrator or each individual member of the Tribunal is appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n(3) A party may not appoint an arbitrator who is a national of the State party to the dispute or the State whose national is a party to the dispute without agreement of the other party.\n\n(4) A person previously involved in the resolution of the dispute as a conciliator, judge, mediator or in a similar capacity may be appointed as an arbitrator only by agreement of the parties.\"\n\n**IV. RECOMMENDATION**\n----------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe issue under discussion is ultimately whether there was agreement between the parties to the arbitration so that there would be no obstacle to the appointment of an arbitrator of the nationality of one or the other, even in the absence of an explicit expression of such agreement (in this case on the part of the Respondent).\n\n42.\n\nIndeed, a reading of the relevant provisions of the various legal instruments cited above as interpreted according to the principle codified at Articles 31 and 32 (VCLT) shows that the rule of principle is as follows: the *majority* of the tribunal must be composed of nationals of States other than those of the States directly concerned (*i.e.*, on the one hand, the State directly party to the dispute and, on the other hand, the State whose national is itself the other party to the same dispute).\n\n43.\n\nThis principle is to be identically found in Article 10.19 of CAFTA, Article 39 ICSID and ICSID Arbitration Rule 13. However, each of these provisions also establishes the possibility of derogating from the said principle by agreement between the parties.\n\n44.\n\nHonduras, the host State of the investment, considers that it has not given such an agreement, whereas the claimant takes the opposite position. On the face of it, this might seem to be the end of the matter, as it is usually difficult, unless effectively demonstrated, to claim that a sovereign State has given an approval that it itself says does not exist.\n\n45.\n\nHowever, here, matters are more complex, primarily for two factual reasons which should be stressed at the outset: not only (a) was such disagreement not explicitly expressed by Honduras, but even more (b) Honduras itself refused to take part in the procedure for appointing the Tribunal44, without later explaining in its Proposal the reason for this abstention.\n\nResponse, para. 63.\n\n46.\n\nSuch an attitude might in itself be justified if it were self-evident that a State's agreement could never be assumed in the absence of its specific consent to the issue in question. However, this is not necessarily the case. In the present one, in a procedure based on the application of CAFTA, ordinarily interpreted in the light of the earlier application of NAFTA (as the latter was its model), Honduras' non-participation could mean that this State did not deem it necessary to express its will in this regard, thereby giving rise to the presumption that silence is equivalent to consent.\n\n47.\n\nIndeed, the mere well-known connection of CAFTA with NAFTA should have raised particular diligence on the part of the host State, given the interpretation that has been given to this treaty including its Article 1125 (which deals with the composition of an arbitral tribunal with regard to the nationality of its members).\n\n48.\n\nAs a matter of fact, as rightly stated by the Claimant, quite a large number of ICSID Members, including CAFTA Members have interpreted CAFTA Article 10.19.4 as allowing pre-agreement to the appointment of national arbitrators without requiring any specification on the identity of particular arbitrators45. This is \"relevant practice\" in the (large) sense in which this element of interpretation is mentioned at VCLT Article 31.3 as it may be meaningfully \"related to the possibility of achieving its object and purpose\"46.\n\nPr\u00f3spera's Reply, para. 18.\n\nSee Georg Nolte, *Treaties and their Practice-Symptoms of their Rise or Decline,* The Hague Academy of International Law, pocketbook form, Brill/Nijhoff, 2018, at 20.\n\n49.\n\nAs demonstrated by the negotiation history of NAFTA article 1125 of which CAFTA Article 10.19.4 retake the words, the purpose of this provision was to make it possible for one of the Parties to a litigation to appoint one of its nationals in ICSID arbitration47, an interpretation which is reinforced by that of qualified commentators48. The opinion of the present author is that, as rightly stated by the Claimant, Article 10.19.4(a) of the CAFTA-DR does contain an agreement by Honduras to set aside the nationality limitation set forth in Article 39 of the ICSID Convention.49\n\nResponse, para. 36.\n\nResponse, para. 37, citing CL-16: Meg Kinnear, Andrea Kay Bjorklund, et al., Article 1125 \u2013 Agreement to Appointment of Arbitrator, INVESTMENT DISPUTES UNDER NAFTA: AN ANNOTATED GUIDE TO NAFTA CHAPTER 11, Supplement No. 1 (June 2006) (CL-16) pp. 1125-2-1125-3.\n\nResponse, para. 27.\n\n50.\n\nAs for the argument developed by the Respondent according to which Article 10.19. 4 refers to two distinct moments of the procedure, it seems hard to find in this provision any suggestion that such an interpretation of this provision is to be retained. Article 10.19.4 does not refer to paragraphs 10.19.2 and 10.19.3 and is not subjected to them. The position of the present author, including in taking due account of its textual context, is that the agreement in Article 10.19.4 does not apply only to arbitrators appointed by the ICSID Secretary-General.50 It does also apply to arbitrators appointed by the parties.\n\nResponse, para. 51.\n\n51.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing considerations, it is the recommendation of this author that the Application of Honduras should not be granted and that, on the contrary, the option chosen by the Claimant should be accepted as being in accordance with the treaty bases on which the composition of the Tribunal was established.\n\n29 uly 2024"}, {"Title": "Decision of the Chair of the Administrative Council Dismissing Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification of David W.

However, in this preliminary phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal's sole task is to determine whether Claimants were required to exhaust local remedies in Honduras before bringing their claims to ICSID. This is a technical legal question that has already been extensively addressed and debated by the Parties \u2013 assisted by highly-qualified counsel with significant expertise in the field \u2013 through over 200 pages of written submissions and during the hearing held in December 2024. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not find that the submissions the petitioners request to make8 \"would assist [it] to determine a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the parties\"9.\n\nFree Cities submits that it is \"uniquely positioned to assist the Tribunal by offering context-specific expertise on: The governance principles underpinning Pr\u00f3spera ZEDE; The broader implications of Honduras' actions on the viability of similar autonomous zones globally; and The importance of honoring government commitments to foster international investment and uphold the rule of law\" (Section 4 of its petition).  \nThe Practitioners assert that they \"are uniquely positioned to assist the Tribunal through: Analysis of legal stability frameworks and their role in investment protection; Empirical evidence regarding economic development impacts; and Expert perspective on international investment protection standards\" (Section 4 of their petition). The Tribunal tends to think that such assistance would fall outside the narrow scope of this preliminary phase.  \nInfinita, \"wishes to make brief and specific contributions to the legal discussion that motivates the preliminary objection\", namely regarding (i) \"the legal nature of the declaration made by the Republic of Honduras in Legislative Decree 41-88\", (ii) \"how [such declaration] cannot affect a conventional provision contained in an international treaty\", (iii) \"the implications of the authorization given by the Republic of Honduras to investors to file actions in ICSID under Legislative Decree 51-2011, and (iv) \"the shift in narrative that the Republic of Honduras has maintained regarding what it now identifies as a Declaration\" (Section iv of its petition). These issues, however, have already been addressed by the Parties in the arbitration, and Infinita has failed to demonstrate why it would be able to provide knowledge or insight that is different from that of the Parties.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 67(2).\n\n6.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal denies the petitions from Free Cities, Infinita and the Practitioners to file written submissions as *amici curiae*.

The Tribunal is composed of Prof. Dr. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, a national of the Kingdom of Spain, as President, appointed by the Secretary-General; Mr. David W. Rivkin, a national of the United States of America, appointed by Claimants; and Prof. Ra\u00fal E. Vinuesa, a national of Argentina and the Kingdom of Spain, appointed by the Secretary-General.\n\n9.\n\nOn 19 February 2024 Respondent filed a proposal for disqualification and the proceeding was suspended. Further to written submissions by the Parties, the proposal for disqualification was declined by the Chair of the Administrative Council and the proceeding was resumed on 7 August 2024.\n\n10.\n\nOn 30 August 2024 Respondent filed the Preliminary Objection under Article 10.20.5 of CAFTA-DR [also referred to as \"**R Objection I**\"].\n\n11.\n\nOn 4 September 2024 the Tribunal confirmed receipt of the Preliminary Objection and suspended the proceeding on the merits pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of CAFTA-DR.\n\n12.\n\nOn 9 September 2024 the Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 [\"**PO1**\"] providing for the rules to govern the preliminary phase of the arbitration [the \"**Preliminary Phase**\"]. The Tribunal noted that if the case continued after the Preliminary Phase, a further procedural order would be issued for the remainder of the proceedings. Finally, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer regarding the items contained in the draft order and to inform the Tribunal of their agreements and/or positions.\n\n13.\n\nOn 19 September 2024 the Tribunal issued PO1, holding that the Preliminary Phase would be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 1 July 2022 [the \"**ICSID Rules**\"], except to the extent modified and/or supplemented by CAFTA-DR.\n\n14.\n\nOn 26 September 2024 Claimants filed observations on Respondent's Preliminary Objection [\"**C Objection I\"**].\n\n15.\n\nOn 25 October 2024 Respondent filed a reply on the Preliminary Objection [\"**R Objection II**\"].\n\n16.\n\nOn 25 November 2024 Claimants filed a rejoinder on the Preliminary Objection [\"**C Objection II**\"].\n\n17.\n\nOn 6 December 2024 the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by video conference to discuss any outstanding procedural, administrative, and logistical matters in preparation for the hearing on preliminary objections [the \"**Hearing**\"].\n\n18.\n\nOn 10 December 2024 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the organization of the Hearing.\n\n19.\n\nOn 15 December 2024 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning applications to intervene by *amicus curiae* in accordance with Article 10.20.3 of CAFTA-DR and ICSID Rule 67.\n\n20.\n\nThe Hearing was held remotely on 16 December 2024, with the following participants:\n\n*Tribunal*:\n\nProf. Prof. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto President   \nMr. David W.

BACKGROUND**\n-------------------\n\n26.\n\nGiven that the present dispute concerns exhaustion of local remedies, the Tribunal will begin by presenting this requirement under international law (**1.**). Subsequently, it will summarize Honduras' conduct regarding exhaustion of local remedies over the past three decades (**2.**). Then, the Tribunal will review Honduras' approval and ratification of CAFTA-DR in the mid-2000s (**3.**), before addressing Claimants' alleged investments under the ZEDE Legal Framework starting in late 2010s (**4.**) and the parliamentary and judicial actions taken in Honduras against such framework since 2022 (**5.**). Finally, the Tribunal will describe the steps taken by Claimants to initiate these proceedings (**6.**).\n\n**1. Exhaustion of local remedies as a requirement under international law**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1.1 Origins and implementation of the exhaustion of local remedies requirement**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe exhaustion of local remedies requirement stems from the customary international law principle that, prior to bringing an international claim, foreign nationals must have first resorted to the host State's legal remedies to obtain redress4.\n\nDoc. **CL-84**, *Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2, Award, dated 20 September 2021 [\"***Lion***\"], para. 543.\n\n28.\n\nThis principle of customary international law was developed in the context of diplomatic protection in the *Interhandel*5 and *ELSI*6 cases. In *Interhandel*, the International Court of Justice stated that\n\n\"The rule that local remedies must be exhausted before international proceedings may be instituted is a well-established rule of customary international law [\u2026] Before resort may be had to an international court [\u2026] it has been considered necessary that the State where the violation occurred should have an opportunity to redress it by its own means, within the framework of its own domestic legal system\"7.\n\nDoc. **RL-1,** *Switzerland v. United States of America*, Judgment, I.C.J. Rep. 1959, dated 21 March 1959. [\"***Interhandel***\"].\n\nDoc. **RL-4**, *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A*., Judgment, I.C.J. Rep. 1989, dated 20 July 1989 [\"***ELSI***\"].\n\nDoc. **RL-1**, *Interhandel,* p. 27.\n\n29.\n\nHowever, the ICSID Convention reverses the traditional customary international law requirement of exhaustion of local remedies by enacting Article 26, which provides that\n\n\"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention\"8.\n\nDoc. **RL-9**, ICSID Convention, Art. 26.\n\n30.\n\nThus, under Article 26 of the Convention, the Contracting States waive the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies, \"unless otherwise stated\"9.\n\nDoc. **RL-9**, ICSID Convention, Art. 26; Doc. **RL-56**, S. Schill et al., \"Article 26\" in *Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention* (2022), para. 298.\n\n31.\n\nAccording to Professor Schreuer, there are various alternatives for a State which wishes to reinstate the requirement to exhaust local remedies:\n\n- it may do so by inserting a condition in a treaty offering consent to ICSID arbitration;\n\n- alternatively, it may do so in national legislation providing for ICSID arbitration; or finally\n\n- in a contract with an ICSID arbitration clause10.\n\nDoc. **RL-56**, S. Schill et al., \"Article 26\" in *Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention* (2022), para. 302. This was also the tribunal's view in *Lanco v. Argentina*: \"A State may require the exhaustion of domestic remedies as a prior condition for its consent to ICSID arbitration. This demand may be made (i) in a bilateral investment treaty that offers submission to ICSID arbitration, (ii) in domestic legislation, or (iii) in a direct investment agreement that contains an ICSID clause\"; *see also* Doc. **RL-7**, *Lanco International Inc. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6, Preliminary Decision: Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, 8 December 1998, para. 39.\n\n32.\n\nDespite the foregoing, ICSID Contracting States have generally shied away from requiring exhaustion of local remedies. ICSID reports that only Israel, Costa Rica and Guatemala (but not Honduras) have notified the Centre that their consent to its jurisdiction is conditioned on the exhaustion of local remedies by the claimant11.\n\nDoc. **R-55**, ICSID/8-D, p. 10. Israel withdrew its notification (which dated from 1983) by a communication to the Centre in 1991; Costa Rica notified the Centre in 1993 that \"[t]here may only be recourse to arbitration pursuant to [the Convention] where all existing administrative or judicial remedies have been exhausted\"; Guatemala notified the Centre in 1993 that \"the Republic of Guatemala will require the exhaustion of local administrative remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under the Convention\". As discussed below, Honduras does not appear to have sent any notification to ICSID in this regard.\n\n33.\n\nSimilarly, States have been traditionally reluctant to incorporate a requirement to exhaust local remedies in BITs. Pursuant to a study from 1997, out of the 220 BITs concluded in the 1980s, only three required the exhaustion of local remedies. Likewise, out of the 409 BITs executed between 1990 and 1997, only five required such exhaustion12.\n\nDoc. **CL-93**, Paul Peters, Exhaustion of Local Remedies: Ignored in Most Bilateral Investment Treaties, in 44 Netherlands International Law Review 233 (1997), pp. 233-234. In a more recent paper, the International Institute for Sustainable Development noted that \"very few agreements in the universe of over 3,000 bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and treaties with investment provisions (TIPs) expressly require ELR. It only appears in some first-generation BITs and in more recent BITs concluded by Argentina, Romania, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay, among others\" (IISD Best Practices Series:  \nExhaustion of Local Remedies in International Investment Law, 2017, Section 3.1, https://www.iisd.org/system/files/publications/best-practices-exhaustion-local-remedies-law-investment-en.pdf).\n\n34.\n\nIn a number of cases, State parties to ICSID proceedings have raised the principle of exhaustion of local remedies as a jurisdictional requirement. Professor Schreuer, however, highlights that, up to 2022, these challenges have \"never\" been successful13.\n\nDoc. **RL-56**, S. Schill et al., \"Article 26\" in *Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention* (2022), para. 329.\n\n**1.2 Content of the exhaustion of local remedies requirement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe exhaustion of local remedies principle requires that,\n\n\"before a claim for the violation of the rights of an individual or a corporation can be pursued against a State through international procedures, that individual or corporation must first have recourse to all means of redress available under the domestic law of the State concerned\"14.\n\nDoc. **RL-56**, S. Schill et al., \"Article 26\" in *Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention* (2022), para. 297.\n\n36.\n\nThe remedies available to an alien that must be exhausted before resorting to arbitration will inevitably vary from State to State. It is clear, however, that the foreign national must exhaust all judicial remedies available under the domestic law of the host State, including recourse to the highest municipal court, if the circumstances of the case authorize such recourse15. Similarly, an alien is required to exhaust all administrative remedies that may lead to a binding decision16.\n\nDoc. **RL-31**, United Nations General Assembly, Commentary on the Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, U.N. Doc. A/61/10, p. 48.\n\nDoc. **RL-31**, United Nations General Assembly, Commentary on the Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, U.N. Doc. A/61/10, p. 48.\n\n**1.3 Exception of obvious futility**\n-------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nTribunals have recognized an exception to this requirement: \"an alien cannot be required to take a measure or lodge an appeal which will not remedy the international wrong\"17.\n\nDoc. **CL-84**, *Lion*, para. 554; *see also* Doc. **CL-47**, *Finnish shipowners against Great Britain in respect of the use of certain Finnish vessels during the war (Finland v. Great Britain)*, 3 UNRIIA 1481, Award, dated 9 May 1934 [\"***Finnish Vessels***\"], p. 1494.\n\n38.\n\nProfessor Amerasinghe describes this exception as follows:\n\n\"The test of obvious futility clearly requires more than the probability of failure or the improbability of success, but perhaps less than the absolute certainty of failure. The test may be said to require evidence from which it could reasonably be concluded that the remedy would be ineffective\"18.\n\nDoc. **CL-84**, *Lion*, para. 554 (*citing* C. F. Amerasinghe, \"Local Remedies in International Law\", Cambridge, 2004, p. 206).\n\n39.\n\nThe International Law Commission [the \"**ILC**\"] has recorded this exception in its Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection:\n\n\"Article 15. Exceptions to the local remedies rule Local remedies do not need to be exhausted where:\n\n(a) There are no reasonably available local remedies to provide effective redress, or the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of such redress\"19.\n\nDoc. **CL-65**, ILC Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Art. 15.\n\n40.\n\nThe tribunal in *Lion* interpreted Article 15 of the ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection and found that the exhaustion rule is subject to two prongs:\n\n\"[\u2026] an aggrieved alien is only required to pursue remedies\n\n- Which are reasonably available, and\n\n- Which have an expectation that they will be effective, *i.e.* the measure or appeal has a reasonable prospect of [redressing claimant's injuries]\"20.\n\nDoc. **CL-84**, *Lion*, para. 562.\n\nReasonable availability\n-----------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe tribunal in *Lion* defined the \"reasonable availability\" prong of the obvious futility test as follows:\n\n\"The first facet of the exhaustion rule is that the aggrieved alien must launch all remedies, which are not extravagant, and take them to the highest judicial instance in the land\"21.\n\nDoc. **CL-84**, *Lion*, para. 563.\n\n42.\n\nThe burden on the claimant is not to pursue all possible remedies, but only those which are reasonably available22. In the words of Professor Amerasinghe:\n\n\"An aggrieved alien is bound only to exhaust those remedies that are available to him. The requirement thus postulated has been described in terms of accessibility\"23.\n\nDoc. **CL-84**, *Lion*, para. 564.\n\nDoc. **CL-84**, *Lion*, para. 565 (*citing* C. F. Amerasinghe, \"Local Remedies in International Law\", Cambridge, 2004, p. 206).\n\n43.\n\nIn its Commentary to the ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, the ILC recalls that the \"reasonable availability\" test is supported by judicial decisions that considered that remedies need not be exhausted when:\n\n\"the domestic court does not have jurisdiction to hear the dispute in question, when the domestic legislation justifying the acts challenged by the alien are not subject to judicial review by the domestic courts, when the domestic courts are notoriously lacking in independence, when consistent and well-established case law is contrary to the alien, when the domestic courts do not offer the alien an avenue appropriate and sufficient remedy or when the respondent State does not have an adequate system of judicial protection\"24.\n\nDoc. **RL-31**, United Nations General Assembly, Commentary on the Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, U.N. Doc. A/61/10, pp. 51-52.\n\nEffectiveness\n-------------\n\n44.\n\nThe tribunal in *Lion* found that the \"effectiveness\" prong of the obvious futility test provides that \"[t]he aggrieved alien is not under an obligation to resort to an appeal which, although available, was obviously futile\"25.\n\nDoc. **CL-84**, *Lion*, para. 567.\n\n45.\n\nThe seminal case establishing this exception was the 1934 *Finnish Vessels* decision, which held that a claimant is not obliged to resort to an appeal, provided that such remedy was \"obviously futile\"26. In the specific case the arbitrator found that where the finding of fact by a lower instance court was final, and the success of the claimant's case depended on a different finding of fact, an appeal to a higher Court was obviously futile27.\n\nDoc. **CL-47,** *Finnish Vessels*, p. 1504.\n\nDoc. **CL-47,** *Finnish Vessels*, p. 1543.\n\n46.\n\nJudge Lauterpacht defined the criterion as there being a \"reasonable possibility\" that a remedy would be afforded. As stated by Judge Fitzmaurice,\n\n\"[\u2026] no means of recourse can be regarded as futile from the effectiveness standpoint unless there does not appear to be even a reasonable possibility that it will afford an effective remedy. This test is acceptable provided it is borne in mind that what there must be a reasonable possibility of the existence of a possibly effective remedy, and that the mere fact that there is no reasonable possibility of the claimant obtaining that remedy, because his case is legally unmeritorious, does not constitute the type of absence of reasonable possibility which will displace the local remedies rule\"28.\n\nDoc. **RL-21**, B. Sabahi, et al. \"Exhaustion of Local Remedies\" in Investor State Arbitration (2019), p. 436 (*citing* the exposition of the standard by G. Fitzmaurice).\n\n**2. Honduras' track record in relation to exhaustion of local remedies under the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**2.1 Honduras' reference to the exhaustion of local remedies in the** ***D****ecreto*** **ratifying the Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nHonduras signed the Convention on 28 May 198629. The Tribunal understands that Honduras did not make any reservations at that time.\n\nList of Contracting States and Other Signatories of the Convention, https://icsid.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/ICSID%203/2024%20-%20Aug%2025%20-%20ICSID%20 3%20-%20ENG.pdf (as of 25 August 2024).\n\n48.\n\nAbout two years thereafter, Honduras approved and ratified the Convention through *Decreto* 41-88 dated 4 August 1988 [the \"***Decreto*** **41-88**\"]30. *Decreto* 41-88 contains only two provisions:\n\n- Article 1, which approves an \"*Acuerdo Original N\u00ba 8-DTTL de fecha 25 de julio de 1986, referente al* '[Convention]'\", and transcribes *ad pedem litterae* the text of the Convention in Spanish31; and\n\n- Article 2, which provides that \"[e]l *presente Decreto entrar\u00e1 en vigencia a partir de la fecha de su publicaci\u00f3n, en el Diario Oficial 'La Gaceta*'\"32.\n\nR Objection I, para. 28; C Objection I, para. 2.\n\nDoc. **R-3**, Republic of Honduras, Decree 41-88, Art. 1: \"Original Agreement No. 8-DTTL dated 25 July 1986, referring the [Convention]\".\n\nDoc. **R-3**, Republic of Honduras, Decree 41-88, Art. 2: \"The present Decree shall be effective as of the date it is published in the Official Journal 'La Gaceta'\".\n\n49.\n\nIn the transcription of the Convention, between Article 75 (the final provision of the Convention) and the list of signatory parties, Honduras inserted the text on which it now bases its Preliminary Objection [the \"**Exhaustion Requirement**\"]:\n\n\"*DECLARACI\u00d3N DE LA REP\u00daBLICA DE HONDURAS.

The Exhaustion Requirement is located in the area highlighted in grey and found between the text of the Convention and its signatures.\n\n51.\n\nHonduras claims that it incorporated the Exhaustion Requirement in *Decreto* 41-88 as an exercise of its right under Article 26 of the Convention, which provides as follows:\n\n\"[\u2026] A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention\"35.\n\nDoc. **RL-9**, ICSID Convention, Art. 26.\n\n52.\n\nWhile Honduras was certainly entitled to require the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 26 of the Convention, the approach it decided to adopt is uncommon:\n\n- *First*, exercising the right to require the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 26 of the Convention is, in itself, exceptional; as noted above, the Tribunal is aware of only three other countries having exercised this right (Israel, Costa Rica and Guatemala).\n\n- *Second*, the requirement to exhaust local remedies, which remains an exception to the rule under the Convention, would seem to require greater clarity in both its wording and its placement:\n\no In its wording, because the language can be interpreted in two ways: either as imposing a requirement to exhaust local remedies before accessing ICSID arbitration, as Honduras asserts, or as a directive to Honduras' future negotiators of treaties and other instruments providing for ICSID arbitration, inciting them to incorporate such a requirement, as Claimants allege; and\n\no In its placement, because a paragraph buried within the transcription of the Convention in the *Decreto* \u2013 inserted between the final article and the signatures \u2013 does not seem to be the most transparent way to communicate to the international community that Honduras is exercising its right under Article 26; furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that Honduras notified this requirement to ICSID; in fact, ICSID registered *Decreto* 41-88 in Document ICSID/8-F, titled \"Legislative or Other Measures Relating to the Convention (Article 69 of the Convention)\" rather than in Document ICSID 8-D, which is used by ICSID to, *inter alia*, register notifications about requirements to exhaust local remedies, such as those made by Israel, Costa Rica and Guatemala36.\n\nDoc. **R-55**, ICSID/8-D, pp. 10, 21-30.\n\n**2.2 Honduras' scarce references to exhaustion of local remedies in instruments providing for ICSID arbitration, including CAFTA-DR**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nSince the publication of *Decreto* 41-88, Honduras has enacted various domestic laws that provide, either directly or indirectly, for ICSID arbitration. References in these laws to the Exhaustion Requirement are scarce:\n\n- In 1989 Honduras approved the *Ley de Fomento a la Inversi\u00f3n Privada Nacional y Extranjera*; in Article 29, this *Ley* transcribed almost verbatim the text of the Exhaustion Requirement from *Decreto* 41-8837; this is the only domestic regulation issued after *Decreto* 41-88 that expressly mentioned the Exhaustion Requirement;\n\n- In 1992 Honduras replaced the 1989 *Ley* with the *Ley Hondure\u00f1a de Inversiones*38; Article 4.13 of the new *Ley* provided that \"*los inversionistas extranjeros podr\u00e1n acordar someter la soluci\u00f3n de sus diferencias de acuerdo a convenios internacionales suscritos por Honduras*\", but it made no reference to the Exhaustion Requirement39;\n\n- In 2011 Honduras replaced the 1992 *Ley* with the new *Ley para la Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de Inversiones*40; Article 25 of the new *Ley* allows investors to resort to ICSID arbitration, national or international arbitration in Honduran arbitration centres, or \"*Justicia Ordinaria*\"41; however, this *Ley* also lacks any reference to the Exhaustion Requirement.\n\nDoc. **C-160**, Decree No. 266-89, approving the Law to Promote National and Foreign Investment dated 15 December 1989, Art. 29: \"*El Estado de Honduras se someter\u00e1 a los procedimientos de arbitraje y conciliaci\u00f3n previstos en el [Convention] \u00fanicamente cuando haya expresado previamente consentimiento por escrito.

Honduras does not dispute this.\n\n*Astaldi S.p.A. & Columbus Latinoamericana de Construcciones S.A. v. Republic of Honduras*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/8; (ii) *Astaldi S.p.A. v.

Republic of Honduras*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/40.\n\n56.\n\nIt appears that Honduras invoked the Exhaustion Requirement in ICSID proceedings for the first time in a letter to the Centre dated 30 May 2023, in which it requested ICSID to dismiss Claimants' claims in these proceedings on the grounds that the Exhaustion Requirement constituted a \"*Cl\u00e1usula de Reserva*\"50.\n\nRespondent's Letter to ICSID, dated 30 May 2023, para. 5.\n\n57.\n\nSubsequently, in addition to filing the Preliminary Objection in this arbitration, Honduras has invoked the Exhaustion Requirement in objections for manifest lack of legal merit raised under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID (2006) Arbitration Rules in two other pending ICSID cases. The Tribunal understands that:\n\n- in one of these cases (*ADASA v. Honduras*), the tribunal rejected the objection, finding that it involved a complex interpretative exercise that went beyond the threshold of obviousness, and deferred its decision on the merits of Honduras' objection to a later stage of the proceedings51; and\n\n- in the other case (*JLL Capital v. Honduras*), the tribunal also denied the preliminary objection, ruling that it did not meet the high standard of Rule 41(5)52; however, according to Respondent, the tribunal later bifurcated the proceedings to hear, *inter alia*, Honduras' objection based on the claimant's failure to exhaust local remedies53.\n\nDoc. **R-58**, L.

Pursuant to Article 71 of the Convention, the denunciation took effect on 25 August 2024, six months after ICSID received Honduras' notice55.\n\nList of Contracting States and Other Signatories of the Convention, available on https://icsid.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/ICSID%203/2024%20-%20Aug%2025%20-%20ICSID%20 3%20-%20ENG.pdf (as of 25 August 2024).\n\n**3. Honduras' approval and ratification of CAFTA-DR with no reference to the Exhaustion Requirement**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nHonduras signed CAFTA-DR in August 2004 and approved it through *Decreto* No. 10-2005 in July 200556.\n\nDoc. **R-65**, Republic of Honduras, *Decreto* 10-2005 approving CAFTA-DR, dated 3 March 2005.\n\n61.\n\nChapter Ten of CAFTA-DR, titled \"Investment\", spans 20 pages and contains detailed provisions on investment protection, including Section B on \"Investor-State Dispute Settlement\", which allows investors to submit claims to ICSID arbitration.\n\n62.\n\nLike other treaties signed by Honduras that provide for ICSID arbitration, CAFTA-DR does not reference the Exhaustion Requirement nor contain any exhaustion requirement at all. Similarly, none of the four articles in the *Decreto* approving CAFTA-DR mentions such a requirement.\n\n**4.

The establishment of the ZEDE Legal Framework**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nOne year later, in 2013 Honduras established the legal framework for the creation of *Zonas de Empleo y Desarrollo Econ\u00f3mico* [\"**ZEDE**\", an acronym for the Spanish term]*.* This framework [\"**ZEDE Legal Framework**\"] consisted of Articles 294, 303, and 329 of the Constitution59 [\"**ZEDE Constitutional Provisions**\"], as well as the Organic Law of the Economic Development and Employment Zones60 [\"**ZEDE Law**\"].\n\nDoc. **C-4**, Constitution of Honduras of 1982 with Amendments through 2013; Doc. **C-2**, Decree No. 236-2012, published on 24 Jan. 2013; Doc. **C-3**, Decree No. 9-2013, published on 20 March 2013.\n\nDoc. **C-6**, Decree No. 120-2013, published on 6 September 2013.\n\n66.\n\nPursuant to the ZEDE Constitutional Provisions, ZEDEs enjoyed functional and administrative autonomy, but were subject to the national legislation in all matters related to sovereignty, application of justice, national defense, foreign relations, electoral matters, and issuance of identification documents and passports61.\n\nDoc. **C-4**, Constitution of Honduras of 1982 with Amendments through 2013, Art. 329.\n\n67.\n\nAdditionally, in accordance with the ZEDE Law, ZEDEs were to be governed by two national authorities: the Committee for the Adoption of Best Practices [the \"**CAMP**\"], and the Technical Secretariat62.\n\nDoc. **C-6**, ZEDE Law, Arts. 11, 12.\n\nRelevant provisions of the ZEDE Law with regard to investments\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe ZEDE Law provided that:\n\n- The Technical Secretary could enter into legal stability agreements with residents and investors of the ZEDEs63; and,\n\n- Should the ZEDE Law be repealed, it would remain in effect for the term agreed in the legal stability agreement, which should not be shorter than 10 years64.\n\nDoc. **C-6**, ZEDE Law, Art. 12.\n\nDoc. **C-6**, ZEDE Law, Art. 45.\n\n69.\n\nAdditionally, the ZEDE Law included a most-favored-nation [\"**MFN**\"] clause, which provided as follows:\n\n\"*Las personas naturales y jur\u00eddicas que operen dentro de las Zonas de Empleo y Desarrollo Econ\u00f3mico (ZEDE) recibir\u00e1n trato en base al principio de Naci\u00f3n M\u00e1s Favorecida (NMF), para lo cual obtendr\u00e1n la extensi\u00f3n autom\u00e1tica de cualquier mejor tratamiento que se conceda o se haya concedido a las dem\u00e1s partes en un acuerdo de comercio internacional suscrito por el Estado de Honduras*\"65.\n\nDoc. **C-6**, ZEDE Law, Art. 32 (\"Natural and legal persons operating within the Zones of Economic Development and Employment (ZEDE) shall be treated on the basis of the Most Favored Nation (MFN) principle, for which they shall obtain the automatic extension of any better treatment that is granted or has been granted to the other parties to an international trade agreement signed by the State of Honduras\").\n\n70.\n\nIn January 2014 a lawyer identified as \"M.A.\u00c1.S\", \"acting on her own behalf\", challenged the ZEDE Legal Framework before the Supreme Court, which upheld its constitutionality66.\n\nDoc. **C-8**, Decision of the Supreme Court of Honduras, Case No. RI 0030-13, 26 May 2014, p. 42.\n\n**4.2 Claimants' creation of PR\u00d3SPERA ZEDE**\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIncorporation of Pr\u00f3spera ZEDE and its operating entities\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nIn August 2017 Mr. Erick Brimen, a United States national, together with his business partners, incorporated Honduras Pr\u00f3spera, a Delaware limited liability company67, the first step towards establishing a ZEDE in Honduras.

DISCUSSION**\n------------------\n\n93.\n\nIn essence, Respondent submits that Claimants have committed a procedural mistake: they decided to submit the dispute to arbitration under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules, notwithstanding the \u2013 undisputed \u2013 fact that they had not exhausted the local administrative and judicial remedies. ICSID arbitration is \u2013 in the Republic's submission \u2013 not available in this case, because of the Exhaustion Requirement inserted by Honduras in *Decreto* 41-88, in which the Republic approved the Convention. This Exhaustion Requirement \u2013 through which, according to Honduras, it exercised its prerogative under Article 26 of the Convention109 \u2013 is worded as follows:\n\n\"*El inversionista deber\u00e1 agotar las v\u00edas administrativas y judiciales de la Rep\u00fablica de Honduras, como condici\u00f3n previa a la puesta en marcha de los mecanismos de soluci\u00f3n de diferencias previstos en el Convenio*\"110.\n\nDoc. **RL-9**, ICSID Convention, Art. 26: \"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention\".\n\nDoc. **R-3**, Republic of Honduras, Decree 41-88, Decree on the ICSID Convention dated 25 March 1988, Art. 75 (\"The investor shall exhaust the administrative and judicial channels of the Republic of Honduras, as a prior condition to the implementation of the dispute settlement mechanisms provided for in this Agreement\").\n\n94.\n\nThe Republic says that, due to Claimants' failure to comply with this condition, the Tribunal is not competent, and the Centre lacks jurisdiction, to adjudicate Claimants' claims.\n\n95.\n\nThe Republic acknowledges that if Claimants had opted for UNCITRAL arbitration (a possibility envisaged by Article 10.16(3)(c) of CAFTA-DR), the Exhaustion Requirement would not have been applicable, and the Tribunal's competence could not have been challenged for failure to exhaust local remedies111.\n\nR Objection I, para. 42; R Objection II, paras. 97-98.\n\n96.\n\nClaimants concede that they did not exhaust local remedies112 but disagree with Honduras mainly for three reasons:\n\n- Respondent has submitted an admissibility objection instead of an objection to the Tribunal's competence, as allegedly required by Article 10.20.5 of CAFTA-DR;\n\n- The Exhaustion Requirement in *Decreto* 41-88 does not suffice to condition Honduras' consent to this arbitration on the exhaustion of local remedies; and\n\n- In any event, the exhaustion of existing local remedies would be futile.\n\nC Objection I, para. 26.\n\nClaimants' first argument\n-------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Claimants' first argument. From a theoretical point of view, the Tribunal tends to prefer the position that the exhaustion of local remedies is a question of admissibility, which does not impinge the competence of the Tribunal nor the jurisdiction of ICSID. That said, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the distinction between admissibility or jurisdictional objections is relevant for the purposes of this decision. Respondent's Preliminary Objection, whether labelled as admissibility or jurisdictional objection, falls within the scope of Article 10.20.5 of CAFTA-DR. Claimants' reading is too restrictive.\n\n98.\n\nThe relevant part of such provision reads as follows:\n\n\"In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request\"113.\n\nDoc. **CL-2**, CAFTA-DR, Art. 10.20.5.\n\n99.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this paragraph is drafted broadly. The purpose of Article 10.20.5 of CAFTA-DR \u2013 including the reference to \"any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence\" \u2013 seems to be to allow respondents to submit any kind of objections, whether related to admissibility or jurisdiction, which, if granted, could promptly end the dispute114. The Tribunal sees no reason why the question of the exhaustion of local remedies (which, if decided in favor of Respondent, would put an end to the proceedings) should be excluded from this.\n\nIn the same vein, the tribunal in *Pac Rim* \u2013 quoted by Claimants \u2013 stressed that the procedure in Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 CAFTA-DR \"is clearly intended to avoid the time and cost of a trial\". Doc. **CL-71***,* *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections Under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5, dated 2 August 2010, para. 112.\n\n100.\n\nThis leaves the Tribunal with two questions:\n\n- Whether the Exhaustion Requirement in *Decreto* 41-88 is a valid condition to ICSID arbitration under Article 26 of the Convention and, if so, whether it has been waived (**1.**);\n\n- Whether, regardless of the validity of the condition, it would make sense to require Claimants to exhaust local remedies given the legal and factual circumstances of this case (**2.**).\n\n**1. The applicability of the Exhaustion Requirement in the present case**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1.1 Validity of the Exhaustion Requirement in** ***D****ecreto*** **41-88 under Article 26 of the Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nHonduras asserts that it validly required exhaustion of local remedies under Article 26 of the Convention by incorporating the Exhaustion Requirement into the law that approved the Convention (*i.e.*, in *Decreto* 41-88). Claimants disagree.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal is inclined to concur with Honduras. Article 26 of the Convention provides that \"[a] Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention\", without specifying the method of implementation.\n\n103.\n\nProfessor Schreuer is of the view that States may express this condition through various means, including \"in national legislation providing for ICSID arbitration\"115. *Decreto* 41-88 serves as legislation that provides for ICSID arbitration \u2013 in fact, it integrates ICSID arbitration into the Honduran legal framework. However, it could be argued \u2013 as Claimants do \u2013 that by \"national legislation\" Professor Schreuer means laws containing the State's explicit consent to ICSID arbitration for certain disputes (such as an investment law) rather than the law approving the Convention.\n\nDoc. **RL-56**, S. Schill et al., \"Article 26\" in *Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention* (2022), para. 302. Likewise, the tribunal in *Lanco v. Argentina* stated that \"[a] State may require the exhaustion of domestic remedies as a prior condition for its consent to ICSID arbitration. This demand may be made [\u2026] (ii) in domestic legislation\"; *see also* Doc. **RL-7**, *Lanco International Inc. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6, Preliminary Decision: Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, dated 8 December 1998, para. 39.\n\n104.\n\nThe answer to this discussion appears to lie in the terms used by then-ICSID Secretary General, Mr. Shihata, in a 1984 editorial titled \"ICSID and Latin America\":\n\n\"The condition regarding exhaustion of local remedies might also be set forth in a bilateral treaty between the Latin American country concerned and the countries of foreign investors. Another way to accomplish the same objective might result from a declaration made by a Contracting State at the time of signature or ratification of the Convention that it intends to avail itself of the provisions of Article 26 and will require, as a condition of its consent to ICSID arbitration, the exhaustion of its local remedies. It should be added, however, that among 90 Signatory States, only one has made such a declaration\"116.\n\n**Doc. RL-6**, I.

The Tribunal understands that the one country referred to by Mr. Shihata was Israel, as in 1984 it was the only country that had notified ICSID that its consent was conditioned on the exhaustion of local remedies.\n\n105.\n\nThis 1984 commentary, specifically focused on Latin American States, holds relevance as it reflects ICSID's position at that time. It is reasonable to infer that Honduras signed the Convention in 1986 and, two years later, inserted the Exhaustion Requirement in *Decreto* 41-88 based on the assurances provided by Mr. Shihata and ICSID, whether through this editorial or by other means. At that time, Honduras had no reason to believe that additional steps were necessary to condition its consent to ICSID arbitration under Article 26 of the Convention.\n\n106.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this is corroborated by the similarity between the language used in Article 26 and in the Exhaustion Requirement:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Article 26 of the Convention | *Decreto* 41-88 |\n| *\"Un Estado Contratante podr\u00e1 exigir el agotamiento previo de sus v\u00edas administrativas o judiciales, como condici\u00f3n a su consentimiento al arbitraje conforme a este Convenio\"*117*.* | *\"El inversionista deber\u00e1 agotar las v\u00edas administrativas y judiciales de la Rep\u00fablica de Honduras, como condici\u00f3n previa a la puesta en marcha de los mecanismos de soluci\u00f3n de diferencias previstos en este Convenio\"*118*.* |\n\nDoc. **RL-9**, ICSID Convention, Art. 26 (\"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention\").\n\nDoc. **R-3**, Republic of Honduras, Decree 41-88, Decree on the ICSID Convention dated 25 March 1988, Art. 75 (\"The investor shall exhaust the administrative and judicial channels of the Republic of Honduras, as a prior condition to the implementation of the dispute settlement mechanisms provided for in this Agreement\").\n\n107.\n\nWhile the inclusion and placement of the Exhaustion Requirement in the *Decreto* 41-88 may be unconventional, as noted above, the Tribunal is unconvinced by Claimants' assertion that it is a forward-looking declaration, instructing future Honduran governments and legislators to insert the exhaustion of local remedies in the State's subsequent consents to ICSID arbitration119. Rather, the terms used and the context in which they were employed seem to reflect Honduras' intention to establish a \"*condici\u00f3n previa*\" as permitted by the Convention.\n\nC Objection I, paras. 55-57; C Objection II, 57-65; English Tr., p. 103:19-104:3 (Jij\u00f3n).\n\n108.\n\nBe that as it may, this does not mean that the Exhaustion Requirement is applicable to the present case, as will be explained below.\n\n**1.2 Whether the condition in** ***D****ecreto*** **41-88 has been waived in CAFTA-DR**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nGiven the factual background outlined above, Claimants could hardly be faulted for directly bringing their claims against Honduras to ICSID. *Pro memoria*,\n\n- Honduras unconventionally inserted the Exhaustion Requirement in *Decreto* 41-88, back in 1988;\n\n- ICSID never registered or listed Honduras' Exhaustion Requirement in its official documents for such a purpose;\n\n- Honduras never mentioned the Exhaustion Requirement in its international treaties providing for ICSID arbitration (including CAFTA-DR), even though in at least one occasion it entered into a treaty that required exhaustion of local remedies; and\n\n- Honduras never brought the Exhaustion Requirement as a defense in any ICSID arbitration prior to this case.\n\n110.\n\nHowever, these circumstances \u2013 including the absence of any reference to the Exhaustion Requirement in CAFTA-DR \u2013 do not *per se* lead the Tribunal to conclude that Honduras has waived the Exhaustion Requirement vis-\u00e0-vis Claimants. The primary reason leading the Tribunal to conclude that Honduras has waived the Exhaustion Requirement is its incompatibility with the *no-U-turn* clause in CAFTA-DR.\n\nThe Exhaustion Requirement and Article 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR are incompatible\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\n*In limine*, as Claimants assert, States may waive their right to require exhaustion of local remedies under international law120. Honduras does not dispute this assertion; in fact, it acknowledges that waiving the Exhaustion Requirement is a possibility121.\n\nC Objection I, para. 35 and fn. 77. Claimants quoted the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, which provide in Article 15 that \"Local remedies do not need to be exhausted where [\u2026] the state alleged to be responsible has waived the requirement that local remedies be exhausted\"; Doc. **CL-65**, ILC Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Art. 15.\n\nR Objection II, para. 79.\n\n112.\n\nClaimants argue that Honduras has waived the Exhaustion Requirement not only by failing to include a requirement to exhaust local remedies in CAFTA-DR (which contains Honduras' consent to ICSID arbitration), but also by agreeing to certain clauses that are incompatible with such a requirement. The Tribunal agrees that this is the case for Article 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR122.\n\nClaimants allege that the Exhaustion Requirement is also incompatible with the fork-in-the-road provisions contained in Article 10.18.4 and in Annex 10-E of CAFTA-DR. In the Tribunal's view, such alleged incompatibility is not evident given that, as Honduras argues, these provisions only refer to the investor's duty to choose a forum (either local or international) for its claims of alleged violations of the State's international obligations (R Objection II, para. 92). Therefore, it could be argued that there is no inconsistency in requiring an investor to, first, exhaust local remedies in the host State for claims *under domestic law* and, subsequently, to choose whether it brings its related claims *under the Treaty* before local courts or before an international tribunal.\n\n113.\n\nArticle 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR reads, in its relevant part, as follows:\n\n\"No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,\n\n(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant's written waiver123, and\n\n(ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the claimant's and the enterprise's written waivers\n\nof any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16\".\n\nClaimants initiated these arbitral proceedings under Article 10.16.1(a) (Request, para. 74) and submitted the corresponding written waivers (Doc. **C-76**, PAC's Waiver Pursuant to Article 10.18 of CAFTA-DR, dated 15 December 2022; Doc. **C-84**, Honduras Pr\u00f3spera's Waiver Pursuant to Article 10.18 of CAFTA-DR, dated 19 December 2022; Doc. **C-85**, St. John's Bay's Waiver Pursuant to Article 10.18 of CAFTA-DR, dated 19 December 2022).\n\n114.\n\nArticle 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR thus precludes an investor from initiating ICSID arbitral proceedings if it does not accompany its notice of arbitration by a written waiver of\n\n\"[\u2026] any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party [\u2026] any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16\".\n\n115.\n\nBoth Parties rely on Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to interpret this provision. Article 31 provides that\n\n\"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\"124.\n\nDoc. **CL-1**, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1155 U.N. Treaty Series, p. 331, done at Vienna on 23 May 1969, dated 27 January 1980, Art. 31.1.\n\n116.\n\nAdditionally, Honduras acknowledges in its pleadings that the Tribunal must apply the principle of effectiveness125.\n\nR Objection II, para. 75.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that an interpretation under these criteria supports Claimants' position.\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with Respondent that the purpose of Article 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR is to protect Contracting States against parallel proceedings126. In fact, the practical consequence of a good faith reading of this provision, based on the ordinary meaning of its terms, serves this purpose: United States' investors who claim to be affected by measures taken by Honduras (like Claimants) may\n\n- initiate proceedings with respect to such measures, under local law, before administrative tribunals or courts in Honduras and may, for any reason they deem appropriate, discontinue such proceedings before they are resolved, and subsequently initiate international arbitration proceedings under CAFTA-DR; or\n\n- as Claimants did, directly initiate international arbitration proceedings with respect to such measures and waive their right to seek relief in Honduras.\n\nR Objection II, para. 88.\n\n119.\n\nThe recognition in Article 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR of these two avenues for investors is incompatible with the Republic's case: *CAFTA-DR's* provision forcing an investor to renounce all domestic proceedings in the host State (whether already initiated or yet to be initiated) before it is authorized to proceed to international arbitration is incompatible with the *Exhaustion Requirement* in *Decreto* 41-88. Indeed, Honduras cannot require an investor to exhaust local remedies before initiating arbitration, while simultaneously forcing such investor to renounce its right to initiate local proceedings or to continue proceedings already underway before proceeding to arbitration.\n\n120.\n\nSince the Exhaustion Requirement and Article 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR cannot coexist, the latter must prevail because:\n\n- being subsequent in time, it implies a waiver of the previously established requirement; and\n\n- in accordance with international law, the Honduran Constitution provides that \"[e]*n caso de conflicto entre el tratado o convenci\u00f3n* [in this case, CAFTA-DR] *y la ley* [*Decreto* 41-88]*, prevalecer\u00e1 el primero*\"127.\n\nDoc. **C-4**, Constitution of Honduras of 1982 with Amendments through 2013, dated 20 March 2013, Art. 18: \"In case of conflict between the treaty or convention and the law, the former shall prevail\". Claimants referred to this provision in C Objection II, para. 67.\n\nScholarly doctrine and other awards\n-----------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe reading that Article 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR constitutes a waiver to the exhaustion of local remedies requirement is not exclusive of this Tribunal. Professors Kaufmann-Kohler and Potest\u00e0 assert that provisions in investment treaties\n\n\"requir[ing] a prior waiver of all domestic proceedings as a condition to access investor-State arbitration [\u2026] have the effect opposite to the exhaustion of local remedies rule. The choice-of-forum requirements can only be enforced if read as an implied waiver of the local remedies rule\"128.\n\nDoc. **RL-52**, G. Kaufmann-Kohler and M. Potest\u00e0, \"The Interplay Between Investor-State Arbitration and Domestic Courts in the Existing IIA Framework\" in *European Yearbook of International Economic Law* (2020), para. 100 (emphasis added).\n\n122.\n\nOther scholars have reached similar conclusions with regard to Article 1121 of NAFTA129, which is drafted in very similar terms to Article 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR130.\n\n\"Article 1121: Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration 1. A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbitration only if: (a) the investor consents to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and (b) the investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, the enterprise, waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party.  \n2. A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1117 to arbitration only if both the investor and the enterprise:  \n(a) consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and  \n(b) waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1117, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party.  \n3. A consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in writing, shall be delivered to the disputing Party and shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration\".\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the Tribunal relies on the above-mentioned authority cited by the Parties. However, it notes that other scholars \u2013 not cited by the Parties on this particular matter \u2013 have reached the same conclusion. For instance, according to Professor Dodge, the *no-U-turn* clause in Article 1121 of NAFTA is \"inconsistent with a requirement that the investor exhaust local remedies because the act of exhausting such remedies would preclude resort to arbitration under the terms of the treaty\" (W. Dodge, *Local Remedies under NAFTA*, Chapter 11 (2011), fn. 43 (emphasis added), https://ssrn.com/abstract=2217059 (last accessed 9 February 2025)). The International Institute for Sustainable Development has published that, \"although not directly waiving the ELR rule itself, Chapter 11 of the NAFTA tacitly waives it, as the text requires investors or investments to 'waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach \u2026, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party'\" (IISD Best Practices Series: Exhaustion of Local Remedies in International Investment Law, 2017, https://www.iisd.org/system/files/publications/best-practices-exhaustion-local-remedies-law-investment-en.pdf (last accessed 9 February 2025), Section 3.1.5 (emphasis added)). Finally, Professor Bjorklund has stated that \"encouraging local recourse while simultaneously permitting investment arbitration would force States to face multiple cases and if not managed properly could allow an investor duplicative recovery. One way States signing investment treaties have dealt with this problem is the so-called 'no-U-turn' approach, which permits an investor to seek relief in local courts first, but if and when the investor shifts to international relief under the treaty the investor must waive its right to initiate or continue litigation in local courts [\u2026]. This is the approach taken [in Article 1121 NAFTA]\" (A. Bjorklund, Chapter 17: *Waiver of Local Remedies and Limitation Periods*, in M. Kinnear et al. (eds.), *Building International Investment Law: The First 50 Years of ICSID* (2015), p. 238).\n\n123.\n\nLikewise, when dealing with Article 1121 of NAFTA, the tribunal in *Metalclad v. Mexico* described Mexico's decision of not insisting on a defense based on lack of exhaustion of local remedies as\n\n\"correct in light of NAFTA Article 1121(2)(b) which provides that a disputing investor may submit a claim under NAFTA Article 1117 if both the investor and the enterprise waive their rights to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in NAFTA Article 1117\"131.\n\nDoc. **CL-56**, *Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, dated 30 August 2000, fn. 4.\n\n124.\n\nOther ICSID tribunals and the Federal Court of Canada have subsequently adopted similar positions on Article 1121 of NAFTA, echoing the *Metalclad v. Mexico* decision132.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the Tribunal relies on the award in *Metalclad v. Mexico*. However, it notes that other tribunals have held a similar position in decisions that have not been submitted by the Parties. For instance, in the Award in *Waste Management v. United Mexican States* (which is, however, cited in Doc. **RLA-52**, fn. 75), the tribunal held that \"the exhaustion of local remedies is a procedural prerequisite for the bringing of an international claim, one which is dispensed with by NAFTA Chapter 11\" (*Waste Management v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, dated 30 April 2004, https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/ita0900.pdf, para. 116 (emphasis added)). Likewise, in *Marvin Roy Feldman v. Mexico*, the tribunal found that \"Article 1121(2)(b) and (3) substitutes itself as a qualified and special rule on the relationship between domestic and international judicial proceedings, and a departure from the general rule of customary international law on the exhaustion of local remedies\" (*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, dated 16 December 2002, para. 72 (emphasis added). Available on https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/ita0319.pdf). In a decision cited in Doc. **RLA-52**, fn. 75, the Federal Court of Canada, also with respect to Article 1121 of NAFTA, observed that \"the prevailing view appears to be that Article 1121 of Chapter Eleven of NAFTA tacitly waives the requirement that litigants must exhaust local remedies before accessing the Chapter Eleven NAFTA arbitration process\" (*William Ralph Clayton et al v. Government of Canada,* PCA Case No. 2009-04, Judgment of the Federal Court of Canada, 2 May 2018, https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-clayton-and-bilcon-of-delaware-inc-v-government-of-canada-judgment-of-the-federal-court-of-canada-wednesday-2nd-may-2018#decision\\_1419, para. 191 (emphasis added)). *Contra*, unconvincingly, *The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award, dated 26 June 2003, https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/ita0470.pdf, paras. 158-164.\n\n125.\n\nThere is thus a general consensus regarding the incompatibility of a requirement to exhaust local remedies, on the one hand, and provisions like Article 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR, on the other.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\n126.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that *Decreto* 10-2005, through which Honduras incorporated CAFTA-DR into its legal system, repealed, for the purposes of such Treaty, the Exhaustion Requirement in *Decreto* 41-88. Therefore, Claimants were not obliged to exhaust local remedies before initiating this arbitration133.\n\nClaimants have also brought claims under the LSA, which permits that certain disputes be adjudicated by ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal has not analysed in this Decision the alleged incompatibility between the LSA and the Declaration, because there is a debate among the Parties as to whether the LSA is binding on Honduras. Such debate requires further argumentation and submission of evidence, which the Tribunal understands will take place in a later phase of these arbitral proceedings. In any event, Respondent's objection to claims brought under the LSA based on Claimants' failure to comply with the Exhaustion Requirement cannot succeed because in this case, as discussed in the next section, local remedies in any case would be futile.\n\n127.\n\nIn any event, such local remedies would have been futile, as explained below.\n\n**2. The futility of local remedies**\n-------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to find that the Exhaustion Requirement applies to an arbitration filed under CAFTA-DR, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that in this case all local remedies were futile.\n\n129.\n\nAs noted above (see Section III.1.3), exhaustion of local remedies can be complied with either by appealing against the impugned measure to the highest Court in the land or by proving that such an appeal would be futile.\n\n130.\n\nThe impugned measures in these proceedings consist in *Decretos* 32 and 33 adopted by the Parliament of Honduras (and some lesser administrative measures originating from or aligned with said *Decretos*134). When Claimants initiated this arbitration, in December 2022, Honduras had already issued *Decretos* 32 and 33. As indicated by Claimants in their Request for Arbitration:\n\n- *Decreto* 32\n\n\"[\u2026] provides for the repeal of Decrees Nos. 236-2012 and 9-2013 which had introduced the Constitutional ZEDE Provisions, and states that any law, regulation, contract, concession or any other norm in favor of ZEDEs 'shall not be legally valid\"135,\n\n- and *Decreto* 33\n\n\"[\u2026] repeals the ZEDE Law with immediate effect, along with all other legislation, legal norms, dispositions or legal precepts derived from or relating to the Organic ZEDE Law\"136.\n\nEnglish Tr., p. 162:3-15 (Santens); Request for Arbitration, para. 64. Some of these measures are: Honduras' Tax Authority allegedly not processing requests for tax identification numbers for entities incorporated in Pr\u00f3spera ZEDE; Honduras' Commercial Registry allegedly not registering the minutes of Honduran corporations referencing transactions in Pr\u00f3spera ZEDE; and a number of Honduras' Customs Administration Agency's officials having allegedly refused to recognize Pr\u00f3spera ZEDE's independent customs authority.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 60.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 61.\n\n131.\n\nIn its Preliminary Objection, Honduras stated that,\n\n\"[\u2026] if Claimants believed that the Republic of Honduras violated their rights by simply promulgating Decrees Nos. 32-2022 and 33-2022, they should have had recourse \u2013 and may still have recourse \u2013 to the judicial courts of Honduras\"137.\n\nR Objection I, para. 39: \"*si las Demandantes consideraban que la Rep\u00fablica de Honduras vulner\u00f3 sus derechos con tan solo promulgar los Decretos No. 32-2022 y 33-2022, debieron haber recurrido \u2013 y pueden todav\u00eda hacerlo \u2013 a los tribunales de justicia de Honduras*\".\n\n132.\n\nAt the Hearing, Honduras' counsel submitted that, prior to filing the Request for Arbitration, Claimants could have, for instance,\n\n\"[\u2026] go[ne] [against *Decretos* 32 and 33] directly before the Supreme Court with a remedy of unconstitutionality\"138.\n\nEnglish Tr., p. 165, l. 3-5 (Gil); Spanish Tr., p. 194:1-3 (Gil): \"*recurrir directamente [contra los Decretos 32 and 33] hacia la Corte Suprema presentando un recurso, una acci\u00f3n de inconstitucionalidad\".*\n\nFutility\n--------\n\n133.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion the \"remedy of unconstitutionality\", which in Honduras' submission Claimants should have filed before the Supreme Court, would have been futile, and Claimants can be exempted from exhausting local remedies, even without having initiated such action.\n\n134.\n\nThe futility of such \"remedy of unconstitutionality\" is proven by the fact that the Supreme Court of Honduras, the highest Court in the land, against whose decisions there is no internal recourse (as acknowledged by Honduras' counsel during the Hearing139), has already reviewed *Decreto* 33140 and has already stated its conclusions regarding its constitutionality. In the Supreme Court Decision, the Supreme Court of the Republic has indeed\n\n- confirmed the constitutionality of *Decreto* 33; and\n\n- additionally, has declared the entire ZEDE Legal Framework unconstitutional with *ex tunc* effect141.\n\nSpanish Tr., p. 192:17-21 (Gil): *\"Ahora, respecto de la sentencia que acaba de ser publicada, la sentencia de la Corte Suprema, esa es una decisi\u00f3n definitiva de la Rep\u00fablica de Honduras respecto de la cual no procede recurso alguno*\"; English Tr., p. 164:3-5 (Gil): \"Now, regarding the Judgment by the Supreme Court, this is something that \u2013 it cannot be contested\".\n\n*Decreto* 32 never came into effect (see paragraph 83 *supra*).\n\nDoc. **R-66,** Supreme Court of Justice, Constitutional Challenge SCO-0738-2021, Judgment, dated 20 September 2024, p. 58.\n\n135.\n\nIf Claimants had filed the \"remedy of unconstitutionality\", as now advocated by Honduras, the outcome would have been the same: the remedy would have been filed with the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court would have dismissed Claimants' action and would have confirmed the constitutionality of *Decreto* 33, for the same reasons set forth in the Supreme Court Decision. Claimants' endeavors would have been futile, and no claimant can be required, to meet the exhaustion of local remedies standard, to engage in meaningless recourses.\n\nA belated argument by Honduras\n------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAt the Hearing, Honduras seemed to argue for the first time that the Tribunal should carry out a theoretical exercise: it should revert to the time when Claimants submitted their Request for Arbitration in December 2022, and examine whether, at that time, it was futile to attempt to exhaust local remedies against the *Decretos*142.\n\nThe Tribunal deduces this from the following exchange between its President and Honduras' counsel:  \nPresident Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto: \"[\u2026] *si nos centramos en los decretos 32/22 y 33/22 y la decisi\u00f3n del Tribunal Supremo que ha sido publicada en la gaceta el 15 de noviembre, \u00bfcu\u00e1les son los recursos internos que deb\u00edan haber acometido los demandantes para cumplir con el requisito de agotamiento de los recursos internos?*\"  \nMr. Gil: \"[\u2026] *Aqu\u00ed hay algo bien importante que precisar, se\u00f1or presidente, que es la mirada temporal en la cual se present\u00f3 la solicitud de arbitraje* [\u2026]\" (Spanish Tr., p. 192:7-10);  \nPresident Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto: \"[\u2026] if we concentrate on Decrees 32/22, and 33/22, the Decision by the Supreme Court published in La Gaceta on 15 November, what are the internal domestic remedies that should have been undertaken by the Claimants in order to fulfill the requirements of the exhaustion of internal remedies?\"  \nMr. Gil: \"[\u2026] we have to state that in the time frame for the Request for Arbitration [\u2026]\" (English Tr., p. 163:11-21).\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with Honduras' position: the analysis of futility must be carried out when the relevant tribunal adjudicates the issue, and the tribunal must take into consideration all facts known at the time of its decision \u2013 there is no reasons to exclude facts which have occurred between the commencement of the proceedings and the date of its decision. Respondent has not submitted any precedents or opinions in support of its thesis, nor has it advanced any reasoning which justify the exclusion.\n\n138.\n\nBut even if *arguendo* the Tribunal were to accept Honduras' position, the outcome would still be the same: any recourse by Claimants, at the time when they filed their Request for Arbitration in 2022, would have been futile. The proceedings which eventually led to the Supreme Court Decision had already been filed by the *Rector* of the *Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma* in 2021. Given the *erga omnes* effects of constitutionality decisions adopted by constitutional courts, to file a further \"remedy of unconstitutionality\" before the same Supreme Court would have led to the same outcome.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\n139.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the local remedies, which Honduras asserts Claimants should have pursued, would have been futile. Therefore, independently of the Tribunal's previous decision in paragraph 126 *supra* (finding that *Decreto* 10-2005, which incorporated CAFTA-DR into the Honduran legal system, repealed, for the purposes of such Treaty, the Exhaustion Requirement in *Decreto* 41-88, and\n\nthat Claimants were not obliged to exhaust local remedies before initiating this arbitration), the Tribunal decides that Claimants were in any event exempted from complying with the Exhaustion Requirement, because any further recourse against *Decretos* 32 and 33 would have been futile.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n140.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the Tribunal decides to:\n\n- Reject Respondent's Preliminary Objection;\n\n- Postpone its decision on the costs of this Preliminary Phase; and\n\n- Order the continuation of the proceedings."}]}
