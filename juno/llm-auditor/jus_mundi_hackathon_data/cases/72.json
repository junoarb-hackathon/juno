INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe claimant is Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. (\"**GTH**\" or \"**Claimant**\"), a company established under the laws of the Republic of Egypt (\"**Egypt**\"). GTH is represented in this proceeding by Ms. Penny Madden QC and Ms. Besma Grifat-Spackman of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP in London, and Mr. Rahim Moloo and Ms. Charline Yim of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP in New York.\n\n2.\n\nThe respondent is Canada (also referred to as \"**Respondent**\"). Canada is represented in this proceeding by Ms. Sylvie Tabet, Mr. Jean-Francois H\u00e9bert, Ms. Heather Squires, Ms. Jenna Wates and Ms. Valantina Amalraj of the Trade Law Bureau (JLT), Global Affairs Canada.\n\n**B. The Subject of this Order**\n--------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThis Order addresses Canada's request for bifurcation of the proceeding. Canada asks the Tribunal to address Canada's jurisdictional objections in a preliminary phase, while GTH prefers that those objections be joined to the merits.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal first sets out the relevant procedural history (Section II), the Parties' requests for relief (Section III) and a brief overview of the underlying dispute as alleged by GTH to the extent it is relevant to this Order (Section IV). In Section V, the Tribunal summarizes the Parties' positions. It then provides its analysis of Canada's request for bifurcation (Section VI) and states its order in Section (VII).\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed and considered all the arguments presented by the Parties. The fact that a specific argument is not expressly referenced in this Order does not mean that it has not been considered, as the Tribunal includes only those points which it considers most relevant for its decision.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nFollowing the constitution of the Tribunal on 21 February 2017, the Tribunal consulted with the Parties and scheduled the first session to be held by teleconference on 21 April 2017.\n\n7.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a draft agenda for the first session and a draft procedural order to facilitate the Parties' discussions on procedural matters in advance of the first session.\n\n8.\n\nOn 7 April 2017, the Parties submitted their comments on the draft agenda and procedural order. They also informed the Tribunal that they had been able to reach agreement on the majority of procedural issues. One issue on which the Parties could not agree was the \"number and sequence of pleadings, including whether the proceedings should be bifurcated to deal with Canada's preliminary objections on jurisdiction and admissibility.\"1 The Parties informed the Tribunal that they would submit their respective comments on the disputed issues (including bifurcation) later that day. They also proposed to each submit a response to the other Party's comments one week later.\n\nEmail from the Claimant (on behalf of the Parties) to the Tribunal of 7 April 2017.\n\n9.\n\nLater that day, Canada submitted its Request for Bifurcation, date 7 April 2017, together with legal authorities RL-001 to RL-0036 (the \"**April Request for Bifurcation**\"). GTH submitted a letter of the same date, addressing the disputed procedural issues, including bifurcation.\n\n10.\n\nOn 10 April 2017, the Tribunal approved the Parties' proposal that each Party would submit a response to the other Party's comments of 7 April 2017.\n\n11.\n\nOn 14 April 2017, Canada submitted a letter containing its response to GTH's letter of 7 April 2017. On the same day, GTH filed a Submission on Bifurcation, Publication and Place of Proceeding, together with legal authorities CL-001 to CL-0018 (the \"**April Response**\").\n\n12.\n\nAlso on 14 April 2017, the Tribunal confirmed that the Parties would be given an opportunity to make oral presentations on the issue of bifurcation during the first session, and asked the Parties to consult regarding the allotted time for such presentations. The Tribunal noted that, after hearing the Parties' presentations, it would consult the Parties regarding the need for any further procedure.\n\n13.\n\nOn 19 April 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to allocate 45 minutes for each Party's presentation on bifurcation. The Tribunal subsequently confirmed this agreement.\n\n14.\n\nThe first session was held by teleconference on 21 April 2017, and each Party made oral submissions on the issue of bifurcation as agreed.\n\n15.\n\nFollowing the first session, the Tribunal considered the Parties' written and oral submissions on the issue of bifurcation. It determined that it would be premature to decide whether to bifurcate the proceeding at that stage, and that the Tribunal would be better-placed to decide after receiving Canada's jurisdictional objections. By letter of 2 May 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties of this determination. It noted that Canada would be welcome to submit another request for bifurcation together with its jurisdictional objections.\n\n16.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, embodying the agreements of the Parties and the decisions of the Tribunal regarding the procedure to govern the arbitration. The Procedural Timetable was attached as Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1. The Procedural Timetable sets out the dates for each procedural step leading to the Tribunal's decision on bifurcation (if any). It then provides alternative timetables for the remaining procedural steps, one of which will apply following the Tribunal's decision on bifurcation, depending on the outcome.\n\n17.\n\nIn accordance with the Procedural Timetable, on 29 September 2017, GTH filed its Memorial on the Merits and Damages, together with exhibits C-001 to C-254, legal authorities CL-001 to CL-089,2 the Expert Report of Santiago Dellepiane A. and Pablo T. Spiller, and the Witness Statements of Kenneth D. Campbell, Michael C. Connolly, David L. C. Dobbie and Andrew M. Dry (the \"**Memorial**\").\n\nThe legal authorities previously submitted with the April Response were refiled with the Memorial.\n\n18.\n\nOn 15 November 2017, Canada filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and Request for Bifurcation, together with exhibits R-001 to R-078, legal authorities RL-038 to RL-163 and the Expert Report of Prof. Dr. Mohamed S. Abdel Wahab (the \"**Jur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation**\").\n\n19.\n\nOn 29 November 2017, GTH filed its Response to Canada's Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Response**\").\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nAs part of the request for relief contained in the Jur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, Canada states that it \"respectfully requests that the Tribunal hear Canada's jurisdictional and admissibility objections in a preliminary phase.\"3\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 297.\n\n21.\n\nIn the Response, GTH includes the following request for relief:\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, and in light of the fact that bifurcation would decrease efficiency and increase cost and the risk of unfair proceedings, GTH respectfully requests that the Tribunal reject Canada's Request for Bifurcation.4\n\nResponse, \u00b6 33.\n\n**IV. OVERVIEW OF THE UNDERLYING DISPUTE**\n------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe purpose of the following overview of the dispute is to provide context for the Parties' arguments on this issue of bifurcation. It is based on GTH's submissions filed to date, as Canada has not yet responded to GTH's substantive claims. Nothing in this overview should be considered a finding of the Tribunal with respect to any disputed fact.\n\n23.\n\nGTH submitted this dispute to arbitration on the basis of (a) the Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"**BIT**\"),5 and (b) the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), **CL-002**, BIT (French version), **CL-003**, BIT (Arabic version).\n\n24.\n\nGTH alleges that it invested in the Canadian telecommunications market following a series of actions by Industry Canada in 2007 and 2008 to encourage investors to participate in an auction for Advanced Wireless Services spectrum licences (the \"**2008 AWS Action**\").6 According to GTH, Canada's ultimate goal was to diversify its telecommunications market, which had historically been dominated by just three players.7\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, 40.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 3.\n\n25.\n\nTo this end, Industry Canada released a policy framework applicable to the 2008 AWS Auction.8 GTH highlights certain conditions set forth in the policy framework, including that Canada would:\n\na. set aside a specific spectrum for new wireless operators (\"**New Entrants**\");9\n\nb. prohibit the transfer of set-aside spectrum licences to companies that did not meet the criteria of a New Entrant for a period of five years from the date of issuance;10\n\nc. establish certain minimum rollout requirements to be met in the first five years; and\n\nd. require incumbent carriers to enter into roaming and tower and site-sharing agreements with New Entrants at \"commercial rates.\"11\n\n**C-004**, Industry Canada, Policy Framework for the Auction for Spectrum Licences for Advanced Wireless Services and other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range, November 2007.\n\n**C-004**, Industry Canada, Policy Framework for the Auction for Spectrum Licences for Advanced Wireless Services and other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range, November 2007, p. 5. A new entrant was defined as: \"An entity, including affiliates and associated entities, which holds less than 10 percent of the national wireless market based on revenue.\" *Id.*\n\n**C-004**, Industry Canada, Policy Framework for the Auction for Spectrum Licences for Advanced Wireless Services and other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range, November 2007, p. 6.\n\n**Exhibit C-004**, Industry Canada, Policy Framework for the Auction for Spectrum Licences for Advanced Wireless Services and other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range, November 2007, pp. 8-9.\n\n26.\n\nIn addition, the 2008 AWS Auction was subject to Canada's ownership and control rules (\"**O&C Rules**\"), which limited the proportion of a common carrier's voting shares that could be held by a foreign investor.12 Yet, according to GTH, the industry expected that the O&C Rules would be relaxed in the future.13\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 92.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 8.\n\n27.\n\nGTH learned of the 2008 AWS Auction in November 2007 and subsequently entered into discussions with Globalive Communications Corp. (\"**Globalive**\"), a Canadian telecommunications provider, to explore the possibility of creating a joint venture to participate in the auction.14 Eventually, GTH and Globalive (through several intermediate companies) established a new Canadian wireless operator, Globalive Wireless Management Corp., which would later operate as Wind Mobile, to participate in the 2008 AWS Auction as a New Entrant.15 According to GTH, the investment was structured to ensure compliance with the O&C Rules. At the same time, however, the relevant corporate documents included a provision that would allow GTH to convert its non-voting shares in Wind Mobile into voting shares when the O&C Rules changed as anticipated.16\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 79.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 90-91. The corporate name of Wind Mobile is Globalive Wireless LP.\n\n**C-084**, Declaration of Ownership and Control, 5 August 2008, pp. 80, 92 (Globalive Holdco Shareholders' Agreement, Clause 6.6 and Schedule C); **C-084**, Declaration of Ownership and Control, 5 August 2008, pp. 119, 13435 (Globalive Investment Shareholders' Agreement, Clause 6.8 and Schedule C); **C-084**, Declaration of Ownership and Control, 5 August 2008, pp. 137-49 (Globalive Canada Holdings Corp. Articles of Incorporation); **C-084**, Declaration of Ownership and Control, 5 August 2008, pp. 150-65 (Globalive Investment Holdings Corp. Articles of Incorporation).\n\n28.\n\nWind Mobile participated in the 2008 AWS Auction and successfully bid for 30 set-aside spectrum licenses for CAD 442 million, which GTH paid in 2008.17\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 87; **C-082**, Letter from Michael D. Connolly to Michael John O'Connor, 22 July 2008.\n\n29.\n\nGTH states that, from 2008 to September 2012, it invested more than CAD 1.3 billion in Wind Mobile, making it the strongest New Entrant in the market.18 However, Canada allegedly \"failed to uphold its end of the bargain, and used its sovereign authority both to change the rules and to orchestrate the application of existing rules to GTH's detriment without any consideration for the extreme unfair consequences for GTH.\"19\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 99, 111.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 11.\n\n30.\n\nFirst, GTH alleges that Canada subjected Wind Mobile to a seven-month review of its compliance with the O&C Rules, which was duplicative, inconsistent and unfair.20 After GTH had paid CAD 442 million for the licenses, Industry Canada conducted an extensive review and determined that Wind Mobile was in compliance with the O&C Rules.21 However, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (\"**CRTC**\") then undertook its own review. It established an onerous public review process specifically targeted at Wind Mobile, and eventually determined that Wind Mobile did not qualify to operate as a common carrier, contrary to Industry Canada's earlier determination.22 Ultimately, Wind Mobile was found to be in compliance with the O&C Rules and entitled to operate, but the regulatory process allegedly hurt Wind Mobile by preventing it from entering the market at a critical time.23\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 V.A.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 120-125.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 126-144.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 14.\n\n31.\n\nSecond, GTH alleges that Canada took no action to create the fair, competitive market conditions foreseen in the policy documents relating to the 2008 AWS Auction until March 2013, \"constituting far too little, too late\".24 According to GTH, the result was that New Entrants had no chance of competing with established carriers.25\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 114, 366.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 V.B.\n\n32.\n\nThird, GTH argues that after the O&C Rules were relaxed as expected in June 2012, [REDACTED]\n\n33.\n\nFourth, GTH alleges that in March 2013, Canada reversed its previously stated policy and announced that New Entrants would no longer be permitted to transfer their set-aside spectrum licenses to an incumbent carrier after the expiration of the five-year period set forth in the 2008 AWS Auction policy framework.30 GTH states that this action made it impossible for GTH to recover any value from its investment. Left with no other options, in September 2014, GTH agreed to sell Wind Mobile to a consortium of non-incumbent investors for CAD 295 million, an amount \"far below the price Wind Mobile would have been worth *but-for* Canada's breaches.\"31\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 V.C.2.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 25.\n\n34.\n\nGTH asserts that, through these actions, Canada has breached the BIT by failing to (a) afford GTH fair and equitable treatment, (b) ensure full protection and security of GTH's investment, (c) guarantee the unrestricted transfer of GTH's investment, and (d) grant GTH's investment treatment no less favourable than that which it provides to investments of its own investors.32 GTH seeks compensation \"in excess of US$ 1.75 billion to be updated as of the date of the Award\".33\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 VII.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 427.\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n35.\n\nCanada requests that the Tribunal bifurcate this proceeding to address its five objections to jurisdiction and admissibility in a separate phase prior to considering the merits of GTH's claims. According to Canada, bifurcation \"will enhance the fairness, efficiency, and economy of the proceedings.\"34\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 2.\n\n***(1) Applicable Legal Standard***\n-----------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nCanada submits that, pursuant to Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, ICSID tribunals have discretion to hear objections to jurisdiction and admissibility in a preliminary phase.35 Indeed, many tribunals in investor-State cases under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional Facility Rules and the UNCITRAL Rules have opted for such a bifurcated proceeding.36\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 283; April Request, \u00b6 23, *citing inter alia* **RL-003**, *Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V. v. The Republic of Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/9) Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 29 May 2009, \u00b6 52 (\"It is clear from [Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention] that the Tribunal may decide to deal with any issue of jurisdiction or admissibility as \"a preliminary question\" or by joinder to the merits of the dispute\").\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 284; April Request, \u00b6 26.\n\n37.\n\nIn Canada's view, there are several benefits to this approach. It allows \"the parties to know where they stand at an early stage,\"37 and enhances the fairness, efficiency, and economy of the proceeding.38 In addition, Canada states that bifurcation \"helps to ensure that the Tribunal only hears and decides a dispute where the conditions on consent to arbitrate have been met.\"39 For Canada, this point is especially important when a sovereign State is a party, in light of the \"basic rule of international law... that a State is not obliged [to] give an account of itself on issues of merits before an international tribunal which lacks jurisdiction or whose jurisdiction has not been established.\"40\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 25, *quoting* **RL-008**, Alan Redfern and Martin Hunter, *Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration*, 4th ed. (London: Thomson, Sweet & Maxwell, 2004), p. 258.\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 284.\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 25.\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 25, *quoting* **RL-010**, Shabtai Rosenne, *The World Court: What It Is and How It Works*, 5th ed. (Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff, 1995), p. 99. *See also* Jur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 285, *citing* **RL-012**, *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (106 I.L.R. 531) Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 April 1988, \u00b6 63 (\"there is no presumption of jurisdiction - particularly where a sovereign State is involved - and the Tribunal must examine objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre with meticulous care, bearing in mind that jurisdiction in the present case exists only insofar as consent thereto has been given by the Parties\").\n\n38.\n\nRegarding the applicable legal framework, Canada points to three main factors identified by the tribunals in *Philip Morris v. Australia* and *Emmis v. Hungary* to be considered in determining whether to bifurcate a proceeding.41 Under this framework, bifurcation of a preliminary objection is appropriate when:\n\na. the objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial,\n\nb. the objection can be examined without prejudging or entering the merits, and\n\nc. the objection, if successful, could dispose of all or an essential part of the claims.42\n\n**RL-022**, *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. The Commonwealth of Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 8 Regarding Bifurcation of the Procedure, 14 April 2014, \u00b6 109; **RL-014**, *Emmis International Holding and others. v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Decision on Respondent's Application for Bifurcation, 13 June 2013, \u00b6 37(2).\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 27 and Jur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6286, *citing* **RL-022**, *Philip Morris Asia Limited v.

Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Decision on Respondent's Application for Bifurcation, 13 June 2013, \u00b6 37(2).\n\n39.\n\nWith respect to the first element, Canada argues that \"the Tribunal must only make a *prima facie* determination that the objections are not frivolous since it is only after having heard the parties' submissions on these objections that it can decide on the objections.\"43\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 287, *quoting* **RL-022**, *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. The Commonwealth of Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 8 Regarding Bifurcation of the Procedure, 14 April 2014, \u00b6 109.\n\n40.\n\nCanada notes GTH's agreement that these three factors are relevant to the Tribunal's determination on the issue of bifurcation.44\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 286, *citing* April Response, \u00b6 7.\n\n41.\n\nAccording to Canada, each of its five objections satisfies the test for bifurcation because it is serious, can be decided without entering into the merits of the dispute, and will dispose of all or an essential part of GTH's claims.45 By significantly reducing the scope of issues before the Tribunal in the merits phase, bifurcation would reduce the burden of document production, and lead to cost savings.46 Canada's arguments relating to each objection are summarised in the following subsections.\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 28. The Tribunal notes that, in its April Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent raised also an objection with respect to the Admissibility of the Claimant's Most-Favored Nation claim. As noted in its more recent pleading, the Respondent no longer raises this objection as the Claimant has since abandoned that claim. Jur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 288.\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 295.\n\n***(2)***  [REDACTED]\n---------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n***(3) Second Objection: Article II(4)(b) of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\n[REDACTED]. According to Canada, even if one were to accept GTH's allegations [REDACTED] unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory, this claim would be excluded from dispute resolution provisions of the BIT pursuant to Article II(4)(b).56\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 109.\n\n48.\n\nArticle II(4)(b) states that\n\nDecisions by either Contracting Party not to permit establishment of a new business enterprise or acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise by investors or prospective investors shall not be subject to the provisions of Article XIII of this Agreement.57\n\n**CL-001**, BIT, Article II(4)(b).\n\n49.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n50.\n\nIn Canada's view, the Tribunal should hear this objection in a preliminary phase for several reasons. First, Canada argues that the objection is serious and substantial, as GTH's \"allegation falls squarely within the scope of the Article II(4)(b) exclusion.\"60\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 38.\n\n51.\n\nSecond, the objection is a discrete question entirely independent from the merits of the dispute.61 According to Canada, the relevant facts [REDACTED] are \"relatively straight forward\"; the Tribunal can carry out its jurisdictional analysis by relying on GTH's pleadings and assuming that all the facts pled are true.62 [REDACTED]\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 39.\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 39.\n\n52.\n\nThird, Canada submits that this objection, if accepted, would dispose of an essential part of GTH's claims. Canada accepts that it could not dispose of the case entirely, but argues that it would significantly reduce the scope of issues and evidence to be addressed in the second phase of the proceeding, leading to time and cost savings.64\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 40; Jur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 290.\n\n53.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n***(4) Third Objection: Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nCanada's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* relates to two categories of GTH's claims: (a) CRTC's O&C review of Wind Mobile in 2009, and (b) the alleged failure of Industry Canada to maintain a regulatory framework that would permit New Entrants to successfully compete in the telecommunications market after the AWS Auction.67\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 149.\n\n55.\n\nAccording to Canada, these claims are time-barred pursuant to the strict limitations period contained in Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT.68 That provision states that an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration only if\n\nnot more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.69\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 180-190.\n\n**CL-001**, BIT, XIII(3)(d).\n\n56.\n\nCanada asserts that the two challenged measures noted above were adopted long before the critical date of 28 May 2013 (three years before the filing of the Request for Arbitration), and that GTH either knew or should have known that it would incur the alleged damage as a result of these measures before that date.70\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 180-190.\n\n57.\n\nIn particular, Canada points out that is undisputed between the Parties that all events relating to the CRTC review occurred from 2009 to April 2012, when the matter was finally closed by the Supreme Court of Canada.71 Thus, GTH was aware of alleged damage arising from the measure no later than April 2012. With respect to the regulatory framework for New Entrants, Canada argues that the untimeliness of the claim is clear from the allegations set forth in the Memorial.72 Indeed, the documents filed by GTH show that it had knowledge of both the alleged breach and loss long before the critical date of 28 May 2013.73\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 181.\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 189-190.\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 189, *citing, inter alia,* Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 150-161; **C-118**, Industry Canada, *Roaming and Tower Sharing Review* (Jul. 2011); **C-134**, *Issue Brief - Wind Mobile* (Jan. 11, 2013); **C-213**, Wind Mobile, *Domestic Roaming: Presentation by Simon Lockie, Chief Regulatory Officer* (Oct. 2013).\n\n58.\n\nCanada denies GTH's allegation that these two measures form part of a cumulative breach. In Canada's view, they are obviously distinct measures, and the Tribunal must reject GTH's \"blatant attempt to by-pass the strict three-year limitation period.\"74\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 150.\n\n59.\n\nCanada asks the Tribunal to bifurcate its objection to jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, as all three factors set forth by the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Australia* weight in favour of bifurcation.75 In this regard, Canada asserts that the seriousness of its objection is clear on the face of GTH's allegations, which demonstrate GTH's knowledge of the alleged breaches and damage long before the critical date under Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT.76\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 291.\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 59.\n\n60.\n\nIn addition, Canada considers that the Tribunal can decide this objection without delving into the merits. In particular, the Tribunal can identify the measure and the allegation of loss by relying on GTH's pleadings alone. There is no need to enter into the substance of the CRTC's review process or to consider Canada's obligations with regard to the regulatory framework following the AWS Auction.77\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 55, 60.\n\n61.\n\nFurther, Canada asserts that if this objection were upheld in a preliminary phase, the scope of issues to be addressed in the next phase would be greatly reduced. For example, the following matters could be avoided, reducing costs:\n\na. Evidence, including expert evidence, relating to the CRTC review, the conduct of the CRTC hearings, the substance of the CRTC decision, appeals of the CRTC decision, and the final decision to overturn the CRTC decision.\n\nb. Factual and evidentiary issues related to Canada's regulation of the telecommunications market.\n\nc. The issue of whether GTH's allegation related to this regulatory framework could amount to a breach of the BIT.78\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 291.\n\n***(5) Fourth Objection: Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nCanada's next objection targets GTH's claims that Canada breached its national treatment obligations contained in Article II(3)(a) and Article IV(1) of the BIT. Canada submits that these claims are precluded by the reservation it made pursuant to Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT, and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over them.79\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00a7 III.E.\n\n63.\n\nArticle IV(2)(d) permits the Contracting Parties to \"make or maintain exceptions within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Agreement\" to which the national treatment obligations will not apply.80 The Annex, in turn, states that \"Canada reserves the right to make and maintain exceptions in the sectors or matters listed below: social services.; services in any other sector.\"81 According to Canada, GTH's national treatment claim relates exclusively to the telecommunications sector, which is a service sector and therefore excluded from the scope of the BIT's national treatment provisions.82\n\n**CL-001**, BIT, Article IV(2)(d).\n\n**CL-001**, BIT, Annex.\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 225-235.\n\n64.\n\nCanada considers it appropriate to bifurcate this objection because it is *prima facie* serious and relates to \"a purely legal question of interpretation based on the text of the treaty.\"83 It is unrelated to the substance of GTH's claims and can be resolved without consideration of factual evidence or witness testimony.84\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 292.\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 292; April Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 46.\n\n65.\n\nIn addition, Canada asserts that if it were to prevail on this objection, GTH's national treatment claims would be disposed of completely. As a result, the merits phase would be more efficient, with a narrower scope for document production, shorter submissions and fewer fact and expert witnesses.85\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 47.\n\n***(6) Fifth Objection: Admissibility***\n----------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nCanada objects to the admissibility of GTH's claims that, in Canada's view, relate to the treatment of Wind Mobile.86 Specifically, Canada submits that GTH lacks standing to bring its claims concerning measures that allegedly affected (a) Wind Mobile's competitiveness as a New Entrant in the Canadian telecommunications market, and (b) the transferability of Wind Mobile's licenses.87\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00a7 IV.\n\nJur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 238.\n\n67.\n\nCanada argues that GTH and Wind Mobile cannot be equated with one another, following the principle of international law that an enterprise and its shareholders have separate legal personality.88 Article XIII(12) of BIT provides a narrow exception to this general principle by allowing a foreign shareholder to bring a claim on behalf of an enterprise incorporated in the host State. However, Article XIII(12) applies only in specific circumstances which are not present in the current case, and GTH does not purport to pursue its claims on behalf of Wind Mobile. Therefore, GTH cannot bring a claim for alleged breaches and damages suffered by Wind Mobile.89\n\nJur.

Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 240.\n\n68.\n\nFor Canada, GTH's allegations regarding the regulatory framework for New Entrants and the transferability of spectrum licences \"do not concern any impairment of the rights associated with the Claimant's shareholding or loans.\"90 Rather, GTH alleges that Canada's failure to ensure a favourable regulatory framework hurt Wind Mobile and its operations (not its shareholders).91 Similarly, GTH alleges that the transfer framework impaired spectrum licenses which are held by Wind Mobile (not by GTH).92\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 64.\n\nJur.

Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 280-281.\n\n69.\n\nIn Canada's view, this objection to admissibility should be heard in a preliminary phase to enhance efficiency. In particular, Canada states that the objection can be decided on the basis of GTH's Request for Arbitration and Memorial, without entering into the merits of the case.93 In addition, Canada considers that a merits phase would be streamlined if this objection were upheld in a preliminary phase. For example, the Parties and the Tribunal would not need to address whether Canada failed to provide a favourable regulatory framework, whether it repudiated the framework set out in advance of the 2008 AWS Auction, or whether the alleged measures constitute a breach of the BIT.94\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 65.\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 66.\n\n**B. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n70.\n\nGTH asks the Tribunal to deny Canada's request for bifurcation because, in GTH's view, the result of bifurcation would be delay, duplicative proceedings and \"a risk of inconsistent determinations by the Tribunal,\" rather than an increase in efficiency and fairness.95\n\nResponse, \u00b6 9.\n\n***(1) Applicable Legal Standard***\n-----------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nAccording to GTH, the Parties \"agree that the Tribunal has the discretion to bifurcate proceedings and that considerations of fairness and efficiency are paramount in determining whether bifurcation is warranted.\"96 In addition, the Parties are in agreement regarding the three factors that tribunals should consider in assessing a request for bifurcation.97\n\nResponse, \u00b6 3.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 3, *citing* Jur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 283-284. These factors are set out at \u00b6 38 above.\n\n72.\n\nGTH states that it is appropriate for a tribunal to decline to bifurcate preliminary objections when\n\n(*i*) the objection is unlikely to succeed; or (*ii*) the stated objection will not dispose entirely of a case (or an essential part thereof) making the merits stage in the proceedings inevitable (and more protracted as a result of bifurcation); or (*iii*) there is extensive overlap between the issues relevant to the determination of the objection and the merits of the proceeding.98\n\nResponse, \u00b64, *citing, inter alia,* **RL-011**, Christoph H. Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch & Anthony Sinclair, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd edition 2009), pp. 538-39 (\"In a considerable number of cases tribunals have joined the consideration of jurisdictional questions to the merits of the case... The need for a joinder to the merits is apparent where the answer to the jurisdictional questions depends on testimony and other evidence that can only be obtained through a full hearing of the case. This would be the case, in particular, if the jurisdictional questions are closely related to the merits and depend on the same factual questions. In such a case, the decision on jurisdiction can only be made after a full consideration of the evidence.\").\n\n73.\n\nApplying that test to the present case, GTH submits that it is not appropriate to hear any of Canada's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility in a preliminary phase. According to GTH, Canada's attempt to portray these objections as serious and complex must be rejected. In fact, they are based on incorrect interpretations of the BIT and therefore lack merit.99\n\nResponse, \u00b6 6.\n\n74.\n\n[REDACTED] As a result, bifurcation of the objections would add a year or more to the procedural timetable without eliminating the need for a merits phase.101 In GTH's view, Canada's request for bifurcation should be rejected on that basis alone.102\n\nResponse, \u00b6 18.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 18.\n\n75.\n\nFurthermore, according to GTH, many of the objections would require the Tribunal to enter into the merits of the claims, as Canada acknowledges. Because such issues would then need to be re-examined in the merits phase, bifurcation would result in delay, extra costs, and the risk of inconsistent findings of fact once the Tribunal considers the full documentary record.103\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 18.\n\n76.\n\nFinally, GTH states that it \"would also be highly prejudicial to decide these objections prematurely, before a full hearing of the evidence on the merits, and bifurcation should be rejected on this basis in any event.\"104\n\nResponse, \u00b6 19.\n\n77.\n\nGTH addresses each of Canada's five objections, as summarised in the following subsections.\n\n***(2)***  [REDACTED]\n---------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n83.\n\nHowever, in the event that the Tribunal does consider bifurcating this objection, GTH asks that this be done \"on an expedited basis according to a timetable that does not disrupt the April 2019 hearing dates already set aside by the Tribunal for the hearing on the merits.\"115\n\nResponse, \u00b6 17.\n\n***(3) Second Objection: Article II(4)(b) of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\n[REDACTED] As a legal matter, GTH asserts that Canada ignores Article II(4)(a) of the BIT, which is essential to understanding the alleged exclusion in Article II(4)(b).116 As a factual matter, GTH denies that its claim relates to the \"acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise.\"117 According to GTH, its claims relate to the exercise of rights already acquired at the time it made its investment, [REDACTED]118\n\nResponse, \u00b6 22, *citing* **CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article II(4)(a) (\"Decisions by either Contracting Party, pursuant to measures not inconsistent with this Agreement, as to whether or not to permit an acquisition shall not be subject to the provisions of Articles XIII or XV of this Agreement\").\n\nResponse, \u00b6 20, *quoting* **CL-001**, BIT Article II(4)(b).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 22; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 93, 345, 348.\n\n85.\n\nGTH highlights Canada's statement that GTH's factual allegations can be accepted as true for the purpose of considering this objection.119 For GTH, it follows that the Tribunal must accept the fact that GTH was seeking to exercise existing rights. Thus, Canada defeats its own objection.120\n\nResponse, \u00b6 22, *citing* Jur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 141.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 II.B.1 (\"Canada Vitiates Its Own Objection Under Article II(4)(b) Of The BIT...\").\n\n86.\n\nIn any event, GTH argues that if the facts relating to Canada's objection were to be determined in a preliminary phase, those same facts would need to be analysed in relation to the merits.121 GTH sees a risk that the Tribunal would need to make factual findings relevant to GTH's claims \"in isolation based on an incomplete factual picture that has been grossly mischaracterized by Canada, causing substantial prejudice to GTH at the merits stage.\"122 Therefore, in GTH's view, the Tribunal must not bifurcate this objection.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 23.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 23.\n\n***(4) Third Objection: Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nGTH submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over GTH's claims for Canada's failure to provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.123 According to GTH, Canada's breaches involve \"a series of measures which crystalized, at the earliest, in or around June 2013, [REDACTED]124 Thus, even if certain events relating to those breaches occurred earlier, the only date relevant to the limitations period is June 2013, when \"Canada's conduct culminated in a breach.\"125\n\nResponse, \u00b6 24.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 24.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 24.\n\n88.\n\nGTH argues that this objection is inappropriate for bifurcation because, as Canada concedes, it will require a detailed inquiry into facts which are relevant to the substance of GTH's claims.126 For example, the Tribunal will need to assess when the alleged breach occurred, the duration of the breach, and when GTH first knew of (or should have known of) the alleged breach and the existence of loss or damage.127 Furthermore, GTH asserts that even if certain of Canada's breaches occurred outside the limitations period, the underlying measures would still need to be considered in the merits phase, as they are relevant to GTH's exit from the Canadian market.128\n\nResponse, *citing* Jur. Memorial, \u00b6 172 (\"As the tribunal in *Rusoro* noted, a determination of whether a series of acts forms part of a larger composite act 'is very fact specific and depends on the circumstances of the case.'\"). Canada cites **CL-016**, *Rusoro Mining Limited v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award, 22 August 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 229-31.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 25.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 26, *citing* **CL-016**, *Rusoro Mining Limited v.

They provide the necessary background and context for adjudicating the case, and the legitimate expectations of an investor may depend crucially on matters that occurred before such Cut-Off Date.\").\n\n89.\n\nTherefore, in GTH's view, this objection should be heard together with the merits, \"when a detailed review of the facts can be undertaken in their appropriate context.\"129\n\nResponse, \u00b6 25.\n\n***(5) Fourth Objection: Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nGTH submits that Canada's jurisdictional objection based on Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT is founded on a flawed interpretation of that provision.130 According to GTH, Article IV(2)(d) creates a prospective right for Canada \"to make or maintain exceptions\" to its national treatment obligations for any services.131 Yet, Canada has not made such an exception; nor can it exercise its right to do so merely \"by adopting or maintaining measures or by according treatment that would otherwise be inconsistent with the national treatment obligations,\" as Canada suggests.132\n\nResponse, \u00b6 28.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 29, *quoting* **C-001**, BIT, Article IV(2)(d) and Annex.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 28, *quoting* Jur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 209.\n\n91.\n\nIn GTH's view, bifurcation of this objection will not serve the interests of fairness or efficiency. First, bifurcation would lead to a duplicative review of the facts relating to the [REDACTED], which are relevant to GTH's fair and equitable treatment claim and to its exit from the Canadian market.133 Second, in a preliminary phase, the Tribunal might be forced to make premature factual findings on such matters \"in the vacuum of Canada's jurisdictional objections, prejudicing GTH claims.\"134\n\nResponse, \u00b6 30.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 30.\n\n***(6) Fifth Objection: Admissibility***\n----------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nFinally, GTH argues that Canada's objection to the admissibility of certain of GTH's claims ignores the fact that, under the BIT, shareholders may claim for both direct and direct loss.135 According to GTH, Canada has neither addressed GTH's description of its investment as a \"bundle of rights\" nor dealt with the case law supporting GTH's position.136\n\nResponse, \u00b6 31.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 31, *citing* Memorial, \u00b6 386.\n\n93.\n\nRegarding bifurcation, GTH submits that, as with Canada's other objections, considerations of fairness and efficiency weigh in favour of hearing this objection together with the merits.137 In this regard, GTH notes that deciding Canada's objection will require a fact-intensive inquiry that touches upon the merits, especially relating to Canada's transfer policies and how they affected GTH's ability to sell its shares.138\n\nResponse, \u00b6 32.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 32.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that the purpose of this Order is to decide whether to bifurcate the present proceedings. The Tribunal takes no decision on the substance of the jurisdictional and admissibility objections at this stage but will do so at the appropriate time as provided in the Procedural Timetable.\n\n95.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' submissions and having deliberated, the Tribunal has determined that, while each of the Respondent's objections is *prima facie* serious and substantial, there is an insufficient basis for bifurcation in this case, and therefore denies the Respondent's request for bifurcation. The Tribunal notes, for the avoidance of doubt, that its decision, and its comments regarding the Respondent's specific jurisdictional and admissibility objections below, are without prejudice to the Tribunal's eventual determination of those objections or any issue on the merits. The Tribunal has in no way prejudged the outcome of any of the preliminary objections raised (which will be joined to the merits of the dispute in the manner envisaged by Article 41 of the ICSID Convention), and the Respondent is fully entitled to maintain such objections as it considers appropriate.\n\nA. **Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal's power to rule on the Bifurcation Request is embodied in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n97.\n\nWith regard to the procedural stage at which the Tribunal may address any objection to its jurisdiction, Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention states that\n\n[a]ny objection by a party to the dispute that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\n\n98.\n\nFurthermore, Rule 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules provides in relevant part that the Tribunal\n\nmay deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures.\n\n99.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules sets forth a legal standard applicable to the decision of whether to join preliminary objections to the merits or instead to hear them in a preliminary phase. The ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules leave this decision entirely to the discretion of tribunals.\n\n100.\n\nHere, the Parties are in agreement that, in exercising their discretion regarding whether to order bifurcation, tribunals should be guided by the paramount considerations of fairness and efficiency and should consider the following three factors, as identified by the tribunals in *Philip Morris v. Australia* and *Emmis v. Hungary* :139\n\na. whether the objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial;\n\nb. whether the objection can be examined without prejudging or entering the merits; and\n\nc. whether the objection, if successful, could dispose of all or an essential part of the claims before the Tribunal.\n\n**RL-022**, *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. The Commonwealth of Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 8 Regarding Bifurcation of the Procedure, 14 April 2014, \u00b6 109; **RL-014**, *Emmis International Holding and others. v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Decision on Respondent's Application for Bifurcation, 13 June 2013, \u00b6 37(2). *See also* April Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 27, Jur. Memorial and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 285, 286, and Response, \u00b6 3.\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Parties' submissions in this respect. It has been guided in its analysis by these criteria, as explained below.\n\n**B. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n102.\n\nPreliminarily, the Tribunal considers that each of the five objections advanced by the Respondent is arguable, has been advanced in good faith, and merits the Tribunal's consideration. Accordingly, it is the Tribunal's view that the objections meet the standard of being *prima facie* serious and substantial, and not frivolous.\n\n103.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does not believe that considerations of procedural economy support bifurcation in this case. Two principal considerations lead it to this view.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n106.\n\n[REDACTED] the factual issue appears to be somewhat balanced (and not clearly likely to be resolved in one way rather than another) on the parties' submissions currently before the Tribunal (on which the parties will doubtless seek to elaborate at an appropriate stage in the future in this arbitration, perhaps by adducing relevant *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the BIT if they consider it appropriate). In light of this, the possibility that the consideration of this jurisdictional objection as a preliminary matter through a bifurcated proceeding might result in the avoidance of years of unnecessary and costly litigation must be weighed against the possibility that bifurcation to address this jurisdictional objection might simply result in additional costs and delays if the objection is rejected.\n\n107.\n\nAs to the remaining four objections, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent's arguments that the resolution of any of those objections in the Respondent's favour in a preliminary phase would result in a reduction of the scope of the merits phase significant enough to warrant bifurcation and the attendant risk of delay and additional expense. Removing one or more of the specific claims identified in the Respondent's objections would not, it appears to the Tribunal, significantly reduce the pleadings which the parties would still be required to prepare, or the overall scope of the factual matrix and expert issues that fact witnesses and experts would be asked to address.\n\n108.\n\n***Second***, the Tribunal considers that preliminary consideration of these objections to jurisdiction and admissibility appears to require consideration of factual issues that will inevitably need to be revisited in the merits phase. In particular:\n\na. The second objection (that claims concerning [REDACTED] are excluded from the dispute resolution provisions of the BIT by virtue of Article II(4)(b)) would appear to require consideration of the facts surrounding the measures in question (i.e., decisions not to permit an acquisition). The Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's suggestion that a limited aspect of those facts could be considered in a preliminary phase, with the broader context surrounding those events falling to the merits phase.\n\nb. The third objection (to jurisdiction *ratione temporis*) appears to the Tribunal to inevitably require a consideration of the facts and context underlying the specific measures in question to decide whether the four measures should be considered cumulatively as argued by the Claimant or each separately as contended by the Respondent, which will then be revisited in a merits phase. Added to this is the Claimant's position that even if certain breaches were not cumulative and fall outside the relevant time period, they are still background facts relevant to the analysis of alleged breaches that are clearly timely.\n\nc. The fourth objection (that GTH's national treatment claims are precluded by Article IV(2)(d) and its Annex of the BIT such that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over them) and the fifth objection (to the admissibility of GTH's claims stemming from the treatment of Wind Mobile) both appear to require the consideration of factual issues that may well be relevant to the merits of the case as well.\n\n109.\n\nWhile the factual questions raised by these jurisdictional and admissibility objections may to a certain extent be narrower than the facts relevant to the merits of the case, there is nevertheless a considerable potential for overlap, and the issues appear to the Tribunal to be intertwined with the merits. This gives rise to the risk that the Tribunal may be required to decide on issues of fact prematurely. Moreover, the costs associated with further briefing, tendering of evidence, and undertaking an evidentiary hearing on these issues on a preliminary basis would not be insignificant. In the Tribunal's view, the inevitable cost of multiple hearings therefore needs to actually produce real opportunities for gains in efficiency in order for bifurcation to be warranted, especially where the objections to be considered in the preliminary phase end up not to be dispositive of the case. The extent to which the Respondent's objections may require the Tribunal to consider facts that are also relevant to the merits significantly undermines any such real opportunities.\n\n110.\n\nIn sum, while the Tribunal accepts that, were the Respondent to succeed on one or more of its non-dispositive objections in a preliminary jurisdictional phase, the subsequent merits phase would be somewhat reduced in scope, it is not convinced that this would warrant the additional costs and time delays associated with a complete two-phase proceeding.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n111.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Tribunal holds as follows:\n\na. The Respondent's request to bifurcate the proceedings is denied.\n\nb. This arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the Procedural Timetable applicable to a joined proceeding, which is contained in Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1 and reproduced as Annex A of this Order.\n\nc. The question of costs is reserved."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on the Parties' Requests for Document Production)", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2018-06-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on the Parties' Requests for Document Production)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, which sets forth the procedural rules governing this arbitration. The Procedural Timetable was attached as Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1 and set out a schedule for the document production phase of the proceeding.\n\n2.\n\nIn accordance with Section 15.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 and the Procedural Timetable, on 28 March 2018, each Party served on the other Party a request for the production of documents. Subsequently, each Party set forth its objections to the other Party's requests for documents.\n\n3.\n\nOn 2 May 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were in the process of discussing their document requests with a view to reaching agreement on additional points. The Parties jointly requested that the deadline to submit the document request schedules to the Tribunal be extended by ten days.\n\n4.\n\nOn 3 May 2018, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties' agreed extension. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that the date for the Tribunal's decision on document production would need to be extended, but that all other dates on the Procedural Timetable would be maintained.\n\n5.\n\nOn 14 May 2018, each Party submitted its document production schedule to the Tribunal.1 Canada also submitted a cover letter and supporting documentation (Tabs 1-3).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant submitted its document requests in the form of a schedule with horizontal rows (Stern Schedule), as required by Section 15.2 and Annex B of Procedural Order No. 1. The Respondent, however, did not comply with Procedural Order No. 1 and filed a schedule with vertical rows, making the Tribunal's review of the Respondent's requests more cumbersome.\n\n6.\n\nOn the following day, the Claimant submitted a further, unsolicited response to the Respondent's document requests. One of the Claimant's complaints was that the Respondent had failed to record all the concessions offered by the Claimant. The Claimant submitted a redline version of the Respondent\u2019s schedule to note such concessions (in the column reserved for the Tribunal\u2019s decision).\n\n7.\n\nOn 16 May 2018, the Respondent submitted an unsolicited reply to the Claimant\u2019s message of 15 May 2018.\n\n8.\n\nIn reaching its decisions on the Parties\u2019 document requests, the Tribunal has considered all the Parties\u2019 submissions. With regard to the Claimant\u2019s unsolicited communication of 15 May 2018, the Tribunal notes that Procedural Order No. 1 provides a procedure by which a Party may apply for leave to file an unscheduled submission or evidence (see Section 16.5), and that this procedure was not followed. The Respondent, in turn, filed its response of 16 May 2018 without first seeking leave from the Tribunal. Therefore, each Party has benefited from an equal opportunity to express its position on the Respondent\u2019s document requests, and this Order takes as basis both the Respondent\u2019s schedule and the Parties\u2019 subsequent comments. Nevertheless, the Tribunal underscores that it expects strict compliance with its procedural orders in the future.\n\n**II. APPLICABLE STANDARDS AND ANALYSIS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThis arbitration is governed by (a) the ICSID Convention, (b) the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and (c) the Tribunal\u2019s procedural orders.\n\n10.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, the Parties and the Tribunal have significant freedom to determine the applicable procedure, including with respect to the production of documents.\n\n11.\n\nThe Parties agreed to a procedure for the production of documents in Section 15 of Procedural Order No. 1. In addition, Section 1.4 of Procedural Order No. 1 states as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal may seek guidance from, but shall not be bound by, the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration, in particular with respect to:\n\n(a) the exchange of documents (Article 3 of the IBA Rules, except that the confidentiality of documents shall be governed by a Confidentiality Order to be agreed by the parties);\n\n[...]\n\n(d) The admissibility and assessment of evidence (Article 9 of the IBA Rules).\n\n12.\n\nThus, in reaching the decisions contained in this Order, the Tribunal has considered, where appropriate, Article 9.2 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration, which provides:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal shall, at the request of a Party or on its own motion, exclude from evidence or production any Document, statement, oral testimony or inspection for any of the following reasons:\n\n(a) lack of sufficient relevance to the case or materiality to its outcome;\n\n(b) legal impediment or privilege under the legal or ethical rules determined by the Arbitral Tribunal to be applicable;\n\n(c) unreasonable burden to produce the requested evidence;\n\n(d) loss or destruction of the Document that has been shown with reasonable likelihood to have occurred;\n\n(e) grounds of commercial or technical confidentiality that the Arbitral Tribunal determines to be compelling;\n\n(f) grounds of special political or institutional sensitivity (including evidence that has been classified as secret by a government or a public international institution) that the Arbitral Tribunal determines to be compelling; or\n\n(g) considerations of procedural economy, proportionality, fairness or equality of the Parties that the Arbitral Tribunal determines to be compelling.\n\n13.\n\nApplying these standards, the Tribunal has deliberated and decided on each contested request as stated in the schedules that are attached as Annex A (the Claimant\u2019s Request for Documents) and Annex B (the Respondent\u2019s Request for Documents).\n\n14.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal confirms that it is not ordering the production of any document subject to legal privilege. In addition, the Tribunal notes that paragraphs 4 to 6 of the Confidentiality Order apply to documents produced in accordance with this Order.\n\n**III.DECISION**\n----------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal holds as follows:\n\na. The Tribunal decides on each document production request as stated in the last column of Annex A and Annex B. These Annexes form an integral part of the present Order.\n\nb. In accordance with the Procedural Timetable (as revised), each Party shall produce all documents ordered to be produced by 17 July 2018. If such documents become available sooner, the Parties shall produce them on a rolling basis beginning on 15 June 2018.\n\nc. The documents produced shall not be communicated to the Tribunal at this stage and shall not be considered part of the record, unless and until one of the Parties submits them as exhibits to a submission."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 4 (Decision on the Claimant's Objections to the Respondent's Claims of Privilege)", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2018-11-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 4 (Decision on the Claimant's Objections to the Respondent's Claims of Privilege)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 1 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, which set forth the Tribunal\u2019s decision on each of the Parties\u2019 respective requests for document production. In Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal stated that it was \"not ordering the production of any document subject to legal privilege.\"1\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 14.\n\n2.\n\nOn 9 October 2018, the Claimant submitted a letter to the Tribunal in which it objected to certain categories of privilege claimed by the Respondent, together with Appendices A to G (the \"Objections\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 10 October 2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal by email that it intended to submit a response to the Objections, pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph 5.3 of Procedural Order No. 1. By email of 11 October 2018, the Tribunal took note of both the Objections and the Respondent\u2019s email.\n\n4.\n\nOn 17 October 2018, the Respondent submitted an electronic copy of its response to the Objections (the \"Response\"). The Respondent subsequently dispatched a hard copy of the Response, together with Legal Authorities RL-243 to 255 and Exhibits R-265 to 292, to ICSID and the Members of the Tribunal. In doing so, the Respondent relied on paragraph 13 of Procedural Order No. 1, which allows seven days between the electronic and hardcopy filing of a submission. Consequently, the Members of the Tribunal received the submission only after 24 October 2018.\n\n5.\n\nIn the cover letter submitted with the Response, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that there are outstanding issues related to the Claimant\u2019s production of documents and privilege claims. The Respondent stated:\n\nUntil such time as GTH provides the requested additional details and completes its document production, Canada is not in a position to determine whether and to what extent the Claimant\u2019s privilege claims comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No.1 and the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration [(the \"IBA Rules\")] and therefore reserves its right to bring a challenge in this respect.\n\n6.\n\nAs the Respondent has not made any application to the Tribunal in respect of the Claimant\u2019s document production, this Order does not address the matter.\n\n7.\n\nFollowing receipt of the Response, the Claimant did not seek leave to submit a rejoinder in response to the Respondent\u2019s defense of its privilege claims. Therefore, the Tribunal has proceeded with its consideration of the Parties\u2019 submissions on this issue (briefly summarised in Section II) in light of the applicable standards (Section III). For the reasons stated in Section IV, the Tribunal issues the Decision contained in Section V.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. The Objections**\n---------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is that the Respondent is in breach of its disclosure obligations set forth in Procedural Order No. 3 because the Respondent has withheld or redacted documents on the basis of impermissible categories of legal privilege. Specifically, the Claimant disputes four categories of privilege claimed by the Respondent: \"Cabinet Confidence,\" \"Deliberative Process,\" \"Third Parties in Confidence,\" and \"National Security.\"2 The Claimant requests that the Tribunal order the production of the documents withheld by the Respondent on these bases.3\n\nObjections, p. 2. The Claimant explains that it first communicated its concerns with the Respondent\u2019s privilege claims to the Respondent by letter of 21 September 2018 (Objections, Appendix B). The Respondent replied on 26 September 2018, stating that it would not produce any further documents (Objections, Appendix C).\n\nObjections, p. 5.\n\n9.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules,4 which can essentially be relied upon only by a respondent State, must be construed and applied narrowly.5 In the Claimant\u2019s view, a respondent is not entitled to withhold documents merely because they are \"sensitive\" under domestic law. Rather, the respondent must show that the documents have a \"special\" sensitivity, which is found compelling by the Tribunal.\n\nSee the text at \u00b6 35 below.\n\nObjections, p. 2, *citing* *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. The Commonwealth of Australia,* PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 12, 14 November 2014, \u00b6 4.6.\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, based on the information it has, there is no indication of a compelling reason for the Respondent to withhold or redact the documents at issue, because:\n\na. Although most of the documents are more than five years old, the Respondent has not shown why they remain sensitive;\n\nb. In light of the Confidentiality Order governing this proceeding, the Respondent has \"fail[ed] to explain why the protection of a Confidential or even a Restricted Access designation could not resolve its concerns related to institutional confidence or national security\";\n\nc. There is no basis for the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant bears the burden of showing that the documents are important to its case, especially considering that a determination on the documents\u2019 relevance and materiality has already been made; and\n\nd. The Respondent has provided examples of redacted portions of documents without explaining how such information falls within Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules.6\n\nObjections, p. 3.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimant also advances specific arguments relating to each of the four challenged categories of privilege, as summarised in the following paragraphs.\n\n12.\n\n*Cabinet Confidence:* According to the Claimant, this is a principle of domestic law, which is inapplicable in this case, and the Respondent has failed to show how the documents it withheld or redacted fall within Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules. Indeed, the relevant documents appear to be less sensitive than documents reflecting the actual deliberations of cabinet members. The Claimant asserts that the content of these documents relates directly to aspects of its claim.7\n\nObjections, p. 4.\n\n13.\n\n*Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission* (\"CRTC\") *Deliberative Process Privilege* : The Claimant states that the documents withheld or redacted on this basis \"appear to be memoranda, notes, and presentations relating to legislative amendments to the Telecommunications Act dating from approximately 3-5 years ago.\"8 In the Claimant's view, the Respondent has failed to show that this information is compellingly sensitive and cannot be protected under the Confidentiality Order.9\n\nObjections, p. 4.\n\nObjections, pp. 4-5.\n\n14.\n\n*Third Parties in Confidence:* The Claimant states that \"[t]here is no basis under the IBA Rules to redact for third parties' confidential information, and particularly in this case where there is a confidentiality order in place.\"10\n\nObjections, p. 5.\n\n15.\n\n*National Security* : The Claimant argues that the Respondent has failed to support its position that it may withhold documents by merely invoking national security. [REDACTED]11\n\nObjections, p. 5.\n\n**B. The Response**\n-------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal reject the Claimant's challenge to the Respondent's privilege claims.12 According to the Respondent, the Objections \"are based on a mischaracterization of both the applicable legal standard and Canada's approach to asserting privilege.\"13\n\nResponse, \u00b6 66.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 3.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent's position is that its privilege claims fall well within Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules. For the Respondent, this provision \"reflects the commonly accepted principle in international arbitration that the confidentiality of certain particularly sensitive documents related to decisions made by governments must be maintained and that their production may be resisted.\"14 The Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s assertion that Article 9.2(f) must be read narrowly. Rather, as noted by the Tribunal in *Bilcon v. Canada,* the correct approach when deciding whether certain information can be withheld is to balance the public interest in protecting the information against the importance of the information for the claimant\u2019s case.15\n\nResponse, \u00b6 4, *citing* **RL-243**, Nathan D. O\u2019Malley, *Rules of Evidence in International Arbitration, an annotated guide* (Informa, London, 2012), \u00b6 9.92.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 6, *citing* **RL-244**, *Bilcon of Delaware et. al. v. The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 13, 11 July 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 22-26.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent explains that its counsel has therefore \"aimed to disclose the maximum amount of information possible while protecting the institutional sensitivity at issue.\"16 For each document, counsel considered whether to withhold information in light of the following five factors:\n\n1) the Claimant\u2019s interest in the disclosure of the information to advance its case as set out in its pleadings including the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Merits and Damages; 2) the importance of the particular institutional sensitivity at issue as reflected in the statutory protection accorded under Canadian law; 3) the disclosure or availability of non-privileged evidence with related content; 4) the provisions of the Tribunal\u2019s Confidentiality Order, particularly those concerning confidential and restricted access designations; and 5) the length of time since the creation of the document or transmittal of the communication.17\n\nResponse, \u00b6 7.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 6.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it has not improperly relied on its domestic law in asserting privilege, as alleged by the Claimant. In the Respondent\u2019s view, its domestic laws are helpful in providing evidence of the sensitivity of certain documents and to explain the Respondent\u2019s claims of privilege under Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules.18\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent then proceeds to explain each of the six categories of privilege it has asserted under Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules, as summarised in the following paragraphs.\n\n21.\n\n*Confidences of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada* : The Respondent seeks to withhold \"Cabinet confidences\" on the basis of their political and institutional sensitivity.19 In the Respondent's view, \"the importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of deliberative and decision-making documents of governments is well settled in international investment law.\"20 Cabinet deliberations, in particular, must be kept secret in support of free and frank discussions among Ministers and their \"collective responsibility.\" Thus, Respondent argues that tribunals have consistently held that such information falls within Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules.21\n\nResponse, \u00b6 12.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 11, *citing* **RL-248**, *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States of America* (UNCITRAL) Decision on Parties' Requests for Production of Documents Withheld on the Grounds of Privilege, 17 November 2005, \u00b6 36.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 14, *citing* **RL-249**, *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Decision of the Tribunal on Production of Documents, 18 July 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18; **RL-250**, *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v.

The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 3, 8 April 2009, \u00b6 54; **RL-244**, *Bilcon of Delaware et. al. v. The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 13, 11 July 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 22-26.\n\n22.\n\nIn response to the Claimant's arguments, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has mischaracterized the type of documents withheld under this category.22 Further, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's view that only documents recording actual deliberations of the Cabinet may be withheld; rather, in its view, \"certain types of information that surround and feed into the Cabinet decision-making process or prepare a Minister in relation to that process must also be protected.\"23 Finally, the Respondent does not accept that the age of the document is a reason for disclosure.\n\nThe Respondent states that it has withheld the following types of information: \"memoranda and briefing material the purpose of which is to present proposals or recommendations to Cabinet; agenda of Cabinet, minutes and records of decisions of Cabinet; documents that consist of or reflect communications or discussions between ministers of the Crown on matters relating to the making of government decisions or the formulation of government policy; departmental briefing notes and communications between civil servants concerning material or matters to be discussed or proposed to be discussed at Cabinet; and draft legislation\" (Response, \u00b6 16).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 17.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent's final point regarding Cabinet confidences is that many documents withheld under this category are also privileged as attorney-client communications under Article 9.2(b) of the IBA Rules or national security information under Article 9.2(f).24\n\nResponse, \u00b6 21.\n\n24.\n\n*National Security* : The Respondent has withheld or redacted a number of documents on the basis that disclosure of the information would be injurious to Canada's national security. The Respondent asserts that there are many different reasons that disclosure of certain information might threaten national security and provides several examples. According to the Respondent, such information is particularly sensitive and deserving of protection. This ground for secrecy is recognized in the domestic legislation of Canada and many other States, and it has been upheld repeatedly by international tribunals.25\n\nResponse, \u00b6 24.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent describes the process by which it identified information subject to privilege on the ground of national security, and asserts that it has \"acted in good faith and undertaken due diligence,\" seeking to disclose as much information as possible.26 In the Respondent's view, its agencies are best placed to determine what information touches on national security; the Tribunal must not second guess the Government's opinion on the matter.27\n\nResponse, \u00b6 30.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 32.\n\n26.\n\nIn response to the Objections, the Respondent also makes the following arguments:\n\na. In weighing the Claimant's interest in disclosure against the risk to national security, it should be noted that \"information in this arbitration relates to purely economic interests that are by their very nature less fundamental\" than interests such as human rights.28\n\nb. Disclosure of the information that the Respondent has withheld is unlikely to advance the Claimant's case. Thus, the Claimant's request for an adverse inference is \"premature, unjustified in the circumstances and must be rejected.\"29\n\nc. Considering the limited scope of the information withheld, there is no interference with the Claimant's right to a fair trial.\n\nd. The Claimant's arguments concerning the lack of details provided by the Respondent for its national security privilege claims are misplaced. The Respondent is unable to provide further details, as that would allow inferences to be made about the privileged material, thereby threatening national security.30\n\nResponse, \u00b6 33.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 34.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 36.\n\n27.\n\n*Confidential Deliberations of the CRTC Commissioners* : The Respondent has claimed privilege over document that \"directly relate to the decision making process by the [CRTC] Commissioners.\"31 According to the Respondent, the CRTC is an administrative tribunal, which performs an adjudicative function. Therefore, information reflecting the confidential deliberations of the CRTC Commissioners is subject to deliberative secrecy and must be withheld.32 The Respondent's position is summarised as follows:\n\nThere is a compelling institutional sensitivity related to the independence of the CRTC and its ability to discharge its mandate that warrants non-production of the documents over which Canada has claimed privilege. Producing these documents would have the same chilling effects that courts have consistently warned against. The disclosure of the confidential deliberations of the CRTC Commissioners would compromise their decision-making process on matters falling with the CRTC's mandate.33\n\nResponse, \u00b6 44.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 37-44.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 45.\n\n28.\n\n*Communication Submitted by Third Parties to the CRTC in confidence pursuant to s. 39 of the Telecommunications Act* : The Respondent has claimed privilege with respect to commercially sensitive information submitted by third parties in confidence to the CRTC. In the Respondent's view, \"disclosure of this information risks harming the financial position of these enterprises, and may inhibit or discourage third parties from providing information to the CRTC that it requires to discharge its mandate.\"34 For this reason, the Canadian Telecommunications Act prohibits disclosure of this confidential information, except in very limited circumstances.35 Further, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to show how the confidential information in the CTRC's possession is material to its claim.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 50.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 49, *citing* **C-046**, *Telecommunications Act*, s. 39.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent notes that it considered the Confidentiality Order when considering whether to disclose this information. However, in light of the considerations above, it determined that the interest in non-disclosure outweighs the Claimant's interest in disclosure.36\n\nResponse, \u00b6 53.\n\n30.\n\n*Confidential Information in the Possession of the Competition Bureau* : The Respondent has also claimed privilege with respect to \"highly sensitive third party confidential information collected by the Competition Bureau in the context of its work reviewing mergers and acquisitions.\"37 The Respondent points out that such information is protected from disclosure under the Canadian Competition Act.38 It argues that this information also falls within Article 9.29(f) of the IBA Rules because of the \"institutional sensitivity related to the Bureau's ability to carry out its core mandate,\"39 as disclosure would discourage third parties from providing this important information to the Bureau in the future. In addition, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant has failed to show how the information withheld is material to its claim.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 55.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, *citing* **R-106**, *Competition Act*, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34, s. 29.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 61.\n\n31.\n\nAgain, the Respondent notes that it has considered the Confidentiality Order, but that the interest in non-disclosure still outweighs any competing interest.\n\n32.\n\n*Information Obtained by Government Officials with Respect to a Third Party in the Course of the Administration or Enforcement of the Investment Canada Act* : The Respondent has withheld three documents and redacted two others which \"contained information obtained by government officials with respect to a third party in the course of the administration or enforcement of the Investment Canada Act.\"40 The Respondent argues that the release of such information is prohibited under Canadian law and raises a \"significant systemic sensitivity.\"41 Because the Respondent considers this information immaterial to the Claimant\u2019s case, it has determined that the interest in non-disclosure outweighs any potential benefit to the Claimant.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 64.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n\n**III APPLICABLE STANDARDS**\n----------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThis arbitration is governed by (a) the ICSID Convention, (b) the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and (c) the Tribunal\u2019 s procedural orders.\n\n34.\n\nThe Parties agreed to a procedure for the production of documents in Section 15 of Procedural Order No. 1. In addition, Section 1.4 of Procedural Order No. 1 states as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal may seek guidance from, but shall not be bound by, the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration, in particular with respect to:\n\n[...]\n\n(d) The admissibility and assessment of evidence (Article 9 of the IBA Rules).\n\n35.\n\nThus, in considering the Objections, the Tribunal has referred, where appropriate, to Article 9.2 of the IBA Rules. In particular, the Tribunal has assessed the Respondent\u2019s privilege claims in light of Article 9.2(f), which provides:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal shall, at the request of a Party or on its own motion, exclude from evidence or production any Document, statement, oral testimony or inspection for any of the following reasons:\n\n[...]\n\n(f) grounds of special political or institutional sensitivity (including evidence that has been classified as secret by a government or a public international institution) that the Arbitral Tribunal determines to be compelling...\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that, as stated in footnote 4 of the Objections, the Claimant does not dispute the Respondent\u2019s claim for solicitor-client privilege at this time.42 The Tribunal also notes that, as mentioned above, the Respondent\u2019s reference to the Claimant\u2019s failure to fully comply with its document production obligations43 has been made merely by way of reservation, without asking the Tribunal to decide anything at this stage. The Tribunal therefore does not take any decision on those matters.\n\nObjections, n. 4.\n\nCover Letter to the Response, pp. 1-2.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed and reached a decision on the six categories of privilege claimed by the Respondent pursuant to Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules, namely: 1. Cabinet confidences, 2. National security, 3. Deliberative process (CRTC), 4. Third parties in confidence (CRTC), 5. Confidential information in the possession of the Competition Bureau (Competition Act), and 6. Information obtained by the Government in relation to the enforcement of the Investment Canada Act (ICA).\n\n38.\n\nIn reviewing the Response, the Tribunal found no evidence of bad faith in terms of a selective assertion of privilege or otherwise. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent has exhibited a number of government memoranda in support of its Counter-Memorial, and has stated in the Response that it produced more than 200 additional memoranda, many without redaction.44 Moreover, the Tribunal is given no reason to believe that the Respondent has acted contrary to its assertion that it balanced its public interest in protecting the information with the Claimant\u2019s need of the information to advance its case.45\n\nResponse, \u00b6 16.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 15.\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent that Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules is predicated to a certain extent on domestic law directing the classification of evidence as a secret by a government. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the degree of political or institutional sensitivity must be measured to a certain extent by reference to domestic law.\n\n40.\n\nReviewing in turn the Claimant\u2019s objections and the Respondent\u2019s defenses, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n41.\n\n*Cabinet Confidences* : The Tribunal does not consider that any deliberative and decisionmaking documents of governments fall automatically within the scope of Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules. That said, the Tribunal has been given no evidence of a blanket refusal by the Respondent on this ground. In particular, the Tribunal notes the following relevant points:\n\na. The five-year limitation period alleged by the Claimant is not persuasive. A government document may remain politically sensitive several years after it is issued depending on its nature and the public interest that it seeks to protect.\n\nb. The Respondent asserts that many documents falling within the scope of Cabinet Confidence privilege are also solicitor-client-privileged.46 This privilege ground is not contested by the Claimant and the Tribunal accepts it.\n\nc. The Claimant\u2019s assertion that Ministers\u2019 briefing reports or government staff emails are unmeritorious of Cabinet Confidence privilege is not persuasive.47 The Tribunal accepts that, depending on their terms and the public interest that they seek to protect, those documents may directly or indirectly relate to Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules situations and merit protection as such.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 21.\n\nObjections, p. 4.\n\n42.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal orders the Respondent to review all responsive documents that it has withheld or redacted on this ground of privilege and to ensure that its privilege log (a) includes all redacted documents as well as those withheld in full, and (b) for those documents withheld in full, states that the asserted privilege cannot be adequately safeguarded through redaction(s).\n\n43.\n\n*National Security:* In deciding on this matter, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent\u2019s assertion of national security privilege is not a case of a blanket refusal, as evidenced by its production of 235 documents responsive to [REDACTED]48 which excludes bad faith. The Tribunal also notes that, of those documents, the Respondent redacted 128 and withheld a further 27 on national security grounds, asserting Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules for each instance of withheld information. The Respondent explains in great detail how it determined that the release of each withheld information \"would\" (not \"could\") be injurious to its national security.49\n\nResponse, n. 18.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 32.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the age of a document alone does not cure national security concerns; nor has the Claimant provided any persuasive reasoning or compelling authority to show why the passing of time sets aside any national security interest.\n\n45.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal orders the Respondent to review all responsive documents that it has withheld or redacted on this ground of privilege and to ensure that its privilege log (a) includes all redacted documents as well as those withheld in full, and (b) for those documents withheld in full, states that the asserted privilege cannot be adequately safeguarded through redaction(s).\n\n46.\n\n*Deliberative Process (CRTC)* : The Respondent has asserted this category of privilege under Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules as a basis for redacting the document contained in Appendix E to the Objections and for withholding additional documents listed in its privilege log. The Claimant argues that CRTC deliberative process privilege is one of national law and that the Respondent has not provided evidence that the information is sensitive or reasons to justify withholding it.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent submits, without being challenged, that CRTC is a tribunal and performs an adjudicative function.50 Moreover, the Respondent underscores that it is claiming the deliberative process privilege only in relation to the CRTC Commissioners' deliberation to render an adjudicatory decision, not in relation to the secretariat and staff who are not involved in the decision-making process.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n\n48.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal orders the Respondent to review all responsive documents that it has withheld or redacted on this ground of privilege and to ensure that its privilege log (a) includes all redacted documents as well as those withheld in full, and (b) for those documents withheld in full, states that the asserted privilege cannot be adequately safeguarded through redaction(s).\n\n49.\n\n*Third Parties in Confidence (CRTC)* : The Claimant summarily dismisses the Respondent's assertion of privilege on the ground of Article 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules as concerns information submitted in confidence by third party to the CRTC. In doing so, the Claimant only refers to that privilege as being one of domestic law. After considering the Claimant's argument, the Tribunal concludes that it cannot exclude a privilege claim merely because it rests on grounds of domestic law. Depending on the facts and the circumstances of the case, some of those privileges merit recognition by international tribunals. Legal privilege is one; so is the case of privileged communication between regulators and the regulated entities in regulated sectors.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent's argument that the Claimant fails to evidence that the confidential information in the possession of CRTC is material to its claim.51 The Claimant is not required to do so, given that the Tribunal has previously ordered the production of responsive documents. Rather, the Tribunal upholds the Respondent's defense on the ground that s.39 of the Telecommunications Act allows a person to submit to CRTC information that it can designate as being confidential, and assures that person that such information shall not be disclosed.52 Legitimate expectations of third parties merit protection outside extraordinary circumstances that might compel to ignorance. No such circumstances have been evidenced to the Tribunal.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 52.\n\n**C-046**, *Telecommunications Act*, s. 39(2).\n\n51.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal orders the Respondent to review all responsive documents that it has withheld or redacted on this ground of privilege and to ensure that its privilege log (a) includes all redacted documents as well as those withheld in full; (b) asserts expressly that each of those documents, or portions thereof, are privileged because they specifically fall under s.39(1)(a), (b) or (c) of the Telecommunications Act, as may be the case for each instance of withheld information, and thus fall under Article 9.2(f) and/or Article 9.2(b) of the IBA Rules; and (c) for those documents withheld in full, states that the asserted privilege cannot be adequately safeguarded through redaction(s).\n\n52.\n\n*Confidential information in the possession of the Competition Bureau (Competition Act):* The same argument advanced by the Respondent to protect information collected in confidence by CRTC is likewise advanced to protect information held by the Competition Bureau in similar circumstances. The Claimant did not include in its Objections a specific challenge to the Competition Act protection of confidential information.\n\n53.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal notes the Respondent\u2019s production of a significant number of responsive documents pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 3 in relation to document request 15, and upholds the defense that the Respondent advances under the Competition Act for the same reasons that it upheld the Respondent\u2019s defense in relation to the Telecommunications Act.\n\n54.\n\n*Information obtained by the Government in relation to the enforcement of the Investment Canada Act* : The Claimant also did not include in its Objections a specific challenge to this ground of privilege.\n\n55.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to the situation under the Telecommunications Act, s.36 ICA does not relate to protecting the legitimate expectation of persons which have labeled the information that they transmitted to the Ministry of Innovation as \"confidential\" in reliance on the statute. The Tribunal also notes that s.36 does not fall under Part IV. 1 of ICA, which deals with National Security. Rather, it falls under Part VI, General Regulation. Moreover, s.36 ICA provides for a long list of exceptions allowing the Minister to disclose the information, including, in 3.1, to an \"investigative body\" for \"that body's lawful investigation.\" Furthermore, contrary to its arguments in relation to its other claims for privilege listed above, the Respondent only refers to unparticularized potential hinderance to cooperative disclosure by foreign investors.53\n\nResponse, \u00b6 64.\n\n56.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal recalls Procedural Order No. 3 and affirms its order for the Respondent to produce responsive documents.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n57.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal holds as follows:\n\na. In relation to all responsive documents falling within the six categories listed above, the Tribunal confirms that if the Respondent, in conducting its review of withheld and redacted documents, finds any documents that do not fall within Article 9.2(b) or 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules in light of the Tribunal's guidance above, those documents must be produced by Monday, 12 November 2018.\n\nb.

BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, setting forth the procedural rules governing this arbitration. The Procedural Timetable was attached as Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1 and set out a schedule for the document production phase of the proceeding.\n\n2.\n\nIn accordance with Section 15.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 and the Procedural Timetable, on 28 March 2018, each Party served on the other Party a request for the production of documents. Subsequently, each Party set forth its objections to the other Party's requests for documents and then its responses to the other Party's objections. On 14 May 2018, each Party submitted its document production schedule to the Tribunal.\n\n3.\n\nOn 1 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, which set forth the Tribunal's decision on each of the Parties' respective requests for document production. In Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal stated that it was \"not ordering the production of any document subject to legal privilege.\"1\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00a7 14.\n\n4.\n\nOn 9 October 2018, the Claimant submitted a letter to the Tribunal in which it objected to certain categories of privilege claimed by the Respondent. On 17 October 2018, the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimant's objections. The Respondent also informed the Tribunal that there were outstanding issues related to the Claimant's production of documents and privilege claims, but it made no application to the Tribunal in this regard.\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 November 2018, the Respondent submitted a letter in which it argued that the \"Claimant's document production is incomplete and inadequate, and that the Claimant withheld or redacted information on the basis of overly-broad and inappropriate privilege claims.\"2 The Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant to conduct a document-by document review and to produce several categories of documents over which the Claimant had asserted privilege. The Respondent also asked the Tribunal to \"modify the procedural timetable by placing a stay on further proceedings, including submission deadlines and the hearing, until the Tribunal has an adequate opportunity to address these issues.\"3\n\nRespondent's letter of 2 November 2018, p. 11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 2 November 2018, p. 1.\n\n6.\n\nOn 3 November 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, setting forth its decision on the Claimant\u2019s objections to the Respondent\u2019s privilege claims. The Tribunal instructed the Respondent to conduct a review of withheld and redacted documents, and to produce any documents that did not fall within Article 9.2(b) or 9.2(f) of the IBA Rules in light of the guidance provided by the Tribunal in that Order.\n\n7.\n\nIn the cover email to Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to comment on the Respondent\u2019s letter of 2 November 2018, regarding both the Respondent\u2019s objections and the proposed stay. The Tribunal also asked for an update with respect to the outstanding issue of publication of the procedural orders.\n\n8.\n\nOn 5 November 2018, the Claimant submitted its Reply on Merits and Damages & Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of 8 November 2018, the Respondent (a) sought an extension to the deadline for its compliance with Procedural Order No. 4; (b) informed the Tribunal that the Parties had reached agreement on the redaction and publication of Procedural Order No. 3; and (c) identified a number of disagreements between the Parties regarding the designation of information as Confidential or Restricted Access Information in Procedural Order No. 2 and the Parties\u2019 submissions.\n\n10.\n\nOn 10 November 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties in response to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 8 November 2018. The Tribunal (a) granted the extension requested by the Respondent; (b) confirmed that Procedural Order No. 3 would be published without its Annexes as agreed by the Parties; and (c) set a pleading schedule for the issue of the designation of information as Confidential or Restricted Access Information.\n\n11.\n\nOne 12 November 2018, the Claimant submitted two letters. The first letter responded to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 2 November 2018 concerning the Claimant\u2019s production of documents and privilege claims. The second letter was in response to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 8 November 2018 concerning the designation of information as Confidential or Restricted Access Information.\n\n12.\n\nBy email of 14 November 2018, the Respondent sought leave to respond to the Claimant\u2019s letter of 12 November 2018 concerning the Claimant\u2019s privilege claims.\n\n13.\n\nOn 15 November 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, noting its concern with the multiplication of submissions and replies in relation to privilege claims at this stage of the proceeding. The Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided not to grant the Respondent leave for a further submission, and would instead convene a procedural telephone conference to discuss with the Parties a means to ensure the production of responsive documents within a useful time period while retaining the agreed hearing dates in April 2019.\n\n14.\n\nOn 16 November 2018, the Respondent submitted its reply on the issue of confidentiality, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions of 10 November 2018.\n\n15.\n\nOn 19 November 2018, the President held the case management teleconference with the Parties. An audio recording of the teleconference was made available to the Parties and the Tribunal following the call. During the teleconference, at the invitation of the President, the Parties agreed to take a number of steps aimed at completing the document production phase as efficiently as possible.\n\n16.\n\nBy email of 21 November 2018, the Claimant provided a list of in-house counsel who appear on the documents disclosed on the Claimant\u2019s privilege logs, identifying the jurisdictions in which they are qualified.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of 22 November 2018, the Tribunal reminded the Parties of the various steps agreed during the case management teleconference.\n\n18.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 22 November 2018, the Claimant submitted a letter on 25 November 2018 in which it confirmed its view that each of the in-house attorneys listed in its email of 21 November 2018 was qualified in at least one jurisdiction that recognizes that attorney-client privilege attaches to communications with in-house counsel.\n\n19.\n\nAlso in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 22 November 2018, the Respondent submitted a letter on 25 November in which it provided a more detailed explanation regarding the two remaining documents over which it asserts privilege under the Investment Canada Act.\n\n20.\n\nOn 29 November 2018, the Respondent submitted the Parties\u2019 Stern Schedule addressing their respective positions on the disputed issues regarding Claimant\u2019s assertion of legal privilege. The Respondent noted that in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, the Claimant first completed its entries in the Stern Schedule and the Respondent then replied to the Claimant\u2019s submissions. The Respondent noted that the Claimant had reserved the right to seek the Tribunal\u2019s leave to respond to new arguments raised in the Respondent\u2019s submissions.\n\n21.\n\nOn 2 December 2018, the Claimant wrote further to the Respondent\u2019s message of 29 November 2018. The Claimant noted that its positions in the Stern Schedule did not take account of the Respondent\u2019s new arguments or Annex I, and that the Claimant would be available if the Tribunal wished to hear Claimant\u2019s position on these matters.\n\n22.\n\nOn 3 December 2018, the Claimant wrote on behalf of the Parties in response to the Tribunal\u2019s request to receive an update on the Parties\u2019 discussions concerning the redactions to Procedural Order No. 2. The Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties were in the process of negotiating the scope of issues that will remain confidential during the course of the proceedings. The Claimant stated that, in the event the Parties were unable to reach an agreement in this regard, they expected to narrow the issues for the Tribunal\u2019s consideration by 7 December 2018.\n\n23.\n\nOn 7 December 2018, the Claimant confirmed that the Parties had agreed to the redactions for Procedural Order No. 2, and provided the non-confidential version of the Order. The Tribunal commends the Parties for their efforts at reaching a consensus on this matter.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the outstanding issues of legal privilege as set forth in the Parties' Stern Schedule. Following its deliberations, the Tribunal has decided on each issue and included its decision in the Schedule.\n\n25.\n\nWith regard to the Respondent's assertion of privilege under the Investment Canada Act, the Tribunal has taken note of the Respondent's further explanation in its letter of 25 November 2018. In light of that explanation, and considering that the Tribunal has not been asked to determine any dispute regarding the Respondent's assertion of this privilege, the Tribunal has decided to reverse its order in paragraph 56 of Procedural Order No. 4 with respect to the two remaining documents that the Respondent has withheld under the Investment Canada Act. The Respondent is no longer obligated to produce these two documents.\n\n**II. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal holds as follows:\n\na. The Tribunal decides on each issue of privilege as stated in the final row of the Stern Schedule attached as Annex A. This Annex forms an integral part of the present Order.\n\nb.

In doing so, the Parties should ensure that the hearing dates (Step N on the Procedural Timetable) are maintained. Absent notification by Thursday, 20 December 2018 to the Tribunal of an agreed production date, each Party shall submit what it considers to be a realistic date (keeping in mind Step N) and the Tribunal will set the deadline. In any event, the Claimant is expected to start its review forthwith.\n\nc. The Respondent is not obligated to produce the remaining two documents with respect to which it asserts privilege under the Investment Canada Act.\n\nd.

BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 13 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, containing its decision on each outstanding issue of legal privilege that had been identified by the Parties in their Stern Schedule dated 29 November 2018.1\n\nProcedural Order No. 5 sets forth in detail the procedural history relating to the Parties' various disputes over matters of legal privilege.\n\n2.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 5, the Tribunal addressed the Parties' submissions on whether there is an exception to the waiver of privilege where parties have a common interest.2 The Tribunal held that, \"the onus is on GTH to demonstrate that the law applicable to privilege for each communication recognises common interest privilege *and* that the communication qualifies for common interest privilege\".3 GTH was granted leave to present evidence concerning the attachment of common interest privilege for each relevant communication, provided that it did so without delay.4\n\nProcedural Order No. 5, Annex A, pp. 19-20, Outstanding Issue 1, sub-question (iii) (\"Waiver of attorney-client privilege through disclosure of legal advice across separate legal entities, and exceptions for common interest, if any, under each applicable law\").\n\nProcedural Order No. 5, Annex A, p. 20.\n\n*Id.* The Tribunal noted that, in light of its decision that in-house counsel admitted in Egypt may not assert legal privilege, \"GTH is only required to demonstrate the two-pronged qualification as concerns the attachment of common interest privilege for the relevant communications under the law of England and Wales and, separately, the law of the Netherlands and that of New Zealand\".\n\n3.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 5, the Tribunal also noted that if the Parties sought further guidance or a determination from the Tribunal in relation to limited waivers of legal privilege, the Tribunal would require better particularised pleadings in this respect.5 The Tribunal stated as follows:\n\nIt is open to the Parties to provide evidence that privilege has not been waived in total or in part by such disclosure of information under the relevant applicable law in the case of each disputed communication. Such evidence can only be contemplated in relation to the rules of privilege in Canada, the United States, England and Wales, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, as the Tribunal has already determined that privilege rules in Egypt do not allow in-house counsel to claim privilege, let alone to claim entitlement thereto following disclosure to third persons.6\n\nProcedural Order No. 5, Annex A, pp. 21-22, Outstanding Issue 1, sub-question (iv) (\"Waiver of attorney-client privilege through disclosure of legal advice to third parties, and limited waiver protections, if any, under each applicable law\").\n\nProcedural Order No. 5, Annex A, p. 22.\n\n4.\n\nBy email of 20 December 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it planned to make submissions with respect to common interest privilege and limited waiver of privilege, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 5, by 23 December 2018.\n\n5.\n\nIn its response of 21 December 2018, the Tribunal encouraged the Parties to attempt to reach an agreement in relation to common interest privilege and limited waiver of privilege. The Tribunal instructed the Parties that, if they were unable to reach such an agreement, they should agree to a briefing schedule on these issues that would not alter the date of the hearing. The Tribunal further directed the Parties to make precise submissions in the form of a Stern Schedule.\n\n6.\n\nOn 7 January 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had been unable to reach agreement on the remaining issues of legal privilege. On behalf of the Parties, the Respondent submitted the Stern Schedule containing the Parties' respective positions on these matters. In addition to their submissions on common interest privilege and limited waiver of privilege, the Parties also made submissions on subject matter waiver of privilege, and sought the Tribunal's guidance on this issue.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant subsequently informed the Tribunal that its supporting documentation had not been properly numbered in the Stern Schedule and filed a corrected version.\n\n8.\n\nBy email of 8 January 2019, the Tribunal acknowledged its receipt of the Parties' Stern Schedule and confirmed that it would work from the corrected version submitted by the Claimant.\n\n**II.

BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 1 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, which set forth the Tribunal\u2019s decision on each of the Parties\u2019 respective requests for document production.\n\n2.\n\nSince the issuance of Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal has issued Procedural Order Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 8, addressing the Parties\u2019 disputes on issues of legal privilege.\n\n3.\n\nOn 18 March 2019, GTH wrote to the Tribunal, challenging the completeness of the Respondent\u2019s document production pursuant to Procedural Order No. 3. Together with its letter, GTH submitted Appendices A to M and exhibit C-257. GTH informed the Tribunal that, in July 2016, its Canadian counsel had submitted a request to the Ministry for Innovation, Science and Economic Development (\"**ISED**\")1 pursuant to Canada\u2019s Access to Information Act. In November 2016, GTH\u2019s Canadian counsel challenged ISED\u2019s response with the Information Commissioner. According to GTH, the Commissioner found the complaint to be well founded, and *\"noted that over 500,000 pages of documents have been identified as potentially relevant, but had not yet been reviewed.*\"2 Then, on 8 March 2019, GTH\u2019s Canadian counsel received 625 pages (55 documents) from ISED (the \"**ATI Documents**\"). GTH alleges that \"*at least 15 of the newly received ATI documents had not been produced to GTH in the Arbitration despite their obvious relevance to several of the issues in dispute,\"* and considers this *\"clear evidence that Canada's productions were deficient.*\"3\n\nISED was formerly known as Industry Canada.\n\nGTH\u2019s Letter of 18 March 2019, p. 3 and **Appendix A**, Letter from Information Commissioner of Canada to Aird & Berlis, 14 December 2018, pp. 5-6.\n\nGTH\u2019s Letter of 18 March 2019, p. 3.\n\n4.\n\nIn light of this issue, GTH requests the following relief:\n\nIn the first instance, GTH respectfully requests that the Tribunal order Canada to confirm the following:\n\ni. That Canada\u2019s document collection efforts to comply with its obligations under PO 3, involved the collection and review of the 500,000 pages identified by ISED as potentially responsive to Ms. Backman's ATI requests.\n\nii. That Canada undertook good faith efforts to ensure that all relevant documents responsive to PO 3 were collected and reviewed, and to detail the procedure used, including the steps undertaken to collect and review electronic records and to preserve the parent-attachment relationships in both electronic and hard copy records.\n\niii. That Canada has produced all draft documents responsive to PO 3, where the draft is not an exact duplicate of a document already produced.\n\nIn the event Canada is unable to confirm the above (or its confirmation is unsatisfactory), GTH respectfully further requests that the Tribunal order Canada to immediately remedy the deficiencies in its disclosure, undertake a review of any documents not yet reviewed that could be responsive to GTH's document requests, and produce such documents as soon as possible. If Canada fails to do so, the Tribunal should be willing to adopt the appropriate adverse inferences with respect to any such failures.\n\n(...) in the interest of procedural fairness and propriety, as well as parity of arms, in the event that Canada produces additional documents as a result of its earlier failure to satisfy its disclosure obligations, GTH respectfully requests permission to submit additional factual exhibits on the record either as part of the post-hearing submission process (if any) or as standalone exhibits.4\n\nGTH's Letter of 18 March 2019, p. 5.\n\n5.\n\nUpon receipt of GTH's letter, the President of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to encourage them to confer together with an aim to reaching a consensus on the matters outlined in GTH's letter. In the event the Parties were unable to agree, the President invited Canada to provide its response by open of business on 22 March 2019 (Washington, D.C. time).\n\n6.\n\nBy email of 22 March 2019, Canada informed the Tribunal that the Parties were still consulting in an attempt to resolve the matters addressed in GTH's letter, and requested a one-day extension to file its response. Canada noted that GTH had consented to the extension request. On the same day, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that the extension was granted.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 23 March 2019, Canada informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable to resolve their disagreement and set out its response to GTH's letter of 18 March 2019. Together with its letter, Canada submitted Appendices A and B. Appendix A contained a Schedule of both Parties' positions on each of the 15 ATI Documents that GTH had identified as being wrongly withheld from Canada's document production (separated into ten categories). That Schedule is contained as Annex A to the Order, together with the Tribunal's determinations in respect of each document.\n\n8.\n\nIn its letter, Canada acknowledged that two of the ATI documents should have been produced, but denied that this could be considered evidence that Canada had carried out a flawed approach to its document production. Canada stated that \"[i]*f anything, the Claimant received more documents than what it was entitled to, not less.* \"5\n\nCanada's letter of 23 March 2019, p. 3.\n\n9.\n\nIn addition, Canada responded as follows to GTH's request that Canada confirm it has reviewed the 500,000 pages referenced by the Information Commissioner:\n\nContrary to what GTH implies in its letter to the Tribunal, ISED has not yet collected half a million pages of documents. That number is merely an estimate of the number of pages that may have to be collected and reviewed by ISED in response to GTH's access to information request. As such, Canada is unable to confirm, as GTH requests, that it has collected or reviewed the documents that ISED has collected to respond to GTH's access to information request. Moreover, GTH's access to information requests are broader than its document production requests in this arbitration.6\n\nCanada's letter of 23 March 2019, p. 5.\n\n**II. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n10.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that GTH's request is admissible. Whilst Canada's alleged deficiencies in complying with Procedural Order No. 3 go back at least to 26 November 2018 when Canada asserted that it conducted the necessary search for responsive documents, it is only when GTH received the ATI Documents on 8 March 2019 that it was able to determine that the production was incomplete.7 In its letter of 23 March 2019, Canada admits that two wrongly withheld documents should have been produced as being responsive to the document production order issued in Procedural Order No. 3.8\n\nGTH's Letter of 18 March 2019, **Appendix C**, Letter of 13 March 2019 from Mr. Rahim Moloo to Ms. Sylvie Tabet.\n\nCanada's letter of 23 March 2019, p. 3.\n\n11.\n\nRegarding GTH's request for relief in Section B of its letter of 18 March 2019, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to require Canada to provide the confirmation requested by GTH in Section B(i) when Canada underscores that the universe of 500,000 potentially responsive documents is yet to be collected, and therefore to exist. Said differently, the benchmark against which the Tribunal is asked to decide on Canada's compliance, or lack thereof, is yet inexistent. In light of this fact, the Tribunal notes with satisfaction Canada's unqualified statement of compliance with all of its document production obligations stated in its letter of 15 March 2019 and finds no compelling reason further to require an additional statement of Canada that mirrors the terms of the relief set out by GTH in Section B(i).9\n\nGTH's Letter of 18 March 2019, **Appendix G**, Letter of 15 March 2019 from Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9bert to Mr.\n\n12.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal determines that Canada's unqualified statement of compliance with all of its document production obligations as set out in its letter of 15 March 2019 satisfies GTH's request for relief in Section B(ii). The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to require a different, more formal, statement absent evidence of a delinquent withholding of responsive documents or of a flawed search process for responsive documents. The onus on evidencing that Canada's unqualified statement its letter of 15 March 2019 is incorrect or utterly misleading falls on GTH.\n\n13.\n\nConcerning GTH's request for relief in Section B(iii), the Tribunal has been presented with no evidence that the Parties agreed that drafts of responsive documents shall not be produced where the final responsive document is produced. Canada could have sought confirmation of its purported understanding of the Parties' agreement as narrated in footnote 9 of its letter of 23 March 2019. Absent an evidence of a consensus between the Rahim Moloo *(\"we reiterate that we have fully complied with all of our document production obligations in this arbitration.*\"). Parties on that issue, the Tribunal notes that its document production order in Procedural order No. 3 does not differentiate between drafts and final documents. Any responsive document must be produced, whether it is in a draft or a final version. Canada cannot arrogate the right to determine which drafts do not *substantially* differ from the final version that has been produced, and therefore be legitimately withheld. Accordingly, Canada is ordered to produce forthwith on a rolling basis all responsive documents that are available in a draft version regardless of the materiality of the difference between the draft and the produced final version.\n\n14.\n\nGTH\u2019s request for leave to produce additional evidence after the hearing is dismissed absent a sufficiently particularized application that would warrant such an extraordinary measure happening after the end of the unique evidentiary hearing scheduled in this arbitration.\n\n15.\n\nFinally, as noted above, the Tribunal\u2019s observations with regard to each of the 15 ATI Documents alleged by GTH to have been wrongly withheld are contained in the Schedule at Annex A to this Order and constitute an inseparable part thereof.\n\n**III. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n16.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. GTH\u2019s request for relief in Section B(i) of its letter of 18 March 2019 is dismissed.\n\nb. GTH\u2019s request for relief in Section B(ii) of its letter of 18 March 2019 is dismissed.\n\nc. In respect of GTH\u2019s request for relief in Section B(iii) of its letter of 18 March 2019, Canada is ordered to produce forthwith on a rolling basis all responsive documents that are available in a draft version regardless of the materiality of the difference between the draft and the produced final version.\n\nd.

The Tribunal decided, *inter alia,* that:\n\nc. Canada is ordered to produce forthwith on a rolling basis all responsive documents that are available in a draft version regardless of the materiality of the difference between the draft and the produced final version.\n\nd. GTH\u2019s request for leave to produce additional evidence after the hearing is dismissed absent a sufficiently particularized application.2\n\nProcedural Order No. 9, \u00b6 16.\n\n4.\n\nOn 21 November 2019, GTH submitted a letter to the Tribunal seeking leave to submit nine new documents (the \"**New Documents**\") into the record (the \"**Application**\"). GTH attached the New Documents as Appendices A to I to the Application.\n\n5.\n\nOn 24 November 2019, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Application and provided instructions to the Parties. The Tribunal noted that GTH had referenced being prejudiced by not being able to make arguments or to cross examine witnesses on the New Documents. In this regard, the Tribunal stated:\n\nThe Tribunal is concerned about allegations of impairment of a Party's right to fully state its case. Claimant is invited to specify by no later than 27 November 2019 whether the Application is limited to seeking leave to submitting the nine appendices A to I on the record or is also meant to include any further requests.\n\n6.\n\nIn its message, the Tribunal also invited Canada to respond to the Application, noting that Canada should:\n\nreply precisely and in detail to Claimant's contention in paragraph 7 of the Application as to whether Respondent (a) has withheld metadata relating to produced documents, and (b) continues to withhold documents that should have been produced pursuant to the Tribunal's order in PO 9.\n\n7.\n\nBy email of 26 November 2019, GTH replied to the Tribunal's query and confirmed that \"the Application is limited to seeking leave to submit Appendices A to I into the record as new Factual Exhibits and does not seek other relief.\"\n\n8.\n\nOn 4 December 2019, Canada submitted its response to the Application, together with Annex A and Appendices A to F.\n\n**II. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Parties' positions on each New Document are set forth in Annex A. In this section, the Tribunal briefly summarizes the Parties' more general statements regarding Canada's document production.\n\n**A. GTH\u2019s Position**\n---------------------\n\n10.\n\nGTH states that from 17 September to 31 October 2019, Canada produced over 400 additional documents which should have been produced more than a year ago pursuant to PO3. According to GTH, there are material differences between the drafts recently produced and the final versions on the record. In addition, GTH alleges that \"documents now produced contain **later (more final)** versions of some documents previously produced by Canada - suggesting that Canada may have selectively produced earlier drafts of documents without producing the later or final iterations.\"3 GTH also expresses concern that Canada continues to withhold documents in violation of PO9, because it \"is inconceivable that there are no drafts\" of certain documents that are on the record.4\n\nGTH's Letter of 21 November 2019, \u00b6 7 *(GTH\u2019s emphasis).*\n\nGTH's Letter of 21 November 2019, \u00b6 7.\n\n11.\n\nAccording to GTH:\n\nCanada's illegitimate withholding of responsive documents has precluded GTH from citing to highly relevant documents in its pleadings, referring to them in oral submissions at the hearing, and cross-examining Canada's witnesses on their content. [A] number of the withheld documents directly contradict Canada's submissions and the oral evidence of Canada's witnesses at the hearing. In particular, GTH has been denied the opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Peter Hill and Mr. Iain Stewart with respect to the context and content of these documents and their own conflicting testimony. There can be no doubt that GTH has been prejudiced by Canada's extraordinary delay in disclosing the documents only now produced in its Supplementary Productions.5\n\nGTH's Letter of 21 November 2019, \u00b6 8.\n\n**B. Canada\u2019s Position**\n------------------------\n\n12.\n\nCanada objects to GTH's Application, arguing that the New Documents contain no new information and viewing the Application to be \"simply an effort by the Claimant to reargue its case.\"6\n\nCanada's Letter of 4 December 2019, \u00b6 4.\n\n13.\n\nCanada submits that it has acted in good faith to comply with its document production obligations. In particular, the only reason that certain documents were not produced prior to the hearing as part of Canada's production pursuant to PO3 was that \"Canada believed in good faith, based on conversations with Claimant's counsel, that the parties had agreed not to produce working drafts of responsive documents for which a final or more recent version existed.\"7\n\nCanada's Letter of 4 December 2019, \u00b6 5.\n\n14.\n\nAccording to Canada, after PO9 was issued and the Parties reached an agreement on the scope of production, Canada \"fully complied in good faith with its production obligations.\"8 Canada rejects GTH's suggestion that Canada is in violation of PO9 because it has not produced drafts of certain documents. For Canada, it is not surprising that drafts, to the extent they ever existed, were not retained. Moreover, Canada argues that drafts of exhibits C-449, R-447 and R-464 were in fact produced, contrary to GTH's assertion.\n\nCanada's Letter of 4 December 2019, \u00b6 10.\n\n15.\n\nCanada also confirms that it did not selectively produce drafts or inappropriately withhold metadata. Given the level of review required to determine whether a document is the final version, the fact that Canada may have made an error identifying the latest version cannot be considered evidence of a lack of diligence or good faith.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n16.\n\nIn PO9, the Tribunal noted Canada's unqualified statement of compliance with all of its document production obligations stated in its letter of 15 March 2019.9 The Tribunal further notes Canada's reiteration of the same unqualified statement in its letter of 4 December 2019 addressed to the Tribunal, stating:\n\nCanada already confirmed in communications with Claimant's counsel that Canada is not improperly withholding further drafts or metadata and that it has complied with PO 9.10\n\nPO9, \u00b6 11.\n\nCanada's Letter of 4 December 2019, \u00b6 4.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it neither to be appropriate nor efficient for it to enter the debate as to what counsel might have discussed amongst themselves or have believed in good faith. This includes in particular the telephone call amongst counsel on 2 August 2019 and the exchange of emails that followed that call.11 The Tribunal has ordered in PO9 that Canada shall produce forthwith on a rolling basis all responsive documents that are available in a draft version regardless of the materiality of the difference between the draft and the produced final version.12 This order remains effective. GTH's bringing to the attention of the Tribunal, for the first time, in its letter of 21 November 2019 that the ordered rolling production only began on 17 September 2019 has not been preceded by protests by GTH as to the unwarranted lapse of time since PO9 had been issued six months ago. In fact, the emails exchanged between August and October 2019, produced in Appendices E and F to Canada's letter of 4 December 2019, without surprise reflect the collaborative, civil approach to solving the issue that is expected of counsel in this arbitration. The Tribunal infers that the production took place in accordance with a timeline that came as of no surprise to GTH. Whilst GTH now claims that it \"has been prejudiced by Canada's extraordinary delay in disclosing the documents\",13 the Tribunal can only observe that GTH seems to have been content to allow the production process to roll over as agreed with Canada without seeking any injunctive relief of the Tribunal or other forms of investigation of the reason for the delay in the ordered production. Had GTH considered Canada's production process to amount to an \"extraordinary delay\" as is being now claimed, the Tribunal would have expected more diligence of GTH in denouncing a potential breach of PO9 and its consequences on GTH's case. None of that has happened before GTH's Application.\n\nAppendices E and F to Canada's Letter of 4 December 2019.\n\nPO9, \u00b6 13.\n\nGTH's Letter of 21 November 2019, \u00b6 8.\n\n18.\n\nIn the same vein, the Tribunal need not go into the debate of whether the allegedly withheld drafts - assuming in-scope drafts have been withheld by Canada from the ordered production - fall within the scope of transitory records the destruction of which is authorised in the policy documents adduced by Canada as Appendices A and B. PO9 is clear in ordering that responsive documents in draft form must be produced. Intimations and expressions of scepticisms, however compelling they may appear to the intimater, are insufficient to rebut Canada's unqualified statement that it is not improperly withholding drafts and that it has complied in good faith with its production obligations.14\n\nCanada's Letter of 4 December 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10.\n\n19.\n\nIn Annex A, the Tribunal reviews the arguments averred by each Party in support or in opposition of the admission of each of the New Documents into the evidential record.\n\n20.\n\nMore generally, with respect to all the New Documents, the Tribunal refers to paragraph 16.5 of Procedural Order No. 1, which provides:\n\nNeither party shall be permitted to submit additional or responsive documents after the filing of its respective last written submission, unless the Tribunal determines that exceptional circumstances exist based on a reasoned written request followed by observations from the other party.\n\n21.\n\nIn the present circumstances, the Tribunal accepts that GTH could not have submitted the New Documents earlier, as their rolling production was only completed on 31 October 2019.15 The Tribunal also considers that GTH has provided a sufficiently reasoned request showing that the standard in paragraph 16.5 is met.\n\nGTH's Letter of 21 November 2019, \u00b6 2.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision with respect to each of the nine New Documents is contained in Annex A. The Tribunal considers that the difference underscored by GTH in its Application as concerns each of the New Documents compared with the corresponding document that is on the record speaks for itself, and Canada's reply in Annex A to its letter of 4 December 2019 stands as a rebuttal. As a result, the Tribunal stands ready to resume its deliberations suspended by the submission of the Application. That said, the Tribunal is open to the Parties potentially agreeing on a limited briefing schedule to discuss the impact of the New Documents on their case. Any such agreement should be indicated to the Tribunal by 16 December 2019, stating the filing dates of the respective submissions. Absent an agreement, each Party is invited to make separate submissions by the set date."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2020-03-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion by Arbitrator Gary Born", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion by Arbitrator Gary Born\n------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI agree in a number of respects with the Tribunal's factual and legal analysis, and with many of the conclusions in its Award. I write separately, however, on one issue as to which I disagree fundamentally with both the Tribunal's decision and reasoning.\n\n2.\n\nPreliminarily, I emphasize my high regard for my colleagues on the Tribunal, and for the care and diligence with which they have approached this matter, both in the Award and otherwise. Nonetheless, I am unable to join the Tribunal's conclusion that GTH's national treatment claim is outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction because it is assertedly excluded from the scope of the BIT's national treatment protections by an exception under Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex to the BIT. In my view, the Tribunal's interpretation of Article IV(2)(d) on this issue is impossible to reconcile with either the language of the BIT or the evident object and purpose of the Treaty.1\n\nTerms defined in the Award have the same meaning in this Dissenting Opinion as in the Award.\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n3.\n\nIt is important to place interpretation of Article IV(2)(d) and the Treaty's Annex in their proper context under the BIT. Article IV(2)(d) is a piece of a broader set of treaty provisions addressing the Contracting Parties' national treatment guarantees and the exceptions to those protections.\n\n4.\n\nArticle IV(1) of the BIT guarantees protected foreign investors national treatment:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall grant to investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment no less favorable than that which, in like circumstances, it grants to investments or returns of its own investors with respect to the expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or disposition of investments.\"2 It is familiar law that protections of foreigners against local discrimination, in the form of national treatment guarantees like Article IV(1), are a bedrock principle of virtually all contemporary investment protection treaties.3\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article IV(1).\n\n*See, e.g.*, August Reinisch, *National Treatment* in BUILDING INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW: THE FIRST 50 YEARS OF ICSID 389 (Kinnear, Fischer, M\u00ednguez Almeida, et al. (eds); Dec 2015) (\"National treatment is one of the basic non-discrimination disciplines in international investment law. Almost all bilateral investment treaties (\"BITs\") and multilateral investment agreements contain national treatment provisions requiring contracting states to provide investors and investments from other contracting parties treatment no less favorable than that accorded to their own investors and investments.\"). *See also Consortium R.F.C.C. v.Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/6, Award (22 Dec. 2003) (Briner, Cremades, Fadlallah), \u00b6 53 (describing national treatment as a \"disposition qui se rencontre syst\u00e9matiquement dans les trait\u00e9s de protection des investissements\").\n\n5.\n\nArticle IV(1) is subject to several exceptions. In particular, Articles IV(2)(a), (b) and (c) of the BIT exclude specified non-conforming measures of the Contracting Parties from the national treatment protections of Article IV(1), while Article IV(2)(d) permits the Contracting Parties to except future non-conforming measures from Article IV(1). Thus, Article IV(2) of the BIT provides:\n\n\"paragraph (1) of this Article [IV], \u2026 do[es] not apply to:\n\na. any existing non-conforming measures maintained within the territory of a Contracting Party; \u2026\n\nb. the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a);\n\nc. an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a), to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with those obligations;\n\nd. the right of each Contracting Party to make or maintain exceptions within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Agreement.\"\n\n6.\n\nAs its text indicates, Article IV(2) was directed principally towards \"existing non-conforming measures,\" which were already in force at the time the BIT was ratified, and the subsequent continuation, renewal or amendment of such existing measures. Article XVI(1) of the BIT required the Contracting Parties to the BIT to notify one another, within two years of the BIT's entry into force, of all such existing non-conforming measures.4 It is common ground that nothing in Articles IV(2)(a), (b) or (c) exempted new non-conforming measures, adopted after the date that the Treaty entered into force, from Article IV's national treatment guarantees; these provisions were directed exclusively towards *existing* measures.5\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article XVI(1) (\"The Contracting Parties shall, within a two year period after the entry into force of this Agreement, exchange letters listing, to the extent possible, any existing measures that do not conform to the obligations in subparagraph (3)(a) of Article II, Article IV or paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article V.\").\n\nThat is underscored by Article IV(2)(c) which permitted amendments to existing non-conforming measures, but only \"to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with those obligations.\" **CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article IV(2)(c).\n\n7.\n\nIn addition, and of direct relevance here, Article IV(2)(d) provides that the Treaty's national treatment protections do not apply to \"the right of each Contracting Party to make or maintain exceptions within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Agreement.\"6 In contrast to Articles IV(2)(a), (b) and (c), Article IV(2)(d) is forward-looking, permitting the Contracting Parties to \"make or maintain exceptions,\" within specific sectors identified in the Annex to the Treaty, in the future (after the signature and ratification of the BIT). In contrast to Articles IV(2)(a)-(c), Article IV(2)(d) established a mechanism by which the Contracting Parties could adopt exceptions for new non-conforming measures from the BIT's national treatment protections \u2013 provided, of course, that the requirements of Article IV(2) and the Treaty's Annex were complied with.\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article IV(2)(d).\n\n8.\n\nAs contemplated by Article IV(2)(d), Canada listed in the Annex of the Treaty a number of sectors or matters as to which it reserved the right to make and maintain exceptions in the future. These sectors were divided by Canada into five general categories, which included \"social services\" and \"services in any other sector.\"7 Specifically, the relevant part of the Annex provides:\n\n1. In accordance with Article IV, subparagraph 2(d), Canada reserves the right to make and maintain exceptions in the sectors or matters listed below:\n\n\u2012 social services (i.e. public law enforcement; correctional services; income security or insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education; public training; health and child care);\n\n\u2012 services in any other sector;\n\n\u2012 government securities - as described in SIC 8152;\n\n\u2012 residency requirements for ownership of oceanfront land;\n\n\u2012 measures implementing the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Oil and Gas Accords.\n\n2. For the purpose of this Annex, \"SIC\" means, with respect to Canada, Standard Industrial Classification numbers as set out in Statistics Canada, Standard Industrial Classification, fourth edition, 1980.8\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Annex.\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Annex.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that these provisions of Article IV(2)(d), and the Annex, exclude all of Canada's challenged measures from Article IV(1)'s national treatment guarantees. In the Tribunal's words, \"GTH's national treatment claim, which relates exclusively to the telecommunications sector, is excluded from the scope of the BIT's national treatment provisions. Accordingly, the national treatment claim is dismissed and will not be considered on the merits.\"9\n\nAward, \u00b6 379.\n\n10.\n\nIn my view, neither Article IV(2)(d) nor the Annex of the BIT provides a basis for excluding Canada's challenged measures from the Treaty's national treatment protections. That is true for two separate and independent reasons: (a) Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex only reserved Canada's right to make exceptions from Article IV(1)'s protections in specified sectors, and Canada never exercised that right to make an exception with respect to its challenged measures; and (b) the sectors listed in the Annex do not, in any event, include the telecommunications sector, to which Canada's challenged measures relate.\n\n11.\n\nAs a consequence, Canada's challenged measures are subject to the BIT's national treatment protections, and the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider GTH's claims. Canada has not asserted any defense on the merits to those claims and, as a consequence, GTH is entitled to an award declaring that Canada has breached its obligations under Article IV(1) and awarding it damages for the losses resulting from that breach.\n\n**II. CANADA HAS NOT MADE AN EXCEPTION UNDER ARTICLE IV(2)(D****) FOR THE CHALLENGED MEASURES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nPreliminarily, GTH has challenged three of Canada's measures under Article IV(1)'s national treatment protections: (a) Canada's implementation of a new process to review Wind Mobile's foreign ownership and control; (b) Canada's prohibition of the sale of GTH's interest in Wind Mobile to incumbent operators; and (c) [REDACTED].10 As noted above, it is common ground that Canada has (unusually) offered no affirmative defense to any of these three claims under Article IV(1).\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 105.\n\n13.\n\nAlso preliminarily, it is equally common ground that Canada has done nothing pursuant to Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT other than to enact and apply the foregoing three challenged measures. Canada has concededly not provided Egypt any notice or other statement excepting any of the challenged measures from Article IV(1)'s provisions, whether pursuant to Article IV(2)(d), the Annex, or otherwise. Canada also has concededly made no statement, whether publicly, to Egypt, directly to GTH, or otherwise, excepting any of the challenged measures from Article IV(1)'s national treatment obligation or, for that matter, referring in any manner to either its challenged measures or to excepted measures under Article IV(2)(d) or the Annex.\n\n14.\n\nRather, Canada's position is that it is free to adopt and apply discriminatory measures, and to take discriminatory actions, at any time, provided only that those measure fall within the scope of the five categories listed in the Treaty's Annex. As the Tribunal correctly observes:\n\nAccording to Canada, it may make or maintain an exception pursuant to Article IV(2)(d) at any time by adopting or maintaining measures or by according treatment that would otherwise be inconsistent with the national treatment obligations; it is not required to take any additional steps to exercise this right.11\n\nAward, \u00b6 341.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Canada's claim without qualification. It concludes that Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT permits Canada to adopt and apply measures, or take other actions, that violate Article IV's national treatment guarantee without any prior action or notice. In the Tribunal's view, \"there is simply no basis in the text of the BIT to impose an additional procedural requirement that triggers the effectiveness of the exception.\"12 In particular, the Tribunal reasons that \"if the Contracting Parties had intended for that right to be subject to any notification requirement beyond listing the relevant sector or matter in the Annex, they would have included it in the text of the BIT.\"13\n\nAward, \u00b6 368.\n\nAward, \u00b6 370. The Tribunal also suggests that the \"specificity\" of other categories in the Annex \"suggests that no further action by Canada is required or contemplated prior to its entitlement to rely upon these exceptions.\" Award, \u00b6 371.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis produces what, in my view, is a very remarkable result \u2013 namely, that the vast bulk of Canada's obligation to provide non-discriminatory national treatment under the BIT is almost entirely without any substance or effect. Under the Tribunal's analysis, Canada is free, at any time and in any manner, to impose blatantly discriminatory measures favoring Canadian nationals, in broad sectors of its economy, without any prior notice to Egypt or Egyptian investors and without any other requirement or limitation. That result makes the Treaty's basic promise of non-discriminatory, transparent treatment of foreign businesses, pursuant to the rule of law, largely illusory. That is a deeply unattractive result, which contradicts the basic objectives of both the Treaty and international law more generally.\n\n17.\n\nIn my view, nothing in the BIT's text or purposes permits, much less requires, this remarkable result. Rather, the plain language of the Treaty leaves both Contracting Parties free, in their sovereign capacities, to except substantial numbers of new measures from the BIT's national treatment protections, while mandating that they do so in accordance with an orderly and transparent process.\n\n18.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal misunderstands the character and meaning of Article IV of the BIT when it reasons that nothing in the BIT \"impose[s] an additional procedural requirement that triggers the effectiveness\" of Article IV(2)(d).14 That reasoning ignores the essential point that, unless Article IV(2)(d) affirmatively excepts Canada's challenged measures from Article IV(1)'s national treatment protection, then that protection remains fully applicable. Inquiry into notification or \"additional procedural requirement[s]\" is unnecessary if Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex do not themselves affirmatively exclude Canada's challenged measures from the scope of Article IV(1).\n\nAward, \u00b6 368.\n\n19.\n\nRegrettably, the Award largely ignores the text of both Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex. In my view, it is clear from the text of these provisions that they do not except Canada's challenged measures from Article IV(1) or otherwise authorize Canada to adopt or impose the challenged measures. Both of those provisions of the BIT are limited solely to a reservation of rights by the Contracting Parties to make future exceptions to Article IV(1)'s obligations, without either exercising those reserved rights or authorizing a Contracting Party to adopt or apply measures that violate Article IV(1). Thus:\n\na) Article IV(2)(d) provides a \"right of each Contracting Party to make or maintain exceptions within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex\";\n\nb) In turn, in the Annex, Canada \"reserves the right to make and maintain exceptions\" in five specified areas.\n\n20.\n\nThere can be no serious doubt that the reservation of a right, as permitted by Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex, is not the actual exercise of that right. As a matter of language, \"reserving a right\" is asserting the freedom to exercise (or not to exercise) the reserved right in the future; it is not the present exercise of the right that has been reserved. To take an obvious example, if a party reserves the right to initiate an arbitration or litigation, or to challenge election results, it does not in so doing commence an arbitration or litigation or file an election challenge; it only preserves, for possible future exercise, an asserted right. On a more mundane level, if I reserve a seat on a flight, or a table in a restaurant, I do not in so doing fly to my destination or enjoy a meal; I simply ensure that, if I so choose in the future, I will not be precluded from doing so.\n\n21.\n\nThis conclusion requires no legal authority, beyond the plain meaning of Article IV(2)(d)'s text. In any event, authority uniformly adopts precisely the foregoing interpretation of a reservation of rights:\n\na) \"[T]he existence of a 'right' is distinct from the exercise of that right. For example, a party may have a contractual right to refer a claim to arbitration; but there can be no arbitration unless and until that right is exercised.\"15\n\nb) \"[The Energy Charter Treaty] 'reserves the right' of each Contracting Party to deny the advantages of that Part to such an entity. This imports that, to effect denial, the Contracting Party must exercise the right.\"16\n\nc) \"[A reserved right] would only apply if a state invoked that provision to deny benefits to an investor before a dispute arose.\"17\n\n**CL-123**, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, \u00b6 155.\n\n**CL-132**, *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA 227, Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 November 2009, \u00b6 456.\n\n**CL-155**, *Anatolie Stati, Gabriel Stati, Ascom Group SA, and Terra Raf Trans Traiding Ltd v. Kazakhstan*, SCC Case No. V 116/2010, Award, 19 December 2013, \u00b6 745.\n\n22.\n\nThus, the text of Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex leave no serious question that neither provision constituted the actual exercise of any right on the part of Canada to make or maintain an exception to the BIT's national treatment protection under Article IV(2)(d). Rather, Article IV(2)(d) granted Canada (exceptionally) the right to \"make or maintain exceptions\" in sectors identified in the Annex, while the Annex identified five specified areas within which Canada could exercise the right to make exceptions.\n\n23.\n\nCritically, nothing in either Article IV(2)(d) nor the Annex then exercised the rights that Canada had reserved. As noted above, Canada concededly has done nothing pursuant to Article IV(2)(d) to exercise those rights. That should be an end to the analysis. Nothing in Article IV(2)(d) nor the Annex does anything beyond making the reservation of a right, which is not itself sufficient to except Canada's challenged measures from the BIT's national treatment protections.\n\n24.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal also ignores the nature of the right that Canada is permitted to reserve, and has reserved, under Article IV(2)(d). Article IV(2)(d) permits a Contracting Party to \"*make or maintain exceptions*\" within the sectors specified in the Annex. Importantly, making or maintaining an \"exception\" is not adopting or imposing a measure; instead, it is formulating a category of measures to which Article IV(1)'s national treatment standard will not apply. This conclusion is clear from Article IV(2)(d)'s use of the term \"exception\" \u2013 that is, a category that is carved out of or excluded from the basic rule18 prescribed in Article IV(1).\n\nOxford Learner's Dictionary defines \"exception\" as a \"a thing that does not follow a rule.\" *Exception*, Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (2014); Cambridge Dictionary defines \"exception\" as \"someone or something that is not included in a rule, group, or list or that does not behave in the expected way.\" *Exception*, Cambridge Business English Dictionary (2011).\n\n25.\n\nThe right to make or maintain an exception under Article IV(2)(d) is fundamentally different from the right to impose measures under Article IV(2)(a), (b) and (c). Each of Article IV(2)(a), (b) and (c) excludes from Article IV(1)'s national treatment protection existing \"measures\" of the Contracting Parties. Thus, Article IV(2)(a) excludes \"any existing non-conforming *measures* maintained within the territory of a Contracting Party,\" while Article IV(2)(b) excludes the \"continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming *measure*,\" and Article IV(2)(c) excludes certain \"amendment[s] to any non-conforming *measure*.\" Those provisions specifically addressed \"measures\" that were already in existence when the BIT came into force.\n\n26.\n\nIn contrast, as noted above, Article IV(2)(d) prescribed a mechanism by which each of the Contracting Parties could, after the BIT came into force, formulate additional exceptions to Article IV(1)'s requirements. Indeed, in the Tribunal's own words, \"the terms used ('reserves the right to make exceptions') reflect the fact that Article IV(2)(d) is largely forward looking.\"19\n\nAward, \u00b6 372.\n\n27.\n\nCritically, however, the future actions permitted by Article IV(2)(d) are not the imposition or application of \"*measures*,\" as under Articles IV(2)(a)-(c), but are instead the making of \"*exceptions*.\" Needless to say, although the two terms are related, \"exceptions\" are not \"measures\" \u2013 which is why Articles IV(2)(a)-(c) and Article IV(2)(d) used different terms in the same provision of the Treaty.\n\n28.\n\nIt is elementary that the Tribunal is obliged to give effect to the text that the Parties have chosen to use in the Treaty.20 That includes in particular giving effect to the different language that the Parties chose to use in Articles IV(2)(a)-(c), on the one hand, and Article IV(2)(d), on the other hand. Treating the different language of these provisions, and the different terms \"measures\" and \"exceptions,\" as if they were the same thing not only disregards the Treaty's language but also violates the basic rule of treaty interpretation (that requires giving effect to all provisions of a treaty,21 including giving meaning to different terms).\n\n*See, e.g.*, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 31 (\"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"). *See also Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of a State to the United Nations* (Advisory Opinion), [1950] ICJ REP. 4, 8 (\"The Court considers it necessary to say that the first duty of a tribunal which is called upon to interpret and apply the provisions of a treaty, is to endeavour to give effect to them in their natural and ordinary meaning in the context in which they occur. \u2026 When the Court can give effect to a provision of a treaty by giving to the words used in it their natural and ordinary meaning, it may not interpret the words seeking to give them some other meaning.\"); *Constitution of the Maritime Safety Committee of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization* (Advisory Opinion), [1960] ICJ REP. 150, 159-160 (\"The [text of the treaty] must be read in [its] natural and ordinary meaning\"); *Temple of Preah Vihear*, [1961] ICJ REP. 17, 32 (\"[W]ords are to be interpreted according to their natural and ordinary meaning in the context in which they occur.\"). *See also* Gerald G. Fitzmaurice, *The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice: Treaty Interpretation and Certain Other Treaty Points*, 28 BRIT. Y.B. INT'L L. 1, 10 (1951) (\"The thought of the majority [of the ICJ] could be summed up by saying that in their view the intentions of the framers of a treaty, as they emerged from the discussions or negotiations preceding its conclusion, must be presumed to have been expressed in the treaty itself, and are therefore to be sought primarily in the actual text, and not in any extraneous source.\").\n\n*See, e.g.*, Gerald Fitzmaurice, *The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice 1951\u20134: Treaty Interpretation and Other Treaty Points*, 33 BRIT. Y.B. INT'L L. 203, 211 (1957) (\"Treaties are to be interpreted \u2026 in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every part of the text.\"). *See also Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada)*, Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, [1998] ICJ REP. 432 (\"[the] principle [of effectiveness] has an important role in the law of treaties\"); *Argentina\u2013Safeguard Measures on Imports of Footwear*, AB-1999-7, WT/DS121/AB/R, 27, \u00b6 81 (1999) (\"[A] treaty interpreter must read all applicable provisions of a treaty in a way that gives meaning to all of them, harmoniously. And, an appropriate reading of [the text] must, accordingly, be one that gives meaning to all the relevant provisions\u2026.\").\n\n29.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Treaty's other provisions also confirm in the clearest of terms this basic distinction between \"measures\" and \"exceptions.\" The Treaty itself defines \"measures\" as regulatory and legislative instruments and other governmental or administrative orders or actions;22 that definition is consistent with the ordinary usage and understanding of the term. In contrast, the Treaty consistently categorizes and treats \"exceptions\" in an entirely different manner, as made clear in the text of Article VI (setting forth specified \"Miscellaneous Exceptions\") and Article XVII (setting forth specified \"General Exceptions\"). In each of these provisions of the Treaty, \"exceptions\" are treated as defined categories of governmental actions and measures, which are excluded from the rules otherwise prescribed by the Treaty's substantive protections, such as those in Article IV(1).23\n\n*See* **CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article I(h) (\"'[M]easure' includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement, or practice.\").\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Articles VI and XVII.\n\n30.\n\nFor example, Article VI set forth exceptions for \"Cultural industries,\" which are defined exhaustively as including, *inter alia*, \"the publication, distribution, or sale of books, magazines, periodicals or newspapers in print or machine readable form but not including the sole activity of printing or typesetting any of the foregoing; or the production, distribution, sale or exhibition of film or video recordings \u2026.\"24 Similarly, Article XVII set forth \"General Exceptions,\" including \"environmental measures,\" again carefully defined as measures \"necessary to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement; necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; \u2026.\"\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article VI(3).\n\n31.\n\nThus, the Treaty's text and structure make it clear that a \"measure\" refers to a Contracting State's governmental action (whether legislative, executive, administrative) which is applied to or imposed on a foreign investor, while an \"exception\" refers to a category of measures which is excluded from the Treaty's protections or to a Contracting State's exercise of a right under the BIT to exclude categories of measures from the Treaty's protections. Importantly, the Treaty's \"exceptions\" are defined in advance, as specified categories of measures, which can be ascertained by reference to the text of the Treaty. Contrary to the Tribunal's analysis, the concepts of \"measures\" and \"exceptions\" are not interchangeable, but instead are fundamentally different, both in ordinary usage, in Article IV and in the other provisions of the treaty.\n\n32.\n\nApplying the Treaty's definition of \"measures\" and \"exceptions\" under Article IV, it is in my view very clear what Article IV(2)(d) allowed Contracting States to do. Article IV(2)(d) authorized Contracting States, within limits prescribed by the Annex, to formulate specified \"exceptions\" that would encompass defined categories of future \"measures\" that a Contracting State might wish to adopt or impose. Critically, however, the making of exceptions under Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex required the formulation of a defined category of measures, like the exceptions in Articles VI and XVII of the Treaty, and not merely an ad hoc, after-the-fact exclusion of any measures within the scope of the Annex from the Treaty's protections.\n\n33.\n\nThe foregoing conclusion is not only evident from the deliberate (and repeated) use of different language in Article IV(2)(d) (\"right to make or maintain exceptions\") and Article IV(2)(a)-(c) (existing \"measures\"), and from the definitions and treatment of \"measures\" and \"exceptions\" in the Treaty. This conclusion is also evident from Canada's other bilateral investment treaties. In particular, Canada's 2004 Model BIT provides that the BIT's national treatment obligations \"shall not apply to *any measure* that a Party adopts or maintains\" with respect to defined sectors.25 That text, unlike the text of Article IV(2)(d) in the Canada-Egypt BIT, does not provide for Contracting Parties to make \"exceptions\" for future \"measures,\" but instead simply excludes from the BIT's coverage all future \"measures\" in particular fields. The terms of Canada's 2004 Model BIT confirm both the plain language of Article IV(2)(d) and the difference in the text of Article IV(2)(d) and Articles IV(2)(a)-(c).\n\n**RL-117**, Canada's Model BIT (2004), Art. 9(2) (emphasis added).\n\n34.\n\nThe same conclusion is also apparent from the structure of the BIT. Articles IV(2)(a)-(c) refer to existing measures, which could be (and, under Article XVI(1), must be) identified at the time the Treaty was ratified, and which are then excluded from Article IV(1). Article IV(2)(d) refers to future measures, which were not yet (and could not be) identified at the time the Treaty was ratified, but which could nonetheless be excluded from Article IV(1). Because these measures could not be identified, the Contracting Parties provided a mechanism in Article IV(2)(d) to allow for exceptions to be made, within limits prescribed in the Annex, from Article IV(1)'s national treatment protection for as-yet-unidentified measures.\n\n35.\n\nIn doing so, however, the Contracting Parties did not simply exclude economic sectors or types of measures from the scope or application of Article IV(1). Instead, the Contracting Parties limited the fields within which future non-conforming measures might be excepted from Article IV(1), by requiring that these fields be identified in an Annex; and they provided for the Contracting Parties to then \"make exceptions\" within those fields, not for the Contracting Parties to simply impose non-conforming measures. That structure confirms both the different language of Article IV(2)(d) (referring to \"exceptions,\" not to \"measures\") and the text of the Annex (referring to the \"reservation of a right\" to make exceptions, not a right to impose measures).\n\n36.\n\nOne could imagine treaty language that had the meaning adopted by the Tribunal with respect to Article IV(2)(d); that text would not, however, be what Article IV(2)(d) or the Annex actually says. Instead, adopting the Tribunal's interpretation of the BIT, Article IV(2)(d) would say \"notwithstanding Article IV(1), each Contracting State has the right to adopt, maintain, amend and impose measures in the sectors listed in the Annex\" which do not conform to Article IV(1), and the Annex would say \"Article IV(1) does not apply to any measures of Canada in the following sectors.\" Needless to say, nothing in Article IV remotely resembles such a provision.\n\n37.\n\nThird, given the clarity of Article IV(2)(d)'s language and structure, there is little need to consider the BIT's object and purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, however, those purposes decisively confirm what the Treaty's text says. In particular, the BIT's fundamental objective of providing a secure, predictable and transparent environment, characterized by the rule of law, both argues for the conclusions outlined above and excludes the interpretation urged by Canada and adopted by the Tribunal.\n\n38.\n\nUnder the Tribunal's interpretation of Article IV, the BIT's fundamental guarantee of national treatment is subject to an open-ended, entirely discretionary power on the part of Canada to disregard the Treaty's protection. In what appears to encompass some 70 percent of Canada's economy,26 Canada is free under the Tribunal's interpretation of the Treaty \u2013 without notice or restriction \u2013 to impose discriminatory measures. As noted above, this is a remarkable, and remarkably unattractive, result. That unbounded discretion is little different from a self-judging exception to the Treaty's national treatment obligation, which is contrary to both the rule of law and the BIT's fundamental objectives, and entirely different from the manner in which \"exceptions\" were treated elsewhere in the Treaty (in Articles VI and XVII). Indeed, that sort of sweeping discretionary power to discriminate on an ad hoc basis against foreigners is almost the exact opposite of what the BIT promised and sought to achieve.\n\nThe services sector accounted for an estimated 70.2% of Canada's GDP in 2017. *See GDP \u2013 composition, by sector of origin*, Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook \u2013 Canada.\n\n39.\n\nIn contrast, reading the BIT to mean what Article IV says does nothing to limit the Contracting States' sovereign regulatory authority. Canada would remain free to adopt exceptions, pursuant to Article IV(2)(d), from Article IV(1)'s national treatment protection (within the limits of the Annex); Canada would merely be required to formulate and publicize those exceptions in advance, as it did in Articles VI and XVII, so that other Contracting Parties and foreign investors could determine when Article IV(1) applied and when it did not. That is precisely the type of transparency, regularity and legal security that both the BIT and the rule of law promise \u2013 but that the Tribunal, regrettably, declines to affirm.\n\n40.\n\nFourth, Canada and the Tribunal also rely on Article XVI(1) of the BIT, which sets out a process by which the Contracting Parties are to notify one another of any existing non-conforming measures,27 while observing that there is no such process prescribed by Article XVI for exercising the right granted by Article IV(2)(d).\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article XVI(1). As noted above, the article provides that \"The Contracting Parties shall, within a two year period after the entry into force of this Agreement, exchange letters listing, to the extent possible, any existing measures that do not conform to the obligations in subparagraph (3)(a) of Article II, Article IV or paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article V.\"\n\n41.\n\nThat analysis is in my view entirely unpersuasive. Article XVI(1) specifically addresses only \"existing\" non-conforming measures. The point of Article XVI(1) is not to provide a general notice mechanism for issues that arise under the BIT in the future, after the Treaty is in force \u2013 rather, it has a limited purpose pertaining to \"existing\" measures.\n\n42.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the reason that Article IV(1) was drafted to apply specifically to Articles IV(2)(a)-(c), and not Article IV(2)(d), is that Article IV(2)(d) itself requires the Contracting States to formulate and make \"exceptions\" to Article IV(1) \u2013 namely, publicly available instruments defining what categories of future measures would, and would not, be excepted from Article IV(1)'s national treatment requirement. It would have made no sense to extend Article XVI(1)'s requirement for notice of \"measures\" to the very different \"exceptions\" under Article IV(2)(d).\n\n43.\n\nArticle XVI of the BIT is also instructive of something else: the intention of the Contracting Parties to clearly identify and communicate measures that would hinder the protection of foreign investment. In addition to the requirement in Article XVI(1) of exchanging letters about existing measures that do not conform to the BIT obligations, Article XVI(2) provides that each party must \"ensure that its laws, regulations, procedures, and administrative rulings of general application respecting any matter covered by this Agreement are promptly published or otherwise made available in such a manner as to enable interested persons and the other Contracting Party to become acquainted with them.\"28\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article XVI(2).\n\n44.\n\nArticle XVI thus seeks to ensure that both Contracting Parties, and their respective investors, are at all times aware of developments that would affect the rights and obligations established by the BIT. Unlike Article XVI(1), Article XVI(2) lacks the word \"existing,\" making clear that such notice is necessary for all present and future measures. This is consistent with the overarching purpose of the BIT to facilitate \"economic cooperation\" by \"the promotion and the protection of investments of \u2026 the other Contracting Party.\"29 Read in this context, the exercise of a reserved right under Article IV(2)(d) necessarily required notifying the other Party. As the Tribunal acknowledges, the language of the Annex which is at issue \u2013 \"services in any other sector\" \u2013 is exceptionally broad.30\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English Version), Preamble.\n\nThe Tribunal calls \"services in any other sector\" category \"broader than the other items listed.\" Award, \u00b6 371.\n\n45.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal laments that the Annex \"could have been drafted in clearer terms.\"31 With respect, Article IV(2)(d), Article XV1(1) and the Annex were drafted in perfectly clear terms. Particularly when read together, in light of the BIT's object and purpose, these provisions impose clear and sensible rights and obligations. Again regrettably, the Tribunal chooses not to give effect to those provisions. Notably, however, if one accepted the Tribunal's view that the Annex and the BIT are unclear, then it underscores all the more the need to interpret Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex consistently with the Treaty's object and purpose and the desirability of avoiding the remarkably unattractive and implausible result produced by the Tribunal's analysis.\n\nAward, \u00b6 372.\n\n**III. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS NOT AN EXCEPTION UNDER THE ANNEX**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nEven if Article IV(2)(d) had the meaning urged by the Tribunal, its conclusion would still be wrong. Even accepting the Tribunal's interpretation of Article IV(2)(d), Canada did not reserve the right to impose non-conforming measures with respect to investments made in telecommunications. In my view, the Tribunal is wrong to conclude that the exceptions to national treatment protection contained in Article IV(2)(d) and the related Annex encompass the telecommunications sector.\n\n47.\n\nAs discussed above, an exception can only be made pursuant to Article IV(2)(d)\n\n\"within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Agreement.\"32 In turn, the relevant provisions of the Annex read as follows:\n\n1. In accordance with Article IV, subparagraph 2(d), Canada reserves the right to make and maintain exceptions in the sectors or matters listed below:\n\n\u2012 social services (i.e. public law enforcement; correctional services; income security or insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education; public training; health and child care);\n\n\u2012 services in any other sector;\n\n\u2012 government securities - as described in SIC 8152;\n\n\u2012 residency requirements for ownership of oceanfront land;\n\n\u2012 measures implementing the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Oil and Gas Accords.33\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article IV(2)(d).\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Annex.\n\n48.\n\nIt is common ground that Canada can only make an exception under Article IV(2)(d) if that exception falls within one of the \"sectors or matters\" listed in the Annex to the BIT. Article IV(2)(d) was not an unbounded right to make exceptions for future measures in any and all areas \u2013 but only within those sectors specified in advance in the BIT's Annex.\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Annex's \"language leaves no room for doubt that Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation with respect to services\"34 as it is the only \"plausible\" explanation.35 In the Tribunal's view, telecommunications is a \"service,\" and as a consequence Canada's challenged measures, applied to a telecommunications company, fall within the Annex. The Award also finds instructive the fact that Canada has contained similar exceptions for services in other investment treaties, and that GTH's own description of Wind Mobile's activities includes \"providing mobile telecommunications services to Canadian customers.\"36\n\nAward, \u00b6 366.\n\nAward, \u00b6 376.\n\nAward, \u00b6 378.\n\n50.\n\nPreliminary, the Tribunal's (and Canada's) interpretation of the Annex is again remarkable. In the Tribunal's view, the term \"services in any other sector\" means any services sector or any sector in which services are provided. As a consequence, telecommunications are a services sector (as presumably would be the case for information technology, health care, finance, advertising, insurance, transport, energy and other fields comprising some 70% of Canada's economy).37 In my view, that interpretation again ignores the plain language of the BIT and produces a result that is antithetical to the BIT's object and purpose.\n\n*See supra* note 26.\n\n51.\n\nFirst, the Annex does not permit exceptions in any services sector; instead, the Annex permits exceptions to be made for measures regulating \"services in any other sector.\" The Annex allows exceptions for the regulation of \"services\" in a given sector, not the regulation of anything in a sector that involves services. Here, there is no suggestion that Canada's review of the shareholding of telecommunications (and other) investments was a regulation of \"services\": it obviously was not, and was, equally obviously, a regulation of financial holdings and corporate control. Nothing in the Annex purports to except future measures of that nature.\n\n52.\n\nSecond, the Annex also does not permit exceptions for measures regulating all services. It only encompasses a defined category of services \u2013 namely, \"services in any other sector.\" Critically, the Tribunal (and Canada) ignore the phrase \"any *other sector*,\" which has a readily-ascertainable and important meaning.\n\n53.\n\nThe Annex's reference to \"any *other sector*\" immediately follows the Annex's reference to:\n\n\"social services (i.e. public law enforcement; correctional services; income security or insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education; public training; health and child care).\"38\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Annex.\n\n54.\n\nIn this context, the most natural reading of the Annex is that services in \"any *other sector*\" is a reference to other \"social services\" in sectors not already specified in the parenthetical in the above quoted text of the Annex. That is what the reference to \"other sectors\" is most plainly construed to mean, and in the context of the Annex, that is the better reading of the reference to \"services.\"\n\n55.\n\nNotably, the Annex does not say \"any services,\" or \"any sector in which services are provided,\" or \"financial, legal, accounting, consulting, telecommunications and any other services.\" Rather, the Annex includes, after a reference to social services in several specified sectors (notably, preceded by an \"i.e.,\" not an \"e.g.,\"), a reference to \"services in any other sector.\" In context, that reference must be to \"services\" in other sectors in addition to those already specified, but without any change from a focus on \"services\" and, specifically, on \"social services.\"\n\n56.\n\nAnd, as already discussed, Canada's challenged measures are regulations of neither \"services,\" much less \"social services,\" in any sector. Critically, Canada's challenged measures are a regulation of investment and ownership/control in the telecommunications sector. Those measures are not a regulation of \"services,\" and are most decidedly not a regulation of \"social services.\" They are a regulation of financial ownership and corporate control, which has nothing to do with the items listed in the Annex.\n\n57.\n\nThird, the Tribunal's reading of the language of the Annex would also make the first of Canada's listed sectors (\"social services\") superfluous: if the second sub-paragraph really did refer generically to all services in any sector, then the first sub-paragraph would be entirely subsumed within it, and therefore would have no independent meaning. The rule of non-redundancy is a fundamental tenet of treaty interpretation in international law39 \u2013 it requires a treaty to be interpreted \"in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every part of the text.\"40 In other words, the reading should not reduce a clause to redundancy or inutility. Applied to our case, understanding the second element of the Annex (\"services in any other sector\") to refer to \"*social* services in any other sector\" is the only way to prevent the first element, \"social services,\" from becoming meaningless.\n\nEdward Gordon, *The World Court and the Interpretation of Constitutive Treaties*, 59 AM. J. OF INT'L L. (1965), p. 814 (\"A twin-forked rule of interpretation constantly mentioned by the Court is (a) that a treaty must be read as a whole to give effect to all of its terms and avoid inconsistency, and (b) that no word or provision may be treated as or rendered superfluous.\"). *See also* Beagle Channel Arbitration (Argentina v. Chile), Court of Arbitration established by the British Government pursuant to the Argentina-Chile General Treaty of Arbitration, 1902, Award of 18 February 1977, 52 INT'L L.R. 140, \u00b6 35 (\"if Chile's view of Article II is correct, the attributions made to her under Article III would appear to be redundant and unnecessary.\"); *Korea\u2014Definitive Safeguard Measure on Imports of Certain Dairy Products*, AB-1999\u20138, WT/DS98/AB/R, p 24, \u00b6\u00b6 80\u201381(1999) (\"it is the duty of any treaty interpreter to read all applicable provisions of a treaty in a way that gives meaning to all of them, harmoniously.\").\n\nGerald G. Fitzmaurice, *supra* note 21, at 211.\n\n58.\n\nMoreover, the first sub-paragraph of the Annex provides in parentheses more detail about sectors that were considered to involve the provision of \"social services\": public law enforcement; correctional services; income security or insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education; public training; and health and child care.41 A natural understanding of the language that immediately follows this provision, in the second sub-paragraph, then, is that \"social services\" are not limited to the sectors indicated in parentheses, but rather capture other sectors as well.\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English Version), Annex (\"social services (i.e. public law enforcement; correctional services; income security or insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education; public training; health and child care i.e. public law enforcement; correctional services; income security or insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education; public training; health and child care)\").\n\n59.\n\nFourth, the Tribunal acknowledges, with some understatement, that \"the breadth of the category 'services in any other sector' might seem surprising\"42 given the Tribunal's interpretation. That is true. The breadth of this category \u2013 apparently encompassing some 70% of Canada's economy \u2013 is particularly striking when contrasted with the narrow character of the sectors identified in the Annex's first sub-paragraph (i.e. \"public law enforcement\" (but not private law enforcement), \"correctional services, and \"public education\" (again, not private education)). It is very odd to think that the drafters of these limited and narrow categories, also intended to make all these limitations redundant and meaningless by way of a passing reference to \"services\" generally. Despite that, the Tribunal's position is that the Annex (silently and secondarily) includes finance, telecommunications, insurance, information technology, energy and the like.\n\nAward, \u00b6 377.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses this implausible reading of the Annex with a reference to \"many of Canada's investment treaties from the mid to late 1990s, which contain similar exceptions for services.\"43 The Tribunal cites bilateral investment treaties between Canada and nine other states that Canada has identified.44 The comparable Annex in all but one of these agreements is identical to that in the Canada-Egypt BIT, leading the Tribunal to conclude that these treaties support both its interpretation of the Annex and the breadth of the \"services in any other sector\" formulation.\n\nIbid.\n\n**RL-026**, Canada-Ukraine FIPA (1994), Article IV(2)(d), Annex; **RL-027**, Canada-Trinidad and Tobago FIPA (1995), Article IV(2)(3), Annex; **RL-089**, Canada-Philippines FIPA (1996), Article IV(2)(4), Annex; **RL-094**, Canada-Barbados FIPA (1996), Article IV(2)(4), Annex; **RL-093**, Canada-Ecuador FIPA (1996), Article IV(2)(4), Annex; **RL-095**, Canada-Venezuela FIPA (1996), Annex II.11.4; **RL-092**, Canada-Panama FIPA (1996), Article IV(2)(4), Annex; **RL-100**, Canada-Thailand FIPA (1997), Article IV(3), Annex I; **RL-028**, Canada-Armenia FIPA (1997), Article IV(2)(d), Annex.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis is unconvincing. The fact that other bilateral investment treaties have language like that in the BIT's Annex merely means that those treaties also raise comparable issues of interpretation (which are not before this Tribunal and which other tribunals have not addressed); that fact says nothing whatsoever about how those issues of interpretation should ultimately be resolved.\n\n62.\n\nMore important, in my view, are treaties concluded at almost the same time as the Canada-Egypt BIT with texts that shed light on what the BIT's Annex was understood to mean. Specifically, the Canada-Thailand BIT, signed in 1997, does not have the language \"services in any other sector\" in its Annex, while the Kingdom of Thailand reserves the right to make and maintain exceptions in \"business in services, i.e., accountancy, attorneyship, architecture, advertisement, brokerage or agency, auction, haircutting, hair dressing, and beauty treatment.\"45 Similarly, the Canada-Philippines BIT contains an exception from the Philippines for \"services involving the practice of licensed profession.\"46\n\n**RL-100**, Canada-Thailand FIPA (1997), Article IV(3), Annex I(2).\n\n**RL-089**, Canada-Philippines FIPA (1996), Article IV(2)(4), Annex I(b).\n\n63.\n\nIn other words, at the same time the Canada-Egypt BIT was concluded, texts that Canada negotiated described with some detail, and in a very limited manner, the industries that would fall under the \"services\" exception. That does not support, and instead contradicts, the Tribunal's view that the Annex contained very broad services exceptions (and was part of a consistent Canadian practice of including such exceptions); instead, at the most relevant times, Canada's bilateral investment treaties had the reverse.\n\n64.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal ignores the fact that Canada has specifically identified \"telecommunications services\" as an exception in other bilateral investment treaties.47 Canada argues that these treaties reveal an \"evolution in the architecture of\" foreign investment protection agreements,48 but the more persuasive inference would be that if Canada had meant to reserve the right to make exceptions in the telecommunications sector, it would have done so expressly, as in other treaties.\n\nJur. Rejoinder, \u00b6 51.\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 223.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal also acknowledges that \"the reference to 'services in any other sector' must be read in the context of the four other listed items.\"49 As the Tribunal notes, the language of the last three exceptions in the Annex is detailed and precise.50 Likewise, the first exception, for \"social services,\" is elaboratively defined in parentheses.51 Like Canada's other bilateral investments treaties, these provisions all suggest a focused and limited, rather than open-ended, approach towards exceptions. In turn, that indicates that the category \"services in any other sector\" should be interpreted in light of the other listed items in the Annex, giving it a more definite meaning in association with \"social services.\"\n\nAward, \u00b6 371.\n\nThe last three items are \"government securities \u2013 as described in SIC 8152\"; \"residency requirements for ownership of oceanfront land\"; and \"measures implementing the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Oil and Gas Accords\"). Exhibit **CL-001**, BIT (English), Annex \u00b6 1.\n\nIbid.\n\n66.\n\nFinally, even if one accepts Canada's position that \"services in any other sector\" means \"any services sector,\" the Annex expressly categorizes telecommunications as a non-services sector in \u00b6 2. The sole \u2013 and sufficient \u2013 guidance in the Annex for identifying a services industry is Statistics Canada's Standard Industrial Classification (\"SIC\").52 According to SIC, telecommunications is not a \"services\" industry; rather, it falls under \"communications and other utilities.\"53 While the telecommunications business may indeed be concerned with the provision of services, the definition in the Annex must control.\n\nExhibit **CL-001**, BIT (English), Annex \u00b6 2. *See also* Exhibit **CL-097**, Statistics Canada, Standard Industrial Classification (1980).\n\nExhibit **CL-097**, Statistics Canada, Standard Industrial Classification (1980), p. 174.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal contends that reliance on the SIC is \"misplaced because it is referenced in the BIT only with respect to government securities and not any other services.\"54 This analysis ignores the plain language of the BIT: \u00b6 2 of the Annex states that \"[f]or the purpose of this Annex, SIC means\u2026.\"55 The Annex does not provide that use of the SIC is limited to the government securities reference \u2013 for instance, \"for the purpose of government securities,\" or \"for the purpose of the third item under Annex (1).\" Paragraph 2's reference to the SIC is clear and unambiguous, and, in turn, the SIC plainly excludes telecommunications.\n\nAward, \u00b6 378, fn. 538 (internal quotations omitted).\n\nExhibit **CL-001**, BIT (English), Annex \u00b6 2.\n\n**IV.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute has been submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt for the promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 11 March 1997 (the \"**BIT**\")1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English Version); **CL-002**, BIT (French Version); **CL-003**, BIT (Arabic Version). GTH refers to this agreement as the \"BIT,\" whereas Canada refers to it as the \"FIPA.\" Although the Tribunal has no preference for one of these terms over the other, it has chosen to use a single term, \"BIT,\" for consistency.\n\n2.\n\nIn this Award, the Tribunal first introduces the Parties (Section II) and provides an overview of the factual background to the dispute (Section III). Section IV sets out the procedural history leading up to this Award, and Section V recalls the Parties' requests for relief. The Tribunal then addresses the objections to jurisdiction and admissibility (Section VI), before turning to the claims on the merits (Section VII). The Parties' requests for costs are considered in Section VIII.\n\n3.\n\nUltimately, the Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction over all claims except the national treatment claim. On the merits, the Tribunal dismisses the remaining claims. The Tribunal's Award is set forth in Section X.\n\n4.\n\nIn reaching the decisions contained in this Award, the Tribunal has carefully reviewed and considered all the arguments presented by the Parties in both their written and oral submissions. The fact that a specific argument is not expressly referenced in this Award does not mean that it has not been considered, as the Tribunal includes only those points which it considers most relevant for its decisions.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES**\n-------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe claimant is Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. (\"**GTH**\" or \"**Claimant**\"), a joint stock company incorporated under the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"**Egypt**\") and listed on the Egyptian Stock Exchange.2 GTH, which was formerly known as Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E., operates mobile telecommunications networks in several markets around the world. Its registered office is 2005 Nile City Towers, North Tower, Cornish El Nile, Ramlet Beaulac, 11221 Cairo, Egypt.3\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex E; Merits Memorial, \u00b6 1.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 15.\n\n6.\n\nThe respondent is Canada (also referred to as the \"**Respondent**\"), a sovereign State. Canada has been an ICSID Contracting State since 1 December 2013.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe following summary is intended to provide a general overview of the factual background to the dispute between the Parties. It is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all facts considered relevant by the Tribunal. Further factual material will be addressed in the context of the Tribunal's analysis of the issues in dispute below.\n\n**A. OVERVIEW OF CANADA'S WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKET**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOversight of the Canadian wireless telecommunications industry is exercised primarily by two Canadian government authorities. Industry Canada, headed by the Minister of Industry (the \"**Minister**\"), manages the radio frequency spectrum in Canada pursuant to the Radiocommunication Act.4 The Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (the \"**CRTC**\") regulates telecommunications carriers pursuant to the Telecommunications Act.5\n\n**C-057**, *Radiocommunication Act*, R.S.C., 1985, c. R-2; **C-036**, Industry Canada, Policy and Call for Applications \u2014 Wireless Personal Communications Services in the 2 GHz Range \u2014 Implementing PCS in Canada, 15 June 1995.\n\n**C-046**, *Telecommunications Act*, S.C. 1993, c. 38; **R-197**, CRTC, website excerpt, Telecom Decision CRTC 94-15, 12 August 1994.\n\n9.\n\nIn addition, telecommunications providers are subject to generally applicable legislation such as the Canadian Competition Act, pursuant to which the Competition Bureau reviews mergers and acquisitions and investigates anti-competitive practices.6\n\n**R-106**, *Competition Act*, R.S.C., 1985.\n\n10.\n\nThe Canadian telecommunications market has expanded significantly since the late 1990s. However, by 2007, the market was highly concentrated, with 94% of market share held by three dominant carriers: Rogers Communications Inc. (\"**Rogers**\"), Bell Canada (\"**Bell**\"), and TELUS Communications Company (\"**Telus**\") (together, the \"**Incumbents**\").7 Mobile wireless spectrum was also concentrated in the hands of the Incumbents.8 Canadian consumers were paying high prices and service penetration was low, relative to other markets.9\n\n**C-079**, 2008 CRTC Report, p. 227; **C-056**, 2007 CRTC Report, p. 92.\n\n**R-084**, Memorandum from Iain Stewart, Industry Canada to Deputy Minister, Industry Canada, Annex B, slide 11.\n\n**C-079**, 2008 CRTC Report, p. 228.\n\n**B. THE 2008 AWS AUCTION**\n---------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn 2007, Industry Canada identified new Advanced Wireless Services (\"**AWS**\") spectrum for release by auction.10 In light of the market and spectrum concentration prevailing at the time, Industry Canada viewed the auction as an opportunity to open the market to new wireless operators (\"**New Entrants**\").11\n\n**C-050**, AWS Auction Consultation.\n\n**C-050**, AWS Auction Consultation, Part II, \u00a7 2.7; **C-004**, AWS Auction Policy Framework, p. 4 (\"The measures being taken are intended to ensure an opportunity for entry by addressing the potential to exploit spectrum as an entry barrier. The department is satisfied that the potential benefits of new entry warrant these measures.\"); **C-048**, Industry Canada, Spectrum Policy Provisions and Consultation on a Framework to Auction Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range for Advanced Wireless Services: Briefing to ADM SITT, 21 November 2006, slide 6 (\"the auction is a unique opportunity for creating opportunity for new market entry\"). The Term \"New Entrants\" is defined in the AWS Auction Policy Framework as \"Any entity, including affiliates and associated entities, which holds less than 10 percent of the national wireless market based on revenue.\" **C-004**, AWS Auction Policy Framework, p. 5.\n\n12.\n\nOn 16 February 2007, Industry Canada initiated the consultation phase for the auction of AWS spectrum licenses to be held in 2008 (the \"**2008 AWS Auction**\") with the publication of the *Consultation on a Framework to Auction Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range including Advanced Wireless Services* (the \"**2008 AWS Auction Consultation**\").12 In this document, Industry Canada noted its overall objective of fostering a competitive wireless telecommunications market and identified certain barriers to market entry, including the \"unavailability of spectrum\" and the \"high fixed cost of building a wireless network\" to replicate the networks controlled by Incumbents.13 The document also stated that \"[f]oreign investment restrictions have the effect of limiting potential entry in the telecommunications market thereby reducing the competitive discipline that the threat of entry can provide.\"14\n\n**C-050**, 2008 AWS Auction Consultation.\n\n**C-050**, 2008 AWS Auction Consultation, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 2.5 and 2.7.\n\n**C-050**, 2008 AWS Auction Consultation, Part II, \u00a7 2.5.\n\n13.\n\nIndustry Canada sought input on, *inter alia* : (a) whether it was necessary to adopt measures in the 2008 AWS Auction to enable market entry; (b) if so, whether setting aside spectrum for New Entrants or introducing spectrum caps would be most effective in fostering competition; (c) the possibility of mandating that Incumbents offer roaming services to New Entrants; and (d) the proposed conditions of license.15\n\n**C-050**, 2008 AWS Auction Consultation, pp. 20-25.\n\n**(1) The Spectrum Policy Framework and Licensing Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 13 June 2007, Industry Canada published a revised *Spectrum Policy Framework for Canada*, which provides the general \"policy foundation\" for the spectrum management in Canada.16 It stated that Canada's objective was to \"maximize the economic and social benefits that Canadians derive from the use of the radio frequency spectrum resource.\"17 It stressed the importance of relying on market forces \"to the maximum extent feasible\" and stated that \"[r]egulatory measures, where required, should be minimally intrusive, efficient and effective.\"18\n\n**C-052**, Industry Canada, Spectrum Policy Framework for Canada (DGTP-001-07), June 2007.\n\n**C-052**, Industry Canada, Spectrum Policy Framework for Canada (DGTP-001-07), June 2007, \u00a7 4.3.\n\n**C-052**, Industry Canada, Spectrum Policy Framework for Canada (DGTP-001-07), June 2007, \u00a7 4.4.\n\n15.\n\nThen, in September 2007, Industry Canada released the *Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services*, providing the general policies and procedures applicable to the issuance and transfer of spectrum licenses.19 With regard to the transfer of licenses, this document states that spectrum licenses obtained through an auction process enjoy \"enhanced transferability and divisibility rights\" and that such \"licences may be transferred in whole or in part (either in geographic area or in bandwidth) to a third party subject to the conditions stated on the licence and other applicable regulatory requirements.\"20 It also specified the \"conditions and guidelines\" applicable to the transfer of spectrum.21\n\n**C-003**, Industry Canada, Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services (CPC-2-1-23, Issue 2), September 2007.\n\n**C-003**, Industry Canada, Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services (CPC-2-1-23, Issue 2), September 2007, \u00a7 5.6.\n\n**C-003**, Industry Canada, Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services (CPC-2-1-23, Issue 2), September 2007, \u00a7 5.6.\n\n**(2) The 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework and Licensing Framework**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nOn 28 November 2007, Canada published its *Policy Framework for the Auction for Spectrum Licences for Advanced Wireless Services and other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range* (the \"**2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework**\").22 Further to the 2008 AWS Auction Consultation, Industry Canada had decided to set aside spectrum for New Entrants in the 2008 AWS Auction and to provide for mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing.\n\n**C-004**, Industry Canada, Policy Framework for the Auction for Spectrum Licences for Advanced Wireless Services and other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range, November 2007 (\"2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework\").\n\n17.\n\nBoth Parties have highlighted the following general statement set out in the 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework:\n\nThe department is committed to government policies which seek to rely on market forces to the maximum extent feasible for the provision of telecommunications services to Canadians. This policy approach can only be pursued in an environment where market forces can be expected to deliver, now and in the future, a level of competition sufficient to protect the interests of users. Accordingly, in making this resource available, a critical consideration has been to implement an auction framework that will help ensure that market forces support a telecommunications infrastructure that delivers innovation and consumer choice at competitive prices.23\n\n**C-004**, 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, p. 2. *See* Merits Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59; Merits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 72.\n\n18.\n\nVarious measures and terms set forth in the Policy Framework are relevant to the current dispute, including the following:\n\na. *Set-Aside Spectrum* : Canada reserved 40 MHz (approximately 40%) of the spectrum that was to be auctioned for bidding exclusively by New Entrants.24 This is referred to as the 'set-aside' spectrum.\n\nb. *Mandatory Roaming* : Canada mandated that Incumbents provide roaming to AWS licensees outside of the licensees' territory for ten years (the term of the AWS license) and roaming within the licensees' territory for five years while the licensees built out their network, with a possible five-year extension for New Entrants that met specified rollout targets.25 Incumbents were required to make roaming \"available at commercial rates,\" described as rates \"that are reasonably comparable to rates that are currently charged to others for similar services.\"26 Further, arrangements were to be offered \"wherever technically feasible\" and negotiated in good faith within certain time frames.27 In the event that \"the parties [were] unable to come to an agreement within the established time frame, the parties [would] be required to undertake binding arbitration.\"28\n\nc. *Mandatory Tower/site Sharing* : Canada mandated tower/site sharing wherever technically feasible in order to prohibit exclusive site arrangements. Sharing agreements were to be negotiated in good faith within prescribed time frames. Licensees would \"be directed to binding arbitration to resolve disputes where they cannot finalize an agreement to share within certain time frames.\"29\n\nd. *Rollout Targets* : The 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework set forth roll-out targets to be achieved within five years, which would be taken into account by Industry Canada in deciding whether to renew the AWS licences after the ten-year licence term and in considering applications from New Entrants for an extension of mandated in-territory roaming beyond the initial five-year period.30\n\ne. *Five-Year Transfer Restriction* : The 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework stated that \"[w]hile all licence transfers must be approved by the Minister, licences obtained through the set-aside may not be transferred to companies that do not meet the criteria of a new entrant for a period of 5 years from the date of issuance.\"31\n\n**C-004**, 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, p. 5\n\n**C-004**, 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, pp. 8-9. Roaming is the process by which one operator's subscribers can access another operator's network in areas where the subscriber's operator lacks infrastructure.

In considering **C-062**, the Tribunal also considered **C-467** admitted pursuant to PO 10.\n\n**(3) Mandatory Roaming & Tower/Site Sharing Policies**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe 2008 AWS Policy and Licensing Frameworks left the specific procedures, policies and time frames related to mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing to be set forth in the final conditions of license (\"**COLs**\"), which would be released later. In November 2007, in parallel with its release of the 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, Canada had initiated a consultation on the proposed COLs relating to conditions of license to mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing.35\n\n**C-060**, Industry Canada, Notice No. DGRB-010-07 \u2013 Consultation on Proposed Conditions of Licence to Mandate Roaming and Antenna Tower and Site Sharing and to Prohibit Exclusive Site Arrangements, November 2007.\n\n22.\n\nOn 29 February 2008, Industry Canada released the results of this consultation in a notice of the final Conditions of Licence for Mandatory Roaming and Antenna Tower and Site Sharing and to Prohibit Exclusive Site Arrangements.36\n\n**C-067**, Industry Canada, Notice No. DGRB-002-08 \u2013 Conditions of Licence for Mandatory Roaming and Antenna Tower and Site Sharing and to Prohibit Exclusive Site Arrangements, 29 February 2008. *See also* **C-007**, Industry Canada, Conditions of Licence for Mandatory Roaming and Antenna Tower and Site Sharing and to Prohibit Exclusive Site Arrangements (CPC-2-0-17, Issue 1), November 2008.\n\n23.\n\nIn May 2008, Industry Canada initiated consultations on the arbitration rules and procedures that would apply to roaming and tower/site sharing disputes, the results of which were released on 29 November 2008 in a circular titled *Industry Canada's Arbitration Rules and Procedures*.37\n\n**C-090**, Industry Canada, Industry Canada's Arbitration Rules and Procedures (CPC-2-0-18, Issue 1), November 2008.\n\n**(4) The Ownership & Control Rules**\n-------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe 2008 AWS Auction was also subject to Canada's ownership and control rules (\"**O&C Rules**\"). At the time, under the Telecommunications Act and the Radiocommunications Regulations, any radiocommunications common carrier was required to be \"Canadian-owned and controlled.\" With respect to a corporation, this meant that Canadians had to own \"not less than 80 per cent of the corporation's voting shares issued and outstanding.\"38\n\n**C-001**, Radiocommunication Regulations, SOR/96-484, \u00a7 10(1) (\"**Canadian-owned and controlled** means, in respect of a corporation, that (a) not less than 80 per cent of the members of the board of directors of the corporation are individual Canadians, (b) Canadians beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate and otherwise than by way of security only, not less than 80 per cent of the corporation's voting shares issued and outstanding, and (c) the corporation is not otherwise controlled by persons who are not Canadians\"); **C-046**, Telecommunications Act, \u00a7 16(3).\n\n25.\n\nFurther, under the Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations, a non-Canadian could not own more than 33 1/3% of the voting shares of a holding company of a Canadian carrier.39 The CRTC had authority to review compliance of the O&C Rules under the Telecommunications Act, while Industry Canada was responsible for ensuring compliance with the identical O&C Rules under the Radiocommunication Regulations.\n\n**C-035**, Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations, SOR/94-667, \u00a7 2.\n\n26.\n\nIn August 2007, Industry Canada released an updated circular advising on the procedures relating to \"Canadian Ownership and Control.\"40\n\n**C-058**, Industry Canada, Canadian Ownership and Control (CPC-2-0-15, Issue 2), August 2007.\n\n**(5) Results of the 2008 AWS Auction**\n---------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe 2008 AWS Auction began on 27 May 2008 and closed on 21 July 2008. Canada raised CAD 4.3 billion in revenue through the auction, and six New Entrants won licenses.41 One of those New Entrants was Wind Mobile, a joint venture between GTH and a Canadian operator, as discussed below.42 Wind Mobile won 30 AWS spectrum licenses (covering a population of 23.3 million) at a price of CAD 442.1 million.43\n\n**C-080**, Industry Canada, Auction of Spectrum Licences for Advanced Wireless Services and Other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range \u2013 Licence Winners, 21 July 2008.\n\n*See* \u00a7 III.C below.\n\n**C-082**, Letter from Michael D.

GTH'S INVESTMENT IN WIND MOBILE**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**(1) GTH's Entry into the Canadian Market**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe 2008 AWS Auction generated significant interest by potential investors, including Globalive Communications Corp. (\"**Globalive**\"), a Canadian telecommunications operator.49 Globalive began seeking investors with which it could partner to participate in the auction. At the same time, GTH had learned that Canada was planning to set aside spectrum in the 2008 AWS Action for New Entrants and saw a potentially promising investment opportunity in the Canadian market.50\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.\n\n**C-065**, Email from Mike O'Connor to Aldo Mareuse, et al., 28 February 2008 [REDACTED]\n\n32.\n\nGlobalive and GTH entered into talks in February 2008 to explore the possibility of a joint venture. On 6 March 2008, they executed a memorandum of understanding, by which GTH agreed to (a) enter into an exclusive negotiation period with Globalive and [REDACTED] GTH's investment committee had received information concerning Globalive's background and experience and its proposed joint venture structure, as well as the Canadian legal and regulatory framework and important terms of the 2008 AWS Auction.52 GTH also sought advice from the Canadian law firm [REACTED] regarding compliance with the O&C Rules.53\n\n**C-066**, Email from Mike O'Connor to Assaad Kairouz, et al., 29 February 2008, attaching Globalive materials.\n\n**CWS-Dobbie**, \u00b6 11.\n\n33.\n\nOn 10 March 2008, Globalive Wireless LP (later known as Globalive Wireless Management Corp. and operating under the brand name Wind Mobile) (\"**Wind Mobile**\") filed an application to participate in the 2008 AWS Auction and provided the required deposit [REDACTED] totalling CAD 235 million.54 Industry Canada accepted Wind Mobile's application.\n\n**C-069**, Globalive Wireless LP, Application to Participate in the Auction for Spectrum Licences for Advanced Wireless Services and other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range, 10 March 2008; [REDACTED]\n\n34.\n\nThe Parties agree that during the period after GTH entered into exclusive negotiations with Globalive, GTH conducted detailed due diligence of the Canadian telecommunications market and the regulatory framework.55 In May 2008, GTH's investment committee decided to go forward with the joint venture with Globalive and participate in the 2008 AWS Auction through Wind Mobile.56\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 84; Merits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 93.\n\n**CWS-Dobbie**, \u00b6 16.\n\n35.\n\nAs noted above, through its participation in the auction, Wind Mobile was issued 30 AWS spectrum licenses for a total of CAD 442.1 million.57\n\n**C-082**, Letter from Michael D.

(\"**GCHO**\") and Mojo Investments Corp. (\"**Mojo**\"), another Canadian company.58 In this agreement, GTH agreed that it would advance funds for the total amount of the spectrum licenses through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Global Telecom Holding Canada Limited (\"**GTHCL**\") (known at the time as OTHCL), and that those licenses and all related rights would be held by Wind Mobile.59\n\n**C-084**, Globalive, Declaration of Ownership and Control of Globalive Wireless LP as a Provisional Winner of Spectrum Licences in the 2GHz Range Including AWS, PCS and the Band 1670-1675 MHz, 5 August 2008, pp. 16-56 (hereinafter, \"**Declaration of Ownership and Control**\") (Amended and Restated Investment Agreement Globalive Communications Holdings Ontario Inc. and Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E. and Mojo Investments Corp., 30 July 2008).\n\n**C-084**, Globalive, Declaration of Ownership and Control of Globalive Wireless LP as a Provisional Winner of Spectrum Licences in the 2GHz Range Including AWS, PCS and the Band 1670-1675 MHz, 5 August 2008, pp. 16-56 (Amended and Restated Investment Agreement Globalive Communications Holdings Ontario Inc. and Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E. and Mojo Investments Corp., 30 July 2008, \u00a7 3).\n\n37.\n\nThe following day, 31 July 2008, GTH entered into two shareholder agreements (together, the \"**SHAs**\"):\n\na. an agreement under which GTHCL and Globalive Investment Holdings Corp. (\"**Globalive Investment**\") owned all the shares in Globalive Canada Holdings Corp.

However, according to GTH's General Counsel, Mr. David Dobbie, GTH understood \"that there was a policy movement in Canada towards a relaxation of the O&C Rules.\"62 Thus, the SHAs and the Articles of Incorporation for Globalive Investment gave GTH the right to take voting control over Wind Mobile if the O&C Rules were relaxed in the future.63\n\n**CWS-Dobbie**, \u00b6 11.\n\n**C-084**, Declaration of Ownership and Control, 5 August 2008, pp. 80, 92 (Globalive Holdco SHA, Clause 6.6 and Schedule C), pp. 119, 134-35 (Globalive Investment SHA, Clause 6.8 and Schedule C), pp. 137-49 (Globalive Canada Holdings Corp.

Under this type of review, documentary evidence filed by the carrier under review will be available for public inspection. Third parties will have an opportunity to file written submissions and request to provide oral submissions on that evidence.

During this process, further changes were made to Wind Mobile's structure in response to concerns expressed by the CRTC.88 Yet ultimately, the CRTC determined that Wind Mobile did not satisfy the O&C Rules. In its decision of 29 October 2009 (the \"**CRTC Decision**\"), the CRTC found that Wind Mobile had \"met the test for legal control\" but was \"controlled in fact by Orascom, a non-Canadian\" and therefore did \"not meet the requirements set out in section 16 of the [Telecommunications] Act and [was not] eligible to operate as a telecommunications common carrier.\"89\n\n**C-015**, CRTC, Telecom Decision CRTC 2009-678: Review of Globalive Wireless Management Corp. under the Canadian ownership and control regime, 29 October 2009, \u00b6 31.\n\n**C-015**, CRTC, Telecom Decision CRTC 2009-678: Review of Globalive Wireless Management Corp. under the Canadian ownership and control regime, 29 October 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 119.\n\n51.\n\nThe CEO of Wind Mobile at the time, Mr. Ken Campbell, wrote to the Minister of Industry, opposing the CRTC Decision.

The GiC disagreed with the CRTC's finding that Orascom controlled Wind Mobile in fact. Thus, on 10 December 2009, the GiC varied the CRTC Decision (the \"**GiC Decision**\").91 It held that Wind Mobile satisfied the O&C Rules under the Telecommunications Act and was eligible to operate as a Canadian telecommunications common carrier.92\n\n**C-017**, Order of the Privy Council and Schedule, P.C. 2009-2008, 10 December 2009.\n\n**C-017**, Order of the Privy Council and Schedule, P.C. 2009-2008, 10 December 2009.\n\n53.\n\nIn December 2009, Wind Mobile commenced operations as a telecommunications carrier.93\n\n**R-069**, Globe and Mail, Lacavera in race against clock for holiday sales; Ottawa's decision to overturn CRTC ruling clears Canada's newest wireless company to launch immediately, 12 December 2009\n\n54.\n\nThe GiC Decision was challenged in Federal Court by Public Mobile Inc., another New Entrant.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MANDATORY ROAMING AND TOWER/SITE SHARING**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nAs noted above, in parallel with the 2008 AWS Auction, Industry Canada adopted a policy of mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing, pursuant to which licensees were required to negotiate in good faith and provide other operators roaming and tower/site sharing at reasonable commercial terms.\n\n57.\n\nAfter the 2008 AWS Auction, Industry Canada received complaints from both Incumbents and New Entrants (including Wind Mobile) that licensees were not following the COLs on roaming and site/tower sharing.97 By letter of 15 May 2009, Wind Mobile sought clarification from Industry Canada regarding the conditions on roaming, noting that a response \"is much needed and will be greatly appreciated and is, in fact, required for Rogers and [Wind Mobile] to usefully advance our negotiations and, if necessary, to proceed to arbitration.\"98\n\n**RWS-Hill**, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\n**C-097**, Letter from Simon Lockie to Peter Hill, 15 May 2009.\n\n58.\n\nOn 1 June 2009, Industry Canada responded as follows:\n\nWhile Industry Canada may provide clarifications on the existing conditions of licence, I would like to remind you that Industry Canada will only formally rule on technical feasibility or potential breaches of the conditions of licence. Disputes regarding the commercial aspects, terms or costs related to the roaming agreement should be dealt with through negotiations between the parties, and if necessary, the arbitration process as set out by Industry Canada.99\n\n**C-100**, Letter from Peter Hill to Simon Lockie, 1 June 2009. Mr. Peter Hill testifies that in several instances, Industry Canada provided Wind Mobile specific assistance in its negotiations with other licensees. **RWS-Hill**, \u00b6 98; Annex B.\n\n59.\n\nGTH alleges that the arbitration process was not a viable option and that Wind Mobile therefore \"had no commercial choice but to agree to the terms imposed by Rogers in order to provide service to subscribers in areas where it did not have any towers or coverage.\"100\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 151.\n\n60.\n\nWith regard to tower/site sharing, Industry Canada released a consultation document in February 2009. Based on the responses, in April 2009, it released its *Guidelines for Compliance with the Conditions of Licence Relating to Antenna Tower and Site Sharing and to Prohibit Exclusive Site Arrangements*.101 Yet as of July 2010, New Entrants requesting to share on towers were only 4.5% successful in reaching agreements, according to Industry Canada statistics.102\n\n**C-093**, Tower/Site Sharing Guidelines.\n\n**C-118**, Industry Canada, *Roaming and Tower Sharing Review*, Slide 25.\n\n61.\n\nIn November 2010, the Minister announced that Industry Canada was commencing a review of its roaming and tower/site sharing policy.103 Industry Canada retained the consulting firm Nordicity to assess the effectiveness of the policy, and Nordicity provided its final report in May 2011.104\n\n**C-113**, Industry Canada, News Release: Minister Clement Updates Canadians on Canada's Digital Economy Strategy, 22 November 2010.\n\n**R-137**, Request for Proposal # IC400998, 25 November 2010, p. 4.\n\n62.\n\nIn March 2012, Industry Canada launched a public consultation on proposed changes to the COLs on roaming and tower/site sharing.105 Wind Mobile commented on the proposal in May and June 2012 and also met with the Minister of Industry in January 2013 to push for regulatory change. Wind Mobile suggested, *inter alia*, that (a) domestic wholesale roaming rates be capped, (b) the rates be subject to CRTC review, (c) existing roaming agreements be reopened, and (d) exclusivity provisions in roaming agreements be prohibited.106\n\n**C-121**, Industry Canada, Proposed Revisions to the Frameworks for Mandatory Roaming and Antenna Tower and Site Sharing, March 2012.\n\n**R-076**, Globalive Wireless Management Corp.

The 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework noted that the CRTC was reviewing the O&C Rules, which \"act as restrictions on foreign investment which constitutes a barrier to market entry,\" but that [r]emoval or liberalization of these requirements would require legislative changes.\"113\n\n**C-004**, 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, p. 3. *See also* **C-050**, 2008 AWS Auction Consultation, \u00a7 2.5.1 (\"Foreign investment restrictions have the effect of limiting potential entry in the telecommunications market thereby reducing the competitive discipline that the threat of entry can provide.

THE 2013 TRANSFER FRAMEWORK**\n----------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nIn the years following the 2008 AWS Auction, Canada became concerned about the prospect of spectrum concentration once the five-year restriction on the transfer of set-aside licenses expired. Industry Canada had announced that that it would be holding 700 MHz and 2500 MHz spectrum auctions and that there would be spectrum caps so that New Entrants could access prime spectrum.148 Yet the viability of the New Entrants was in question, and it was unclear whether they would participate.149\n\n**C-122**, Industry Canada, Policy and Technical Framework, Mobile Broadband Services (MBS) \u2013 700 MHz Band, Broadband Radio Services (BRS) \u2013 2500 MHZ Band (SMSE-002-12), March 2012, \u00b6 35.\n\n**RWS-Stewart**, \u00b6 50.\n\n86.\n\nAgainst this background, on 14 January 2013, Shaw (a New Entrant) announced that it had reached an agreement with Rogers (an Incumbent) to sell Rogers a purchase option on its set-aside licenses.150 Industry analysts saw that the market was consolidating,151 and Wind Mobile strongly opposed the deal, urging Industry Canada to \"immediately revoke Shaw's AWS licenses.\"152\n\n**C-136**, *Shaw Announces Agreement With Rogers for Purchase and Sale of Assets*, 14 January 2013. Rogers and Shaw had sought a preliminary review of this option agreement from Industry Canada in October 2012. Industry Canada responded as follows: \"Based on the documentation that you have provided, we conclude that the proposed option agreement is not prohibited under the A WS condition of licence concerning licence transferability. However, we do consider that the agreement would be inconsistent with intent of the conditions and the Framework. You cannot apply for the transfer of Shaw's set-aside licences until September 2, 2014.\" **R-099**, Letter from Peter Hill, Industry Canada to Ken Engelhart, Rogers Communications and Jean Brazeau, Shaw Communications, 19 November 2012.\n\n**C-142**, Scotiabank, Biweekly Report: Converging Networks: The Writing's on the Wall \u2013 The Canadian Wireless Market is Consolidating, 21 January 2013.\n\n**R-360**, Letter from Simon Lockie, Wind Mobile to John Knubley, Industry Canada, 22 January 2013.\n\n87.\n\nOn 7 March 2013, Industry Canada released a *Consultation on Considerations Relating to Transfers, Divisions and Subordinate Licensing of Spectrum Licences* (the \"**2013 Transfer Consultation**\"). It proposed that in certain cases, Industry Canada would conduct a \"detailed review\" of proposed license transfers in which it would consider whether the transfer would impact, among other things, \"the efficiency and competitiveness\" of the Canadian telecommunications market.153\n\n**C-152**, 2013 Transfer Consultation, \u00b6 15.\n\n88.\n\nThe *Globe & Mail* reported that the Minister of Industry had initiated the consultation after learning that New Entrants were contemplating selling their spectrum licenses to Incumbents, and that his plan was to have the new rules in place before the five-year transfer restriction expired.154\n\n**C-171**, Rita Trichur & Boyd Erman, *Ottawa moving quickly to finalize wireless rules*, THE GLOBE & MAIL, 15 April 2013. *See* **C-166**, Rita Trichur, *Wireless carriers sound alarm over Ottawa's spectrum transfer plan*, THE GLOBE & MAIL, 4 April 2013\n\n89.\n\nTogether with the 2013 Transfer Consultation, Industry Canada issued a press release titled \"Harper Government Puts Consumers First in Telecommunications Plan,\"155 and the Minister of Industry gave a speech in which he stated:\n\n[O]ur government is delivering on our promise to use the upcoming wireless spectrum auctions to promote four competitors in each region of the country. \u2026 [B]efore the auction, we will review the policy on spectrum licence transfers with the objective of promoting competition in the wireless sector.

He stated:\n\nThese licences were specifically set aside for new entrants in the AWS auction. I have been clear. The Government has been clear.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n111.\n\nOn 28 May 2016, GTH submitted to ICSID a Request for Arbitration, including exhibits 1 to 36 and Annexes A to I.\n\n112.\n\nOn 6 June 2016, in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration and so notified the Parties. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible pursuant to Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n113.\n\nBy correspondence of 12 and 13 August 2016, the Parties informed ICSID of their agreed method of constituting the Tribunal. The Parties agreed that the Tribunal would be composed of three members, with each Party appointing one arbitrator, and third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed pursuant to a list procedure. In this regard, the Parties specified that they would exchange lists of candidates for the President of the Tribunal without copying ICSID.\n\n114.\n\nIn accordance with the Parties' agreed method of appointment, GTH appointed Mr. Gary Born, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator. Canada then appointed Professor Vaughan Lowe, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator. Professor Lowe accepted his appointment on 19 August 2016, and Mr. Born accepted his appointment on 25 August 2016.\n\n115.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, the Parties informed ICSID that they had agreed to an amended schedule for the list procedure by which the presiding arbitrator was to be appointed.\n\n116.\n\nOn 19 January 2017, the Parties jointly requested ICSID's assistance in appointing the President of the Tribunal. Specifically, the Parties asked ICSID to provide them with a list of seven candidates, which had been pre-screened for conflicts and availability. Upon receipt of the list, each Party had the option to agree to appoint a candidate from the other Party's previously exchanged lists of candidates. Otherwise, each Party would be permitted to strike two names from the list and rank the remaining candidates from one to five, with one being the most preferred. The candidate with the lowest total score would be appointed.\n\n117.\n\nAt ICSID's request, the Parties specified on 25 January 2017 that in the event of a tie among candidates, the candidate with the lowest difference between the points assigned by each Party would be appointed. If the tie were still not resolved, the Parties would attempt to agree on one of the candidates with the lowest total score. In the absence of agreement, the Secretary-General would select and appoint the President from among those candidates.\n\n118.\n\nOn 6 February 2017, ICSID provided the Parties with the requested strike-and-rank list.\n\n119.\n\nPursuant to the Parties' agreed procedure, considering the results of the Parties' rankings, the Secretary-General appointed Professor Dr. Georges Affaki, a national of France and Syria, as President of the Tribunal. Professor Affaki accepted his appointment on 21 February 2017.\n\n120.\n\nOn the same date, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. The Parties were provided copies of the declarations required under ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) signed by Professor Affaki, Mr. Born and Professor Lowe, as well as the accompanying statements of Mr. Born and Professor Lowe.\n\n121.\n\nFollowing its constitution, the Tribunal consulted with the Parties regarding the format and date of the first session. The Tribunal determined that the first session would be held by teleconference on 21 April 2017.\n\n122.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, in preparation for the first session, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties a draft agenda and a draft procedural order, which had been approved by the Tribunal. The Parties were invited to confer on procedural matters and to inform the Tribunal of any agreements they reached or, in the absence of agreement, of their respective positions.\n\n123.\n\nOn 7 April 2017, the Parties submitted a joint draft procedural order reflecting the Parties' agreement on most procedural issues. A limited number of matters remained in dispute, including the place of the proceeding, confidentiality and the \"number and sequence of pleadings, including whether the proceedings should be bifurcated to deal with Canada's preliminary objections on jurisdiction and admissibility.\"195\n\nEmail from the Claimant (on behalf of the Parties) to the Tribunal of 7 April 2017.\n\n124.\n\nLater on 7 April 2017, GTH submitted a letter addressing the disputed procedural issues. Canada submitted (a) a request for bifurcation, including legal authorities RL-001 to RL-036, and (b) a letter addressing the other disputed procedural matters.\n\n125.\n\nOn 14 April 2017, Canada submitted a letter containing its response to GTH's letter of 7 April 2017. On the same day, GTH filed a Submission on Bifurcation, Publication and Place of Proceeding, together with legal authorities CL-001 to CL-0018.\n\n126.\n\nAlso on 14 April 2017, the Tribunal confirmed that the Parties would be given an opportunity to make oral presentations on the issue of bifurcation during the first session. The Tribunal noted that, after hearing the Parties' presentations, it would consult the Parties regarding the need for any further procedure.\n\n127.\n\nThe first session was held by teleconference as scheduled on 21 April 2017.\n\n128.\n\nFollowing the first session, the Tribunal determined that it would be premature to decide whether to bifurcate the proceeding at that stage, and that the Tribunal would be better-placed to decide after receiving the Respondent's jurisdictional objections. The Tribunal informed the Parties of this determination on 2 May 2017.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal continued to consult the Parties regarding the outstanding disputed procedural issues, encouraging them to agree as far as possible. The Parties were able to reach agreement on certain matters, including that the place of arbitration would be Paris, France. On 13 June 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\"), embodying the agreements of the Parties and the decisions of the Tribunal regarding the procedure to govern the arbitration. The Procedural Timetable was attached as Annex A of PO1.\n\n130.\n\nWith regard to issues of confidentiality and transparency, the Parties were directed to consult and agree on a draft confidentiality order. PO1 provided that The Tribunal's awards, decisions and orders would be published on the ICSID website, subject to the redaction of confidential information under a Confidentiality Order to be agreed by the parties.\n\n131.\n\nOn 31 August 2017, Mr. Born provided the Parties with a supplemental statement pursuant to Arbitration Rule 6.\n\n132.\n\nIn accordance with the Procedural Timetable, on 29 September 2017, GTH filed its Memorial on the Merits and Damages, together with exhibits C-001 to C-254, legal authorities CL-001 to CL-089,196 the Expert Report of Santiago Dellepiane A. and Pablo T. Spiller, and the Witness Statements of Kenneth D. Campbell, Michael C. Connolly, David L. C. Dobbie and Andrew M. Dry (\"**Merits Memorial**\").\n\nThe legal authorities previously submitted with the Claimant's submission of 14 April 2017 were refiled with the Merits Memorial.\n\n133.\n\nOn 5 October 2017, Mr. Born provided the Parties with a supplemental statement pursuant to Arbitration Rule 6.\n\n134.\n\nOn 26 October 2017, the Parties submitted a draft Confidentiality Order. They sought the Tribunal's resolution of one disputed issue. On 30 October 2017, the Tribunal issued the Confidentiality Order applicable to the proceeding.\n\n135.\n\nOn 15 November 2017, Canada filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and Request for Bifurcation, together with exhibits R-001 to R-078, legal authorities RL-038 to RL-163 and the Expert Report of Prof. Dr. Mohamed S. Abdel Wahab (\"**Jur. Memorial**\").\n\n136.\n\nOn 29 November 2017, GTH filed its Response to Canada's Request for Bifurcation.\n\n137.\n\nOn 14 December 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"**PO2**\"), in which it decided to deny the Respondent's request for bifurcation. Accordingly, the arbitration proceeded in accordance with the Procedural Timetable applicable to a joined proceeding.\n\n138.\n\nOn 26 February 2018, Canada filed its Counter-Memorial on Merits and Damages, including exhibits R-079 to R-264 and legal authorities RL-164 to RL-242, the Expert Report of The Brattle Group, and the Witness Statements of Jennifer Aitken, Peter Hill and Iain Stewart (\"**Merits Counter-Memorial**\").\n\n139.\n\nIn accordance with Section 15.1 of PO1 and the Procedural Timetable, on 28 March 2018, each Party served on the other Party a request for the production of documents. Subsequently, each Party set forth its objections to the other Party's requests for documents and then its responses to the other Party's objections.\n\n140.\n\nOn 2 May 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were in the process of discussing their document requests with a view to reaching agreement on additional points. The Parties jointly requested that the deadline to submit the document request schedules to the Tribunal be extended. On 3 May 2018, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties' agreed extension.\n\n141.\n\nOn 14 May 2018, each Party submitted its document production schedule to the Tribunal. The Respondent also submitted a cover letter and supporting documentation.\n\n142.\n\nBy correspondence of 15 and 16 May 2018, the Parties made further, unsolicited submissions relating to the document requests.\n\n143.\n\nOn 1 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, including Annexes A and B (\"**PO3**\") containing its decisions on the Parties' document requests. In PO3, the Tribunal stated that it was \"not ordering the production of any document subject to legal privilege.\"197\n\nPO3, \u00b6 14.\n\n144.\n\nOn 18 July 2018, GTH informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to extend a number of deadlines on the Procedural Timetable. The following day, the Tribunal approved the Parties' agreement.\n\n145.\n\nBy letter of 21 August 2018, Canada requested a further extension of time to complete its document production pursuant to PO3 and proposed a revised Procedural Timetable to accommodate this extension. At the Tribunal's invitation, GTH submitted a response to the Respondent's letter on 24 August 2018. GTH opposed the requested extension. On 27 August 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision on the matter and issued a revised Procedural Timetable.\n\n146.\n\nOn 9 October 2018, GTH submitted a letter to the Tribunal, together with Appendices A to G, in which it objected to certain categories of privilege claimed by Canada. On 10 October 2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal by email that it intended to submit a response to GTH's letter. By email of 11 October 2018, the Tribunal took note of both GTH's letter and Canada's email.\n\n147.\n\nOn 17 October 2018, Canada submitted an electronic copy of its response to GTH's letter of 9 October 2018. Canada subsequently filed a hard copy of the response, together with exhibits R-265 to R-292 and legal authorities RL-243 to RL-255. In its response, Canada informed the Tribunal that there were also outstanding issues related to GTH's production of documents and privilege claims, but did not make any application to the Tribunal in this respect.\n\n148.\n\nOn 2 November 2018, Canada submitted a letter, together with exhibits R-293 to R-295 and Appendices A to F. It requested that the Tribunal (a) order GTH to conduct a document-by-document review and to produce several categories of documents over which it had asserted privilege; and (b) stay the proceedings until the Tribunal had an opportunity to address these issues.\n\n149.\n\nOn 3 November 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"**PO4**\"), addressing GTH's objections to the Canada's privilege claims. Pursuant to PO4, Canada was required to conduct a review of withheld and redacted documents, and to produce any documents not subject to privilege in light of the Tribunal's guidance.\n\n150.\n\nIn the cover email to PO4, the Tribunal invited GTH to comment on Canada's letter of 2 November 2018. The Tribunal also asked for an update regarding the Parties' redaction of the procedural orders which had been issued but not yet published.\n\n151.\n\nOn 5 November 2018, GTH submitted its Reply on Merits & Damages and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, including exhibits C-255 to C-401, legal authorities CL-090 to CL-183, the Expert Report of Dr. Hani Sarie-Eldin and the Second Expert Report of Santiago Dellepiane A. and Pablo T. Spiller (\"**Merits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial**\").\n\n152.\n\nBy letter of 8 November 2018, Canada (a) sought an extension to the deadline for its compliance with PO4; (b) informed the Tribunal that the Parties had reached agreement on the redaction and publication of PO3; and (c) identified a number of disagreements between the Parties regarding the designation of information as Confidential or Restricted Access Information in PO2 and the Parties' submissions.\n\n153.\n\nOn 10 November 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties in response to Canada's letter of 8 November 2018. The Tribunal (a) granted the requested extension; (b) confirmed that PO3 would be published without its Annexes as agreed by the Parties; and (c) set a pleading schedule for the issue of the designation of information as Confidential or Restricted Access Information.\n\n154.\n\nOne 12 November 2018, GTH submitted two letters, together with exhibits C-402 to C-428 and legal authorities CL-184 to CL-188. The first letter responded to Canada's letter of 2 November 2018 concerning GTH's production of documents and privilege claims. The second letter was in response to Canada's letter of 8 November 2018 concerning the designation of information as Confidential or Restricted Access Information.\n\n155.\n\nBy email of 14 November 2018, Canada sought leave to respond to GTH's letter of 12 November 2018 concerning the Claimant's privilege claims.\n\n156.\n\nOn 15 November 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, noting its concern with the multiplication of submissions and replies in relation to privilege claims. The Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided not to grant Canada leave for a further submission, and would instead convene a procedural telephone conference to discuss with the Parties a means to ensure the production of responsive documents within a useful time period while retaining the agreed hearing dates in April 2019.\n\n157.\n\nOn 16 November 2018, Canada submitted its reply on the issue of confidentiality, in accordance with the Tribunal's instructions of 10 November 2018.\n\n158.\n\nOn 19 November 2018, the President held the case management teleconference with the Parties. An audio recording of the teleconference was made available to the Parties and the Tribunal following the call. During the teleconference, at the invitation of the President, the Parties agreed to take a number of steps aimed at completing the document production phase as efficiently as possible.\n\n159.\n\nBy letter of 22 November 2018, the Tribunal reminded the Parties of the various steps agreed during the case management teleconference. In accordance with the Tribunal's directions, both Parties submitted letters on 25 November 2018 providing certain information requested by the Tribunal. GTH submitted exhibits C-429 to C-431 with its letter, and Canada submitted exhibits R-295 to R-298 with its letter concerning privilege under the ICA.\n\n160.\n\nOn 29 November 2018, the Parties submitted a Stern Schedule containing their respective positions on the disputed issues relating to GTH's assertion of legal privilege. It was accompanied by Canada's exhibits R-299 to R-320 and legal authorities RL-256 to RL-261, and GTH's legal authorities CL-189 to CL-192.\n\n161.\n\nOn 2 December 2018, GTH confirmed that its positions in the Stern Schedule did not take account of new arguments advanced by Canada and that it would be available if the Tribunal wished to hear GTH's position on these matters.\n\n162.\n\nOn 7 December 2018, GTH confirmed that the Parties had agreed to the redactions of PO2, and provided the non-confidential version of the Order, which was published on the ICSID website.\n\n163.\n\nOn 13 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, including Annex A (\"**PO5**\"), containing its decision on each outstanding issue of legal privilege that had been identified by the Parties in their Stern Schedule dated 29 November 2018.\n\n164.\n\nIn PO5, the Tribunal addressed the Parties' submissions on whether there is an exception to the waiver of privilege where parties have a common interest. The Tribunal held that, \"the onus is on GTH to demonstrate that the law applicable to privilege for each communication recognises common interest privilege *and* that the communication qualifies for common interest privilege.\"198 GTH was granted leave to present evidence concerning the attachment of common interest privilege for each relevant communication, provided that it did so without delay.\n\nPO5, Annex A, p. 20.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal also noted in PO5 that if the Parties sought further guidance or a determination from the Tribunal in relation to limited waivers of legal privilege, the Tribunal would require better particularised pleadings in this respect.\n\n166.\n\nBy email of 20 December 2018, GTH informed the Tribunal that it planned to make submissions with respect to common interest privilege and limited waiver of privilege, pursuant to PO5. In response, the Tribunal encouraged the Parties to attempt to reach an agreement on these matters. The Tribunal instructed the Parties that, if they were unable to reach such an agreement, they should make precise submissions in the form of a Stern Schedule.\n\n167.\n\nOn 7 January 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had been unable to reach agreement on the remaining issues of legal privilege. On behalf of the Parties, Canada submitted the Stern Schedule containing the Parties' respective positions on these matters.199 It was accompanied by Canada's exhibits R-321 to R-358 and GTH's exhibits C-432 to C-447.\n\nThe Claimant subsequently informed the Tribunal that its supporting documentation had not been properly numbered in the Stern Schedule and filed a corrected version.\n\n168.\n\nOn 11 January 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal of certain agreements they had reached relating to the Procedural Timetable. They provided further clarification about their agreement on 23 January 2019, and in response, the Tribunal issued a revised Procedural Timetable on 28 January 2019.\n\n169.\n\nOn 18 January 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, including Annex A (\"**PO6**\") containing its decision on common interest privilege, limited waiver of privilege and subject matter waiver of privilege.\n\n170.\n\nBy letter of 22 January 2019, Canada requested information regarding the relationship between Mr. Born and GTH's counsel, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, LLP. GTH responded on 27 January 2019, and Mr. Born provided a statement on 28 January 2019. On 30 January 2019, Canada stated that it appreciated the clarifications and had taken note of Mr. Born's statement that no present or past relation with Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, LLP affects his independence or impartiality in this arbitration.\n\n171.\n\nBy letter of 27 January 2019, GTH sought leave to (a) include in the evidentiary record documents produced pursuant to PO6, and (b) adduce new evidence of un-waived privilege for certain categories of documents. The Tribunal responded on 30 January 2019. It granted GTH's first request, noting that Canada would be permitted to submit any responsive evidence within seven days after GTH filed the new documents. Regarding GTH's second request, the Tribunal invited Canada to comment.\n\n172.\n\nOn 3 February 2019, Canada submitted its Rejoinder on Merits and Damages and Reply on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, including exhibits R-359 to R-598, legal authorities RL-262 to RL-329, the Second Expert Report of The Brattle Group, the Second Legal Expert Report of Prof. Dr. Mohamed S. Abdel Wahab, and the Rejoinder Witness Statements of Jenifer Aitken, Peter Hill and Iain Stewart (\"**Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply**\").\n\n173.\n\nBy letter of 12 February 2019, Canada informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable to reach agreement on the remaining issues of legal privilege. Canada requested \"that the Tribunal apply Article 3.8 of the IBA Rules and organise the tendering by GTH of certain non-disclosed and redacted documents to a Tribunal-appointed neutral expert.\"\n\n174.\n\nUpon the invitation of the Tribunal, GTH responded to Canada's letter on 15 February 2019. GTH opposed Canada's request for an expert review of the disputed documents and suggested that the Tribunal itself conduct a review to resolve the Parties' outstanding dispute over the two categories of documents addressed in GTH's letter of 27 January 2019 and certain other redacted documents.\n\n175.\n\nCanada responded to GTH's proposal by letter of 18 February 2019. Canada stated that it was \"willing to proceed with the Tribunal reviewing certain documents rather than appointing an independent expert to do so.\"\n\n176.\n\nBy letter of 19 February 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, in light of the Parties' agreement, the Tribunal would conduct the review of documents. The Tribunal instructed the Parties to consult regarding the precise scope of the Tribunal's review and offered guidance in this regard. The Tribunal also instructed GTH to submit a hyperlinked schedule of the disputed documents to the Tribunal no later than 25 February 2019.\n\n177.\n\nOn 25 February 2019, GTH informed the Tribunal that, despite the Parties' continued discussions regarding GTH's privilege claims, there remained more than 160 documents in dispute. GTH shared its view that \"it would be neither procedurally fair nor proper for the Tribunal to review all of these documents.\" Therefore, GTH stated that \"the only timely and procedurally fair way forward is to accept Respondent's suggestion that an independent third party be appointed to review all of the disputed privileged documents.\"\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal responded to the Parties on the same day. It noted that, considering Canada's letter of 12 February 2019 and GTH's letter of 25 February 2019, the Tribunal understood there to be a joint application by the Parties to appoint an independent expert to review the disputed documents. The Tribunal granted the application and confirmed that it had identified a list of potential candidates and instructed ICSID to contact them to inquire about their availability and independence. The Parties were instructed to consult and attempt to agree on detailed Terms of Reference and a list of documents to be provided to the expert.\n\n179.\n\nThe Parties submitted their joint proposed Terms of Reference on 28 February 2019. After reviewing the Parties' proposal and making certain additions, the Tribunal provided the revised Terms of Reference to the Parties for their consideration. Both Parties subsequently confirmed their agreement with the revised Terms of Reference.\n\n180.\n\nOn 1 March 2019, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing teleconference with the Parties to discuss the organization of the upcoming hearing. Following the teleconference, the President deliberated with his co-arbitrators regarding the outstanding issues.\n\n181.\n\nOn 2 March 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to appoint Dr. Patricia Shaughnessy to serve as the independent expert, and that Dr. Shaughnessy had confirmed her availability and independence. The Parties were given until the following day to raise any objection to the appointment.\n\n182.\n\nAs neither Party raised any objection, on 3 March 2019, the Tribunal confirmed the appointment of Dr. Shaughnessy as the independent expert, and she signed the Terms of Reference.\n\n183.\n\nOn 4 March 2019, GTH provided Dr. Shaughnessy with a hyperlinked schedule of the disputed documents. Dr. Shaughnessy conducted her review and, on 12 March 2019, submitted her assessment to the Tribunal.\n\n184.\n\nOn 14 March 2019, the Tribunal issued two orders: Procedural Order No. 7 (\"**PO7**\") containing the Parties agreements and the Tribunal's decisions relating to the organization of the hearing; and Procedural Order No. 8, including Annex A (\"**PO8**\"), by which it adopted Dr. Shaughnessy's assessment of the privilege issues.\n\n185.\n\nOn 5 March 2019, GTH filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, including exhibits C-448 to C-455, legal authorities CL-193 to CL-213, the Second Expert Report of Dr. Hani Sarie-Eldin and the Second Witness Statement of Mr. David L. C. Dobbie (\"**Jur. Rejoinder**\").\n\n186.\n\nOn 18 March 2019, GTH wrote to the Tribunal, challenging the completeness of Canada's document production pursuant to PO3 and requesting certain relief from the Tribunal.\n\n187.\n\nIn response, the President of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to encourage them to confer together with an aim to reaching a consensus on the matters outlined in GTH's letter. In the event the Parties were unable to agree, the President invited Canada to provide a response. By letter of 23 March 2019, Canada informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable to resolve their disagreement and set out its response to GTH's letter of 18 March 2019.\n\n188.\n\nOn 25 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, including Annex A (\"**PO9**\") containing its decision on GTH's request of 18 March 2019.\n\n189.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction, merits and quantum took place at the Word Bank Office in Paris from 1 to 12 April 2019 (the \"**Hearing**\").

Canada requested leave to respond, which the Tribunal granted. On 29 April 2019, Canada submitted its response. The Tribunal then invited GTH to indicate whether it wished to reply, and in response, GTH stated that it did not consider it necessary to comment further at that time.\n\n191.\n\nOn 24 May 2019, each Party submitted its Post-Hearing Submission.\n\n192.\n\nOn 11 June 2019, each Party submitted its Submission on Costs.\n\n193.\n\nOn 21 November 2019, GTH submitted a letter to the Tribunal seeking leave to submit nine new documents into the record. GTH attached these nine documents as Appendices A to I to the Application.\n\n194.\n\nOn 24 November 2019, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Application and provided instructions to the Parties. The Tribunal noted that GTH had referenced being prejudiced by not being able to make arguments or to cross examine witnesses on the nine documents. In this regard, the Tribunal stated:\n\nThe Tribunal is concerned about allegations of impairment of a Party's right to fully state its case. Claimant is invited to specify by no later than 27 November 2019 whether the Application is limited to seeking leave to submitting the nine appendices A to I on the record or is also meant to include any further requests.\n\n195.\n\nIn its message, the Tribunal also invited Canada to respond to GTH's request.\n\n196.\n\nBy email of 26 November 2019, GTH replied to the Tribunal's query and confirmed that \"the Application is limited to seeking leave to submit Appendices A to I into the record as new Factual Exhibits and does not seek other relief.\"\n\n197.\n\nOn 4 December 2019, Canada submitted its response to the Application, together with Annex A and Appendices A to F.\n\n198.\n\nOn 8 December 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural No. 10, including Annex A (\"**PO10**\"), addressing GTH's request of 21 November 2019. The Tribunal decided to grant GTH's request with respect to each of the nine documents.\n\n199.\n\nIn the meantime, on 27 November 2019, the Parties jointly requested that the Tribunal provide guidance on certain confidentiality issues relating to the publication of the Tribunal's procedural orders.

CANADA'S REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nCanada submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this dispute, and it denies each of GTH's claims under the BIT.\n\n205.\n\nCanada requests that the Tribunal render an award:\n\na) Declaring that GTH is not an \"investor\" of the Arab Republic of Egypt within the meaning of Article I of the Canada-Egypt FIPA and that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over GTH's claims.202\n\nIn the alternative,\n\nb) Declaring that the adoption of the Transfer Framework did not breach Canada's obligations under Articles II(2)(a), II(2)(b), and IX(1) of the Canada-Egypt FIPA; and\n\nc) Declaring that the national security review of GTH's application to acquire voting control of GTH falls within the dispute settlement exception in Article II(4)(b) of the Canada-Egypt FIPA and that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over GTH's claims related to the national security review.\n\nIn the further alternative,\n\nd) Declaring not admissible pursuant to the reservation in Article IV(2)(d) and its annex, the claim that the national security review of GTH's application to acquire voting control of GTH breaches Article IV(1) of the Canada-Egypt FIPA; and\n\ne) Declaring that the national security review of GTH's application to acquire voting control of Wind Mobile did not breach Canada's obligations under Articles II(2)(a) and II(2)(b) of the Canada-Egypt FIPA; and\n\nf) Declaring that Canada's cumulative treatment of GTH's investment did not breach Canada's obligations under Articles II(2)(a) and II(2)(b) of the Canada-Egypt FIPA.\n\nAnd in all cases,\n\ng) Dismiss GTH's claim for damages and ordering that GTH bear the costs of the arbitration, including Canada's costs for legal representation and assistance.\n\nRespondent's Letter of 16 April 2019; *see* Merits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 598; Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 414; Respondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 91.\n\n**VI. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n--------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nCanada's position is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over GTH's claims because: (a) GTH does not qualify as an \"investor\" under Article I(g) of the BIT; (b) Article II(4)(b) of the BIT deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over GTH's claims concerning the Transfer Framework; (c) the claims are time-barred under Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT; and (d) Article IV(2)(d) excludes GTH's national treatment claims from dispute resolution under the BIT. Canada objects to the admissibility of GTH's claims relating to the treatment of Wind Mobile on the basis that GTH lacks standing to bring these claims.\n\n207.\n\nThe following table reflects Canada's view of how its objections affect GTH's claims.203\n\n**ANNEX - IMPLICATIONS OF JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY OBJECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE CLAIMS IN CLAIMANT\u2019S MEMORIAL**\n\n**In the table** below \"X\" indicates the Tribunal\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over a claim of breach of the FIPA or the Claimant\u2019s lack of standing as a result of Canada\u2019s jurisdictional and admissibility objections.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Challenged Measures****(\u00b6\u00b6 24 and 301 of the Claimant\u2019s****Memorial)** | **Obligations Allegedly Breached\\*** | **Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Personae*** **under Article XIII and Article 25 of the ICISD Convention** | **Article II(4)(b) Dispute Settlement Exclusion of Decisions Not to Permit Establishment or Acquisition of Enterprises** | **Jurisdiction** ***Ratione****Temporis*** **under****Article XIII(3)** | **Article IV and its Annex Exclusion of the Application of National Treatment Obligations to Services** | **Standing to Claim for Damages Arising from Treatment of Wind Mobile** |\n| Blocking GTH\u2019s right to transfer Wind Mobile\u2019s set-aside spectrum licenses to an incumbent at the expiration of the Five-Year Rollout Period | Self-standing breach of: FET.

Memorial, Annex, p. A-1.\n\n208.\n\nIn response, GTH asserts that Canada's objections must be dismissed because the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all of GTH's claims, and the claims relating to the treatment of Wind Mobile are admissible.\n\n209.\n\nBelow, the Tribunal addresses the applicable legal standard and each of Canada's five objections. The Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction and admissibility is contained in Section VI.G.\n\n**A. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(1) Canada's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n210.\n\nCanada submits that the burden of establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction over GTH's claims lies with GTH.204 As stated by the tribunal in *Tulip v. Turkey*, \"it is for Claimant to satisfy the burden of proof required at the jurisdictional phase,\" and this burden remains with the claimant even when a jurisdictional objection is raised by a respondent.205 In this regard, Canada cites *National Gas v. Egypt*, in which the tribunal reasoned as follows:\n\nAlthough it is the Respondent which has here raised specific jurisdictional objections, it is not for the Respondent to disprove the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Under international law, as a matter of legal logic and the application of the principle traditionally expressed by the Latin maxim \"*actori incumbit probatio*\", it is for the Claimant to discharge the burden of proving all essential facts required to establish jurisdiction for its claims.206\n\nJur.

The Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL) Award on Jurisdiction, 10 February 2012, \u00b6 280 (\"The burden of proof for the issue of consent falls squarely on a given claimant who invokes it against a given respondent. Where a claimant fails to prove consent with sufficient certainty, jurisdiction will be declined\").\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 23, *citing* **RL-042**, *National Gas S.A.E. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/7, Award, 3 April 2014, \u00b6 118.\n\n211.\n\nThus, according to Canada, only when a claimant has proven the facts necessary to establish jurisdiction does \"the burden shift[] to the respondent to show why, despite the facts proved by the claimant, the tribunal does not have jurisdiction.\"207\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 24.\n\n212.\n\nFurther, in Canada's view, a State's consent to jurisdiction must be \"clearly and unambiguously ascertained\"; if there is any ambiguity, a tribunal should decline jurisdiction.208\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, citing **RL-040**, I *CS Inspection and Control Services Limited (U.K.) v.

France)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports, 4 June 2008, \u00b6 62.\n\n213.\n\nCanada contends that, in this case, its consent to arbitration contained in Article XIII of the BIT is conditioned on a potential claimant satisfying certain requirements and procedures.209 According to Canada, these conditions are fundamental bases of its consent. Canada highlights Article XIII(5) of the BIT, which states that \"[e]ach Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\"210\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 27.\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 27, *quoting* **CL-001**, BIT (English Version), Article XIII(5) (Respondent's emphasis).\n\n214.\n\nFor Canada, it follows that GTH must prove that it has fulfilled all the requirements of Article XIII of the BIT in order to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction.211\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 28.\n\n**(2) GTH's Position**\n----------------------\n\n215.\n\nIn its submissions on the legal standard applicable to Canada's preliminary objections, GTH does not challenge Canada's position regarding the burden of proof.212 GTH focuses instead on the applicable rules of treaty interpretation, arguing that Canada's objections rest on a flawed interpretation of the BIT.213\n\nGTH does not accept Canada's assertion that a State's consent to arbitration must be \"unambiguously ascertained.\"\n\nReply on Merits and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 III.A.\n\n216.\n\nGTH submits that the Tribunal must interpret the BIT's jurisdictional requirements in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**VCLT**\"), which provides the principles of customary law applicable to treaty interpretation.214\n\nReply on Merits and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 96.\n\n217.\n\nAccording to GTH, Canada's interpretation of the BIT is inconsistent with these rules in the following ways:\n\na. Canada fails to interpret the ordinary meaning of certain terms in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT. In particular, Canada's interpretation \"undermines the BIT's purpose to promote the free flow of investments between the Parties.\"215\n\nb. Canada ignores the express terms of the BIT and instead improperly relies on supplementary means of interpretation, such as Canada's other treaties. This approach is contrary to Article 32 of the VCLT.216\n\nc. Canada does not attempt to find the meaning of terms that best reconciles the multiple authentic texts of the BIT (the English, French and Arabic versions) and instead relies on interpretations that cannot be supported by all three versions.217\n\nd. There are no special rules of interpretation for treaty provisions dealing with a State's consent to arbitration. Yet, in an attempt to heighten the standard of proof, Canada mischaracterizes the law and asserts that State's consent to a tribunal's jurisdiction must be \"unambiguously ascertained.\"218\n\nReply on Merits and Jur.

Memorial, \u00b6 26.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no disputed issue that it needs to decide on this matter at this stage. The Tribunal need not decide on issues such as the burden of proof and treaty interpretation in the abstract and will instead consider such matters when relevant in relation to each jurisdictional objection in the sections below.\n\n**B. WHETHER GTH IS A QUALIFYING INVESTOR UNDER ARTICLE I(G****) OF THE BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nCanada's first objection is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* over all GTH's claims because GTH does not qualify as an \"investor\" under Article I(g) of the BIT.\n\n220.\n\nGTH argues that Canada's objection is based on a misreading of the BIT and must be dismissed.\n\n**(1) Relevant Provision of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nArticle I(g) of the BIT defines \"investor\" as follows:\n\n(g) \"investor\" means [\u2026] in the case of the Arab Republic of Egypt:\n\nany natural or juridical person, including the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt who invests in the territory of Canada.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nthe term \"juridical person\" means any entity established in accordance with, and recognized as a juridical person by the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt: such as public institutions, corporations, foundations, private companies, firms, establishments and organizations, and having permanent residence in the territory of the Arab Republic of Egypt.219\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English Version), Article I(g).\n\n222.\n\nThe Parties have also referred to the Arabic and French versions of this provision, which together with the English are all equally authentic texts.\n\n223.\n\nThe definition of \"*investisseur*\" found in Article I(f) of the French BIT reads as follows:\n\n\u00ab investisseur d\u00e9signe \u00bb [\u2026] Dans le cas de la R\u00e9publique arabe d'\u00c9gypte : toute personne physique ou morale, y compris le gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique arabe d'\u00c9gypte, qui fait un investissement sur le territoire canadien :\n\n[\u2026]\n\npar le terme \u00ab personne morale \u00bb, il faut entendre toute entit\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e en conformit\u00e9 avec les lois de la R\u00e9publique arabe d'\u00c9gypte et reconnue comme personne morale par ces lois: dont les institutions publiques, les personnes morales proprement dites (ou corporations) les fondations, les compagnies priv\u00e9es, les firmes, les \u00e9tablissements et les associations, ayant le droit de r\u00e9sidence permanente sur le territoire de la R\u00e9publique arabe d'\u00c9gypte.220\n\n**CL-002**, BIT (French Version), Article I(f).\n\n224.\n\nThe Arabic version of Article I(g) reads as follows:\n\n[...] :\u00a0\u0632) \"\u0627\ufedf\ufee4\ufeb4\ufe98\ufe9c\ufee4\ufeae\" \ufbfe\ufecc\ufee8\ufef2)\n\n**:\ufed3\ufef2 \ufea3\ufe8e\ufedf\ufe94 \ufe9f\ufee4\ufbad\ufeee\u0631\ufbfe\ufe94 \ufee3\ufebc\ufeae \u0627\ufedf\ufecc\ufeae\ufe91\ufbff\ufe94**\n\n:\u0623\u064a \ufeb7\ufea8\ufeba \u0637\ufe92\ufbff\ufecc\ufef2 \u0623\u0648 \u0625\ufecb\ufe98\ufe92\ufe8e\u0631\u064a \ufe91\ufee4\ufe8e \ufed3\ufef2 \u0630\ufedf\ufeda \ufea3\ufedc\ufeee\ufee3\ufe94 \ufe9f\ufee4\ufbad\ufeee\u0631\ufbfe\ufe94 \ufee3\ufebc\ufeae \u0627\ufedf\ufecc\ufeae\ufe91\ufbff\ufe94 \ufbfe\ufeb4\ufe98\ufe9c\ufee4\ufeae \ufed3\ufef2 \u0625\ufed7\ufee0\ufbff\ufee2 \ufedb\ufee8\ufeaa\u0627\n\n[...]\n\n\u06f2 - \u0648 \ufbfe\ufecc\ufee8\ufef2 \"\ufeb7\ufea8\ufeba \u0625\ufecb\ufe98\ufe92\ufe8e\u0631\u064a\" \u0623\u064a \ufee3\ufee8\ufeb8\ufe84\u0629 \ufe97\ufedc\ufeee\ufee7\ufe96 \u0623\u0648 \u0623\ufee7\ufeb8\ufe8c\ufe96 \u0648\ufed3\ufed8\ufe8e\u064b \ufedf\ufed8\ufeee\u0627\ufee7\ufbff\ufee6 \ufe9f\ufee4\ufbad\ufeee\u0631\ufbfe\ufe94 \ufee3\ufebc\ufeae \u0627\ufedf\ufecc\ufeae\ufe91\ufbff\ufe94 \ufee3\ufe9c\ufede \u0627\u0627\ufedf\ufee4\ufee8\ufeb8\ufe82\u062a \u0627\ufedf\ufecc\ufe8e\ufee3\ufe94 \u0648 \u0627\ufedf\ufeb8\ufeae\ufedb\ufe8e\u062a \u0627\ufedf\ufecc\ufe8e\ufee3\ufe94 \u0648 \u0627\ufedf\ufea8\ufe8e\ufebb\ufe94 \u0648 \u0627\ufedf\ufee4\ufe86\ufeb3\ufeb4\ufe8e\u062a \u0648 \u0627\ufedf\ufee4\ufee8\ufec8\ufee4\ufe8e\u062a \u0648 \u0627\ufedf\ufe98\ufef2 \ufedf\ufbad\ufe8e \u0625\ufed7\ufe8e\ufee3\ufe94 \u062f\u0627\ufe8b\ufee4\ufe94 \ufed3\ufef2 \u0625\ufed7\ufee0\ufbff\ufee2 \ufe9f\ufee4\ufbad\ufeee\u0631\ufbfe\ufe94 \ufee3\ufebc\ufeae \u0627\ufedf\ufecc\ufeae\ufe91\ufbff\ufe94.221\n\n**CL-003**, BIT (Arabic Version), Article I(g).\n\n**(2) Canada's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n225.\n\nCanada submits that GTH has failed to prove that it (a) was established in accordance with, and recognized as juridical person by the laws of Egypt and (b) had its \"permanent residence\" in Egypt at the time it filed the Request for Arbitration.222 Thus, GTH is neither an \"investor\" under the BIT nor a \"National of another Contracting State\" within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* over GTH's claims.223\n\nJur.

Establishing the Tribunal's Jurisdiction *Ratione Personae* Under the ICSID Convention and the BIT\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nAccording to Canada, GTH must prove that it was an \"investor\" under Article I(g) of the BIT at the time it filed the Request for Arbitration on 28 May 2016 in order to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.224\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 33-38, *citing* **RL-045**, Zachary Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009) [Excerpt], p. 284 (\"The tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* extends\u2026 to an individual or legal entity\u2026 which has the nationality of another of the contracting state parties in accordance with the relevant provision in the investment treaty and the municipal law of that contracting state party and, where applicable, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\").\n\n227.\n\nCanada highlights that its consent to arbitrate under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention extends only to \"a national of another Contracting State,\" within the meaning of Article 25(2).225 Canada asserts that Article 25(2)(b), which applies to juridical persons, \"does not impose any particular test\" for determining the nationality of a juridical person and instead \"leaves broad discretion to the Contracting States to define \u2026 corporate nationality, under the relevant BIT.\"226 Thus, in Canada's view, the definition of \"national of another Contracting State\" is determined by the nationality requirements contained in the applicable treaty. In the present case, those nationality requirements are set forth in Article I(g) of the BIT.\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 34.\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 35, *quoting* **RL-046**, Christoph Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2d ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009) [Excerpt], p. 263.\n\n228.\n\nSimilarly, Canada asserts that its consent to arbitrate under Article XIII(1) of the BIT extends only to a dispute with \"an investor of the other Contracting Party.\"227\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 37, *quoting* **CL-001**, BIT (English Version), Article XIII(1) (\"Any dispute between one Contracting Party and *an investor of the other Contracting Party*, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall, to the extent possible, be settled amicably between them.\" (*Canada's emphasis*)). *See also* Article XIII(2) (\"If a dispute has not been settled amicably through consultations within a period of six months from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted by *the investor* to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4).\" (*Canada's emphasis*)).\n\n229.\n\nTherefore, Canada concludes, if GTH cannot prove that it qualified as an \"investor\" under Article I(g) of the BIT \"at the time of the alleged breaches, and that it continued to qualify as such until the time that it commenced arbitral proceedings,\" the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae*.228\n\nJur.

Interpretation of Article I(g) of the BIT\n--------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nCanada's position is that under Article I(g) of the BIT, GTH must show that it had permanent residence in Egypt on the date it submitted the Request for Arbitration.229 Canada advances a number of arguments to support this interpretation.\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 40-62; Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 41 *et seq.*\n\n231.\n\n*First*, in Canada's view, the ordinary meaning of Article I(g) is that an entity must fulfil two requirements to qualify as a \"juridical person\" in Egypt: the first requirement is to be \"established in accordance with, and recognized as a juridical person by the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt,\" and the second is \"having permanent residence in the territory of the Arab Republic of Egypt.\"230 Canada notes that these requirements are linked by the word \"and,\" which indicates that the second requirement is separate from, and additional to, the first requirement.231\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 43, *quoting* **CL-001**, BIT (\"English Version\"). In the Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, Canada refers to \"the *triple* requirements of being established in accordance with, and recognized as a juridical person by the laws of Egypt and having permanent residence in Egypt\" (emphasis added), but this does not appear to change the basis of Canada's argument.

According to Canada:\n\nEgyptian law does not recognize a concept of permanent residence for either natural or juridical persons, meaning there is no *right* of permanent residence for legal entities under Egyptian Law. In order for these terms to be given meaning, and be read consistently with the English and Arabic texts, the reference to having a *right* of permanent residence in the French text must be understood as requiring that the entity actually *have* permanent residence in Egypt.247\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00b6 62. Canada submits that \"both experts on Egyptian law agree that the concept of 'permanent residence' is not recognized in Egyptian law.

Egypt's model BIT provides a definition for an Egyptian \"juridical person\" that replaces the commas separating each element of the list in Article I(g) of the BIT with semi-colons. In GTH's view, this makes it even clearer that Egypt intended \"having permanent residence\" to serve as another example of a qualifying entity, rather than a separate requirement.

Canada's interpretation is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of \"permanent residence.\"338\n\nb. Canada's interpretation would require multinational companies to have a single permanent residence, which is illogical in light of the reality of corporate personality.339\n\nc. Tribunals have recognized that even natural persons may have more than one permanent residence.340\n\nd. Canada attempts to impose something like a dominant nationality test, which is not recognized as a general principle of international law.341 Canada's own authorities confirm that tribunals will not apply such a restrictive test without express treaty language.342\n\ne. Canada draws its interpretation from two cases that address the question of whether a *natural* person could advance a claim against the State of their nationality, which is irrelevant in the present case.343 In any event, these decisions do not help Canada. In *Binder v. Czech Republic*, the tribunal's decision was based on the parties' agreement that the claimant could be an investor of only one of the State parties to the relevant treaty, and the tribunal refused to exclude \"the possibility of two permanent residences.\"344 In *Uzan v.

In this arbitration, only the latter is relevant. Within the definition provided in Article I(g) for an Egyptian investor, separate meanings are ascribed to an investor who is a natural person and to an investor which is a juridical person. Given the undisputed status of GTH as a corporation,376 only the definition of juridical person in Article I(g) of the BIT is relevant to determine whether GTH is a protected investor.\n\n*See* **HSE-005**, GTH's Commercial Register (2018); **HSE-006**, GTH's Commercial Register (2016).\n\n283.\n\nAs indicated in the BIT, the treaty has been authenticated in three languages: Arabic, English and French, \"all versions being equally authentic.\"377 In relevant parts, Article I(g) provides:\n\n\"investor\" means : [\u2026]\n\nIn the case of the Arab Republic of Egypt: [\u2026]\n\nany natural or juridical person any natural or juridical person, including the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt who invests in the territory of Canada.

For example, the Arabic version omits the reference to \"and recognised as a juridical person by,\" which is found both in the English and in the French versions.381 Punctuation marks are also inconsistently inserted in the relevant subparagraphs across the three linguistic versions. That said, none of those differences casts doubt on the requirement in the BIT that an Egyptian investor that is a juridical person must be established in accordance with the laws of Egypt *and* must have permanent residence in the territory of Egypt.\n\nAt the Hearing, in reply to the President of the Tribunal's question, Canada conceded that the omission is not relevant to its jurisdictional case. Day 2, Tr. 123:8-10.\n\n286.\n\nThe foregoing two conditions of establishment *and* of permanent residence are cumulative. GTH's attempt to question the application of a requirement of permanent residence to a juridical person based on its reading of the punctuation marks in Article I(g)(ii) of the BIT goes counter to the explicit terms of that provision. Indeed, GTH's submission that, because of the positioning of the colon and of the comma in subparagraph (ii), the requirement of permanent residence only applies to the specific categories listed after the colon but not generically to \"any entity established\" goes counter to the ordinary meaning of the conjunction \"and\" appearing in the English and in the Arabic version, and to the acceptable usage of the comma in the French version. Taken together, those conjunction and punctuation mark, when read in light of Article 33(4) of the VCLT, denote the intention of the drafters of the BIT to close the illustrative list of non-exhaustive categories of juridical persons investors of Egypt (such as public institutions \u2026 and organisations) and return to a general requirement of \"permanent residence\" that is applicable to all juridical persons regardless of the category.\n\n287.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties have made submissions on the point that the French version of the BIT refers to \"*ayant le droit de r\u00e9sidence permanente*,\" which translates in English as \"having the right to permanent residence\" in Egypt. On its face, that reference appears to set a different standard from the equally authentic English and Arabic versions which require the investor to \"have permanent residence.\"382 Neither Party nor their experts has suggested that the French version sets a different standard that must prevail over the other versions of the BIT. In any event, the Tribunal considers that it has been plainly evidenced in fact that GTH had been established \u2013 not only had the right to become established \u2013 in accordance with the laws of Egypt and remained so on the date of the Request for Arbitration,383*and* that it is recognised as a juridical person by the laws of Egypt and remained so on the date of the Request for Arbitration.384 The following brief exchange at the hearing between the Tribunal and Canada's Egyptian law expert helpfully confirms those facts:\n\nMR BORN: Can I interject, just so that I'm sure I understand your testimony. I think you agreed with Ms Madden that GTH is incorporated in Egypt and remains recognised under Egyptian law as a joint stock company?\n\nA. Indeed, Professor.385\n\nMerits Rejoider and Jur.

(Professor Abdel Wahab) Yes, because if it is fictitious in a way, not reflective of reality, the company risks nullity. That is the issue. MR BORN: But when you say \"risks nullity\", do you mean that non-compliance with that requirement is an automatic nullity, or that something has to be done by legal process? A. (Professor Abdel Wahab) No, it has to be done by way of legal process. MR BORN: And until that legal process is completed, the company is still a company? A. (Professor Abdel Wahab) Yes, indeed.\"\n\nDay 6, Tr. 83 :7-10.\n\n288.\n\nThis is further corroborated by GTH's Egyptian law expert's unqualified evidence at the hearing:\n\nThe second issue: is GTH established and recognised under Egyptian law? And again, my conclusion is: yes, it is. Definitely and without any doubt, it has been incorporated in compliance with Egyptian law and continued to be in compliance with Egyptian law, and continues to be an Egyptian company. Because the only requirement to be an Egyptian national as a company is to be incorporated under Egyptian law, and this is where you get your nationality as an Egyptian company.386\n\nDay 6, Tr. 154 :12-20.\n\n289.\n\nCanada's submission that GTH \"is not an entity established in accordance with the laws of Egypt\"387 because GTH allegedly does not have a principal place of management in Egypt is rebutted by the production by GTH of a contemporaneous extract from the Commercial Register, approved by the Egyptian government, certifying that GTH has its headquarters in Egypt.388\n\nDay 9, Tr. 146:8-10.\n\n**HSE-005**, GTH's Commercial Register (2018); **HSE-006**, GTH's Commercial Register (2016).\n\n290.\n\nThat first requirement for a qualifying investor under Article I(g)(ii) being established, the Tribunal is therefore left with the task of determining whether GTH had permanent residence in the territory of Egypt on the relevant date. The term \"permanent residence\" is not defined in the BIT. Likewise, both Egyptian law experts instructed by the Parties agree that the term is not defined either in Egyptian law.389 The Parties agreed in their pleadings,390 and reiterated at the hearing, that it is an autonomous treaty concept:\n\n[MS TABET:] Now, how to interpret the concept of \"permanent residence\": the best way, by interpreting the treaty, if we accept that it's an autonomous standard, not one that refers to Egyptian law, is to adopt an ordinary meaning definition of \"permanent residence\".\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So you accept that \"permanent residence\", in the definition of Egyptian investor, is an autonomous concept of the treaty, and that the Tribunal does not have to look at Egyptian law for interpreting it?\n\nMS TABET: I think that is our position, and we have made alternative submissions as well. THE PRESIDENT: Right. Could Claimant remind me if on that point that concords with your submission? Do you accept that the Tribunal has to look only at the treaty to interpret \"permanent residence\" in the definition of Egyptian investor?\n\nMS MADDEN: Yes, this is a public international law question.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. So the Tribunal does not have to look at the course of conduct, or precedent in Egyptian diplomacy in concluding similar treaties; we'll just concentrate on that particular treaty?\n\nMS MADDEN: I think that's right, yes, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Canada confirms?\n\nMS TABET: Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, that's helpful.391\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur.

General rule of interpretation\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n*Article 32*. Supplementary means of interpretation\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n*Article 33*. Interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages\n\n1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.\n\n2. A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the parties so agree.\n\n3. The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.\n\n4. Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.392\n\n**CL-018**, VCLT*,* Articles 31-33.\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no support in the BIT for Canada's contention that \"permanent residence,\" as used in the BIT, requires strong and enduring ties \"that must be stronger than the entity's ties to any other jurisdiction at the time when the permanence of residence is assessed.\"393 For an international corporation engaged in business in numerous markets to be required to have a single permanent residence would be an extraordinary limitation and a departure from customary and legitimate means of doing business that ought only be considered where the BIT itself or, absent that and in accordance with the VCLT, its preparatory work or the circumstances of its conclusion warrant such a construction. No such evidence is adduced by Canada. The Tribunal considers that a juridical person can have more than one permanent residence absent an overriding mandatory limitation in the applicable laws.\n\nJur.

Reply, \u00b6 75.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Canada that the Contracting Parties agreed to promote foreign investments only according to the terms of the BIT and its scope provisions.394 However, where those terms are provided without limitation as is the case in Article I(g)(ii) for \"permanent residence,\" the Tribunal cannot imply arbitrary limitations for that would unbalance the BIT's substantive provisions.395 As GTH rightly points out,396 Canada's reliance on *Binder v. Czech Republic* overlooks the essential linchpin on which that award rests *expressis verbis* : \"the Parties agree that the BIT envisages a permanent residence in one State only.\"397 There is no evidence of any such agreement between the Parties in these proceedings as concerns the Egypt-Canada BIT.\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur.

Reply, \u00b6 78.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal also considered Canada's Egyptian law expert's opinion that, under Egyptian law referred to in Article I(g)(ii), \"permanent residence\" means the principal place of management. To that end, the expert testified as follows:\n\nSo if a company that is presumably an Egyptian joint stock company just maintains an office, this is not demonstrative of domicile or permanent residence, as indicative also of the company being a foreign company, because an Egyptian company would have its principal place of management in Egypt.398\n\nDay 6, Tr. 14:7-12.\n\n295.\n\nDomestic procedural matters such as the address where a company may be validly served with legal documents and other corporate issues governed by the Egyptian Companies Act399 are of little assistance to this Tribunal for the purpose of determining its jurisdiction over an investor pursuant to the identification of its permanent residence, an autonomous treaty concept.400 The Tribunal considers that any contention implying a notion of exclusiveness in the identification of the permanent residence of a company faces the difficulty that, in all three linguistic versions of Article I(g)(ii), \"permanent residence\" is ascribed no qualifications, and requires no minimum bar or specific material manifestations. A registered office, as evidenced in the contemporaneous Commercial Register extract adduced in evidence, suffices to show \"permanent residence\".401 While Canada questioned at the hearing the accuracy of the information contained on the Commercial Register,402 it has not provided any satisfactory evidence of that contention. Canada also accepts that the determination of the relevant place is a factual determination.403 The officially-certified, signed and stamped extract of the Commercial Register,404 an Egyptian government-issued document, referring to the headquarters of GTH at the relevant time as being located in Egypt, is accepted by the Tribunal as sufficient evidence of the company's establishment in accordance with, and of its recognition as a juridical person by, the laws of Egypt.\n\nDay 6, Tr. 15:1-5; **R-628**, The Egyptian Companies Law No. 159 of 1981 [Supplementary unofficial translation of Articles 54, 60, 63, 68, 77, 82] 1981; **R-629**, The Egyptian Civil and Commercial Procedures Code issued by Law No. 13, of 1968 [Unofficial Translation of Articles 13(3) and 19], 968; **MSW-034**, Companies' Law as Amended by Law No. 4 of 2018, 16 January 2018 (showing an amendment to article 1 of Act No. 159/198, which appears to relate primarily to the matter of proper service of judicial acts upon the company).\n\n*See* \u00b6 290 above.\n\nTo that end, see the evidence of GTH's Egyptian law expert, **HSE-005**, GTH's Commercial Register (2018); **HSE-006**, GTH's Commercial Register (2016); Day 6, Tr. 153:21-154:1.\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur.

Canada in effect takes the position that GTH is required to maintain a one and only \"principal place of management\" in Egypt at the relevant time. As already noted, there is no requirement of exclusiveness in the BIT. [REDACTED]\n\n298.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n299.\n\nAs to submissions attempting to infer support from the concept of natural persons' domicile under any of the Contracting Parties' domestic laws, they are simply irrelevant in the case of corporate investors, because the BIT explicitly differentiates in Article I(g) between their [REDACTED] definition in subparagraph (ii) and that of individual investors in subparagraph (i).\n\n300.\n\n[REDACTED] As such, GTH meets the requirements for an \"investor\" as defined in the BIT.\n\n**C. WHETHER ARTICLE II(4)(B****) OF THE BIT DEPRIVES THE TRIBUNAL OF JURISDICTION OVER GTH'S CLAIMS RELATING TO THE VOTING CONTROL APPLICATION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nCanada's second objection is aimed at GTH's claim concerning the national security review conducted in the context of GTH's attempt to acquire voting control of Wind Mobile. According to Canada, this claim is excluded from the dispute resolution provision of the BIT pursuant to Article II(4)(b) of the BIT, and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction over the claim.\n\n302.\n\nGTH argues that Canada's objection must be dismissed because GTH's claim does not relate to an \"acquisition\" within the meaning of Article II(4) of the BIT.412 Rather, it relates to the exercise of rights already acquired at the time it made its investment, before the national security review. Alternatively, GTH asserts that its claim concerns the process leading up to [REDACTED] not the decision itself and is therefore permitted under Article II(4)(a) of the BIT.413\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

Canada argues that this is by design; it \"has always sought in all of its trade and investment agreements a broad exclusion for its ICA review process and the result of such review.\"419 Canada highlights that the language of Part IV.1 of the ICA, which governs the scope of the national security review, mirrors the language in Article II(4)(b) of the BIT. It applies to an investment, implemented or proposed, by a non-Canadian:\n\n(a) to **establish** a new Canadian business;\n\n(b) to **acquire** control of a Canadian business in any manner described in subsection 28(1); or\n\n(c) to **acquire**, in whole or in part, or to establish an entity carrying on all or any part of its operations in Canada \u2026420\n\nJur.

Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 174.\n\n**(4) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nThe decisions in this section of the Award are taken by a majority of the Tribunal.\n\n325.\n\nIn support of its second jurisdictional challenge based on Article II(4)(b) of the BIT, Canada advances both its construction of the relevant BIT provision and policy reasons to show that its [REDACTED] is excluded from the arbitration mechanism set out in Article XIII of the BIT.459 The Tribunal, by a majority, finds neither of those two grounds to be convincing.\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 96 *et seq*.\n\n326.\n\nFirst, Canada's reference to its treaty practice allegedly systematically excluding from international treaty dispute settlement mechanisms ICA-related decisions in respect of the establishment or acquisition of a business enterprise is insufficient to deny the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the BIT. The Tribunal must determine the scope of its jurisdiction with reference to the terms of the BIT, as interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT. Consistent with its alleged practice, Canada could have specifically referred to its foreign ownership and control legislation in Article II(4)(b) of the BIT; it has not done so, although the ICA had been enacted in 1985 and, as such, predated the BIT.\n\n327.\n\nThe additional argument that Canada refrained from specifically naming the ICA in the BIT to afford symmetrical protection to both Contracting States is not persuasive either. The BIT features other protections afforded nominally to one or the other of the Contracting States and their respective nationals without any consistent symmetrical approach (e.g., Article I(g) and the Annex).\n\n328.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Canada's argument that, for the purpose of acquiring voting control of Wind Mobile, GTH's intended conversion of Class D non-voting shares of Wind Mobile into Class B voting shares involves an \"acquisition of shares\" within the meaning of Article II(4)(b) or, as Canada put it more synthetically at the hearing:\n\nThe share conversion is an acquisition of shares, and in this case it also amounts to an acquisition of Wind Mobile.460\n\nDay 2, Tr. 113:16-18. *See also* Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 100 (\"The share conversion process thus constitutes an acquisition of shares of an existing business enterprise because GTH would have obtained new voting shares of Wind Mobile that it did not previously own. The exclusion in Article II(4)(b) is not limited to certain types of share acquisitions. Conversion of shares is one of the ways of realizing an acquisition of shares, because the shareholder has to return the original certificates (i.e. ceases to own them), and in exchange receives new shares from the company. The fact that the term *conversion* is used does not negate the legal nature of the transaction taking place whereby one set of shares is cancelled in exchange for another set of shares with different attributes\").\n\n329.\n\nThe Amended and Restated Shareholders' Agreement461 to which Canada refers mentions in section 4 of Schedule C a conversion of Class D non-voting shares into Class B voting shares on the basis of one Class D share for each Class B share. The fact that the mechanism involves a return of Class D share certificates and the issue of Class B share certificates does not mean, absent evidence of an *animus novandi*, that new Class B shares are acquired*.* It is simply that the shareholder's rights over the shares are enhanced with the ability to vote. Had the conversion of Class D shares into Class B shares involved an obligation to \"acquire\" ownership of the Class B shares to achieve the conversion, GTH would in all logic have had to \"sell\" its Class D shares which, being nominative, would have had to be annulled. This would have triggered a reduction in Wind Mobile's corporate capital, even for a *scintilla temporis*, until capital is increased with the issue of the new Class B shares. A complex annulment/issue/acquisition of share process of that sort would be expected to be mentioned in a sophisticated document like the Amended and Restated Shareholders' Agreement. No such mention can be found therein. The fact is that the Agreement only refers to a conversion of shares, and does so consistently throughout. As GTH puts it: \"GTH sought to convert non-voting shares that it already owned by exercising a preexisting right, that GTH had already acquired, to assume voting control of its investment.\"462\n\n**C-018**, Amended and Restated Shareholders' Agreement between AAL Holdings Corporation and Mojo Investments Corp. and Orascom Telecom Holding (Canada) Limited and Globalive Investment Holdings Corp.

Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 156, 161.\n\n330.\n\nAs to Canada's argument that GTH has referred in some of its correspondence to \"acquisition,\" it is difficult to draw any firm inferences out of inconsistent references, the reason being that those references often are made to issues other than the conversion of the non-voting shares. Importantly, those references \u2013 if they were to be considered \u2013 ought to be read against the following statement [REDACTED]\n\n331.\n\nCanada ran a further case to the effect that:\n\nthe acquisition of voting shares would also have amounted to an acquisition of the enterprise resulting from an acquisition of legal control. Article II(4) applies to decisions not to permit the acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise.134 There is no basis on which to limit the exclusion to certain forms of acquisitions of an existing business enterprise. Acquisitions of existing business enterprises are often realized through acquisitions of control.464\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 100.\n\n332.\n\nCanada supports its contention by referring to subsection 28(1) of the ICA, which includes a reference to the acquisition of voting control.465 The difficulty for Canada is that the BIT refers to the \"acquisition of an existing business enterprise, or a share of an enterprise,\" but not to the acquisition of voting control. One cannot be held to be necessarily subsumed in the other. Absent a reference in the BIT to the acquisition of legal control, and in conformity with the general rule of interpretation in Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the majority of the Tribunal considers that the BIT refers in Article II(4)(b) to the acquisition of an enterprise or a share thereof in the sense of ownership as opposed to control.\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, n. 135, *citing* **C-009**, Investment Canada Act (12 March 2009 \u2013 28 June 2012).\n\n333.\n\nIt should be added that the object and purpose of the treaty \u2013 a general interpretation standard under Article 31(1) of the VCLT \u2013 commands that potentially choosing a broad interpretation of the terms of the treaty so as to read a reference to an \"acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise\" as including an acquisition of legal control should only be considered with caution. Broadening exclusions from the protections accorded in the BIT by a Contracting Party to nationals of the other Contracting Party, beyond their explicit terms, would hardly be conducive to the encouragement of the creation of favourable conditions for investors to make investments.\n\n334.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal, by a majority, decides that it cannot accept Canada's assertion that the challenged measures fall within the scope of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT as a decision not to permit the acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise. The objection on jurisdiction is therefore rejected.\n\n335.\n\nWith the above determination made, the Tribunal need not go into the additional argument that GTH adduces seeking to differentiate between \"a decision\" and \"the process of reaching that decision.\"466\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 169 *et seq*. Day 1, Tr. 167:10.\n\n336.\n\nOne Member of the Tribunal considers that the exception under Article II(4) of the BIT to the right of the investor to submit disputes to arbitration is applicable to the present dispute. This Member considers that the measure complained of here concerned the acquisition of voting control over Wind Mobile and thus constitutes an \"acquisition \u2026 of an existing business enterprise\" within the meaning of Article II(4), interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to those terms in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT. The focus in that Article in its English and French texts467 is on the acquisition of a \"business enterprise,\" i.e., an economic entity rather than a legal entity; and from the point of view of the Contracting Parties, for whose benefit the Article II(4) exception is established, the acquisition of control is at least as significant in the context of the control of foreign investment (with which the BIT is by its nature essentially concerned) as is the acquisition of rights of financial participation in a business without any correlative rights to control that business. Furthermore, this Member considers that the object and purpose of the treaty is not confined to the promotion and protection of investments, but must be understood to include both the fair treatment of investments and the preservation of certain regulatory competences for the State hosting the investment. The majority of the Tribunal has considered the minority's opinion, but decided that it does not change its interpretation of the provision.\n\nWhile the Arabic text may have a narrower meaning or connotation, confining the reference to a 'company' rather than an 'enterprise', this Member considers that the best reconciliation of the treaty texts, in accordance with the principle set out in Article 33(4) of the VCLT, points to a wider concept of a 'business enterprise'.\n\n**D. WHETHER ARTICLE IV(2)(D****) OF THE BIT DEPRIVES THE TRIBUNAL OF JURISDICTION OVER THE CLAIMANT'S NATIONAL TREATMENT CLAIMS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nCanada's next objection targets GTH's claim that Canada breached its national treatment obligations contained in the BIT. Canada submits that this claim is precluded by the reservation it made pursuant to Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT, and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the claim.468\n\nJur. Memorial, \u00a7 III.E.\n\n338.\n\nIn response, GTH argues that this objection must be dismissed because (a) Canada never exercised its right to make or maintain an exception under Article IV(2)(d), and (b) in any event, Canada did not reserve the right to maintain exceptions with respect to investments made in the telecommunications sector.\n\n**(1) Relevant Provisions of the BIT**\n--------------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nArticle IV(II)(d) of the BIT specifies that the Contracting Parties' national treatment obligations \"do not apply to: [\u2026] the right of each Contracting Party to make or maintain exceptions within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Agreement.\"469\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article V(1)(d).\n\n340.\n\nThe Annex states:\n\n1.

In particular, Canada points out that the BIT does not contain a notification requirement, unlike some other investment treaties.477 Thus, there is no basis for GTH's assertion that Canada must notify Egypt and its investors before exercising its right to make an exception.478\n\nJur.

Whether the Annex Includes Telecommunications\n------------------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nRegarding the scope of the exception, Canada's position is that the Annex of the BIT excludes all services, including telecommunications.494 Canada highlights that the first exclusion listed in the Annex is \"social services,\" which is followed by \"services in *any* other sector.\"495 Canada reads these together to mean that all service sectors, including social services, fall within the scope of the exception.496 Thus, Canada sees no basis for GTH's position that telecommunications are not covered by the Annex.\n\nJur.

It argues that nearly all its investment treaties from 1994 to the late 1990s contain provisions identical or similar to Article IV(2)(d) the Annex of the BIT, which contains a broad exception for all services from Canada's national treatment obligations.497 Canada opposes GTH's argument that Canada specifically identified telecommunications in other treaties when it sought to exclude that sector.498 Canada points out that GTH cites treaties from 2013 and 2014, which reflect an \"evolution in the architecture of Canada's FIPAs over the past three decades.\"499 These treaties and the BIT all exclude telecommunications, albeit in different ways.500\n\nJur.

GTH points to Article IV(2)(a)(ii) of the BIT, which expressly excludes certain future non-conforming measures.511\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

Whether the Annex Includes Telecommunications\n------------------------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nIn any event, GTH argues that the telecommunication sector does not fall within the scope of the reservation of rights contained in the Annex to the BIT.523 GTH rejects Canada's position that telecommunications is covered by the item \"services in any other sector.\"524 GTH advances the following arguments to support its view:\n\na. The category \"services in any other sector\" is not equivalent to \"services sectors,\" as Canada suggests.525\n\nb. Canada's interpretation would render the first item in the list (\"social services\") superfluous.526\n\nc. In any event, the telecommunications sector is not a service sector; it also covers infrastructure, construction and product sales.527\n\nd. Canada's own Standard Industrial Classification, which is referenced in the Annex to the BIT, classifies telecommunications as a utility, not a service.528\n\ne. In other investment treaties, Canada has expressly exempted measures with respect to \"telecommunications services\" but did not do so in the BIT. Indeed, in other treaties, Canada exempted \"telecommunications services\" *in addition to* \"the establishment or acquisition in Canada of an investment in the services sectors.\"529\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

Rejoinder, \u00b6 52.\n\n**(4) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Tribunal notes that Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT concerns exceptions to national treatment, which is a substantive protection granted under the BIT. Canada invokes this provision as an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, and GTH has responded on that basis. In the Tribunal's view, the issue might be better characterised as a question of admissibility or even merits, given its relevance to substantive protection rather than to the dispute resolution provisions of the BIT. However, this distinction carries no practical consequence in the present circumstances. Regardless of how one chooses to characterise Canada's objection, its operation is the same: if the Tribunal upholds the objection, it will not consider GTH's national treatment claim any further. Therefore, the Tribunal will address Canada's objection as pleaded by the Parties.\n\n364.\n\nThe decisions in this section of the Award are taken by the Tribunal acting by a majority.\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine whether, pursuant to Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex of the BIT, measures taken in the telecommunications sector are excluded from the scope of Canada's national treatment obligations. To reach that determination, the Tribunal will address in turn two main questions: (a) has Canada validly made an exception under Article IV(2)(d)? and (b) if so, is telecommunications captured by that exception? With respect to each of these questions, the Tribunal's fundamental task is to interpret the relevant provisions of the BIT in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT.\n\n366.\n\nArticle IV of the BIT is structured as a statement of general principle in paragraph (1), subject to a number of exceptions set forth in paragraph (2). Specifically, paragraph (2) states that paragraph (1) and certain other provisions of the BIT \"do not apply to\" subparagraphs (a) to (d). Subparagraph (a) refers to \"existing non-conforming measures\" and a very specific category of measures adopted after the date of the entry into force of the BIT (relating to ownership and participation in State entities). In turn, subparagraphs (b) and (c) refer to the continuation, renewal and amendment of such measures.\n\n367.\n\nOf primary interest to the Tribunal is Article IV(2)(d), which provides that the national treatment obligation in paragraph (1) \"does not apply to \u2026 the right of each Contracting Party to make or maintain exceptions within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex.\"531 The text makes clear that the right to make an exception in a sector or a matter is subject to only one condition: the sector or matter must be listed in the Annex. In the Annex, Canada \"reserves the right to make and maintain exceptions\" in five categories, including \"social services\" and \"services in any other sector.\"532 This language, similar in all three authentic linguistic versions of the BIT, leaves no room for doubt that Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation with respect to \"services.\" Unattractive as the result may seem to the dissenting minority,533 such is the Parties' agreement as recorded in the explicit terms of the BIT. The Tribunal is neither expected nor empowered to rewrite the Treaty to make its substantive protections more efficient for the interests of a party. The Tribunal is not expected either to adapt the application of the terms of the Treaty to suit the variable size of the concerned sectors in the Canadian economy.534\n\nThe Arabic version of the Annex (but not in the English and the French versions) also includes Egypt's reservation of right to make and maintain exceptions in specifically listed matters. This is not disputed between the Parties.\n\nThe scope of this category is discussed below, beginning at \u00b6 375.\n\nDissenting Opinion of Mr. Born, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 38.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 50.\n\n368.\n\nA remaining question is whether Canada may exercise that right by simply adopting or applying an inconsistent measure, or whether Canada must take an intermediary step to \"activate\" that right. Canada's position is that the \"right to make exceptions is the right to take inconsistent measures,\" whereas GTH contends that Canada must affirmatively exercise its right to make exceptions, such as \"by providing notice to investors that are subject to the BIT's protections.\"535\n\nDay 2, Tr. 140:9-16; Jur. Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48. *See* the summary of the Parties' positions in Section VI.D(2) and (3) above.\n\n369.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the correct, and most reasonable, interpretation of Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex supports Canada's position. In particular, there is simply no basis in the text of the BIT to impose an additional procedural requirement that triggers the effectiveness of the exception.536\n\nAs Canada highlights, many BITs include express notice requirements for exceptions such as those permitted by Article IV(2)(d).\n\n370.\n\nIn this regard, it is useful to consider Article XVI of the BIT, which provides:\n\n1. The Contracting Parties shall, within a two year period after the entry into force of this Agreement, exchange letters listing, to the extent possible, any existing measures that do not conform to the obligations in subparagraph (3)(a) of Article II, Article IV or paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article V.\n\n2. Each Contracting Party shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that its laws, regulations, procedures, and administrative rulings of general application respecting any matter covered by this Agreement are promptly published or otherwise made available in such a manner as to enable interested persons and the other Contracting Party to become acquainted with them.\n\n371.\n\nArticle XVI(1) sets out a process by which the Contracting Parties are to notify one another of any existing non-conforming measures, but there is no such process prescribed for exercising the right granted by Article IV(2)(d). The obvious indication is that if the Contracting Parties had intended for that right to be subject to any notification requirement beyond listing the relevant sector or matter in the Annex, they would have included it in the text of the BIT.537 Even if there were any want of diligence on the part of Canada in publicising this fact under Article XVI(2) (Transparency) of the BIT, that could amount to a breach of Article XVI(2) but would not, of itself, imply any violation of any other Article of the BIT.\n\nIt is worth noting that GTH does not allege any violation of Article XVI. From the record, it is clear that the text of ICA was available to investors at all times and that, as a matter of fact, GTH knew of the national security review provisions that were adopted in 2009.\n\n372.\n\nWith regard to the Annex, the reference to \"services in any other sector\" must be read in the context of the four other listed items. These refer to matters as specific as \"government securities \u2013 as described in SIC 8152\" and \"residency requirements for ownership of oceanfront land\" and \"measures implementing the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Oil and Gas Accords.\" The specificity of these categories also suggests that no further action by Canada is required or contemplated prior to its entitlement to rely upon these asserted \"exceptions.\" Although \"services in any other sector\" is broader than the other items listed, there is no indication in the text that it should be treated differently.\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal can but note that the text of the Annex could have been drafted in clearer terms. For instance, Canada could have stated that its national treatment obligation does not apply to non-conforming measures in the listed sectors or matters. At the same time, the Tribunal understands that the terms used (\"reserves the right to make exceptions\") reflect the fact that Article IV(2)(d) is largely forward looking. While Article IV(2)(a) to (c) are primarily concerned with *existing* measures (and thus refer clearly to excluded \"non-conforming measures\"), the main purpose of Article IV(2)(d) is to exclude measures that might be adopted *in the future*.\n\n374.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal must interpret the text of the BIT as it is, not as it should have been drafted in an ideal situation. As already mentioned, the text leaves no doubt that Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation in \"services,\" and the Tribunal declines to subject that right to a notice requirement or other procedural hurdle which is not included in the BIT. Thus, the Tribunal concludes that under Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex, Canada may adopt or apply measures with respect to \"services\" that are not in conformity with its national treatment obligation.\n\n375.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that this exception is limited to the national treatment provisions of the BIT. Canada remains obligated to provide Egyptian investors fair and equitable treatment when adopting or applying any measures in relation to \"services\" under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, and Canada must be reasonably transparent in the adoption of laws, regulations and procedures that might affect \"services\" under Article XVI(2).\n\n376.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question of whether \"services in any other sector\" includes telecommunications, which is the sector at issue in the present case. The Tribunal has no difficulty finding that it does.\n\n377.\n\nAs noted above, the first item listed in the Annex is \"social services,\" followed by \"services in *any* other sector.\" The only plausible interpretation is that all services, including social services, fall within the scope of the Annex.538 The Tribunal cannot accept GTH's argument that \"services in any other sector\" should be read more narrowly to give meaning to the reference to \"social services\" in the preceding item. That Canada chose to divide services into two categories, and provide further elaboration in respect of the first category, does not alter the clear language of the Annex.\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 132.\n\n378.\n\nWhile the breadth of the category \"services in any other sector\" might seem surprising, the language is consistent with many of Canada's investment treaties from the mid- to late- 1990s, which contain similar exceptions for services.539 In any event, it is not for the Tribunal to judge the extent to which a State chooses to guarantee investors national treatment (or not).\n\n**RL-026**, Canada-Ukraine FIPA, Article IV(2)(d), Annex; **RL-027**, Canada-Trinidad and Tobago FIPA, Article IV(2)(3), Annex; **RL-089**, Canada-Philippines FIPA, Article IV(2)(4), Annex; **RL-094**, Canada-Barbados FIPA, Article IV(2)(4), Annex; **RL-093**, Canada-Ecuador FIPA, Article IV(2)(4), Annex; **RL-095**, Canada-Venezuela FIPA, Annex II.11.4; **RL-092**, Canada-Panama FIPA, Article IV(2)(4), Annex; **RL-100**, Canada-Thailand FIPA, Article IV(3), Annex I; **RL-028**, Canada-Armenia FIPA, Article IV(2)(d), Annex.\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal is also unpersuaded by GTH's assertion that telecommunications is not a service sector. That assertion fails to reflect reality and runs contrary to GTH's own description of Wind Mobile's activities, which were aimed at providing mobile telecommunications services to Canadian customers.540\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal agrees with Canada that GTH's reliance on the Standard Industrial Classification is misplaced because it is referenced in the BIT only with respect to \"government securities\" and not \"any other services.\"\n\n380.\n\nIn light of the findings above, the Tribunal concludes that GTH's national treatment claim, which relates exclusively to the telecommunications sector, is excluded from the scope of the BIT's national treatment provisions. Accordingly, the national treatment claim is dismissed and will not be considered on the merits.\n\n**E. WHETHER THE CLAIMS ARE TIME-BARRED UNDER ARTICLE XIII(3)(D****) OF THE BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nCanada's submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over certain of GTH's claims because they are time-barred pursuant to the limitations period contained in Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT.\n\n382.\n\nGTH argues that its claims relating to Canada's cumulative, or composite, breaches of the BIT are not impacted by the notification period in Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT, and the Tribunal should therefore dismiss Canada's objection.\n\n**(1) Relevant Provision of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nArticle XIII(3)(d) of the BIT provides:\n\nAn investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if: [\u2026] not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.541\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article XIII(3)(d).\n\n**(2) Canada's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n384.\n\nCanada submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over GTH's claims challenging (a) the CRTC's O&C review of Wind Mobile and (b) Canada's alleged failure to maintain a regulatory framework for roaming and tower site/sharing favourable to New Entrants.542 In Canada's view, these claims fall outside the strict limitations period in Article XIII(3)(b) of the BIT, and GTH cannot evade that limitations period by alleging that the measures are part of a composite breach.543\n\nJur.

In Canada's view, these are separate, distinct measures, and GTH has failed to show any link among them other than the alleged impact on Wind Mobile.558 For example, the CRTC is \"an arm's-length regulator\" separate from the arms of the Government involved with the other measures, and it carried out its review pursuant to the Telecommunications Act, a distinct legal basis.559 Similarly, the roaming and tower/site sharing regulatory framework shares no link with the other measures and applied to all New Entrants, not only Wind Mobile.560 The ICA review was conducted on the distinct basis of national security concerns by an arm of Industry Canada that is not involved with telecommunications policy.561\n\nJur.

As a result, GTH asserts that it is not claiming those as stand-alone or separate breaches.569 However, GTH submits that those breaches are part of a cumulative breach, which was not known until June 2013.570\n\nDay 1, Tr. 173:24-174:15.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00a7 IV.\n\n397.\n\nGTH points to the description of \"composite act\" found in Article 15 of the ILC Articles and its Commentary.571 Article 15 states that a composite breach is \"a series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful,\" which \"occurs when the action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act.\"572\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

Canada subjected GTH to \"a pattern of conduct that gradually eroded the framework upon which GTH's investment was premised.\"581 Some of Canada's acts do not amount on their own to a breach of the BIT.582 In particular, GTH does not allege that the CRTC review and Canada's failure to enforce the roaming and tower/site sharing regulatory framework are discrete breaches.583 However, with the benefit of hindsight, this pattern of conduct amounts to a composite breach, \"which crystallized by the time of Canada's unlawful treatment of GTH's efforts to take voting control of its investment.\"584\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

Time limitation will only bar a claim if, in addition to the breach having become known to the investor more than three years before it submitted its claim to arbitration, the loss or damage resulting from that breach *also* became known to that investor more than three years before it submitted its claim. All three equally authentic linguistic versions of the BIT confirm the cumulative nature of the 'time of knowledge' test of the limitation period in Article XIII(3)(d).\n\n408.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that GTH does not argue that either the CRTC ownership and control review or the alleged failure of the Government's measures related to roaming and tower/site sharing is \"an independent breach of the BIT.\"597 Whether the series of actions or omissions in relation thereto are part of a wider, cumulative breach of the BIT, as alleged by GTH,598 or distinct and separate measures as alleged by Canada,599 is a matter for the merits. The same applies to the question of identifying the links in the chain,600 if any, between those two time-barred actions of Canada and the other alleged breaches, namely, the national security review and the Transfer Framework.\n\n*See* \u00b6 405 above.\n\nJur.

The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award, 22 August 2016, \u00b6 230. Canada refers in its submissions to \"a pattern of conduct unified by a common intent converging towards the same result,\" (Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, a\u00b6 149), which GTH rejects (Jur. Rejoinder, \u00b6 59).\n\n409.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal need not decide whether it has jurisdiction on inexistent claims. Determining whether a composite breach has occurred depends on the characterisation of the specific facts underlying those claims and the rights and obligations set in the BIT. The Tribunal addresses these questions below in the Merits section of the Award.\n\n410.\n\nIn understanding the time bar in Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT, the precedents arising under a different treaty, NAFTA, adduced by Canada in support of its defense *ratione temporis*, are of little assistance. This is because of the differences in the relevant terms of each treaty. While, as submitted by Canada,601 the English version of Article 1116(2) of NAFTA is identical on its face to Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT, the equally authentic French versions of each of those two treaties differ. Indeed, the French version of NAFTA Article 1116(2)602 provides: \"*Un investisseur ne pourra soumettre une plainte \u00e0 l'arbitrage si plus de trois ans se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis la date \u00e0 laquelle l'investisseur a eu ou aurait d\u00fb avoir connaissance du manquement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et de la perte ou du dommage subi.*\" This may be translated in English as requiring that the investor \"knowledge of the alleged breach and of the incurred loss or damage.\" In contrast, the French version of the BIT requires of the investor to \"*avoir connaissance de la violation pr\u00e9tendue et du pr\u00e9judice ou du dommage* **qu'elle lui a caus\u00e9s**.\"603 This may be translated in English as requiring that the investor has \"knowledge of the alleged breach and of the loss or damage caused by that breach.\"604\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 146.\n\nNAFTA Article 2206: \"Authentic Texts\" provides: \"The English, French and Spanish texts of this Agreement are equally authentic.\"\n\n*Emphasis added.*\n\nThe Parties have not pointed in their submissions to this difference between the terms of NAFTA and those of the BIT. However, the Tribunal is only relying on the BIT, the three authentic versions of which have been pleaded, not on NAFTA which is not relevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, under Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT, for the investor to acquire knowledge, whether actually or constructively, that it has incurred loss or damage *caused by the alleged breach*, all the actions or omissions necessary to constitute the alleged breach must have occurred. This is particularly true in the case of a composite act, as alleged by GTH on the basis of Article 15 of the ILC Articles.605 It is only when the last of the actions or omissions necessary to constitute the wrongful act occurs (which, as the ILC noted, is not necessarily the last act in the series),606 that the investor can acquire knowledge of the loss caused by that wrongful act as required in Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT.\n\n*See* \u00b6 406 above.\n\nThe Commentary to ILC Article 15 states that the Article \"defines the time at which a composite act 'occurs' as the time at which the last action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act, without it necessarily having to be the last of the series.\" **RL-233**, International Law Commission, ILC Articles with commentaries (2001), \u00b6 7.\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore dismisses Canada's time bar objection to jurisdiction based on Article XIII(3)(d) as unfounded, given that GTH is not asserting any claim for separate breaches in relation to the alleged facts pertaining to the CRTC review and to the roaming and tower/site sharing measures. The Tribunal does so without prejudice to the possibility that, as a matter of the merits of the case, particular elements of the claim as presented by GTH are liable to be dismissed because they are not shown to be elements of a composite act that comes to completion only within the three-year period.\n\n**F. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT HAS STANDING TO BRING CLAIMS RELATING TO THE TREATMENT OF WIND MOBILE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n413.\n\nCanada objects to the admissibility of GTH's claims which, in Canada's view, relate to the treatment of Wind Mobile. Specifically, Canada submits that GTH lacks standing to bring its claims concerning measures that allegedly affected (a) Wind Mobile's competitiveness as a New Entrant in the Canadian telecommunications market, and (b) the transferability of Wind Mobile's licenses.\n\n414.\n\nGTH's position is that it has standing under Article XIII(3) of the BIT to bring claims relating to both direct and indirect loss or damages it suffered as a result of Canada's alleged breaches of the BIT. In GTH's view, Canada's objection must be dismissed because it is based on an irrelevant provision of the BIT and a non-existent principle of international law.\n\n**(1) Relevant Provision of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nArticle XIII of the BIT concerns the \"Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Contracting Party.\" It provides in relevant part:\n\n1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement[] and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall, to the extent possible, be settled amicably between them.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n3. An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:\n\n(a) the investor has consented in writing thereto;\n\n(b) the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind;\n\n[\u2026]\n\n4. The dispute may, at the election of the investor concerned, be submitted to arbitration under:\n\n(a) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)\n\n[\u2026]\n\n5. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n7. A tribunal established under this Article shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n12. (a) A claim that a Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that an enterprise that is a juridical person incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws of that Contracting Party has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, may be brought by an investor of the other Contracting Party acting on behalf of an enterprise which the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly. In such a case\n\n(i) any award shall be made to the affected enterprise;\n\n(ii) the consent to arbitration of both the investor and the enterprise shall be required;\n\n(iii) both the investor and enterprise must waive any right to initiate or continue any other proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind.607\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article XIII.\n\n**(2) Canada's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n416.\n\nCanada argues that GTH and Wind Mobile cannot be equated with one another, following the principle of international law that an enterprise and its shareholders have separate legal personality.608 This principle was set forth by the ICJ in the *Barcelona Traction* case, and the Court recognized that harm to a shareholder does not create a right for the shareholder to seek compensation for measures taken against the enterprise.609\n\nJur.

But the mere fact that damage is sustained by both company and shareholder does not imply that both are entitled to claim compensation. \u2026 Thus whenever a shareholder's interests are harmed by an act done to the company, it is to the latter that he must look to institute appropriate action; for although two separate entities may have suffered from the same wrong, it is only one entity whose rights have been infringed\").\n\n417.\n\nCanada distinguishes between direct and derivative/reflective shareholder claims. According to Canada, a claim is derivative if the alleged harm to the shareholder resulted from the treatment of the corporation.610 In that case, the shareholder has no independent right of action under international law.611\n\nJur.

When a shareholder brings a claim under Article XIII(12), both the shareholder and the enterprise must consent to arbitration and waive any right to initiate other proceedings relating to the challenged measure, and any damages are to be paid to the enterprise.614\n\nJur.

Mexico*, although the tribunal accepted jurisdiction, it rejected the claimant's argument that Mexico's treatment of the claimant's subsidiary rendered the claimant's shares worthless.

Rather, GTH alleges that Canada's failure to ensure a favourable regulatory framework hurt Wind Mobile and its operations (not its shareholders).637 Similarly, GTH alleges that the Transfer Framework impaired spectrum licenses which are held by Wind Mobile (not by GTH).638 In particular, Canada argues that neither the Transfer Framework nor any other measure ever prevented GTH from selling its shares in Wind Mobile.639 For Canada, it follows that these measures \"did not interfere with GTH's investment.\"640\n\nJur.

Rejoinder, \u00b6 68, *quoting* **CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article VII.\n\n435.\n\nAccording to GTH, its interpretation of Article XIII is supported by the only other decision to address a nearly identical provision in another BIT.656 In *EnCana v. Ecuador*, EnCana brought claims under the Canada-Ecuador BIT with respect to Barbadian subsidiaries involved oil and gas exploration in Ecuador.657 One of Ecuador's jurisdictional objections was that EnCana was \"not claiming in relation to its own loss but rather in relation to loss suffered by\" its subsidiaries.658 The tribunal stated that:\n\nThe Tribunal does not interpret Article XIII(12) as limiting the clear words of Articles I and XIII(1) which allow an investor to maintain a claim for loss suffered to itself arising from a breach of the BIT. \u2026 True, it does distinguish between loss or damage suffered by a locally incorporated enterprise and loss or damage suffered directly or indirectly by the investor itself. Circumstances can be envisaged where a breach of the BIT affecting a locally incorporated subsidiary would have caused no loss or damage to the parent \u2013 e.g., where no consequence flowed from the breach either to the returns to the parent or to the share value of the subsidiary. \u2026 But an investor which alleges that it has suffered loss or damage, directly or indirectly, through a breach of the BIT is entitled to bring proceedings under Articles XIII(1) and (2). If it cannot prove compensable loss or damage, it will fail on the merits; that does not affect the jurisdiction of a tribunal constituted in accordance with Article XIII(4) to entertain its claim.659\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

On the other hand, GTH sees significant practical problems with Canada's approach. In this regard, GTH states:\n\nGTH sought to invest in the Canadian telecommunications market as an Egyptian investor, it had no choice but to agree to a shareholding structure by which it would invest in the Canadian enterprise through the ownership of shares. Now, Canada seeks to preclude GTH from claiming damage to its investment due to Canada's measures by referring to the very shareholding structure Canada had required GTH to create.670\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

It includes any kind of asset owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Shares are specifically listed amongst the non-exhaustive examples in that provision of the BIT, as are bonds and debentures and claims to money.673 GTH's indirect shareholding in Wind Mobile and the debt owed to it by Wind Mobile are therefore qualifying investments that are protected by the BIT. Moreover, earlier in this Award, the Tribunal ruled that GTH is a qualifying investor that benefits from the BIT's protections.674\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English version), Article I(f) (\"'investment' means any kind of asset owned or controlled either directly, or indirectly through an investor of a third State, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter's laws and, in particular, though not exclusively, includes: \u2026 (ii) shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of participation in a company, business enterprise or joint venture; (iii) money, claims to money, and claims to performance under contract having a financial value\").\n\n*See* above Section VI.B.\n\n443.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that GTH asserts that it is not bringing a claim under the BIT on behalf of Wind Mobile or for damages incurred by Wind Mobile, but claims pursuant to Article XIII(1) in respect of its own loss as an investor in Wind Mobile, i.e., as a shareholder and a creditor of Wind Mobile. The Tribunal considers therefore that GTH need not comply with the terms of Article XIII(12) of the BIT. As GTH's counsel stated during the Hearing:\n\nSo that's exactly what GTH did: they brought the claim under Article [XIII](1); they waived their right to bring these claims under any other forum, even whether or not they could have aside. So we think Article XIII(12) is just simply irrelevant here.675\n\nDay 1, Tr. 172:12-15.\n\n444.\n\nThe Tribunal notes approvingly the pragmatic approach that the *EnCana v. Ecuador* tribunal has taken: an investor that qualifies for the protection of the treaty, and which alleges that it has suffered loss or damage that is separate from that suffered by its locally-incorporated subsidiary, is entitled to bring proceedings to recover those alleged separate damages under the equivalent of Article XIII(1).676 Whether that investor prevails on the merits is a matter that does not relate to the debate on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n**CL-125**, *EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador* (UNCITRAL) Award, 3 February 2006, \u00b6 118.\n\n445.\n\nThe decisions in the large number of investment cases to which GTH refers, holding that an investor has standing to claim damages because of the loss in the value of its shares or debt, does not mean that *Barcelona Traction* was wrongly decided; nor is this Tribunal suggesting that *Barcelona Traction* has become irrelevant in light of more recent investment arbitral jurisprudence such as *CMS v. Argentina*.677*Barcelona Traction* was essentially about diplomatic protection.678 This arbitration is predicated primarily on the terms of the BIT. Those terms broadly define qualifying investments to include the indirect holding of shares and claims to money, and permit an investor to bring to arbitration claims for loss or damages caused to its investment by a measure taken by the host State in breach of the BIT.\n\n**CL-005**, *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Republic of Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, \u00b6 48 (\"The Tribunal therefore finds no bar in current international law to the concept of allowing claims by shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned, not even if those shareholders are minority or non-controlling shareholders.

THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nThe Tribunal upholds Canada's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over GTH's claim that Canada violated its national treatment obligations set forth in the BIT. The Tribunal denies Canada's remaining objections to jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n448.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal dismisses GTH's national treatment claim and finds that it has jurisdiction over each of GTH's remaining claims, the merits of which will be considered in the following Section.\n\n**VII. MERITS**\n---------------\n\n**A. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT**\n-----------------------------------\n\n449.\n\nGTH submits that Canada has breached its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by (a) blocking GTH from selling Wind Mobile to an Incumbent;679 (b) subjecting GTH to an arbitrary national security review process that lacked transparency and due process;680 and (c) Canada's cumulative conduct over the lifetime of GTH's investment.681\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00a7 VII.A.2; Merits Reply and Jur.

GTH highlights that the term \"customary\" does not appear in Article II(2)(a).704 In its view, the proper interpretation of the phrase, which gives meaning to all the terms of Article II(2)(a), is that \"FET cannot be contrary to the principles of international law and, to the extent there is any difference between the two, principles of international law act as a floor but not as a ceiling.\"705\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

Venezuela* stated that the \"discussion of whether Art. II.2 of the BIT incorporates or fails to incorporate the CIS Standard when defining FET has become dogmatic: there is no substantive difference in the level of protection afforded by both standards.\"714\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

Reply, \u00b6 198.\n\n472.\n\nFor Canada, because Article II(2)(a) is a customary international law standard, it follows that the burden is on GTH to provide evidence of State practice and *opinio juris* to support its position regarding the elements of the fair and equitable standard in the BIT.730 In Canada's view, GTH has failed to meet this burden. GTH relies solely on past arbitral decisions, which are not evidence of State practice.731\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 335-337.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 338.\n\n473.\n\nIn any event, Canada contends that, even if the Tribunal were to find that Article II(2)(a) provides protection beyond the minimum standard of treatment, it should reject GTH's argument that investors are entitled to broad protections in relation to unfair and arbitrary measures, legitimate expectations, transparency and due process.732\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 339.\n\n474.\n\nAccording to Canada, GTH's \"allegations ignore the fact that international law generally grants a high level of deference to States with respect to domestic policy choices and balancing of public interest and individual rights.\"733 Whether the FET standard is autonomous or based in customary international law, Canada's position is that FET does not permit tribunals to second guess a State's policy choice or the justification of that choice.734 This has been confirmed in several arbitral decisions; for example, the tribunal in *Crystallex v. Venezuela* stated that:\n\ngovernmental authorities should enjoy a high level of deference for reasons of their expertise and competence (which is assumed to be present in those institutions called to make the relevant decisions) and proximity with the situation under examination. It is not for an investor-state tribunal to second-guess the substantive correctness of the reasons which an administration were to put forward in its decisions, or to question the importance assigned by the administration to certain policy objectives over others.735\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 340.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 340 *et seq.* ; Merits Rejoinder and Jur.

Thus, in the context of national security concerns, it would be unreasonable to expect a government to act with full transparency.748\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 358-360; Merits Rejoinder and Jur.

The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n482.\n\nAs can be noted from the summaries above, the Parties differ as to the content and scope of the FET obligation expressed in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. In construing the scope of that obligation as agreed between the Contracting Parties in the BIT, the Tribunal will have regard to the general rule of interpretation in Article 31 of the VCLT. Contrary to other disputed terms in the BIT, the three authentic texts of the BIT are identical in setting out an FET obligation for each Contracting Party \"in accordance with principles of international law.\"\n\n483.\n\nIn reviewing the object and purpose of the BIT, the Tribunal notes that both the Preamble750 and Article II(1)751 state the wish of the Contracting Parties to create favourable conditions for Canadian investors in Egypt, and for Egyptian investors in Canada, and their recognition that the protection of investments made by their respective nationals in the territory of the other Contracting State will be conducive to the stimulation of business initiative and to the development of economic cooperation between those States. The Tribunal considers those objectives to be important in construing the terms of the BIT in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT.\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English Version), Preamble (\"RECOGNIZING that the promotion and the protection of investments of investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party will be conducive to the stimulation of business initiative and to the development of economic cooperation between them\").\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English Version), Art. II(1) (\"Each Contracting Party shall grant to investments, or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party, treatment no less favourable than that which, in like circumstances, it grants to investments or returns of investors of any third State.\").\n\n484.\n\nDealing first with Canada's argument that the fair and equitable treatment standard set out in the BIT is limited to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, the Tribunal concludes that there is no basis for such an interpretation. Any such limitation runs counter to the explicit terms used in Article II(2)(a) and to the ordinary meaning to be given to those terms in their context and in the light of the BIT's object and purpose.\n\n485.\n\nArticle II(2)(b) refers to fair and equitable treatment in conformity with principles of international law; it does not refer to the minimum standard of treatment. The authentic French and Arabic texts of the BIT are identical to the English text.752 This Tribunal finds no support for Canada's endeavour to override the terms of the BIT and to draft into Article II(2)(b) a reference to the minimum standard that would limit the potential application of a wider range of international law principles than the minimum standard alone.\n\nTo be precise, the authentic French and Arabic texts of the BIT refer in Article II(2)(a) to \"*the* principles of international law\" [emphasis added], while the English text omits \"the\". However, no submissions were made that the omission is a relevant factor in construing the FET obligation in the BIT and the Tribunal does not consider that it is critical to that effect.\n\n486.\n\nIt is worth recalling the words of Dr. F.A. Mann, recalled by the *Vivendi* tribunal as follows:\n\nAs Dr. F.A. Mann, one of the twentieth century's leading authorities on the interaction between municipal law and public international law wrote in 1981:\n\n*\"the terms 'fair and equitable treatment' envisage conduct which goes far beyond the minimum standard and afford protection to a greater extent and according to a much more objective standard than any previously employed form of words. A Tribunal would not be concerned with a minimum, maximum or average standard. It will have to decide whether in all circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable. No standard defined by any other words is likely to be material. The terms are to be understood and implied independently and autonomously\".*\n\nDr. Mann's conclusions have been echoed by others. Like Dr. Mann, an UNCTAD Report on Fair and Equitable Treatment concluded that \"where the fair and equitable standard is invoked, the central issue remains simply whether the actions in question are in all the circumstances fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable\". Stephen Vascianne reached the same conclusion in his extensive study of the concept of fair and equitable treatment.753\n\n**CL-045**, *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 7.4.8-7.4.9 (footnotes omitted) (quoting F.A. Mann, \"British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments,\" 52 BRIT. YB Int'l L. 241, 244 (1981) and citing Stephen Vascianne **, \"** The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law and Practice,\" 70 BRIT. Y.B. Int'l L 99, 144 (1999)).\n\n487.\n\nIn other international treaties to which Canada is a party, explicit reference is made to the \"minimum standard of treatment.\" This includes Article 1105 of NAFTA754 and Article 5 of Canada's 2004 Model BIT.755 In particular, NAFTA, signed in 1992, predates the BIT. The concept of the minimum standard was well known to Canada when negotiating and signing the BIT. Yet, the BIT does not make reference thereto. Canada's agreement with Egypt expressed in the BIT is to be enforced, and this Tribunal shall therefore construe the FET obligation in accordance with principles of international law.\n\n**RL-101**, North American Free Trade Agreement, Article 1105 (titled \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\").\n\n**RL-117**, Canada Model BIT (2004), Article 5 (titled \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\" and stating in subparagraph (2): \"The concepts of 'fair and equitable treatment' and 'full protection and security' in paragraph 1 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens\").\n\n488.\n\nIn assessing whether the FET obligation has been breached, a tribunal must determine whether, in all of the circumstances of the particular case, the conduct properly attributable to the State has met the treaty requirement that it be \"fair and equitable.\"756 The stricter standard of \"grossly unfair or unjust\" conduct averred by Canada is not supported by the text of the BIT.757 Further, as recognised by the *CMS v. Argentina* tribunal, FET is an objective standard which is \"unrelated to whether the Respondent has had any deliberate intention or bad faith in adopting the measures in question. Of course, such intention and bad faith can aggravate the situation, but are not an essential element of the standard.\"758\n\n**CL-045**, *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, \u00b6 7.4.12.\n\n*See* Merits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 353.\n\n**CL-036**, *CMS Gas Transportation Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICISD Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 12 May 2005, \u00b6 280; *see* **CL-045**, *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, \u00b6 7.4.12.\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the *Tecmed v. Mexico* tribunal's holding in construing Article 4(1) of the Mexico-Spain BIT (1996), which is similar in its terms to Article II(2)(b) of the BIT:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that this provision of the Agreement, in light of the good faith principle established by international law, requires the Contracting Parties to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations. Any and all State actions conforming to such criteria should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued, or the resolutions approved thereunder, but also to the goals underlying such regulations. The foreign investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the State that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and business activities. The investor also expects the State to use the legal instruments that govern the actions of the investor or the investment in conformity with the function usually assigned to such instruments, and not to deprive the investor of its investment without the required compensation. In fact, failure by the host State to comply with such pattern of conduct with respect to the foreign investor or its investments affects the investor's ability to measure the treatment and protection awarded by the host State and to determine whether the actions of the host State conform to the fair and equitable treatment principle. Therefore, compliance by the host State with such pattern of conduct is closely related to the above-mentioned principle, to the actual chances of enforcing such principle, and to excluding the possibility that state action be characterized as arbitrary; i.e. as presenting insufficiencies that would be recognized \"\u2026by any reasonable and impartial man,\" or, although not in violation of specific regulations, as being contrary to the law because:...(it) shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.759\n\n**CL-031**, *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, \u00b6 154 (footnotes omitted).\n\n490.\n\nIn answer to Canada's concerns about potential limits on the State's ability to regulate, this Tribunal does not consider that the FET obligation, as interpreted in accordance with the terms of the BIT, improperly or unreasonably restricts the State from legislating and adapting its legal system to changing circumstances. In doing so, however, the State may not ignore the interests of an investor that relied on the State's earlier course of action.760\n\nSee **CL-040**, A *DC Affiliate Limited and* *ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, \u00b6 483; **CL-072**, Rudolf Dolzer, \"Fair and Equitable Treatment: Today's Contours,\" 12 S.C. J. of Int'l L. 7, 23 (2013).\n\n491.\n\nThe above being determined, the Tribunal need not determine in the abstract theoretical issues such as the breadth of protection that an investor is entitled to claim in relation to unfair and arbitrary measures, legitimate expectations, transparency and due process. The Tribunal will consider whether there has been a breach of the FET obligation in relation to each specific claim advanced by GTH in Sections (3) to (5) below based on the relevant facts and the evidence adduced in the case.\n\n**(3) Whether the Transfer Framework Breached the Respondent's Fair and Equitable Treatment Obligation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. GTH's Position\n-----------------\n\n492.\n\nGTH claims that Canada violated Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by denying GTH the ability to transfer the set-aside spectrum licenses to an Incumbent after the five-year transfer restriction had expired.761 According to GTH, Canada's action constitutes two distinct breaches of the FET standard: (a) Canada frustrated GTH's legitimate expectations; and (b) Canada subjected GTH to unreasonable and arbitrary treatment.762\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 VII.A.2; Merits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 IV.A.2.\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 305.\n\n*GTH's Expectations*\n--------------------\n\n493.\n\nGTH asserts that a fundamental component of the 2008 AWS Auction Framework was a finite five-year restriction on the transfer of set-aside spectrum licenses, after which New Entrants would be permitted to sell their licenses to an Incumbent.763 The purpose of this restriction was to prevent New Entrants from engaging in arbitrage with their spectrum license and to encourage licensees to put the spectrum to meaningful use.764\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 277(b).\n\n494.\n\nHowever, according to GTH, \"Canada knew that it could not introduce an indefinite ban on the sale of set-aside spectrum licenses to Incumbents because it knew that investors would not purchase spectrum licenses with such a restriction.\"765 Thus, GTH alleges that Canada deliberately introduced the finite five-year period to induce New Entrants to invest in the Canadian telecommunications sector.766\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 273.\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 273.\n\n495.\n\nGTH argues that Industry Canada and all the New Entrants understood and expected that after expiration of the five-year restriction, the New Entrants would be permitted to transfer their spectrum licenses to Incumbents.767 Mr. Michael Connolly testifies that Industry Canada intended to allow market forces to return after five years and had accepted the possibility that there might be no New Entrants left in the market after that period.768\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 313; **CWS-Connolly**, \u00b6 13.\n\n**CWS-Connolly**, \u00b6 13.\n\n496.\n\nAccording to GTH, its expectation that Canada would uphold this condition was supported by the following facts:\n\na. In the *Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services* (the \"**Spectrum Licensing Procedure**\"), Industry Canada confirmed that relevant spectrum licenses enjoyed the \"privilege\" of \"enhanced transferability and divisibility rights.\"769\n\nb. Canada had recognized \"the importance of relying on market forces in spectrum management\" and confirmed that regulatory measures, if and when adopted, would be minimally intrusive.770\n\nc. Industry Canada's past practice was to allow the sale of a New Entrant to an Incumbent after a transfer restriction period had expired.771\n\nd. Canada had assured investors that the \"spectrum licenses may be transferred in whole or in part (either in geographic area or in bandwidth) to a third party subject to the conditions stated on the licence and other applicable regulatory requirements.\"772\n\ne. The five-year transfer restriction was memorialized in Wind Mobile's set-aside spectrum licenses in unambiguous terms:\n\nLicenses acquired through the set-aside of spectrum... may not be transferred or leased to, acquired by means of a change in ownership or control of the licensee, divided among, or exchanged with companies that do not meet the criteria of a new entrant, **for a period of 5 years** from the date of issuance.773\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 314; **C-003**, Industry Canada, Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services (CPC-2-1-23, Issue 2), September 2007, \u00a7 5.6.\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 314; Merits Reply and Jur.

Mr. David Dobbie testifies that \"GTH would not have been likely to invest in Canada, and certainly not at the price we bid in the Auction, had we been informed at the outset that we would not be allowed to sell our investment to an Incumbent.\"775 Similarly, Mr. Andy Dry testifies that it would be difficult to justify investing as a New Entrant without a clear, stable liquidity right attached to the spectrum licenses.776\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 317 *et seq.* ; Merits Reply and Jur.

This is an unambiguous breach of Canada's obligation to accord GTH's investment FET under the BIT.784\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 324 *et seq.* ; Merits Reply and Jur.

For example, Minister Paradis told the House of Commons that \"[s]pectrum set aside for new entrants was never intended to be transferred to incumbents and as such will not be approved now, nor will it likely be in the future.\"790\n\n**C-195**, House of Commons Debates, Hansard 146(262), 41st Parliament, 1st Session, 4 June 2013, p. 17647.\n\n503.\n\nGTH denies that having a guaranteed fourth player had always been the objective of the 2008 AWS Auction. It points to a December 2012 internal Industry Canada presentation, which stated that \"aside from the 5-year restriction on AWS spectrum, there are no other specific conditions\" for spectrum transfer, and that \"[c]hanging the current IC approach to license transfer requests would require consultation.\"791\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 329; **C-131**, Email from Rebecca Guillemette to Cindy-Lee Cook, et al., 10 December 2012, *attaching* Industry Canada, *Wireless Telecommunications Sector: Status Update and Implications*, 10 December 2012 [ATI Document], Slide 14.\n\n504.\n\nGTH rejects Canada's reliance on the fact that transfers of the spectrum licenses were always subject to the Minister's approval and that the Minister had the right to amend the conditions of the licenses.792 In GTH's view, it was reasonable in the circumstances for New Entrants to expect that the Minister would approve transfers after expiration of the five-year restriction.793 Further, Canada informed prospective investors that the Minister's discretion to amend conditions to licenses under the Radiocommunications Act 5(1)(b) \"would be exercised on an exceptional basis.\"794\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

In a 2012 memorandum, Industry Canada described the \"*Status quo*\" as follows:\n\nIC would not be in a position to object to spectrum license transfers that would reduce the limited pool of spectrum available to new entrants and increase incumbents' spectrum dominance. The Competition Bureau would be the sole body that could review spectrum license transfer requests with competitive impacts in mind, with any objections involving a lengthy legal process.795\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

Canada's Position\n--------------------\n\n515.\n\nCanada denies that the Transfer Framework breached Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by blocking the sale of Wind Mobile to an Incumbent.816\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 II.D; Merits Merits Rejoinder and Jur.

While Canada accepts that \"the Department was approached informally on a few occasions about potential deals involving Wind Mobile's licences,\" it argues that GTH never in fact requested a transfer of Wind Mobile's licences.818 Given that the Minister never denied such a request, Canada concludes that there is no factual basis for GTH's claim.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 362; Merits Rejoinder and Jur.

Reply, \u00b6 305.\n\n517.\n\nIn any event, Canada further argues that the Transfer Framework was not contrary to any legitimate expectations GTH could have held; nor was it an unreasonable or arbitrary measure targeting Wind Mobile.\n\n*GTH's Expectations*\n--------------------\n\n518.\n\nAccording to Canada, GTH's arguments regarding the alleged frustration of its legitimate expectations must be rejected for several reasons.\n\n519.\n\n*First*, as a corollary to its objection to GTH's standing,819 Canada argues that GTH's expectations about the transferability of the AWS spectrum licenses are irrelevant to its claim because Wind Mobile\u2014not GTH\u2014was the license holder, and GTH has not brought a claim on behalf of Wind Mobile.820 Canada's position is summarized as follows:\n\nThe only expectations that can be relevant to the Claimant's FET claims are those it held in relation to the investments that are the subject of its claim \u2013 its equity in GIHC and its debt interests with respect to Wind Mobile. The Claimant has not identified any such expectations. Instead the Claimant focuses on expectations it allegedly held in relation to Wind Mobile's spectrum licences, which the Claimant never controlled. \u2026 Similarly, when considering whether Canada made any representations to the Claimant to induce it to invest in Wind Mobile, the only representations that are relevant are those related to its investment.821\n\nSee Section VI.F above.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 398-403.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 400-401.\n\n520.\n\n*Second*, even if the Tribunal were to find GTH's expectations as to Wind Mobile's licenses relevant, Canada contends that it never guaranteed GTH a \"right\" to sell Wind Mobile or transfer Wind Mobile's licences to an Incumbent at the end of the five-year restriction on license transfers.822 In Canada's view, GTH's alleged expectations are based on a mischaracterization of the relevant regulatory framework, rather than actual assurances made by Canada.823\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 404; Merits Rejoinder and Jur.

Under the Radio Communications Act, any transfer of a spectrum license requires the Minister's approval, and Canadian courts have confirmed that the Minister's broad \"discretion to manage the spectrum\" includes discretion over whether to approve requests to transfer spectrum licenses.824 In deciding whether to approve a transfer, the Minister can take into account a wide variety of considerations.825\n\nb. As stated in the Licensing Circular in effect at the time of the 2008 AWS Auction, although spectrum licences with \"enhanced transferability and divisibility rights\" could \"be transferred in whole or in part (either in geographic area or in bandwidth) to a third party,\" such a transfer was \"subject to the conditions stated on the licence and other applicable regulatory requirements.\"826\n\nc. The COL's of Wind Mobile's licenses stated:\n\nThe licensee may apply in writing to transfer its licence in whole or in part (divisibility), in both the bandwidth and geographic dimensions. Departmental approval is required for each proposed transfer of a licence, whether the transfer is in whole or in part. The transferee(s) must also provide an attestation and other supporting documentation demonstrating that it meets the eligibility criteria and all other conditions, technical or otherwise, of the licence. \u2026 The Minister of Industry retains the discretion to amend these terms and conditions of licence at any time.827\n\nd. The 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, the AWS Licensing Framework and the AWS Consultation Paper also expressly state the requirement to obtain approval of any spectrum licence transfer.828 Canada made this requirement clear to potential bidders in the 2008 AWS Auction, through the public questions and answers process.829\n\ne. GTH and other potential bidders knew that Canada's objective in conducting the 2008 AWS Auction was not to allow New Entrants to acquire spectrum at a discount only to have them sell it to Incumbents.830\n\nf. The sale of Wind Mobile to an Incumbent would also have been subject to approval by the Competition Bureau under the Competition Act.831\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 187-192; **RWS-Hill**, \u00b6\u00b6 105-106; **C-057**, *Radiocommunication Act*, \u00b6\u00b6 5(1)(a)(i.1), 5(1.1); **C-046**, *Telecommunications Act*, s. 7; **R-224**, *Telus Communications Company v.

Specifically, Canada rejects GTH's reliance on the speculations of industry analysts and market participants regarding what might happen after the five-year period.839 Canada also contends that an approval of a license transfer more than a decade earlier under different circumstances does not create a \"past practice\" on which to base future expectations.840\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur.

The Spectrum Licensing Procedure in effect at the time of the 2008 AWS Auction states that \"licensing policies are constantly adapting to changes in radiocommunication in order to respond effectively to the evolving competitive environment and user needs.\"842\n\nb. The Minister's authority to amend the COLs is stated in section 5(1)(b) of the Radiocommunication Act.843\n\nc. The COLs provide that the Minister \"retains the discretion to amend these terms and conditions of licence at any time.\"844\n\nd.

The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n538.\n\nThis section of the Award contains the Tribunal's analysis of GTH's FET claims relating to Canada's adoption and implementation of the Transfer Framework. The Tribunal will consider GTH's claims that Canada's actions (i) frustrated GTH's legitimate expectations and (ii) were arbitrary, unreasonable, and lacked transparency.\n\n*Legitimate Expectations*\n-------------------------\n\n539.\n\nTo determine whether Canada's conduct frustrated GTH's legitimate expectations and, as a result, breached the FET standard as set out in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, the Tribunal will examine whether, based on the evidence adduced by the Parties, it is possible to identify representations by Canada that could give rise to legitimate expectations by GTH, the extent to which GTH relied on those representations in its investment decision, and whether Canada fundamentally departed from those representations after GTH made its investment in reliance thereon.\n\n540.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed, *inter alia*, the 2001 Spectrum Auction Framework,885 the Spectrum Licensing Procedure,886 the 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework,887 and the AWS Auction Consultation Paper,888 all of which were available to GTH in 2008 when considering whether to invest in Canada. The Tribunal finds no compelling evidence that Canada represented at the time of the AWS Auction that it would unconditionally permit New Entrants to transfer their set-aside licences to Incumbents, or that the Minister would approve all applications to transfer set-aside spectrum to Incumbents automatically after the expiry of the five-year transfer restriction. The evidence reviewed below supports this finding.\n\n**C-041**, 2001 Spectrum Auction Framework.\n\n**C-003**, Industry Canada, Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services (CPC-2-1-23, Issue 2), September 2007.\n\n**C-004**, 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework.\n\n**C-050**, AWS Auction Consultation Paper.\n\n541.\n\nUnder the heading \"Licence Transferability and Divisibility,\" the COLs state:\n\nThe licensee may apply in writing to transfer its licence in whole or in part (divisibility), in both the bandwidth and geographic dimensions. *Departmental approval is required for each proposed transfer of a licence*, whether the transfer is in whole or in part.889\n\n**C-010**, Wind Mobile Licenses (*emphasis added*). In the cover letter to the Licenses, the Director General of Industry Canada indicated to Mr. Campbell, the CEO of Globalive: \"I would strongly suggest that you carefully read the conditions appended to the licences,\"\n\n542.\n\nAs highlighted by both Parties, the 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework and the AWS Licensing Framework each contains the following statement: \"While all licence transfers must be approved by the Minister, licences obtained through the set-aside may not be transferred to companies that do not meet the criteria of a new entrant for a period of 5 years from the date of issuance.\"890 Canada correctly argues that this statement put potential bidders on notice that all license transfers were subject to ministerial approval. The Tribunal finds the language to be unambiguous in this respect. GTH focuses instead on the second limb of the statement, which sets out the five-year restriction on transfers. In effect, GTH attempts to turn this *restriction* on transfers into a positive *obligation* of Canada to permit transfers after the five-year period. The Tribunal does not accept this argument. Reading selectively the part of the statement that GTH cites as a guarantee of unconditional transfer would override the express requirement of ministerial approval contained in the other part of the same statement.\n\n**C-004**, 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, p. 6; **C-005**, AWS Licensing Framework, p. 7.\n\n543.\n\nThe *Responses to Questions for Clarification on the AWS Policy and Licensing Frameworks*, a document that Canada issued on 27 February 2008 as a companion document to the other documents for the AWS Auction, which was adduced by GTH as evidence in this arbitration, further corroborates the Tribunal's determination in the preceding paragraph. In that document, Canada indicated: \"Once licences have been issued, licensees may transfer licences, subject to departmental approval, to other companies provided that they meet the conditions of licence.\"891 Canada further specified in that document:\n\nAs outlined in the AWS Licensing Framework, *departmental approval is required for each proposed transfer of a licence*, whether the transfer is in whole or in part. The licensee must apply to Industry Canada in writing. The transferee(s) must also provide an attestation and other supporting documentation demonstrating that it meets the eligibility criteria and all other conditions, technical or otherwise, of the licence. *This provision applies for the entire term of the licence.*892\n\n**C-062**, Industry Canada, Responses to Questions for Clarifications on the AWS Policy and Licensing Frameworks, 27 February 2008, p. 20 (*emphasis added*). In considering that evidence, the Tribunal also reviewed **C-467** later adduced by GTH and admitted on the evidential record pursuant to PO10.\n\n*Ibid.* at \u00b6 5.9 (*emphasis added*); repeated at \u00b6 6.18.\n\n544.\n\nAt the Hearing, the former director of Industry Canada, Mr. Connolly, explained that a license transfer requires Ministerial approval because the transfer involves the issuance of a new licence, which only the Minister has authority to do:\n\nQ. Now, under item (a)(i.1), the act grants the minister authority for the issuance of spectrum licences; correct? You can also see it on the screen.\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. And through the authority to issue licences, the minister has authority over transfer reviews; correct?\n\nA. Yes, he does.\n\nQ. And just so we all understand how transfers work, transfers involve the surrendering of a licence and the issuance of a new licence; correct?\n\nA. Yes, the scheme of the Radiocommunication Act is such that the licence must be issued to the entity that's going to own or operate radio apparatus. To transfer a licence, a licence is revoked with consent from party A and a new licence issued to party B.\n\nQ. So a transfer in spectrum is not like selling typical goods, where two individuals in the private market can just exchange the good freely, without the government being involved; correct?\n\nA. The government must be involved, at a minimum, because, as I've mentioned, party B is to receive a new radio authorisation. Party B must, at minimum, meet the eligibility requirements that are in the regulations, and it's the minister's responsibility to verify that those eligibility requirements have been met.893\n\nDay 3, Tr. 132:7-133:11 (Connolly).\n\n545.\n\nWhile the policy documents repeatedly refer to the required approval of the Minister, they do not contain any assurance that such approval shall be granted where the eligibility criteria of the transferee are fulfilled and the restriction period has expired. Meeting the eligibility criteria is necessary to apply for a license transfer; however, ministerial approval is still required for the transfer to be effective. In this sense, the eligibility requirements stand as an admissibility prerequisite: the Minister need not consider a transfer application that does not meet the prerequisite. GTH ignores the distinction between *admissibility* and *approval* when it argues that such a reading of the Minister's power renders the five-year restriction redundant and of no meaning.894 The COLs leave no doubt that the transfer is predicated on the Minister's approval:\n\nDepartmental approval is required for each proposed transfer of a licence, whether the transfer is in whole or in part. The transferee(s) must *also* provide an attestation and other supporting documentation demonstrating that it meets the eligibility criteria and all other conditions, technical or otherwise, of the licence.895\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 24(b).\n\n**C-010**, Wind Mobile Licenses, pp. 2, 5 (*emphasis added*).\n\n546.\n\nThis is also reflected in the testimony of Mr. Connolly who explained that even if the eligibility criteria were met, the Minister retained discretion to approve or disapprove transfers after five years:\n\nQ. So even if the eligibility criteria were met, the minister retained discretion to approve or disapprove transfers after five years; correct?\n\nA. He did.\n\nQ. Canada also did not make an express or explicit promise or representation that transfers to incumbents would be automatically approved after five years; correct?\n\nA. That is correct. And as I've explained before, it cannot be automatic, because the minister has 25 obligations.896\n\nDay 3, Tr. 168:16-25.\n\n547.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the assertion by GTH that \"the evidence shows that the only express restriction on transfer contained in set-aside spectrum licenses was the 5-year restriction on transfer to an Incumbent.\"897 That assertion, in the terms by GTH, casts light on a fundamental flaw in GTH's case: the five-year restriction on transfer is not *the only* restriction; meeting eligibility criteria and obtaining the Minister's approval of the application for transfer are prerequisites. And neither of those two prerequisites excludes the Minister's ability to take into account spectrum concentration when deciding whether to approve an application for transfer.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 23(d).\n\n548.\n\nGTH has highlighted the statement in the Spectrum Licensing Procedure that spectrum licenses obtained through an auction process enjoy the \"privilege\" of \"enhanced transferability and divisibility rights.\"898 However, the Tribunal has been shown no evidence that enhanced transferability alone guarantees a favourable outcome of the ministerial approval process. As Canada explained, the term \"enhanced transferability\" for auctioned licences meant that a licensee could apply to transfer an unutilised spectrum licence or unutilised parts thereof.899 This is in contrast to non-auctioned licences or radio licences, which could usually only be indivisibly transferred as part of a going concern.900\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 314; **C-003**, Industry Canada, Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services (CPC-2-1-23, Issue 2), September 2007, \u00a7 5.6.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 39, citing **C-003**, Industry Canada, Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services (CPC-2-1-23, Issue 2), September 2007, \u00a7 5.6.\n\nDay 4, Tr. 52:1-55:25 (Hill); Day 4, Tr. 243:13-18 (Stewart).\n\n549.\n\nMore generally, all of the policy documents must be read in the context of the underlying legislative and regulatory regime. In particular, the Radiocommunication Act expressly gives the Minister the power to amend the COLs:\n\ntaking into account all matters that the Minister considers relevant for ensuring the orderly establishment or modification of radio stations and the orderly development and efficient operation of radiocommunication in Canada \u2026 (b) amend the terms and conditions of any licence, certificate or authorization issued under paragraph (a).901\n\n**C-057**, Radiocommunication Act, R.S.C., 1985, \u00a7 5(1).\n\n550.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its reading of the relevant policy documents is consistent with that of Canada's Federal Court in *Telus v. AGC*, which held:\n\n[N]othing in these statements constitutes a statement, or even an implication that, at the end of five years a party may freely, without review or constraint by the Minister, licence or acquire any or all of the set-aside spectrum, nor do any of these statements constitute an undertaking or assurance by the Minister that, after five years, the Minister may decline to exercise discretion to manage the spectrum.902\n\n**R-195**, *Telus v. AGC*, \u00b6 57.\n\n551.\n\nGTH seeks to sidestep this outcome by pointing to internal memoranda circulated within Government agencies purportedly expressing Canada's view that New Entrants were entitled to transfer their set-aside spectrum upon the expiry of the five-year restriction. For example, in one memorandum, a staffer of Industry Canada indicates: \"Incumbents would have to wait five years before being able to acquire a new entrant, either to reduce competition or to acquire spectrum capacity.\"903 The Tribunal notes that this internal memorandum was not available to GTH at the time of the investment so as to permit even the possibility of building a legitimate expectation thereon.904 In any event, the Tribunal finds no persuasive argument prompting it to give priority to an internal memorandum over the explicit terms of the policy documents discussed above. Moreover, the arbitral record contains other contemporaneous internal Government documents that emphasise the cumulative conditions of transferability as stated in the COLs, such as the following:\n\nQ15 \u2013 Could new entrants use a set-aside to flip the spectrum for profit at the expense of taxpayers?\n\nNo. A condition of licence will stipulate that the spectrum acquired under a set-aside cannot be sold to companies that are not eligible for the set-aside, for 5 years following the auction.\n\nThere is nothing automatic about a licence transfer. The transfer of a licence is subject to Ministerial approval.905\n\n**C-308**, **[[** Email from Suzanne Lambert to Pamela Miller, *attaching* Table of AWS Implications **]]**, p. 6.\n\nDay 8, Tr. 230:6-17. The Tribunal need not decide on Canada's submission that, for a representation to give rise to legitimate reliance, it has to have been critical to the investor's decision to invest.\n\n**R-478**, AWS Announcement Questions and Answers, 27 November 2007, p. 17. *See also* the testimony of Mr. Connolly at Day 3, Tr. 168:13-22.\n\n552.\n\nThe Tribunal will next consider GTH's argument that the Minister's previous approvals of transfers of mobile spectrum licences created a precedent as to how he would review transfer applications, resulting in a legitimate expectation that transfers to Incumbents would receive approval if the eligibility criteria and the moratorium expiry prerequisites were met.906 In this regard, Mr. Connolly testified at the Hearing as follows:\n\nQ. Past transfer approvals do not and cannot bind the minister in his or her exercise of discretion over subsequent transfer applications, can they?\n\nA. I don't believe so.907\n\nTwo Incumbents, Telus and Rogers, were each granted approval to purchase New Entrants Clearnet and Microcell who had been issued PCS spectrum licenses. *See* **C-040** and **C-043**, Claimant's Opening Presentation, slide 35.\n\nDay 2, Tr. p. 169:1-4 (Connolly).\n\n553.\n\nIn his Second Witness Statement, Mr. Hill stated:\n\nFurthermore, Telus' acquisition of Clearnet and Rogers' purchase of Microcell are not examples of automatic transferability without Ministerial approval. The Department analyzed each application and provided recommendations to the Minister based on the context and circumstances prevailing at the time. In each case, the Minister exercised his discretion and issued a decision. These administrative decisions, made on a case-by-case basis, do not create precedents regarding future decisions by the Minister. Each decision to approve or deny a licence transfer is based on the particular circumstances of the request. By 2013 and 2014, the conditions prevailing in the wireless telecommunications market were significantly different than the circumstances prevailing a decade earlier when the Clearnet and Microcell licence transfers occurred.908\n\n**RWS-Hill 2**, \u00b6 11.\n\n554.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts this testimony and does not agree with GTH's argument that the Minister's past approvals could create an expectation as to future approvals upon which GTH was entitled to rely.\n\n555.\n\nIn sum, the record makes clear that Canada did not make any representation which could give rise to a legitimate expectation of GTH that it is assured of being permitted to transfer its spectrum licenses to an Incumbent after the expiry of the five-year restriction on transfers. In light of this determination of the Tribunal, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to examine whether GTH's relied, exclusively or not,909 on representations by Canada in reaching its decision in 2008 to invest in Canada. Any assumptions GTH made based on what the market might have expected Canada to do in relation to applications for transfer at the end of the five-year period were made at GTH's own risk; their consequences cannot be imputed to Canada.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 15(b).\n\n556.\n\nFor completeness, however, the Tribunal notes that GTH's own internal documents reveal a gap between what the policy documents provided and what GTH took from those documents. An example is the Private Placement Memorandum,910 an internal, confidential document of Globalive that had not been shared with the Canadian Government before the investment was made.911 That Memorandum only referred to the five-year restriction on the sale of spectrum to an Incumbent; it did not mention the other eligibility conditions required of the transferee or the requirement of ministerial approval set out in the COLs. Another example is the presentation by JP Morgan to Orascom Telecom on 10 April 2008, which indicated that a \"License may not be transferred to incumbent companies for 5 years from issuance,\" but did not mention the other conditions on transfer set out in the auction documents and the underlying statutes.912 GTH's reliance on those reports, which were prepared by its professional advisors on the basis of publicly available auction documents and their underlying rules, was GTH's own business decision for which Canada cannot be faulted.\n\n**C-066**, Email from Mike O'Connor to Assaad Kairouz, et al., 29 February 2008, *attaching* Globalive materials, pp. 62-63. That document was the subject of abundant discussion at the Hearing. *See* Day 8, Tr.163 *et seq.*\n\nDay 8, Tr. 165:6-12 (Madden) (\"You also posed the question, Mr Chairman: did government officials see this contemporaneously? We have checked -- or Globalive counsel have checked as far as they can, and we've also checked with Mr Andrew. There's no evidence that that was provided \u2013 it's a private placement memorandum \u2013 that it was provided to the government.\") Counsel for GTH sought to adduce evidence at the hearing that the Private Placement Memorandum had been submitted to the Government, although only in August 2009. Day 8, Tr.168:18-21 (Madden). In reply to a question from the Tribunal, counsel for GTH submitted: \"No, sir, we do not submit that this amounts to knowledge. This document isn't evidence of knowledge of the Canadian Government, save that it was knowledge by August 2009, in our submission, because it was actually provided to the Government of Canada expressly in response to a request, 'Please provide us with all the documents that you sent to investors to encourage investment'. So as at that date, yes, they had knowledge of this document. But this document, in terms of the period February 2008 leading up to the AWS auction, that was, as it were, a private document.\" Day 8, Tr. 183:25-184:10 (Madden).\n\n**C-072**, JPMorgan, Orascom Telecom \u2013 Canadian Wireless Opportunity, 10 April 2008, p.19.\n\n557.\n\nGTH's misreading of the policy documents is also reflected in the testimony of Mr. Dobbie and Mr. Andrew. Mr. Dobbie stated that \"after the five-year period was up, a New Entrant would be able to sell set-aside spectrum licences to an Incumbent.\"913 Mr. Andrew similarly stated that \"after the 5-year period had expired, a New Entrant would be free to transfer the set-aside spectrum licences to any entity meeting the O&C Rules, including an Incumbent.\"914 Those views are plainly unsupported by the policy documents to which they refer. What those documents permit a New Entrant to do upon the expiry of the five-year transfer restriction is *to apply* for transfer to an entity meeting the eligibility criteria, including an Incumbent, whereupon the Minister will review the application and decide whether to approve that application. Conflating the ability to *apply for a transfer* and the *actual transfer* is an interpretation of the applicable rules that GTH chose to make; Canada cannot be held liable for the consequences of GTH's own choice.\n\n**CWS-Dobbie**, \u00b6 10.\n\n**CWS-Andrew**, \u00b6 8.\n\n558.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that GTH has not established the existence of any legitimate expectation that was violated, in breach of the BIT, by Canada's adoption and implementation of the Transfer Framework.\n\n559.\n\nHad GTH succeeded in evidencing that, after it made its investment based on the terms and undertakings set out in the auction policy documents, Canada had fundamentally altered those policy documents, for example by prolonging the five-year finite restriction on transfer, or by deciding that no set-aside licence may be transferred at all at any time, there could have been an argument that Canada may have breached its obligation pursuant to Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. However, no such evidence was presented to the Tribunal.\n\n560.\n\nIn the next section, the Tribunal will consider GTH's claims of arbitrariness, unreasonableness and lack of transparency.\n\n*Arbitrariness, Unreasonableness and Lack of Transparency*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n561.\n\nIn considering GTH's claim that Canada acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in adopting and implementing the Transfer framework, the Tribunal will have reference to the standard stated by the tribunal in *Crystallex v. Venezuela* that \"a measure is for instance arbitrary if it is not based on legal standards but on excess of discretion, prejudice or personal preference, and taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker.\"915 The Tribunal also accepts GTH's reference to the tests of arbitrariness expressed by Professor Schreuer in his expert opinion in *EDF v. Romania*, including his view that a measure is arbitrary if it \"inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose.\"916\n\n**CL-082**, *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00b6 578.\n\n**RL-205**, *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, \u00b6 303; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\n562.\n\nIn applying the standard, the Tribunal's task is not to second guess the substantive correctness of Canada's regulatory decisions or the policy motivations behind those decisions. The Tribunal considers that deference is due to the competent governmental authorities in the exercise of their mandate. At the same time, this Tribunal agrees with the statement of the Crystallex tribunal that \"deference to the primary decisionmakers cannot be unlimited, as otherwise a host state would be entirely shielded from state responsibility and the standards of protection contained in BITs would be rendered nugatory.\"917\n\n**CL-082**, *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00b6 584.\n\n563.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes, with agreement, that investment tribunals have consistently ruled that, absent an undertaking of the host State to stabilise the regulatory framework in the sector where the investment is made, a change in that framework to reflect the market evolution that is not arbitrary or aimed to harm the investor is not a breach of the FET standard.918\n\n**RL-205**, *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, \u00b6 217 (\"Except where specific promises or representations are made by the State to the investor, the latter may not rely on a bilateral investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes in the host State's legal and economic framework. Such expectation would be neither legitimate nor reasonable\"); **RL-318**, *Charanne B.V. and Construction Investments S.A.R.L. v. The Kingdom of Spain*, SCC Case No. V 062/2012, Final Award (Unofficial English Translation), 21 January 2016, \u00b6 510 (\"However, as stated in previous sections of this award, in the absence of a specific commitment toward stability, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that a regulatory framework such as that at issue in this arbitration is to not be modified at any time to adapt to the needs of the market and to the public interest.\"); **CL-038**, *Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL) Partial Award, 17 March 2006, \u00b6 305 (\"No investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time the investment is made remain totally unchanged. In order to determine whether frustration of the foreign investor's expectations was justified and reasonable, the host State's legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into consideration as well.\"); Respondent's Closing Presentation, slide 127.\n\n564.\n\nThe difficulty for GTH is that, in attempting to establish a breach of the FET standard under the BIT, it has not met its burden of proving that the Transfer Framework was not based on legal standards, reflected an excess of discretion, prejudice or personal preference, or was politically motivated and without any legitimate policy objective.\n\n565.\n\nIn particular, GTH evidenced no fundamental inconsistency with Canada's spectrum management policy objectives or with the objectives of the 2008 AWS Auction. The evidence adduced showed that references to spectrum concentration in the 2013 Transfer Framework that brought Industry Canada to block the transfer of set-aside spectrum licences to Incumbents were essentially adopted to enhance competition. This reflected the change in the market between 2008 and 2012 due to the rising use of smartphones which made it critical for the government to control spectrum concentration.919 While before June 2013, spectrum concentration might not have been conspicuously underscored as a condition for approval of transfer, the rationale for the 2008 AWS Auction was built on the need to avoid concentration by the Incumbents. The Telecommunications Act, a source of Ministerial authority over spectrum management,920 provides \"that the Canadian telecommunications policy has as its objectives [\u2026] (c) to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness, at the national and international levels, of Canadian telecommunications.\"921 In reply to an argument of inconsistency put by GTH,922 the Tribunal does not find any illegitimacy or irrationality in the Canadian Government's considering in 1994 that the market was competitive and introducing ten years later, in 2013, a Transfer Framework to regulate spectrum concentration, given the important evolution in the market that was amply discussed at the Hearing. Wind Mobile's acknowledgment that \"the Government's primary policy objective\" was \"to create, enhance, and sustain competition in the Canadian wireless telecommunications market\" contradicts GTH's argument that the Transfer Framework was politically-motivated, and adopted to \"deflect public criticism\" rather than to advance a legitimate policy objective.923\n\nDay 4, Tr. 118:1-18 (Hill); Day 3, Tr. 153:25-154:18 (Connolly).\n\n**C-052**, Industry Canada, *Spectrum Policy Framework for Canada (DGTP-001-07)*, \u00b6 3.1 (\"The Minister of Industry, through the Department of Industry Act, the Radiocommunication Act and the Radiocommunication Regulations, with due regard to the objectives of the Telecommunications Act, is responsible for spectrum management in Canada.

(\"WIND\"), 3 April 2013, \u00b6 2.\n\n566.\n\nAccordingly, and contrary to GTH's contention, the Tribunal does not see in the adduced evidence a fundamental change in the 2013 Transfer Framework, but rather different wording of the same policy that had been the consistent rationale for the AWS Auction since its inception. Moreover, the discretionary authority of the Minister to approve transfer applications, omnipresent in the AWS Auction policy documents, never excluded spectrum concentration as one of the criteria for approval.\n\n567.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Parties debated the evidentiary impact of certain internal advice to the Minister not referring to spectrum concentration as a specific criterion in the outcome of the transfer review process.924 The Tribunal finds in that debate no grounds permitting it to infer a limitation of the Minister's discretion to consider other factors as would be consistent with the objectives of the Radiocommunication Act and Telecommunications Act in reviewing licence transfers, as that discretion had been indicated in the COLs.\n\n**C-261**, Memorandum from John Knubley and Marta Morgan to Minister of Industry, *Approach to Mobile Spectrum Licence Transfer Requests*, *attaching* Annex A: Main Holders of AWS Set-Aside Spectrum, 27 December 2012; **C-262**, Memorandum from John Knubley and Marta Morgan to Minister of Industry, *Approach to Mobile Spectrum Licence Transfers \u2013 Briefing Material*, *attaching* Annex A: Wireless Telecommunications Sector: Update and Implications and Annex B: Industry Canada, *Approach to Mobile Spectrum Licence Transfers*, January 2013; Day 3, Tr. 154:5-25 (Connolly); Day 4, Tr. 134:14-135:12 (Hill); Day 5, Tr. 17:24-19:18 (Stewart) (testifying that \"The minister's discretion is unbounded.

In considering **C-262**, the Tribunal also reviewed **C-468** later adduced by GTH and admitted into the evidential record pursuant to PO10.\n\n568.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal considers that neither the terms of the licences nor the statutes that underlie those licences can be read as committing Canada to freeze its telecom regulatory framework. Specifically, the Radiocommunication Act provides the Minister with authority, albeit on an exceptional basis and only after consultation,925 to \"amend the terms and conditions of any licence, certificate or authorization issued paragraph (a).\"926 The COLs, one of the main documents on which GTH rests its claim of legitimate expectations,927 refer to the Radiocommunication Act and make it binding on the spectrum licensee.928\n\n**C-003**, Industry Canada, Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services (CPC-2-1-23, Issue 2), September 2007, \u00a7 5.3.\n\n**C-057**, Radiocommunication Act, R.S.C., 1985, \u00a7 5(1)(b).\n\n**C-465**, **[[** Claimant's Closing Presentation **]]**, p. 8.\n\n**C-010**, Wind Mobile Licenses, headings and \u00b6 7.\n\n569.\n\nGTH has also asserted that Canada's actions breached the FET standard because they lacked transparency. In its Closing Presentation, GTH advanced two arguments in this regard:\n\nFirst, assuming Canada's assertion regarding Canada's intended meaning of the transferability of licenses is correct, Canada failed to ensure that GTH understood that \"*undue spectrum concentration*\" would be used to prevent GTH's ability to sell its investment. [\u2026]\n\nSecond, assuming Canada's assertion regarding Canada's intended meaning of the transferability of licenses is correct, Canada failed to clarify to GTH the meaning of this provision when it became aware of GTH's understanding in August 2009.929\n\n**C-465**, Claimant's Closing Presentation, slides 69-70.\n\n570.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Canada's explicitly stated prerequisites for spectrum transferability, including competition policy considerations that may be considered by the Minister in the approval process, satisfy any transparency requirement that might arise under the FET obligation. The Tribunal finds no ground in the BIT, including in the principles of international law against which the FET standard is to be assessed pursuant to Article II(2)(a), to warrant additionally to ascribe Canada to a duty to correct potential misunderstandings of the applicable rules that the investor, GTH, competently counselled throughout the investment process, has chosen to infer.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n571.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal dismisses GTH's claim that Canada violated Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by denying GTH the ability to transfer the set-aside spectrum licenses to an Incumbent after expiry of the five-year transfer restriction period. GTH has not established that Canada frustrated GTH's legitimate expectations, or that Canada subjected GTH treatment that was arbitrary, unreasonable, non-transparent, politically motivated or without any legitimate policy objective.\n\n572.\n\nIn light of that conclusion, the Tribunal decides that it is unnecessary also to review Canada's defense on the standing of GTH to bring this claim, allegedly because only Wind Mobile (the license holder) could assert its entitlement to legitimate expectations.\n\n**(4) Whether Canada Breached its Fair and Equitable Treatment Obligation by Conducting the National Security Review and Preventing** [REDACTED]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na.

According to GTH, tribunals have found that State conduct in the name of national security concerns may violate the FET standard, particularly where other motives were involved or there were alternative means of addressing the State's concerns that would not have conflicted with the FET obligation.933 GTH submits that \"[i]n these circumstances, once an investor has made a *prima facie* case that there has been a breach, the burden shifts to the respondent to rebut this case,\" which is especially important where the relevant documents are held by the State.934\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

For example, Canada refers to the award in *Devas v. India*, which states:\n\nAn arbitral tribunal may not sit in judgment on national security matters as on any other factual dispute arising between an investor and a State. National security issues relate to the existential core of a State.

The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n599.\n\nGTH claims that Canada violated its FET obligation by subjecting GTH to an arbitrary national security review and [REDACTED] Specifically, GTH alleges that Canada failed to provide (a) transparency and due process, and (b) non-arbitrary and consistent treatment. The Tribunal has discussed the relevant legal standards above.1025\n\n*See* Sections VII.A(2) and VII.A(3)(c)(ii) above.\n\n600.\n\nGTH offered in its Opening Presentation at the Hearing a helpful outline of the events surrounding the national security review of GTH's Voting Control Application. It is copied below.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n601.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes a marked difference between the national security review-related claim advanced by GTH and its other claim in relation to the transferability of set-aside AWS licences. In relation to the national security review, it is undisputed that GTH had been put on notice in the 2008 AWS Auction documents of the requirement that an acquisition of control by a non-Canadian of an investment of the type GTH made in Wind Mobile in the Canadian wireless market is subject to the restrictions set out in the O&C Rules and to a confidential review for determination by the Minister of whether that acquisition of control would be of net benefit to Canada.1026 To that end, the AWS Auction Consultation Paper provided:\n\n2.5.1 Foreign Investment Restrictions\n\nCanadian ownership and control requirements impose certain restrictions on foreign investment in facilities-based telecommunications carriers in Canada including wireless carriers. The spectrum considered in this consultation process will eventually be licensed under the Radiocommunication Act subject to Canadian ownership and control requirements and therefore subject to foreign investment restrictions. Foreign investment restrictions have the effect of limiting potential entry in the telecommunications market thereby reducing the competitive discipline that the threat of entry can provide. It is important to consider the effect this may have on the free operation of the market and the ability to rely solely on market forces in the forthcoming auction.1027\n\n**R-169**, Investment Canada Act (29 June 2012 \u2013 25 June 2013), \u00a7 16; **C-144**, Letter from W. VanderBurgh to M.J. Thivierge, 22 January 2013, p. 3.\n\n**C-050**, AWS Auction Consultation Paper, \u00b6 2.5.1.\n\n602.\n\nSimilarly, the restrictions on foreign investment in the Canadian wireless market was underscored in the 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework:\n\nIn addition to access to spectrum, a consideration particular to the Canadian wireless market is the presence of Canadian ownership requirements under the *Telecommunications Act* which apply to all facilities-based carriers. These requirements ensure that Canada's telecommunications infrastructure is owned and controlled by Canadians. However they also act as restrictions on foreign investment which constitutes a barrier to market entry. The question of foreign ownership restrictions is being studied by the Competition Policy Review Panel. Removal or liberalization of these requirements would require legislative changes.1028\n\n**C-004**, 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, p. 3\n\n603.\n\nThe conclusion is therefore unescapable that GTH had all the means to know, at the time of making its investment, that the ownership of a Canadian wireless business was subject to foreign investment restrictions. Importantly, GTH had also been given contemporaneous knowledge that any change in those restrictions would require an amendment to the laws, not merely administrative tolerance or the exercise of the Minister's discretion.\n\n604.\n\nTo the extent that GTH acted upon the assumption that \"there was a policy movement in Canada towards a relaxation of the O&C Rules which would allow a foreign company like GTH to take control of its investment in Wind Mobile,\" as Mr. Dobbie testified, that assumption reflects the degree of risk that GTH was willing to take on when deciding to invest in Canada.1029 Indeed, that assumption proved correct: Canada did eventually relax the O&C Rules as expected.\n\n**CWS-Dobbie**, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 21.\n\n605.\n\nHowever, the change in the O&C Rules did not guarantee that GTH would be permitted to take control of Wind Mobile, or that its attempt to do so would be exempt from review under the ICA. [REDACTED]\n\n606.\n\nSimilarly, the applicability of the ICA was unaffected by the fact that GTH structured its \"investment in a way that would give GTH the right to take control if the O&C Rules changed.\"1031 GTH may have had such a right in the relevant corporate documents, but that contractual right does not supersede applicable Canadian law.\n\n*Ibid.* ; Claimant's Opening Presentation, slide 72, citing **C-084**, Declaration of Ownership and Control of Globalive Wireless LP as a Provisional Winner of Spectrum Licences in the 2 GHz Range Including AWS, PCS and the Band 1670-1675 MHz, 5 August 2008, pp. 80 (Shareholders' Agreements, 31 July 2008, p. 20), 134 (Shareholders' Agreements, 31 July 2008, Schedule C, p. 4), 163 (Articles of Amendment, 30 July 2008, p. 1f).\n\n607.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is not the Tribunal's role to assess [REDACTED] To properly consider GTH's claims, the Tribunal need only consider how that process was conducted.\n\n608.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal will address GTH's allegation that the process was not transparent. Assessing the proper standard of transparency in relation to acts of government requires taking into account the sensitivity of the information at issue. In a national security review, it is understandable that intelligence agencies might conduct investigations before informing the targeted persons, or that information requests might not state the reasons therefor in full detail. The Tribunal considers that due process standard should be deemed satisfied where the subject of the investigation is afforded a fair opportunity to make its case in relation to readily identifiable issues, and that opportunity is afforded reasonably ahead of an administrative decision being made based on objectively verifiable factors and after an appropriate time period which is not unnecessarily rushed. The Tribunal will apply this standard to the relevant facts surrounding the national security review, which are largely uncontested.\n\n609.\n\nThe background to the purpose of the ICA review of foreign investments can be found in the witness statement of Ms. Aitken, the Director of IRD at the relevant time:\n\nThe ICA is the primary mechanism for reviewing foreign investments in Canada. It contemplates the review of significant investments by non-Canadians to determine whether they are likely to be of net benefit to Canada and it provides a mechanism for the review of investments by non-Canadians that could be injurious to national security. [\u2026]\n\nUnder the ICA, the Minister is responsible for determining whether direct investments by non-Canadians in non-cultural Canadian businesses are likely to be of net benefit to Canada. A non-Canadian seeking to acquire control of an established Canadian business valued at or above a certain threshold must apply for review of that acquisition, which entails an assessment by the Minister of whether or not the investment is likely to be of net benefit to Canada.1032\n\n**RWS-Aitken**, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. In her evidence, Ms. Aitken indicated that in 2012, a foreign investment was subject to review if the book value of the assets used in carrying on the Canadian business being acquired was equal to or exceeded CAD 330 million.\n\n610.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n611.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n612.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence in the arbitral record, the Tribunal considers that Canada provided GTH with an adequate opportunity to make its case in relation to the regulatory and the national security reviews under the ICA, and that GTH engaged fully in that exchange. [REDACTED] contradicts GTH's allegations that it was \"completely left in the dark,\"1039 and \"not given any information that would enable it to defend itself or address the Government's concerns,\"1040 which form the basis of GTH's claim of denial of due process and un-transparent conduct in violation of Canada's FET obligation.\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 300.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 303.\n\n613.\n\nThe remaining claim advanced by GTH is that \"Canada's national security review was without any legitimate basis and was, therefore, arbitrary and unreasonable, in breach of Canada's FET obligation.\"1041 [REDACTED]\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 314.\n\n614.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n615.\n\nMore generally, as Canada rightly submits:\n\nNational security concerns are not static, they evolve over time as the nature of security threats change, new intelligence is gathered and the assessment of these risks reviewed. An assessment of the same facts may lead to a different conclusion with respect to the concerns they raise depending on other available information and the surrounding circumstances.1045\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 58, *citing* Day 5, Tr. 309:11-310:1 (Aitken); **RWS-Aitken**, \u00b6 38.\n\n616.\n\n[REDACTED] The Tribunal considers that evidence as satisfactorily demonstrating genuine national security concerns assessed by the competent authorities. As a result, GTH's claims that Canada's actions were unreasonable and arbitrary are dismissed.\n\n617.\n\nTo be complete, the Tribunal has reviewed GTH's claim that Canada misused the national security review of its Voting Control Application in order to further Canada's telecommunication policy objectives.1050 The evidence on the record does not support GTH's arguments. The evidentiary record shows that national security concerns assessed by the competent Canadian security and intelligence authorities prompted the ICA review.1051 Alleging, as GTH does,1052 that the purpose of conducting a national security review in this case was to advance telecommunication policy objectives of Canada or to allow time to implement the Transfer Framework is a serious matter, akin to alleging a conspiracy. Yet, GTH fails to meet the evidentiary burden of establishing its allegation. The claim must be dismissed.\n\nClaimant's Opening Presentation, slide 82.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nDay 1, Tr. 75: 3-10 (\"So if we could turn to slide 82, which is a memo to the minister on 9th May (C-275), it couldn't be clearer that Canada was using the national security review to probe for information on whether GTH was intending to sell to an incumbent. It stated in terms that the national security review was being used to influence the outcome of GTH's investment in Wind Canada, in furtherance of its 'fourth player' strategy\").\n\n618.\n\nWithout it affecting the findings of the Tribunal set out above, [REDACTED] it is understandable that a prudent investor may well decide that it is time to put an end to the significant sums that it was compelled to pour into the investment given the cash-intensive requirements of this economic field.1056 Harsh as it might be, such is the reality of business with its potential for windfall profit or for abysmal loss. In any event, it cannot turn into a ground to rule that Canada has breached the BIT by its conduct of the national security review of GTH's application to take control of Wind Mobile.\n\n**CWS-Dry**, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 29 (referring to GTH having \"already invested well over CAD 1 billion\") and having to decide whether to \"commit to a potential further investment of as much as CAD 230 million to participate in the auction.\").\n\n**(5) Whether the Measures Cumulatively Breached the Respondent's Fair and Equitable Treatment Obligation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. GTH's Position\n-----------------\n\n619.\n\nGTH submits that Canada's pattern of treatment of GTH's investment following the 2008 AWS Auction until the sale of Wind Mobile in September 2014, taken together, cumulatively breached Article II(2)(a).1057\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 361 *et seq.* ; Merits Reply and Jur.

Argentina*, in which the tribunal held that Argentina had breached the FET standard through a series of measures that contributed to claimants selling their investment at a loss.1060 The *El Paso* tribunal viewed Argentina's measures \"as cumulative steps which individually do not qualify as violations of FET, \u2026 but which amount to a violation if their cumulative effect is considered,\" and noted that the \"combination of all these measures completely altered the overall framework.\"1061\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

Canada implemented the exact conditions of licences it had announced, and GTH cannot now challenge the effectiveness of those conditions.1100\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur.

For Canada, there is nothing surprising or wrong with different State entities (like Industry Canada, the CRTC and the Competition Bureau) acting within their respective mandates and legal authority to arrive at different conclusions.1108 In any event, Canada argues that its policy objective to increase competition in the telecommunications sector \"remained consistent\" during the life of GTH's investment, even if \"the measures that were considered necessary to achieve it evolved in response to changing circumstances.\"1109\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur.

The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n641.\n\nIn determining the legal standard for a composite/cumulative breach, this Tribunal does not apply to its review of the evidence a threshold requirement that all of the alleged acts must be unified by a common purpose of malicious intent by the State as pleaded by Canada.1110 In line with the standard set by the *Tecmed* tribunal, the Tribunal considers that while the acts or omissions must be something more than a routine exercise of legitimate governmental powers, it is sufficient that:\n\nThe common thread weaving together each act or omission into a single conduct attributable to the Respondent is not a subjective element or intent, but a converging action towards the same result, i.e. depriving the investor of its investment, thereby violating the Agreement.1111\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 320.\n\n**CL-031**, *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, \u00b6 62.\n\n642.\n\nThe success of GTH's claim depends therefore on its ability to establish, as a matter of fact, whether the various acts it cites converge toward the same result and, if so, whether those acts taken together amount to a breach of FET.\n\n643.\n\nAfter reviewing the acts by Canada that, according to GTH, together amount to a breach of FET, the Tribunal does not find sufficient evidence to establish cumulative or composite breach by Canada of its obligations under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.\n\n644.\n\nTaking in turn each of Canada's acts listed by GTH in this head of claim,1112 the Tribunal finds that the evidence shows different mandates for Industry Canada and the CRTC, so that their acts cannot be deemed to be duplicative or repetitive.1113 Each of those agencies of the Government acted within its respective authority in conducting separate reviews of Wind Mobile's corporate structure and reached a decision concerning the particular agency's own field of competence.1114 Each review was a legitimate exercise of a regulatory power. No inference or breach of the FET standard may be drawn from the sole fact that the outcome of those reviews was not identical.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that GTH does not claim that the roaming/tower sharing or the CRTC/ICA O&C reviews *on their own* constitute a breach of FET, because they fall outside the three-year time bar. *See*, *e.g.*, Jur. Memorial \u00b6 56 (\"GTH does not contend that the alleged facts outside the three-year period led to a discrete breach (or multiple breaches)\"); Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 74.\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 325.\n\nDay 3, Tr. 169:11-15 (Connolly) (\"Q. And Industry Canada's review of the ownership and control rules was not determinative of the CRTC's ownership and control analysis; correct? A. That is correct. The CRTC makes an independent decision on the same matter.\").\n\n645.\n\nThe Tribunal holds the same view as concerns the allegation of inconsistency between the CRTC's decision in 1994 to forbear from regulating wireless telecommunications services following its determination that \"competition was sufficient to protect the interests of users\"1115 and Industry Canada's decision to take into account spectrum concentration in the Minister's approval of applications for transfer, as set forth in the Transfer Framework in 2013. The different scope and purpose underlying each of those decisions excludes that inferences of inconsistency be drawn merely from the fact that they did not yield identical outcomes. Moreover, the Tribunal has previously found in this Award that there is no evidence that Canada has fundamentally changed its transferability of spectrum rules so as to frustrate GTH's legitimate expectations.1116\n\nIn accordance with section 34(2) of the Telecommunications Act. **C-046**, Telecommunications Act, \u00a7 34 (2). *See* Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 326.\n\n*See* Section VII.A(3) above.\n\n646.\n\nAs to whether the Canadian Government should have intervened in the wireless market to require Incumbents to offer more reasonable terms to Wind Mobile in relation to tower and site sharing, GTH fails to establish the statutory grounds on which the Government could have interfered in the Incumbents' rights to negotiate advantageous business deals with New Entrants. Importantly, the evidence adduced by Canada shows that the CEO of Wind Mobile, Mr. Campbell, considered the terms of the national roaming agreement agreed with Rogers, an Incumbent, as being \"reasonable.\"1117 While he described the prices agreed with Rogers as being \"slightly higher than some benchmarks,\" he expressed his belief that \"we can pass through to consumers with a small mark up if necessary.\"1118 As one would expect of a prudent business decision-maker, he considered the roaming agreement globally and identified advantages that outweighed the price, namely that \"it allows us to ensure that our proposition does not suffer from an 'inferior coverage' perspective.\"1119 It is difficult to see how this contemporaneous evidence from the person who was at the helm of GTH's investment in Canada is consistent with GTH's subsequent claim that Wind Mobile failed to obtain the reasonable commercial rates it was expecting, as a result of Canada's failed policy.1120 Nothing on the evidential record warrants an expectation that the Canadian telecom regulator would interfere in the wireless market to tip in favour of the New Entrant the balance of business dealings negotiated at arm's length amongst professionals, specialists of the relevant sector. This was well summarised at the Hearing by Industry Canada's then Director General of the Spectrum Management Operations Branch, Mr. Peter Hill, who testified that:\n\nwhere a specific issue was brought to our attention, we acted immediately. Where a general issue was brought to our attention, such as \"They're really being not nice\", it would be very -- it's impossible for me to act on that. But we got a lot of those.1121\n\n**R-601**, **[[** Email from Ken Campbell to Wafaa Lotaief and David Dobbie, *attaching* Wind, *WIND Mobile, Management Presentation*, December 9, 2010 **]]**, p. 5.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 149.\n\nDay 4, Tr. 179:11-180:1.\n\n647.\n\nAs to the rest of Canada's acts listed by GTH under this head of claim, the Tribunal need not repeat its findings already made in this Award motivating its dismissal of GTH's claims of [REDACTED] or refusal by Canada to permit automatic transfer of the set aside licences upon the expiry of the restriction period.1122 The important point is that all these acts, when viewed cumulatively, do not establish the \"common thread\" that GTH allege to amount to a composite breach of Canada's obligations to accord FET to GTH's investment.1123 GTH's claim in relation to the totality of the measures taken by Canada breaching the FET treatment obligation is therefore dismissed.\n\n*See* Section VII.A(3) and (4) above.\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 325.\n\n**(6) Conclusion on Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n648.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal holds that GTH has failed to establish that Canada breached Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. Each of GTH's FET claims is therefore dismissed.\n\n**B. FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY**\n-----------------------------------\n\n649.\n\nGTH submits that Canada has breached its obligation to provide full protection and security (\"**FPS**\") under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT because the Government's \"cumulative action (and inaction) towards GTH's investment threatened the commercial and legal security of GTH's investment.\"1124\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 379.\n\n650.\n\nCanada submits that this claim must be rejected because the FPS obligation concerns only physical protection and, in any event, GTH has failed to prove its factual allegations.\n\n651.\n\nIn the following Sections, the Tribunal first recalls the relevant provision of the BIT, then addresses the applicable legal standard, and then considers whether GTH has established a breach of the FPS standard under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.\n\n**(1) Relevant Provision of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------\n\n652.\n\nCanada's obligation to provide FPS is set forth in Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, which states:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall accord investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party [\u2026] full protection and security.1125\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English Version), Article II(2)(b).\n\n**(2) Applicable Legal Standard**\n---------------------------------\n\na. GTH's Position\n-----------------\n\n653.\n\nGTH's position is that Article II(2)(b) constitutes a \"positive obligation on the State to create and maintain a commercial and legal framework that ensures the security of investments and protects investments from the adverse actions of third parties or State organs.\"1126 While GTH acknowledges that this provision does not reflect a strict liability standard, it argues that the host State must exercise vigilance and due diligence and \"take all reasonable measures to protect the investor against harm.\"1127 GTH cites Professor Schreuer's description of the FPS obligation:\n\n[B]y assuming the obligation of full protection and security the host State promises to provide a factual and legal framework that grants security and to take the measures necessary to protect the investment against adverse action by private persons as well as State organs. In particular, this requires the creation of legal remedies against adverse action affecting the investment and the creation of mechanisms for the effective vindication of investors' rights.1128\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 376; *see* Merits Reply and Jur.

Canada's Position\n--------------------\n\n657.\n\nCanada argues that GTH's interpretation of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT improperly \"equates the standard with an open-ended guarantee of commercial and legal security,\" which is not supported by the text of the BIT or by previous arbitral decisions.1136\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur.

According to Canada, this interpretation is consistent with Article 31 of the VCLT.1137 Canada looks to the Oxford Dictionary to find the ordinary meaning of the terms \"protection\" and \"security\" and concludes that \"the phrase 'protection and security' refers to safety from physical harm, injury, or impairment.\"1138 Further, Canada argues that the \"object and purpose of the FPS standard likewise point to physical safety.\" As observed by several tribunals, the standard was \"developed in the context of physical protection and security of the company's officials, employees or facilities.\"1139\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 461-462.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 462; **RL-209**, *English Oxford Living Dictionaries* online.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 463, *quoting* **RL-188**, *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v.

The *Siemens* tribunal noted that the word \"security\" in the FPS clause it was considering was modified by the word \"legal,\" and in the treaty at issue in *National Grid*, the reference to \"full protection and security\" was followed by broad language not found in the BIT.1147\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 469; **CL-026**, *American Manufacturing & Trading, Inc. v.

The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n662.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the FPS standard is independent of the FET standard. The separate head of treaty-based claim submitted by GTH in relation to the FPS standard reflects the drafting of each standard in a separate provision in the BIT, with the FET standard provided in Article II(2)(a) and the FPS standard in Article II(2)(b).\n\n663.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute either that the FPS standard covers the obligation of the host State to accord physical protection to the investor, its investments and the investors' returns. However, they disagree on whether the FPS duty arising under the BIT reaches beyond physical protection also to include commercial and legal protection of the investment and the investor's returns.1150\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 378.\n\n664.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the terms of the BIT in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT and in light of the authorities adduced by the Parties, and has noted that the terms \"protection\" and \"security\" in Article II(2)(b) are qualified by \"full\" without any exclusion or limitation. The Tribunal therefore agrees with GTH that the standard of \"full protection and security\" as set in the BIT is not limited to safeguards against physical interference by State organs and private persons, but extends to accord legal safeguard for the investment and the returns of the investor. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the decisions of several previous investment tribunals. For example, in *CME v. Czech Republic*, the tribunal ruled that \"[t]he host State is obligated to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor's investment withdrawn or devalued.\"1151 In *CSOB v. Slovakia*, the tribunal held:\n\nThe Slovak Republic's denial of CSOB's title to request from the Slovak Republic that SI's losses are covered would deprive CSOB from any meaningful protection for its loan and thus breach the Slovak Republic's commitment to let CSOB 'enjoy full protection and security' as stated in Article 2(2) BIT.1152\n\n**CL-030**, *CME Czech Republic B.V.

The Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Award, 29 December 2004, \u00b6 170.\n\n665.\n\nThe tribunal in *Azurix v. Argentina* was particularly explicit in holding that \"full protection and security was understood to go beyond protection and security ensured by the police. It is not only a matter of physical security; the stability afforded by a secure investment environment is as important from an investor's point of view.\"1153 In upholding the same rule, the tribunal in *Siemens v. Argentina* drew additional authority from the fact that the relevant treaty, like the BIT in this arbitration, defined \"investment\" as applying also to intangible assets in relation to which \"physical\" security is difficult to apprehend, ruling:\n\nAs a general matter and based on the definition of investment, which includes tangible and intangible assets, the Tribunal considers that the obligation to provide full protection and security is wider than 'physical' protection and security. It is difficult to understand how the physical security of an intangible asset would be achieved.1154\n\n**CL-039**, *Azurix Corp. v.

No such attempt was made in the BIT. The investors are therefore entitled to the full extent of the unqualified assurance of full protection and security that each of the two Contracting States has committed in Article II(2)(b) to accord investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting State.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 467 and the treaties therein cited by Canada as examples.\n\n667.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal notes that both Parties agree that the obligation of the host State to accord FPS does not create a strict liability that would dispense with the need for a claimant to prove that the alleged injury was attributable to the State or its agents.1156 As stated by the ICJ in the *ELSI* case:\n\nThe reference... to the provision of 'constant protection and security' cannot be construed as the giving of a warranty that property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or disturbed.1157\n\n*See* Merits Memorial, \u00b6 376.\n\n**RL-186**, *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.

GTH's Position\n-----------------\n\n669.\n\nGTH submits that Canada has breached its FPS obligation in several ways.1159 According to GTH, Canada not only failed to protect GTH's investment from harm, but was in fact the \"main culprit\" that knowingly caused the damage.1160\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 379-381; Merits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 337-341.\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 337.\n\n670.\n\nSpecifically, GTH alleges that Canada breached its FPS obligation in the following ways:\n\na. Canada subjected GTH to an opaque, arbitrary national security review, during which Canada failed to inform GTH of any serious charges and did not provide GTH a meaningful opportunity to respond.1161\n\nb. Canada \"introduced significant uncertainty to the security of GTH's investment and the future of Wind Mobile\" by conducting the national security review in a prolonged, non-transparent way.1162\n\nc. Canada introduced further legal insecurity for GTH and Wind Mobile when it introduced the Transfer Framework, thereby changing a key component of the conditions of the spectrum licenses.1163\n\nd. Canada's acts, when viewed cumulatively, dismantled the regulatory framework that Canada had designed to induce GTH to invest in the Canadian market, and thereby \"destroyed the legal security of GTH's investment.\"1164\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 186; Merits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 338.\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 77, 338.\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 340.\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 341.\n\nb. Canada's Position\n--------------------\n\n671.\n\nCanada argues that GTH's FPS claim must fail because GTH has not alleged that its investment suffered any physical harm.1165\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 458, 473, 480.\n\n672.\n\nFurther, even if the Tribunal disagrees with Canada's interpretation of Article II(2)(b), Canada's position is that GTH has failed to establish a breach of the FPS standard. In this regard, Canada asserts that GTH's allegations relating to FPS \"are essentially based on the same mischaracterizations as the allegations of breach of the FET standard.\"1166 Therefore, Canada refers to its submissions in connection with GTH's FET claim.1167\n\nMerits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 332.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 478, 479; Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 332.\n\n673.\n\nCanada also raises the following arguments:\n\na. Contrary to GTH's position, the Transfer Framework did not fundamentally change or \"effectively dismantle\" the legal framework applicable to Wind Mobile's spectrum licences. Rather, the Transfer Framework clarified how the Minister would exercise his existing discretion in relation to spectrum license transfers.1168\n\nb. GTH was well aware of the national security provisions of the ICA when it submitted the Voting Control Application, and therefore cannot argue that the national security review deprived its investment of the legal protection and security to which it was entitled. [REDACTED] and ensured that GTH was accorded due process throughout the process.1169\n\nc. There is no justification for GTH's arguments that various distinct measures should be considered cumulatively to amount to a composite breach of FPS. In addition, GTH's complaints about the mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing conditions are based on a mischaracterization of events.1170\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 475. Canada argues that, unlike the situation in *CME v. Czech Republic*, there is no allegation in this case that Canada, through the Transfer Framework, interfered with contractual relationships that formed the basis of GTH's investment. **CL-030**, *CME Czech Republic B.V. (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL) Partial Award, 13 September 2001, \u00b6 427.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 478; Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 332(ii).\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 440; Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, \u00b6 332(iii).\n\n674.\n\nThus, Canada concludes that GTH's claim under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT must be rejected.\n\nc. The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n675.\n\nThe Tribunal has already noted that the standards of FET and of FPS are distinct, as indicated by the fact that they are set out in two different provisions of the BIT.1171 It follows that the host State is subject to different obligations under each of those standards, even if in certain situations those obligations might overlap. However, the Tribunal can only decide on whether the State has satisfied its FPS-based obligation of exercising due diligence by examining the specific facts averred by the Parties. To that end, the Tribunal notes that the facts averred by GTH in support of its claim of breach of FPS are the same facts that GTH had previously invoked in support of its claim of breach of FET. As Canada notes, GTH does not advance new allegations.1172 This is particularly the case as concerns the allegation that Canada undertook an opaque and arbitrary national security review of GTH's Voting Control Application, and the allegation that the introduction of the Transfer Framework fundamentally changed the terms of Wind Mobile's spectrum licences.\n\n*See* \u00b6 663 above.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 332.\n\n676.\n\nConsidering the above, the main factual findings set out by the Tribunal earlier in this Award are relevant to GTH's FPS claim. In particular:\n\na. The introduction of the Transfer Framework in 2013 was not inconsistent with the policy documents shared with GTH in advance of the 2008 AWS Auction, and did not amount to fundamentally change the terms of GTH's spectrum licenses.\n\nb. There is no evidence that the national security review of GTH's Voting Control Application was pretextual, or that Canada failed to provide GTH with sufficient information to respond to Canada's concerns.\n\nc. Thus, neither the national security review of GTH's Voting Control Application nor the Transfer Framework constitutes arbitrary, inconsistent or opaque treatment of GTH's investment.\n\nd. GTH has not established its claim that Canada committed a series of acts, including the national security review and the Transfer Framework, that can be viewed together as a composite act depriving GTH of its investment.\n\n677.\n\nApplying these findings to GTH's FPS claim, it becomes clear that there is no basis in the evidential record before this Tribunal to determine that Canada has failed to exercise \"due diligence\" with respect to the protection of GTH's investment. The Tribunal must therefore dismiss GTH's FPS claim.\n\n678.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal notes that it has considered each of GTH's allegations in the specific context of the FPS standard set forth above, and is not simply repeating its determination on GTH's FET claims.\n\n679.\n\nThe Tribunal's determination earlier in this Award that neither the national security review nor the introduction of the Transfer Framework and its alleged impact on the transferability of the set-aside licenses to incumbents, whether viewed separately or cumulatively, constitutes arbitrary, inconsistent or opaque acts of Canada applies *mutatis mutandis* in relation to GTH's claim of breach of the FPS standards and leads to its dismissal.\n\n680.\n\nIn so deciding, the Tribunal is neither applying the FET standard in reviewing the facts alleged by GTH in support of its FPS claim nor conflating the two separate BIT standards. The Tribunal reviewed each claim separately in accordance with its own ascribed standard. The Tribunal has found the following:\n\na. The State had no duty to interfere in the negotiation between the New Entrants and the Incumbents in relation to roaming and tower sharing.1173\n\nb. The reviews by the competent Canadian authorities of Wind Mobile's shareholder structure leading to different outcomes were conducted by separate government entities, each acting properly within its mandate.1174\n\nc. The national security review of GTH Voting Control Application was conducted, in its duration, scope and modalities, in the respect of the investor's fundamental right to due process, [REDACTED].1175\n\nd. GTH failed to establish that Canada has fundamentally changed the transferability terms of the set-aside spectrum licences, where Canada had essentially clarified the relevance of weighing spectrum concentration in the exercise by the Minister of his discretion in reviewing an application for transfer to an Incumbent.1176\n\n*See* Section VII.A(5) above.\n\n*See* Section VII.A(5) above.\n\n*See* Section VII.A(4) above.\n\n*See* Section VII.A(3) above.\n\n681.\n\nIt follows that the State's conduct was consistent with the statutes and regulations made available to the investor at the time of the investment, and cannot amount to a breach of the FPS standard under the BIT, just as it did not amount to a breach of the FET standard under that BIT.\n\n**(4) Conclusion on Full Protection and Security**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n682.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal dismisses GTH's claim that Canada has breached Article II(2)(b) of the BIT by failing to provide GTH's investment full protection and security.\n\n**C. NATIONAL TREATMENT**\n-------------------------\n\n683.\n\nThe Tribunal has ruled earlier in this Award that it has no jurisdiction to determine GTH's claim that Canada breached its obligation to provide national treatment protection to GTH under Article IV(1) of the BIT.1177\n\n*See* Section VI.D(4) above.\n\n**D. GUARANTEE OF UNRESTRICTED TRANSFER OF INVESTMENTS**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n684.\n\nGTH's final claim is that Canada breached its obligation to guarantee the unrestricted transfer of investments under Article IX(1) of the BIT by blocking GTH from transferring Wind Mobile's licenses to an Incumbent, which Canada denies.\n\n685.\n\nIn the following Sections, the Tribunal reproduces the relevant BIT provision, summarizes the Parties submissions, and then sets out its analysis and conclusion in relation to this claim.\n\n**(1) Relevant Provision of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------\n\n686.\n\nArticle IX(1) of the BIT, under the heading \"Transfer of Funds,\" provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall guarantee to an investor of the other Contracting Party the unrestricted transfer of investments and returns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Contracting Party shall also guarantee to the investor the unrestricted transfer of:\n\n(a) funds in repayment of loans related to an investment;\n\n(b) the proceeds of the total or partial liquidation of any investment;\n\n(c) wages and other remuneration accruing to a citizen of the other Contracting Party who was permitted to work in connection with an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party;\n\n(d) any compensation owed to an investor by virtue of Articles VII or VIII of the Agreement.1178\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English Version), Article IX(1).\n\n687.\n\nCanada also refers to paragraphs (2) and (3) of Article IX, which state:\n\n2. Transfers shall be effected without delay in the convertible currency in which the capital was originally invested or in any other convertible currency agreed by the investor and the Contracting Party concerned. Unless otherwise agreed by the investor, transfers shall be made at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer.1179\n\n3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Contracting Party may prevent a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to:\n\n(a) bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors;\n\n(b) issuing, trading or dealing in securities;\n\n(c) criminal or penal offenses;\n\n(d) reports of transfers of currency or other monetary instruments; or\n\n(e) ensuring the satisfaction of judgments in adjudicatory proceedings.\n\n**CL-001**, BIT (English Version), Article IX(2).\n\n**(2) GTH's Position**\n----------------------\n\n688.\n\nIn addition to challenging Canada's Transfer Framework under the FET and the FPS provisions of the BIT, GTH also challenges the same under Article IX(1) of the BIT. To that end, GTH avers that the reference in Article IX(1) to \"transfer of investments and returns\" should be read to include the \"transfer,\" in the meaning of sale, to an Incumbent of GTH's investment consisting of \"the bundle of rights associated with its indirect shareholding and loans to Wind Mobile.\"1180\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 345.\n\n689.\n\nGTH submits that Article IX(1) is broad and covers the transfer of any \"investment\" or \"return.\"1181 GTH highlights that the second sentence of the provision expressly states that it should not be read to limit the general principle of free transfer and lists additional types of transfers that are \"also\" guaranteed.1182\n\nMerits Memorial, \u00b6 383.\n\nMerits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 343.\n\n690.\n\nGTH asserts that, \"[w]hile broad transfer guarantee provisions are uncommon, the ordinary meaning of this provision is clear\" and includes the sale or disposition of investments generally.1183 According to GTH, the tribunal in *Karkey v. Pakistan* confirmed that a similarly broad transfer provision can apply to the free transfer of investments as opposed to funds.1184 GTH also cites the observation of Newcombe and Paradell that:\n\nsome IIA provisions appear to apply more generally to restrictions on the investment itself. For example, Article VII, Canada-Venezuela [BIT] (1996), guarantees to investors 'the unrestricted transfer of investments.' Domestic restrictions on the sale or other disposition of the investment that prevent the investor from liquidating its investment would appear to be covered by this type of provision, and not simply the transfer of funds after liquidation.1185\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

I of the BIT more relevant to this issue.\").\n\n692.\n\nTherefore, GTH rejects Canada's position that the application of Article IX(1) is limited to the transfer of *funds* from the host State to the investor's State.1187 In GTH's view, Canada's interpretation ignores the ordinary meaning of the of Article IX(1) and relies on the \"object and purpose underlying transfer provisions\" in general, contrary to the mandate in Article 31 of the VCLT to consider the text of the BIT.1188 Further, GTH contends that Canada has neither cited any authority to support its narrow interpretation, nor distinguished those authorities put forward by GTH.1189 More fundamentally, GTH does not accept that there is a basis for Canada's distinction between the funds generated by an investment and the core assets making up the investment, which are both valuable to the investor.1190\n\nMerits Reply and Jur.

According to Canada, Article IX(1) does not apply to restrictions on the sale of assets within Canada; rather, it is limited to guaranteeing the free transfer of funds between Canada and Egypt.1193\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 486-503; Merits Rejoinder and Jur.

Venezuela*, in which the claimant held equity in Venezuelan gold mining companies and argued that an export ban on gold breached Venezuela's transfer obligation under the relevant treaty.1211 The *Rusoro* tribunal held that the ban did not breach that obligation because the gold did not constitute an \"investment\" or \"return\" within the meaning of the relevant transfer provision.1212\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 509.\n\nMerits Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 507-509, *citing* **CL-016**, *Rusoro Mining Limited v.

Reply, \u00b6 348.\n\n**(4) The Tribunal's Analysis and Conclusion**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n702.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that GTH's claim in relation to unrestricted transfers is based on a misconception of the scope of the term \"transfer\" in Article IX of the BIT. While it could be argued that the sale of personal property involves a \"transfer\" of ownership, this is not the meaning of \"transfer of investments and returns\" used in Article IX(1) of the BIT. When interpreting the terms of Article IX \"in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose,\" as required by Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the Tribunal notes the reference in Article IX to:\n\n- \"transfer of investments and returns,\" where the term \"returns\" is defined in Article 1(i) as \"amounts yielded by an investment\";\n\n- \"funds in repayment of loans related to an investment\";\n\n- \"the proceeds of the (\u2026) liquidation of any investment\";\n\n- \"transfers shall be effected in the convertible currency in which the capital was originally invested\";\n\n- \"transfers shall be made at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer\";\n\n- \"transfer, the returns attributable to investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party\"; and\n\n- the title of Article IX: \"*Transfer of funds*.\"\n\n703.\n\nAll of the terms of Article IX referred to above point towards the construction of the term \"transfer\" as denoting the free movement of the funds invested in the host State,1215 or of the proceeds of the liquidation of an investment that takes the form of another category of qualifying asset, and the returns on investment that the investor yielded over the duration of the investment. Thus, \"transfer\" includes expatriation outside the host State, whether or not that movement consists of a repatriation to the investor's country. In all of those situations, Article IX precludes the host State from restricting the right of the investor to transfer the amount, proceeds and returns of its investment out of the host State, for instance by enacting capital or currency controls, subject to the exceptions listed in Article IX(3).\n\nIf the qualifying investment takes the form of money or securities pursuant to Article I(f)(i) and (iii) of the BIT.\n\n704.\n\nIn so deciding, the Tribunal agrees with Canada's submission that the purpose of Article IX is to protect cross-border movements of funds related to the investment. The Tribunal also notes approvingly Canada's citation of Dr. Abba Kolo's summary of the purpose of transfer of funds provisions in investment treaties, in the following terms:\n\n[T]he ability to transfer funds in and out of the host state ensures that the foreign investor reaps the benefits or enjoys the fruits of his or her investment through dividend payments, paying for goods and services, servicing of debts, or fulfilling other financial obligations that would enhance the value of the investment.1216\n\n**RL-320**, Abba Kolo, \"Transfer of Funds: The Interaction Between the IMF Articles of Agreement and Modern Investment Treaties: A Comparative Law Perspective,\" *in* Stephan W. Schill, *International Investment Law and Comparative Public Law* (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 346.\n\n705.\n\nAny remaining doubt on the proper interpretation of \"transfer\" in Article IX is dispelled by reading the corresponding term in the authentic French text \"*transfert*\" (while French \"*transmission*\" would have been used had the Contracting States meant to refer to the outright sale of the investment) and the authentic Arabic text \"\u0627\ufedf\ufe98\ufea4\ufeee\ufbfe\ufede\" (while \"\u0627\ufedf\ufe92\ufbff\ufeca\" or \"\ufee7\ufed8\ufede \u0627\ufedf\ufee4\ufee0\ufedc\ufbff\ufe94\" would have been used had the Contracting States meant to refer to outright sale or to conveyance of property). Applying the interpretation rule set out in Article 33 of the VCLT, the Tribunal adopts the meaning of \"transfer\" which best reconciles the three authentic texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty. That meaning is the permission of the free circulation of the funds that consist in or result from the investment, as opposed to a guarantee of an unrestricted conveyance of ownership of that investment to an Incumbent at the end of the five-year period.\n\n706.\n\nConsidering the above, the Tribunal cannot accept GTH's broad interpretation of Article IX(1) of the BIT. In the Tribunal's view, that provision applies exclusively to the transfer of funds.\n\n707.\n\nGTH does not provide any evidence that Canada hampered its ability to freely dispose of the return of the sale of its investment in Wind Mobile in 2014, whether its indirect shareholding or loans, including by transferring the proceeds outside Canada or investing them in other assets in Canada after the Transfer Framework was introduced. Article IX in its true construction offers no ground to GTH to claim relief. GTH's claim under Article IX is dismissed.\n\n**E. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON THE MERITS**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n708.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal has determined that GTH has failed to establish that Canada breached any of its obligations set forth in the BIT. The Tribunal therefore dismisses all GTH's claims on the merits. As a consequence, there is no need for the Tribunal to consider GTH's claim for damages or the Parties' submissions on quantum.\n\n709.\n\nThe final matter for determination is the Parties' respective claims for the costs of the proceeding, which the Tribunal addresses in the next section.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n710.\n\nEach of the Parties asks the Tribunal to order the other Party to pay all the costs of the arbitration, including the cost of legal representation and assistance, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and ICSID's costs.\n\n**(1) GTH's Submission on Costs**\n---------------------------------\n\n711.\n\nGTH submits that the Tribunal has discretion to allocate the costs of the proceeding, and that the Tribunal should exercise that discretion by awarding GTH its costs.\n\n712.\n\nIn particular, GTH's position is that if it were to prevail on the merits, it should be reimbursed for the costs it incurred over the entire course of this arbitration.1217 In GTH's view, such an award of costs is required to achieve the *Chorz\u00f3w* principle of full reparation.1218\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 7.\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 6, *citing* **CL-075**, *Gold Reserve Inc. v.

Canada's unsuccessful application to bifurcate the proceeding, which necessitated several rounds of oral and written submission.1219\n\nb. Canada's \"ill-supported\" objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, including its \"frivolous objection to Claimant's status as an Egyptian juridical person investor.\"1220\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 7(a).\n\nClaimant's Cost Submission, \u00b6 7(b).\n\n714.\n\nThe following table contains a summary of the fees and expenses GTH incurred in the entire proceeding, up to 31 May 2019:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Description of Costs** | **Amount** |\n| Legal fees (Gibson Dunn) | USD 14,624,241.90 |\n| Disbursements for Fees and Expenses of Consultants and Local Counsel | USD 576,680.96 |\n| Disbursements for Fees and Expenses of Testifying Experts | USD 1,561,397.09 |\n| Other Disbursements | USD 1,302,347.56 |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Advance Payments to ICSID | USD 600,000.00 |\n| TOTAL | USD 18,664,667.51 |\n\n715.\n\nGTH also provides a breakdown of these costs by time periods and an estimate of the costs attributable to defending against Canada's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n**(2) Canada's Submission on Costs**\n------------------------------------\n\n716.\n\nLike GTH, Canada submits that the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate the costs of the proceeding.1221 According to Canada, in deciding the allocation of costs, the Tribunal should take into account the following factors: (a) the outcome of the proceeding; (b) the relative success of the parties; (c) the parties' conduct of the proceeding; (d) the reasonableness of the parties' costs; and (e) whether the dispute involved complex or novel issues.1222\n\nCanada's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\nCanada's Costs Submission, \u00b6 3, citing, inter alia, **RL-200**, *Waste Management, Inc. v.

United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, 9 January 2003, \u00b6 200.\n\n717.\n\nApplying this standard to the present case, Canada argues that if the Tribunal upholds Canada's jurisdictional objections, GTH should bear all Canada's costs, especially considering that GTH opposed bifurcation of the preliminary objections.1223\n\nCanada's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\n718.\n\nIn any event, even if the Tribunal were to find jurisdiction over some of the claims, Canada urges the Tribunal to consider \"the serious and legitimate arguments put forward by Canada in its defence,\" and the fact that GTH's broad claims and ambiguous position regarding which measures were being challenged increased the costs of Canada's defense.1224\n\nCanada's Costs Submission, \u00b6 7.\n\n719.\n\nCanada further submits that GTH took an unreasonable approach to document production and privilege claims, resulting in unnecessary costs. Therefore, GTH \"must bear the parties' costs for its unjustifiable privilege assertions and repeated failures to comply with the Tribunal's production orders.\"1225 Similarly, Canada considers GTH's approach to damages an unreasonable departure from accepted damages principles, resulting in a costly exchange that could have been avoided.1226\n\nCanada's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.\n\nCanada's Costs Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\n720.\n\nAccording to Canada, its costs are reasonable in light of GTH's approach to the case, which required Canada to expend significant resources to defend the claims.\n\n721.\n\nThe following table contains a summary of the fees and expenses Canada incurred from the filing of GTH's Notice of Intent in on 27 November 2015 to 31 May 2019:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Description of Costs** | **Amount** |\n| Legal Representation (Trade Law Bureau) | CAD 4,986,699.38 |\n| Legal Representation (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada) | CAD 1,223,990.96 |\n| Disbursements for Fees and Expenses of Consultants and Testifying Experts | CAD 2,701,874.80 |\n| Other Disbursements | CAD 227,650.68 |\n| Advance Payments to ICSID | CAD 792,805.00 |\n| TOTAL | CAD 9,933,020.82 |\n\n**B. THE ARBITRATION COSTS**\n----------------------------\n\n722.\n\nThe costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Description of Costs** | **Amount** |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses |  |\n| Professor Georges Affaki | USD 483,341.95 |\n| Mr. Gary Born | USD 99,490.81 |\n| Professor Vaughan Lowe | USD 89,595.50 |\n| Independent Expert's fees | USD 33,562.50 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | USD 158,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses (estimated) | USD 131,639.97 |\n| TOTAL | USD 995,630.73 |\n\n723.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and paragraph 9.1 of PO1, these arbitration costs have been paid out of advance payments made by the Parties in equal parts (50% by GTH and 50% by Canada). The remaining balance in the case escrow account will be reimbursed to the Parties in equal parts. As a result, GTH's share of the arbitration costs amounts to USD 497,815.37, and Canada's share also amounts to USD 497,815.37.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISION ON COSTS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n724.\n\nBoth Parties accept that the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate costs under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Specifically, Article XIII(9) of the BIT provides that the \"tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.\" In turn, Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention states:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n725.\n\nIn the exercise of its discretion in matters of allocation of costs, the Tribunal finds it fair that the Parties bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares and that each Party bears its own legal and other costs expended in connection with this arbitration. In reaching this decision, the Tribunal has considered all the circumstances of the case, including in particular the outcome on jurisdiction in favour of GTH (but for Canada's jurisdictional challenge in relation to the national treatment claim) and on the merits in favour of Canada, the results achieved by each Party during their protracted dispute in relation to privileged documents, and the fact that GTH's claims, even if they did not succeed on the merits, presented genuine issues which could legitimately be brought before an investment tribunal.\n\n726.\n\nIn a final note, the Tribunal notes its high appreciation to counsel for both Parties for their highly professional, proactive and courteous attitude throughout the proceedings, which was of great assistance to this Tribunal in fulfilling its duties.\n\n**IX. AWARD**\n-------------\n\n727.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\n728.\n\nDECIDES that it has no jurisdiction to entertain GTH's claim that Canada breached its national treatment obligations under Article IV(1) of the BIT in respect of GTH's investment;\n\n729.\n\nDECIDES that it has jurisdiction under the BIT and the ICSID Convention to entertain GTH's claims that Canada breached the following obligations under the BIT:\n\n(i) The fair and equitable treatment standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT,\n\n(ii) The full protection and security standard in Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, and\n\n(iii) The unrestricted transfer guarantee in Article IX(1) of the BIT;\n\n730.\n\nDECIDES that the claims mentioned in paragraph 729 are admissible;\n\n731.\n\nDISMISSES GTH's claims that Canada breached its obligations under the BIT, specifically:\n\n(i) The fair and equitable treatment standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT,\n\n(ii) The full protection and security standard in Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, and\n\n(iii) The unrestricted transfer guarantee in Article IX(1) of the BIT;\n\n732.\n\nDISMISSES GTH's request for damages;\n\n733.\n\nORDERS the Parties to bear the arbitration costs in equal parts;\n\n734.\n\nHOLDS that each Party shall bear its legal costs and expenses without contribution by the other Party; and\n\n735.\n\nDISMISSES all other claims or defences by either Party."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2022-09-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**T****able of** **S****elected** **A****bbreviations**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Applications | Applications for Annulment filed by Canada and GTH on July 27, 2020 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| Award | *Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. v Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/16, Award, March 27, 2020 |\n| BIT or FIPA | Agreement between Canada and the Arab Republic of Egypt for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on March 11, 1998 (also called Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement) |\n| C-[#] | GTH's Exhibit |\n| CL-[#] | GTH's Legal Authority |\n| CD-[#] | Claimant's demonstrative exhibit |\n| Canada's Application | Application for Annulment filed by Canada on July 27, 2020 |\n| Canada's Memorial on Partial Annulment | Canada's Memorial dated March 8, 2021 |\n| Canada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment | Canada's Counter-Memorial dated July 6, 2021 |\n| Canada's Reply on Partial Annulment | Canada's Reply dated September 27, 2021 |\n| Canada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment | Canada's Rejoinder dated December 17, 2021 |\n| CRTC | Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission |\n| Committee | Prof. M\u00f3nica Pinto, Prof. Lawrence Boo and Ms. Dyal\u00e1 Jim\u00e9nez |\n| GCHO | Globalive Communications Holdings Ontario Inc. |\n| GiC | Governor in Council |\n| GTH | Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. |\n| GTHCL | Global Telecom Holding Canada Limited |\n| GTH's Application | Application for Annulment filed by GTH on July 27, 2020 |\n| GTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment | GTH's Memorial dated March 8, 2021 |\n| GTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment | GTH's Counter-Memorial dated July 6, 2021 |\n| GTH's Reply on Partial Annulment | GTH's Reply dated September 27, 2021 |\n| GTH's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment | GTH's Rejoinder dated December 17, 2021 |\n| Hearing | Hearing on Annulment held on February 7 and 8, 2022 |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18, 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| ICA | Industry Canada |\n| ICA Act | Investment Canada Act |\n| Mojo | Mojo Investments Corp. |\n| O&C Rules | Ownership & Control Rules |\n| R-[#] | Canada's Exhibit |\n| RL-[#] | Canada's Legal Authority |\n| RD-[#] | Respondent's demonstrative exhibit |\n| Tr.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 27, 2020, Global Telecom Holdings S.A.E. (\"GTH\" or the \"Claimant\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") an application for the partial annulment of the award rendered on March 27, 2020, by Prof. Georges Affaki, Prof. Gary Born and Prof. Vaughan Lowe (the \"Award\") in the case *Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. v Canada* (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/16) (\"GTH's Application\"). On the same day, Canada (also, the \"Respondent\") filed an application for the partial annulment of the Award (\"Canada's Application\"). GTH's Application and Canada's Application shall together hereinafter be referred to as the \"Applications.\"\n\n2.\n\nThe Award decided a dispute submitted to the Centre on the basis of the Agreement between Canada and the Arab Republic of Egypt for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on March 11, 1998 (the \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\")1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\nWhilst GTH refers to the Treaty as \"BIT\", Canada employs the term Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement \"FIPA.\" The Committee has no preference between the two terms, but for the sake of consistency will use \"BIT\" as did the Award (para. 1).\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant and Respondent are referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\n4.\n\nBoth Parties applied for partial annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, and both identified the same three grounds for annulment, viz: (i) manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b)); (ii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (iii) failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n5.\n\nThe Committee renders one Decision that deals with both Applications. As explained below, the two Applications were dealt with together procedurally.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn July 27, 2020, ICSID received the Applications for annulment. On August 11, 2020, pursuant to Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Applications.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated September 24, 2020, in accordance with Rules 6 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Parties were notified that an *ad hoc* Committee composed of Prof. M\u00f3nica Pinto, a national of Argentina, appointed to the Panel by Argentina, and designated as President of the Committee, Prof. Lawrence Boo, a national of Singapore, appointed to the Panel by Singapore, and Ms. Dyal\u00e1 Jim\u00e9nez, a national of Costa Rica, appointed to the Panel by Costa Rica had been constituted (the \"Committee\") to hear both Applications. On the same date, the Parties were notified that Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti, Senior Legal Adviser, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n8.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 13(1), the Committee held a first session with the Parties on November 6, 2020, by telephone conference.\n\n9.\n\nFollowing the first session, on November 23, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. It was agreed that the Committee would hear both Applications.

BACKGROUND ON ARBITRATION AND THE AWARD**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA. **F****actual background**\n-----------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe following summary is intended to provide a general overview of the factual background to the dispute between the Parties. It is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all facts considered relevant by the Tribunal and/or the Committee.\n\n23.\n\nThe present dispute regards the ability of Wind Mobile, a corporation partially owned by GTH, to operate and transfer its investment in the wireless services market in Canada.\n\n24.\n\nAt the time of the underlying arbitration, Canada's telecommunications market was highly concentrated and was dominated by three Canadian service providers - Bell, Rogers and Telus - known as the Incumbents.\n\n25.\n\nIn 2008, Canada developed an Investment Framework for Canada's Auction of Advanced Wireless Services Spectrum Licenses (\"2008 AWS Auction\") that would facilitate the entrance of new wireless providers, known as New Entrants. In particular, Canada set aside spectrum licenses for New Entrants that could not be transferred to Incumbents for a finite five-year period.\n\n26.\n\nGTH, previously known as Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E., a joint stock company incorporated in Egypt, operates mobile telecommunications networks around the world. GTH and a Canadian partner jointly participated in the 2008 AWS Auction through the enterprise Wind Mobile, which won 30 AWS spectrum licenses at a price of CAD$ 442.1 million.\n\n27.\n\nUnder the Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations in force at the time, a non-Canadian could not own more than 33 1/3 percent of the voting shares of a holding company of a Canadian carrier. The Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (\"CRTC\") had authority to review compliance of the Ownership & Control Rules (\"O&C Rules\") under the Telecommunications Act, while Industry Canada (\"ICA\") was responsible for ensuring compliance with the identical O&C Rules under the Radiocommunication Regulations.\n\n28.\n\nGTH could not own or have voting control over Wind Mobile due to Canadian O&C Rules, but its investment was structured in a manner that would allow it to take voting control in the future if the O&C Rules were relaxed. Thus, while GTH held majority of Wind Mobile's shares but only 32 percent of Wind Mobile's voting shares, GTH's non-voting shares could be converted to voting shares if and when the O&C Rules were relaxed and subject to ICA approval as provided for by the law.\n\n29.\n\nOn July 30, 2008, GTH entered into an investment agreement with Globalive Communications Holdings Ontario Inc. (\"GCHO\") and Mojo Investments Corp. (\"Mojo\"), another Canadian company. In this agreement, GTH agreed that it would advance funds for the total amount of the spectrum licenses through its wholly owned subsidiary, Global Telecom Holding Canada Limited (\"GTHCL\"), known at the time as OTHCL, and that those licenses and all related rights would be held by Wind Mobile.\n\n30.\n\nAs required under the 2008 AWS Auction Licensing Framework, on August 5, 2008, Wind Mobile submitted its Declaration of Ownership and Control to Industry Canada, in order to commence the review of Wind Mobile's compliance with the O&C Rules. Following certain changes made to the corporate structure, on February 16, 2009, Industry Canada found Wind Mobile to be in compliance with the Radiocommunication Regulations O&C Rules. Wind Mobile then provided Industry Canada with a revised Declaration of Ownership and Control. Industry Canada issued Wind Mobile's 30 spectrum licenses on March 13, 2009.\n\n31.\n\nOn May 22, 2009, the CRTC notified Wind Mobile that it would conduct a Type 4 review of Wind Mobile's ownership.2 Ultimately, the CRTC determined that Wind Mobile did not satisfy the O&C Rules. In its decision of October 29, 2009 (the \"CRTC Decision\"), the CRTC found that Wind Mobile had \"met the test for legal control\" but was \"controlled in fact by Orascom, a non-Canadian\" and therefore did \"not meet the requirements set out in section 16 of the [Telecommunications] Act and [was not] eligible to operate as a telecommunications common carrier.\"3\n\nAs indicated in the Award, \"in exceptional circumstances, the Commission will hold an oral, public, multi-party proceeding (Type 4 review) where an ownership or governance structure is of a in exceptional circumstances, complex or novel nature, such that in the Commission's view its determination wilhold precedential value to industry players and the general public, where the Commission considers that the evidentiary record would be improved by third-party submissions, and the Commission further considers that the appearance of parties would more easily allow the Commission to complete and test the evidentiary record. Under this type of review, documentary evidence filed by the carrier under review will be available for public inspection. Third parties will have an opportunity to file written submissions and request to provide oral submissions on that evidence. At the conclusion of the review process, a public decision will be issued.\" (Award, para. 48).\n\nAward, para. 50.\n\n32.\n\nAfter the CRTC Decision was issued, the Governor in Council (the \"GiC\") commenced a review pursuant to its authority under the Telecommunications Act to vary decisions of the CRTC.4 The GiC disagreed with the CRTC's finding that Orascom controlled Wind Mobile in fact. Thus, on December 10, 2009, the GiC varied the CRTC Decision (\"the GiC Decision\"). It held that Wind Mobile satisfied the O&C Rules under the Telecommunications Act and was eligible to operate as a Canadian telecommunication common carrier.\n\nAward, para. 52.\n\n33.\n\nIn December 2009, Wind Mobile commenced operations as a telecommunication carrier.\n\n34.\n\nThe GiC Decision was challenged in Federal Court by Public Mobile Inc., another New Entrant. The respondents in the proceeding were Wind Mobile and the Attorney General of Canada. On February 4, 2011, the Federal Court agreed with Public Mobile and quashed the GiC Decision.\n\n35.\n\nBoth Wind Mobile and the Attorney General of Canada appealed the Federal Court decision, and by its judgment of June 8, 2011, the Federal Court of Appeal reversed the Federal Court and reinstated the GiC Decision. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied in April 2012, closing the matter under Canadian law.\n\n36.\n\nAt the time of GTH's investment in the Canadian market, Weather Investments S.p.A. (\"Weather Investments\") was the largest shareholder in GTH. In April 2011, control of GTH passed from Weather Investments to a wider group comprised of Weather Investments and VimpelCom Ltd. (\"VimpelCom\"), a telecommunications company based in The Netherlands. VimpelCom became the largest shareholder in GTH.\n\n37.\n\nIn 2012, the O&C Rules were relaxed and GTH was no longer prohibited from having voting control over Wind Mobile. Accordingly, GTH submitted its Voting Control Application to get approval for its plan to exercise what it deemed its pre-existing right to take voting control over Wind Mobile.\n\n38.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n39.\n\n[REDACTED] Finally, on September 15, 2014, GTH approved the sale of its shareholding in Wind Mobile to AAL (Wind Mobile's controlling shareholder) and a group of private equity firms (\"AAL\"). Industry Canada approved the sale in November 2014.\n\n40.\n\nIn March 2015, Industry Canada held an auction of AWS-3 spectrum licenses, in which certain spectrum was set aside for New Entrants. Wind Mobile acquired a block of set-aside spectrum licenses through this auction for CAD$ 56.4 million.\n\n41.\n\nOn June 24, 2015, Industry Canada approved two transfers of set-aside spectrum licenses to Rogers: (1) Rogers' purchase of the set-aside spectrum licenses of Shaw (a New Entrant) for CAD$ 350 million; and (2) Rogers' acquisition of Mobilicity (a New Entrant) for CAD$ 440 million. As part of these transactions, Rogers transferred all of Mobilicity's AWS spectrum to Wind Mobile, and Shaw's AWS spectrum was split between Wind Mobile and Rogers. In return, Wind Mobile transferred some of its existing AWS spectrum to Rogers.\n\n42.\n\nOn December 16, 2015, Wind Mobile's new owners sold the company's spectrum licenses and business holdings to Shaw for CAD$ 1.6 billion.\n\n**B. T****he** **A****ward**\n----------------------------\n\n43.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, an arbitral tribunal composed of Prof. George Affaki (President), Prof. Vaughan Lowe and Prof. Gary Born (the \"Tribunal\") rendered the Award in ICSID Case ARB/16/16. The Tribunal decided by majority that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain GTH's claim that Canada breached its national treatment obligations under Article IV(1) of the BIT in respect of GTH's investment and that it had jurisdiction regarding the other GTH's claims. On the merits, the Tribunal by majority dismissed GTH's claims regarding the breach of the fair and equitable standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, of the full protection and security standard in Article II(2)(b)\u00a0and the unrestricted transfer guarantee in Article IX of the BIT. The Tribunal also by majority dismissed GTH's claims on damages and all other claims and defences by either party. Prof. Born issued a dissenting opinion. The *dispositif* reads as follows:\n\n\"For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\nDECIDES that it has no jurisdiction to entertain GTH's claim that Canada breached its national treatment obligations under Article IV(1) of the BIT in respect of GTH's investment;\n\nDECIDES that it has jurisdiction under the BIT and the ICSID Convention to entertainGTH's claims that Canada breached the following obligations under the BIT:\n\n(i) The fair and equitable treatment standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT,\n\n(ii) The full protection and security standard in Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, and\n\n(iii) The unrestricted transfer guarantee in Article IX(1) of the BIT;\n\nDECIDES that the claims mentioned in paragraph 729 are admissible;\n\nDISMISSES GTH's claims that Canada breached its obligations under the BIT, specifically:\n\n(i) The fair and equitable treatment standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT,\n\n(ii) The full protection and security standard in Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, and\n\n(iii) The unrestricted transfer guarantee in Article IX(1) of the BIT;\n\nDISMISSES GTH's request for damages;\n\nORDERS the Parties to bear the arbitration costs in equal parts;\n\nHOLDS that each Party shall bear its legal costs and expenses without contribution by the other Party; and\n\nDISMISSES all other claims or defences by either Party.\"\n\n**C. R****equest for** **R****elief** **- C****anada**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn the light of its submissions, Canada asks the Committee to:\n\n(1) Annul the parts of the Award that contain the findings of a majority of the Tribunal with respect to Article II(4)(b) and the Tribunal's assertion of jurisdiction over GTH's National Security Review Claims; and\n\n(2) Grant any further relief it deems just and appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n45.\n\nAt the Hearing, Canada asked the Committee to:\n\n(1) Annul paragraphs 324-336 of the Award;\n\n(2) Annul the Tribunal's conclusions regarding its jurisdiction at paragraph 729(i) and (ii) as they pertain to Canada's national security review; and\n\n(3) Award such other relief as the Committee considers appropriate.\n\n**D. R****equest for** **R****elief** **- GTH**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn the light of its written and oral submissions, GTH requests that the Committee:\n\n(1) Annul the Award's decision on the National Treatment Claim, as reflected in paragraph 728 of the *dispositif* and the corresponding paragraphs in the Award related to the National Treatment Claim (paragraphs 363-80, 683);\n\n(2) Annul the Award's decision on the Blocked Sale Claim, as reflected in paragraph 729(i) of the *dispositif* and the corresponding paragraphs in the Award related to the Blocked Sale Claim (paragraphs 539-71);\n\n(3) Annul the Award's decision on the Free Transfer Claim, as reflected in paragraph 729(iii) of the *dispositif* and the corresponding paragraphs in the Award related to the Free Transfer Claim (paragraphs 702-707);\n\n(4) Order Canada to pay all of the costs and expenses associated with the annulment proceedings, including GTH's legal fees, the fees and expenses of the Committee, and ICSID's other costs; and\n\n(5) Award such other relief as the Committee considers appropriate.\n\n**IV. ANNULMENT LEGAL STANDARDS**\n---------------------------------\n\nA. **S****cope of annulment**\n-----------------------------\n\n47.\n\nUnder Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\"\n\n48.\n\nIn its Memorial on Partial Annulment, GTH states that \"[a]s finality is a fundamental goal for the ICSID system, annulment proceedings are designed to have a limited scope of review. Notably, as stipulated in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, annulment can only be granted on five bases, with each ground serving to safeguard parties from '*violations of the fundamental principles of law governing the Tribunal's proceedings'*. Unlike an appeal before national courts, annulment proceedings are not intended to be a reconsideration of the merits of the case. Instead, annulment proceedings are limited to reviewing procedural errors in a tribunal's conduct and disposition of proceedings, rather than a substantive inquiry into its reasoning and conclusions.\"5\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 29 (emphasis in the original).\n\n49.\n\nCanada, quoting the decision in *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v The United Arab Emirates,* states that the annulment proceedings pursue three goals: the integrity of the tribunal, the integrity of the procedure, and the integrity of the award. It also stresses the differences between an appeal and annulment proceedings and that all of the grounds for annulment should be strictly construed.6 In its Reply, Canada insists in that while it readily agrees that annulment proceedings are not an appeal mechanism, and that arbitral tribunals are empowered to determine their own jurisdiction, it is nevertheless fully within the purview of an annulment committee to review a tribunal's conclusions on jurisdictional issues for manifest errors. That is the very purpose of Article 52(1)(b).7\n\nRD-01, Slides 20-22.\n\nCanada's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 9.\n\n50.\n\nThe provisions under the Convention and the Arbitration Rules are exhaustive in the enunciation of the grounds that warrant an annulment. Only those explicitly mentioned in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention can serve as basis for annulment. Further, neither the ICSID Convention nor the Rules include appeal as a remedy against an award. This is not in dispute. The interpretation of Article 52(1) should be made in the light of Articles 31, 32 and 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"). Therefore, an interpretation of Article 52(1) in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose, requires the Committee to strictly adhere to the annulment standards.8 Both Parties agree that there is a difference between annulement and appeal.\n\nTr. Day 1, Ms. Madden 20:12-21.\n\n51.\n\nIn fact, the Committee agrees with the *Total v Argentina* committee in that \"annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy\" and that \"Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither narrowly nor broadly.\"9 Therefore, the Committee deems that the legal rules applicable to the annulment procedure seek to safeguard the integrity of the arbitration system and not to review the decisions in the underlying arbitrations on their merits. At the same time, the discretion awarded to the Committee by Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention \u2013 \"the Committee shall have the authority to annul the award or any part thereof on any of the grounds set forth in paragraph (1)\" \u2013 should be interpreted so as not to defeat the object and purpose of the remedy or erode the finality or binding force of awards.10\n\n*Total SA v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Annulment, February 1, 2016, para. 167 (**CL-219**). See also Tr. Day 1, Mr. Moloo, 20:6-11; Tr. Day 1, Mr. Klaver, 106:4-25 and 107:1-7.\n\nICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administration Council of ICSID,* May 5, 2016 , para. 74 (**CL-251**).\n\n52.\n\nThis means that the scope of annulment is by nature quite limited, since the Committee is precluded from revisiting the facts and the evidence and even the conclusions of the Tribunal. In this case, the Committee must only be concerned with the boundaries within which the BIT signatories (and the Parties) consented to arbitrate and under which jurisdictional conditions. Also, it must be satisfied that the Tribunal issued a reasoned award and that it did not breach a fundamental rule of procedure. The Committee will set out each ground invoked by the Parties in the next section.\n\n53.\n\nDuring the Hearing it was said that \"[w]hile Canada and GTH broadly agree on these principles, they diverge on how the principles apply to the award in this case.\"11 The Committee will consider those differences and apply the applicable standard in the given case.\n\nTr. Day 1, Mr. Klaver, 105:23-25.\n\n**B. M****anifest excess of powers** **(A****rticle** **52(1)(****B****))**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nRecalling Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which states that an award may be annulled when \"the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers\", both Parties agree that this ground for annulment requires the Committee to engage in a two-stage inquiry: the assessment of the actual commission of an excess of powers and, if so, whether such excess of powers is manifest.12 The Committee shares this view.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 42; GTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 32-33; Tr. Day 1, Mr. Maloo 21:11-15.\n\n55.\n\nFor its part, in line with *Fraport v the Philippines,* Canada submits that \"[a] tribunal may manifestly exceed its powers when it goes beyond the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement or fails to apply the proper law.\"13\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 43; Tr. Day 1, Mr. Maloo, 20:19-25 and 21:1-21\n\n56.\n\nQuoting the committee in *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v The United Arab Emirates*, GTH submits that a tribunal can exceed the scope of its powers when it \"do[es] something beyond the reach of such powers as defined by three parameters, the jurisdictional requirements, the applicable law and the issues raised by the Parties\", including when \"a tribunal acts 'too little'\" and \"it does not accept and exercise the powers granted to it and fails to fulfil its mandate.\"14 GTH adds that the distinction between jurisdictional errors and errors in the application of law is key in cases where tribunals decline to exercise jurisdiction they have, given that jurisdictional errors undermine the very consent that underpins arbitration. As a consequence, \"if a Tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction and such excess is manifest, its decision cannot stand.\"15\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 34.\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 36.\n\n57.\n\nGTH refers to jurisdictional excess of powers, both to the commission by overreach and by defect. It refers to earlier decisions by ICSID *ad hoc* committees to argue that for an excess of powers to be \"manifest\", committees have held that such an error must be \"obvious.\" An interpretation under the VCLT similarly results in the term manifest to mean \"objectively evident\", \"clear\", \"self-evident\", \"textually obvious and substantively serious\" or \"sufficiently clear and serious.\"16\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 37.\n\n58.\n\nGTH submits that \"manifest has been explained in many ways by many different committees and in different contexts, but essentially, it goes to how obvious is the excess of powers, how clear is it, how self-evident is it? Those are different ways in which committees have explained, what does it mean to be manifest? Other committees have explained the standard by a reference to the word 'tenable', and what does this mean? It essentially means if it's a tenable interpretation of a treaty then it cannot be manifest that the Tribunal got it wrong, so essentially the question of whether or not it's a tenable or an untenable interpretation is a proxy for assessing how obvious was the excess of powers.\"17\n\nTr. Day 1, Mr. Maloo, 23:5-20.\n\n59.\n\nThe drafters of the ICSID Convention anticipated that an excess of powers arises when a tribunal goes beyond the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement, decides points which have not been submitted to it, or fails to apply the law agreed by the parties.18 Accordingly, the Committee considers that a tribunal can exceed its powers if it fails to exercise jurisdiction when it is clear that it has a mandate and, conversely, when it does exercise jurisdiction lacking a mandate to do so. The \"manifest\" nature of the excess of powers is an excess that is obvious, clear or self-evident and which is discernable without the need for an elaborate analysis of the award.19 Some *ad hoc* committees have interpreted the meaning of \"manifest\" as serious or material to the outcome of the case.20 Therefore, if a tribunal proposes a tenable interpretation of a basis for its jurisdiction, it will be difficult for the excess of powers to be considered manifest.21.\n\nICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administration Council of ICSID,* May 5, 2016, para. 81 (**CL-251**).\n\nICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administration Council of ICSID,* May 5, 2016, para. 83 (**CL-251**).\n\n*Idem.*\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP v Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision on the Annulment Application of Caratube International Oil Company LLP, February 21, 2014, para. 144. (**CL-245**).\n\n60.\n\nThis Committee agrees with other *ad hoc* committees in that the ICSID Convention provides that the tribunal is the judge of its own competence, a power generally referred to as *comp\u00e9tence de la comp\u00e9tence.*22 As stated by the *Perenco v Ecuador* committee, \"ICSID annulment proceedings do not avail for a *de novo* review of jurisdiction. That would be tantamount to an appeal.\"23\n\nICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administration Council of ICSID,* May 5, 2016, para. 88.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Limited v Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/06, Decision on Annulment, May 28, 2021 (\"*Perenco v Ecuador*\"), para. 94 (**CL-274**).\n\n61.\n\nIn the context of Canada's Application, the Parties disagree on the standard regarding the application of the proper law. Canada contends that the majority of the Tribunal (the \"Majority\") advanced an erroneous interpretation of the proper law.24 GTH, for its part, argues that the Tribunal applied the correct law and that how it applied it is irrelevant for purposes of the annulment.25\n\nRD-02, Slide 13.\n\nTr. Day 2, Ms. Madden, 81:5-13.\n\n62.\n\nCanada submits that *ad hoc* committees have recognized that, where a tribunal does not apply the law applicable to the arbitration, there is grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(b). A committee must limit itself to determining if the tribunal did, in fact, apply the law it was bound to apply, without reviewing whether it was properly applied. Nevertheless, adds Canada, in exceptional circumstances, a gross or egregious misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law could effectively amount to a failure to apply the proper law and give rise to annulment.26 Relying on *Kl\u00f6ckner v Cameroon,* Canada contends that \"[w]here the tribunal purports to apply the applicable law but actually applies a different body of law, a manifest excess of powers may arise.\"27\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 46-47.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 49.\n\n63.\n\nOn that point, the Committee notes that the committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner v Cameroon* found that the tribunal issued a decision \"based more on a sort of general equity than on positive law (and in particular French civil law) or precise contractual provisions, such as Article 9 of the Turnkey Contract.\"28 Moreover, the Kl\u00f6ckner committee pointed out that \"in the Award's passages on the evaluation of the respective obligations or debts, the main ones of which have just been cited, it is difficult to find any legal reasoning as required by provisions of Articles 52(1)(e) or 48(3). Instead, there is really an 'equitable estimate' (to use the Tribunal's own words, p. 126; cf. also p. 127) based on 'approximately equivalent' estimates or approximations, which is in any case impossible to justify solely on the basis of the Award's explanations of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* or the counter-claim.\"29 For these reasons, the committee was led to the conclusion that the tribunal had applied a different set of rules.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Decision on the Application for Annulment Submitted by Kl\u00f6ckner Against the Arbitral Award Rendered on October 21, 1983, May 3, 1985 (\"*Kl\u00f6ckner v Cameroon*\"), para. 166 (**RL-344**).\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner v Cameroon* , para. 176.\n\n64.\n\nThe drafting history of the ICSID Convention shows that a tribunal's failure to apply the proper law could constitute a manifest excess of powers, but that erroneous application of the law could not amount to an annullable error, even if it is manifest.30 Notwithstanding the above, as with many other *ad hoc* committees, this Committee is aware that there may be a fine line between a failure to apply the proper law and an erroneous application of the law.31\n\nICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administration Council of ICSID,* May 5, 2016, para. 90 (**CL-251**).\n\nICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administration Council of ICSID,* May 5, 2016, para. 93 (**CL-251**).\n\n65.\n\nIn its Application, Canada contends that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers when it ascertained its jurisdiction over issues covered by Article II(4)(b) of the BIT. For its part, in its Application, GTH alleges that the Majority's decision to decline jurisdiction over the National Treatment Claim on the basis of Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT amounted to a manifest excess of powers.\n\n**C. S****erious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure** **(A****rticle** **52(1)(****d****))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nGTH recalls that Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention states that an award may be annulled where \"there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" and that it is a tribunal's duty to act with procedural fairness in order to preserve the legitimacy of the award.32 Canada submits that the respect for the fundamental rules of procedure is an important guarantee for the integrity and the legitimacy of the arbitration procedure.33\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 47.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 131.\n\n67.\n\nBoth Parties agree, and the Committee shares their views, that this ground for annulment requires the Committee to engage in a two-stage inquiry. First, the Committee must assess whether the Tribunal has departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. If yes then, second, whether such a departure was \"serious.\"34\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 48; Tr. Day 1, Mr. Klaver, 114:8-12.\n\n68.\n\nAlso, both Parties agree on the relevance of the right to be heard, and that it is considered a fundamental rule of procedure; they provide earlier decisions in support thereof.35 With similar language, both Parties argue that a tribunal should not surprise the parties with an issue that neither party brought to the record and that, as part of the right to fair trial under international law, the tribunal should ensure that each party has an effective opportunity to be heard on the crucial points of the reasoning that the tribunal intends to adopt.36 Canada also states that a tribunal cannot *sua sponte* raise a new thesis beyond the legal framework established by the Parties and rely on it as a basis for its decision, without providing the Parties an opportunity to comment on it.37 The Committee agrees generally with these views.\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 49; Canada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 137-139; Tr. Day 1, Mr. Klaver, 114:13-25.\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 50; RD-01, Slide 49.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 17.\n\n69.\n\nGTH argues that \"[o]nce a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure has been established, an applicant must show that the departure was *'serious* by showing either that (*i*) observance of the rule may have caused the tribunal to reach a substantially different result, or (*ii*) non-observance deprived a party of the benefit of the rule thus impacting the proceedings. Once an *ad hoc* committee has established that a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is serious, the committee must annul the impacted portion of the relevant award.\"38\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 52.\n\n70.\n\nCanada reiterates what the committee in *Perenco v Ecuador* stated \"[\u2026] that for a departure to be serious it need not be outcome determinative in the sense that the Applicant has to demonstrate that the Tribunal's decision would have been different had the fundamental procedural rule been observed. The Applicant, however, has the burden to demonstrate that there is a distinct possibility that the departure may have made a difference on a critical issue of the Tribunal's decision*.*\"39 The Committee agrees that this is the appropriate test.\n\nRD-01, Slide 50.\n\n71.\n\nIn its Application, Canada alleges that there was a serious departure from the right to be heard because the Tribunal surprised the Parties with its interpretation of ownership and control, its interpretation that acquisition does not involve control, and by not having dealt with the argument regarding the purchase of AAL's shares. For its part, in its Application, GTH alleges the same grievance regarding the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Free Transfer Claim because it relied on a legal argument that was not advanced by either Party.\n\n**D. F****ailure to state reasons** **(A****rticle** **52(1)(****e****))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nGTH points out that \"Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention states that an award may be annulled when '*the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based*', which reflects the requirements contained in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention that the award '*deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal*' and '*state the reasons upon which it is based*,' and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i) which requires [sic]the award contain '*the decision of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which the decision is based'*.\"40\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 39 (emphasis in the original).\n\n73.\n\nBoth Parties state that at a minimum, an award must be sufficiently clear to \"enable [...] one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law\", thus, the award must \"enable the reader (and specifically the parties) to see the reasons upon which the award itself is based.\"41\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 40; Canada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 101. See e.g. *Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v Republic of Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on the Application by Guinea for Partial Annulment of the Arbitral Award dated January 6, 1988, December 22, 1989, (\"*MINE v Guinea*\"), para. 5.09 **(RL-349)**.\n\n74.\n\nGTH contends that committees have found that a tribunal has failed to state reasons when: (1) there is an absence of reasons in the Award; (2) the tribunal presents reasons that are contradictory; (3) the tribunal fails to deal with a question submitted to it and (4) the tribunal fails to address key evidence.42\n\nCD-01, Slide 38.\n\n75.\n\nGTH submits that the Parties agree that the absence of reasons relating to a pivotal or outcome determinative point amounts to a failure to state reasons and that contradictory reasons on outcome determinative issues amount to a failure to state reasons.43\n\nCD-01, Slides 39-40.\n\n76.\n\nCanada specifies that the failure to address every question put forward by a party is not necessarily grounds for annulment. Two conditions must be satisfied to find an annullable error under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention: (1) the reasons must be impossible to understand either because they are absent, severely lacking, and cannot reasonably be inferred from the decision read as a whole or because of contradictory findings; and (2) the failure to state reasons must relate to a decisive element, material to the outcome of the case.44 It also contends that contradictory reasons cancel each other if they do not allow the reader to follow the tribunal's reasoning.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 102.\n\n77.\n\nGTH submits that according to Article 49 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has to deal with every question submitted to it, which, as pointed out by Prof. Schreuer, is to be understood objectively in the sense of a crucial or decisive argument, that is one whose acceptance would have altered the tribunal's conclusions.45 The same line of arguments can be found in Canada's presentation, which adds that an award is nevertheless annullable when there is a lacuna significant enough to prevent a reader from following the reasoning of the tribunal. Insufficient or inadequate reasons can therefore give rise to annulment in those limited circumstances.46\n\nCD-01, Slides 41-43.\n\nRD-01, Slides 37-47; Canada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 104.\n\n78.\n\nCanada contends that Article 52(1)(e) requires a very high threshold because the risk to get into the \"impermissible\" territory of an appeal is high.47 It restates the five precepts put forward by the committee in *Cortec v Kenya*, namely (1) there is no appeal and the tribunal is the judge of the admissibility and of the probative value of any evidence adduced before it; (2) the reasoning on a particular issue/s need not be expressly stated, so long as it can reasonably be inferred from the award as a whole; (3) a tribunal is not required to address every argument raised by a party; (4) where possible, an annulment committee should interpret an award in a manner that validates its reasoning and (5) annulment may not be sought in respect of matters not put before the original tribunal.48\n\nRD-01, Slides 30-31.\n\nRD-01, Slides 32-36.\n\n79.\n\nThe Committee considers that there is a clear link between the provision in the ICSID Convention requiring the tribunal to state the reasons for the award and the ground providing for annulment when there has been a failure to provide the reasons on which the award is based.49 *Ad hoc* committees have explained that the requirement to state reasons is intended to ensure that the reader can understand the reasoning of the tribunal, meaning the reader can understand the facts and law applied by the tribunal in coming to its conclusion. The correctness of the reasoning or whether it is convincing is not relevant.50\n\nICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administration Council of ICSID,* May 5, 2016, para. 102 (**CL-251**).\n\nICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administration Council of ICSID,* May 5, 2016, para. 105. (**CL-251**).\n\n80.\n\nAs expressed in the decision in *Perenco v Ecuador,* this Committee also \"stresses that Article 52(1)(e) does not concern the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. As correctly noted by the *CDC v Seychelles* committee 'the more recent practice among *ad hoc* Committees is to apply Article 52(1)(e) in such a manner that the Committee does not intrude into the legal and factual decision-making of the Tribunal.' It is not on an *ad hoc* committee to assess the quality, extension, or correctness of the reasons provided by a tribunal, much less to annul an award on that basis. If a tribunal provides reasons on how and why it reached its decision, there is no room for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\"51\n\n*Perenco v Ecuador,* para. 164.\n\n81.\n\nWhile Canada and GTH broadly agree on these parameters, they diverge on how they apply to the Award in this case.52 In its Application, Canada contends that the Tribunal failed to state reasons regarding what it deemed the correct interpretation of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT and why the ICA Application, [REDACTED], would have amounted to an acquisition of ownership. In its Application, GTH contends that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in finding that Canada did not breach its fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") obligation by blocking GTH from transferring its spectrum licenses to an incumbent after a five-year restriction on transfer expired, in finding that Canada did not breach the Free Transfer obligation, and in finding it lacked jurisdiction over GTH's claim that Canada breached the National Treatment obligation.\n\nTr. Day 1, Mr Klaver, 105:23-25.\n\n**V. CANADA'S APPLICATION**\n---------------------------\n\n82.\n\nCanada seeks the annulment of certain parts of the Award. Specifically, Canada seeks the annulment of the Tribunal's conclusion that it had jurisdiction over GTH's claims with respect to Canada's National Security Review of the Claimant's proposed acquisition of control of Wind Mobile (the \"National Security Review\"). The Majority held that the dispute settlement exclusion in Article II(4)(b) of the BIT between Canada and Egypt did not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction over GTH's National Security Review Claims. The Majority reached this conclusion by finding that GTH's voting control application under the Investment Canada Act (\"ICA Act\") (generally, the \"ICA Application\") did not concern the acquisition of Wind Mobile or of a share of Wind Mobile under Article II(4)(b). Canada considers that the Majority's findings are fundamentally flawed because of a number of annullable errors under the ICSID Convention. Three aspects of the relevant section of the Award (section VI.C.) arguably give rise to different grounds of annulment simultaneously.\n\n83.\n\nCanada submits that the first aspect relates to the Majority's finding that GTH's proposed acquisition of control of Wind Mobile did not constitute an acquisition of an existing business enterprise. This conclusion, and the process by which the Majority reached it, constitute annullable errors under Articles 52(1)(b), (e), and (d) of the Convention.\n\n84.\n\nCanada considers that the Majority's interpretation of the terms \"acquisition of an existing business enterprise\" in Article II(4)(b) of the BIT as limited to acquisition of ownership \u2013 but not acquisition of control \u2013 of an enterprise constitutes a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. It contends that the Majority's interpretation of this jurisdictional issue is untenable, and that the Majority failed to consider Canadian law in its interpretation of what constitutes an acquisition of an enterprise. The Majority also manifestly exceeded its powers by concluding that the ICA Application did not relate to the acquisition of Wind Mobile.\n\n85.\n\nCanada submits also that the Award fails to state reasons for the conclusion that GTH's proposed acquisition of voting control of Wind Mobile was not an acquisition of an existing business enterprise. It considers that it is therefore annullable under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention. Although the Majority appears to have concluded that the proposed transaction would not have amounted to the acquisition of ownership of Wind Mobile, the basis for this conclusion is not explained and is impossible to understand by reading the Award.\n\n86.\n\nIn addition, Canada points out that the Majority seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention, as GTH never argued that Article II(4)(b) of the BIT was limited to acquisition of ownership of an enterprise, and the Tribunal never allowed Canada to address this unexpected and unreasonable interpretation. The Tribunal also failed to provide Canada with the opportunity to be heard on the issue of what constitutes acquisition of ownership of an enterprise, and why the transactions contemplated in the ICA Application met that threshold.\n\n87.\n\nThe second aspect relates to the Majority's finding that the proposed share conversion in GTH's ICA Application did not amount to the acquisition of a share of an enterprise. That conclusion, and the process by which the Majority reached its conclusion, in Canada's view, constitute annullable errors under Articles 52(1)(b), (e), and (d) of the Convention*.*\n\n88.\n\nIn Canada's submissions, the finding that the ICA Application did not concern the acquisition of a share of Wind Mobile is a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention, because: (1) it is plainly contradicted by the evidence before the Tribunal; and (2) the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law, the Ontario Business Corporations Act (the \"OBCA\"), to the effects of share conversions.\n\n89.\n\nCanada challenges the Majority's reasoning on whether the ICA Application involved an acquisition of a share because it considers it is so deficient that it amounts to a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention. It points out that it is not possible to understand what law the Tribunal applied or on what basis it concluded that the proposed share conversion of the Class D non-voting shares do not result in the acquisition of the newly issued Class B voting shares which GTH did not previously own.\n\n90.\n\nCanada states that, to the extent any explanation was advanced, the Majority seems to have reached its conclusion based on a theory related to the treatment of corporate capital in the Shareholder's Agreement that was not raised by the Claimant. In doing so, the Majority committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention*.*\n\n91.\n\nFinally, Canada identifies a third aspect of the Tribunal's decision on Canada's jurisdictional objection under Article II(4)(b) of the BIT that allegedly gives rise to an annullable error: the Tribunal failed to consider and address the fact that GTH's ICA Application also involved an acquisition of the shares held by AAL in Wind Mobile. It submits that the Tribunal ignored Canada's argument and evidence without providing any reasons whatsoever, although the issue was material to the outcome of Canada's jurisdictional objection under Article II(4)(b). This omission constitutes a failure to state reasons and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, under Articles 52(1)(e) and (d) of the Convention, and it led the Tribunal to manifestly exceed its powers under Article 52(1)(b).53\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 1-10.\n\n92.\n\nIn order to understand the Parties' arguments better, the Committee recalls that Article II(4)(b) of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n\"Decisions by either Contracting Party not to permit the establishment of a new business enterprise or acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise by investors or prospective investors shall not be subject to the provisions of Article XIII of this Agreement.\"\n\n93.\n\nArticle XIII of the BIT concerns the Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the host Contracting Party.\n\nA. **M****anifest excess of powers** **(A****rticle** **52(1)(****b****))**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Canada's Position***\n--------------------------\n\n94.\n\nCanada submits that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention by asserting jurisdiction despite the dispute settlement exclusion in Article II(4)(b) regarding GTH's claims related to Canada's National Security Review. This annullable error stems from the Majority's untenable jurisdictional finding that the review of GTH's ICA Application did not relate to the acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of an enterprise under Article II(4)(b), and its failure to apply the proper law in coming to its conclusions.54\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 51.\n\n95.\n\nCanada contends that the Tribunal was bound by the limitation embodied in the BIT's Article II(4)(b) but that it failed to apply such a provision, which was the proper applicable law, and that such failure amounts to a manifest excess of its powers. Canada states that Article II(4)(b) is a jurisdictional provision which limits the BIT Parties' consent to arbitrate and the Tribunal's powers to decide certain disputes.55\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 51-52.\n\n96.\n\nCanada contends that its treaty practice and domestic legislation, which relevance the Majority dismissed, clearly establish that the exclusion was designed to capture reviews of acquisitions under the ICA Act, including acquisitions of voting control of enterprises. The ICA, which applied to the review of GTH's proposed transaction, is Canada's primary mechanism for reviewing acquisitions of investments.56\n\nCanada's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 14.\n\n97.\n\nCanada alleges that in considering what constitutes the \"acquisition of an existing business enterprise\" within the meaning of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT, the Majority purported to interpret these terms in accordance with the VCLT, while in effect disregarding the proper rules of treaty interpretation.57 Despite purporting to apply the VCLT, the Majority completely failed to consider the ordinary meaning of the terms in Article II(4)(b) and to take into account the context of the terms \"acquisition of an existing business enterprise.\"58\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 55.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 57.\n\n98.\n\nIn fact, Canada alleges that Black's Law Dictionary defines the term \"acquisition\" as \"the gaining of possession or control over something.\" The ordinary meaning of \"acquisition of an existing business enterprise\" therefore must be understood to include the action of obtaining or gaining possession or control over an existing business enterprise. Conversely, the acquisition of control of an enterprise is also an acquisition of an existing enterprise as it is generally understood in corporate merger and acquisition transactions.59\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 58.\n\n99.\n\nCanada contends that the Tribunal did not conduct a proper interpretation in the light of Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the ordinary meaning of the terms in their context and in the light of their object and purpose, and instead relied on the absence of a specific reference to acquisition of voting control as different from acquisition of a share in the text of the BIT. According to Canada, the exclusion embodied in Article II(4)(b) of the BIT refers to the authorizations required under domestic law with respect to the acquisition of ownership or control of an enterprise. It insists that, on the facts of the case, it is clear that GTH was seeking to acquire Wind Mobile through its ICA Application. The ICA review was triggered precisely because an acquisition of voting shares of Wind Mobile was contemplated, and the acquisition of these shares would have amounted to an acquisition of Wind Mobile through an acquisition of control.60\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 59-62; Canada's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 47.\n\n100.\n\nCanada states that even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the proposed transaction submitted to the regulatory authorities involved only a conversion of GTH's Class D non-voting shares into Class B voting shares in Wind Mobile, the Majority's findings would remain contradictory. Nowhere in the Award does the Majority explain the contradiction between the fact that Wind Mobile would have become a foreign owned and controlled common carrier within the meaning of the O&C Rules after the transaction, and the fact that the same transaction allegedly did not amount to a foreign acquisition of a common carrier for the purposes of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT.61\n\nCanada's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 52.\n\n101.\n\nCanada does not argue that the Majority's application of the VCLT, although clearly deficient and inadequate, was a failure to apply the proper law. Canada points to the Majority's perfunctory VCLT analysis to highlight the process that led to such a manifestly incorrect interpretation of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT. For example, while the Majority purported to come to its conclusion \"in conformity with the general rule of interpretation in Article 31(1)\" by referring to the ordinary meaning of \"acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise\", it is impossible to understand how the VCLT allowed the Majority to read in the term \"ownership\" but not the term \"control\" in interpreting what constitutes an acquisition of an enterprise or share thereof.62\n\nCanada's Reply on Partial Annulment, paras. 22-23.\n\n102.\n\nCanada insists that the Tribunal also failed to correctly state the object and purpose of the Treaty, portraying it as being limited to the protection and promotion of investors and failing to recognize that the Contracting Parties to the Treaty also sought to maintain certain regulatory flexibilities and oversight over their investment policy.63 And it concludes that, in the light of the Tribunal's finding,64 the exercise of GTH's share conversion rights was subject to the ICA Act, the Majority's conclusion that GTH's ICA Application did not relate to the Acquisition of Wind Mobile is untenable. [REDACTED], would GTH have acquired Wind Mobile, so that in finding that the ICA Application did not relate to the acquisition of Wind Mobile, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.65\n\nCanada's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 24.\n\nAward, para. 71.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 68-71.\n\n103.\n\nCanada challenges the Majority's finding that the proposed share conversion in GTH's ICA Application would not have amounted to the acquisition of a share of an enterprise. Canada contends that having conversion rights is fundamentally different from owning the shares that would be obtained as a result of the exercise of the conversion right. A conversion right is equivalent to an option to acquire a share: before exercising the option, the option-holder does not own the share itself. It points out that the Tribunal recognized that the conversion rights were conditional on liberalization of the O&C Rules and obtaining ICA approval.66 It further states that the Shareholder's Agreement clearly reflects the fact that the share conversion of Class D shares would result in the acquisition of newly issued additional Class B voting shares.67\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 73.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 76.\n\n104.\n\nCanada concludes that finding that the ICA Application did not concern the acquisition of a share of Wind Mobile is a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention, because it is plainly contradicted by the evidence before the Tribunal.68\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 79.\n\n105.\n\nCanada submits that GTH's ICA Application was not limited to the acquisition of new voting shares through the conversion of Class D shares. It also included the acquisition of AAL's shares in Wind Mobile, ultimately leading to GTH indirectly owning 99 percent of Wind Mobile's issued and outstanding shares. And that proves, according to Canada, that it related to an acquisition of shares of an existing business enterprise within the meaning of Article II(4)(b).69\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 81.\n\n106.\n\nCanada submits that the Tribunal departed from its duty to decide the dispute in accordance with the rules of law agreed by the Parties. It failed to consider the ICA Act in determining what constitutes an acquisition of an enterprise in the context of foreign arbitration. It also failed to apply the applicable law, the OBCA.70\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 82.\n\n107.\n\nCanada does not suggest that domestic law was the applicable law for the purpose of determining a breach of the Treaty or that it formed the only basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Rather, domestic law had to be applied in the context of interpreting and applying the jurisdictional provision in Article II(4)(b).71 Canada relies on numerous authorities which have noted that it is necessary to rely on domestic law in order to establish the existence and scope of certain facts on which jurisdiction depends. \"Just like in *Fireman's Fund v Mexico* and *Gallo v Canada,* the definitions of 'investment' and 'enterprise' in Article 1 of the Treaty contain a *renvoi* to domestic law that must be taken into consideration when interpreting Article II(4)(b), which is a dispute settlement exclusion related to the acquisition of certain investments, e.g., enterprises and shares thereof.\"72\n\nCanada's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 27.\n\nCanada's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 29.\n\n108.\n\nCanada insists once again that the concepts of ownership and control should have been defined by domestic law, following the approach of *Nelson v Mexico.* Therefore, the Tribunal's failure to apply the relevant domestic law in making its findings on these questions constitutes a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. Further, the need to refer to domestic law in interpreting \"acquisition of an enterprise\" and \"ownership\" or \"control\" of an enterprise is reinforced here by the direct *renvoi* to domestic law in Article 1(f) of the Treaty.73\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 84-85, 88.\n\n109.\n\nCanada responds to the claim that it did not provide evidence on national law regarding the share conversion process during the underlying Arbitration by stating that \"the Claimant never argued that they were relevant considerations. Moreover, the Tribunal never raised the issues or allowed Canada an opportunity to present evidence of Canadian corporate law which addresses these issues.\"74\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 98.\n\n***b. GTH\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------\n\n110.\n\nGTH submits that while Canada advances three different Article 52(1) grounds for annulment, each of them is the iteration of its disagreement with the decision and the introduction of new elements Canada never presented to the Tribunal. First, the Majority applied the proper law, and was not obliged to apply domestic law, in reaching a decision that was tenable in the light of the VCLT, and the Majority's assessment of evidence is not subject to review in annulment. Second, the Majority articulated its reasons for finding that GTH sought neither to acquire Wind Mobile nor to obtain ownership of a share thereof, and it addressed Canada's ancillary argument on the scope of the Voting Control Application. Third, Canada was given the right to be heard on its Article II(4)(B) objection.75\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 3-6.\n\n111.\n\nGTH contends that Canada has failed to establish that the Majority committed an excess of powers under either basis, let alone a manifest excess of powers.76\n\nCD-02, Slide 19.\n\n112.\n\nGTH contends that the Majority applied the proper law. It argues that Canadian law was not the applicable law but rather, as provided for in Article XIII(7) of the BIT, the BIT and applicable rules of international law. Accordingly, in its analysis of the Article II(4)(b) objection, the Majority applied the BIT provisions and international law.77\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 43, 45; GTH's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 10.\n\n113.\n\nGTH alleges that there is no *renvoi* to domestic law in the BIT to suggest the Majority should have considered domestic law when interpreting Article II(4)(b).78 It also alleges that Canada attempts to import into Article II(4)(b) \"irrelevant\" references to domestic law that appear in Article I of the BIT and, even assuming *arguendo* that those references are relevant, how they would have factored into the Tribunal's analyzis of Article II(4)(b).79 It adds that Canada's complaint concerns the Tribunal's consideration of domestic law as a fact, which is not a ground for annulment. Finally, it adduces that even assuming that was a ground for annulment (which is not), Canada never advanced its arguments regarding the application of Ontario Law in the Arbitration.80\n\nGTH's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 12.\n\nGTH's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 13.\n\nGTH's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, paras. 14-15.\n\n114.\n\nAccording to GTH, Canada's argument, that since the terms used in Article II(4)(b) are not defined in the BIT nor in international law they had to be interpreted according to Canadian law, collides with Article 31 of the VCLT which points to the ordinary meaning of the terms in their context and in the light of the BIT's object and purpose. GTH alleges that none of the authorities advanced by Canada is useful to its argument that the Tribunal had to apply domestic (Canadian) law.81\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 47-48.\n\n115.\n\nFinally, GTH considers that Canada's argument relates to alleged errors in the Majority's analysis, which in any case do not give rise to annulment. The Tribunal had the discretion to determine whether the ICA Act was relevant or not to its interpretation of Article II(4)(b) and it did so, and even when Canada may not agree with its conclusions, that disagreement is not a ground for annulment.82\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 51.\n\n116.\n\nRegarding Canada's argument that the OBCA should have been the leading domestic text for interpretation, GTH adduces that such was never referenced by either Party during the Arbitration. Even when Canada admits there was an absence of evidence, it argues that it was because the Tribunal never raised the issue nor invited Canada to present evidence. Canada does not explain how the Tribunal failed to give it an opportunity to produce evidence. GTH considers Canada's arguments in this sense as new arguments it never made during the Arbitration and, finding support in Procedural Order No. 2, it affirms that annulment proceedings are not the proper place to make new arguments.83\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 52-53.\n\n117.\n\nGTH argues that Canada has not shown why the Majority's decision is untenable.84 In fact, the Majority followed GTH's presentation on that point.85 It applied the interpretation rule embodied in Article 31(1) of the VCLT. The Majority then applied the VCLT in coming to a reasonable and supported interpretation. Even if there were errors in the Majority's application of the VCLT, or partial non-application of some principles of interpretation contained in the VCLT, it still applied the proper law.86 These do not amount to excess of power.\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 55.\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 57 refers to GTH's Reply on Merits and Damages and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 156, 161; GTH's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, paras. 35-42 and GTH's Post-Hearing Submission, para. 52.\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 59-60.\n\n118.\n\nGTH finally alleges that, even if the Committee finds that the Majority committed any excess of powers in dismissing the Article II(4)(b) objection, such excess is not \"manifest.\" For the reasons explained above, the Majority's purported excess is not \"obvious, clear or self-evident\", nor is the decision unreasonable on its face.87\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 64.\n\n119.\n\nGTH indicates that to annul the Award for a manifest excess of powers based on untenable findings, this Committee must find that no tribunal could have reasonably reached the conclusion that the Majority did.88\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 41, 55; GTH's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 17.\n\n120.\n\nGTH alleges that Canada has failed to establish that the Majority's decision to dismiss Canada's Article II(4)(b) objection amounts to an excess of powers, let alone a \"manifest\" excess warranting annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.89\n\nGTH's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 8.\n\n121.\n\nFor those reasons, GTH submits that Canada's request to annul the Majority's decision on Article II(4)(b) objection as a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) must be dismissed.\n\n**(2) The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Committee considers that in order to determine whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers it must examine whether the Tribunal properly identified the applicable law and endeavoured to apply such law for the question of jurisdiction.\n\n123.\n\nIn paragraph 326 of the Award, the Tribunal stated that it \"must determine the scope of its jurisdiction with reference to the terms of the BIT, as interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT.\" It also noted that \"[c]onsistent with its alleged practice, Canada could have specifically referred to its foreign ownership and control legislation in Article II(4)(b) of the BIT; it has not done so, although the ICA Act had been enacted in 1985 and, as such, predated the BIT.\"90\n\nAward, para. 326.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal further stated that it was not persuaded by Canada's argument that the conversion of Class D non-voting shares to Class B voting shares involved a return of the exchange of share certificates with enhanced ability to vote and did not involve a sale of Class B shares to achieve the conversion. The language consistently used in the Amended and Restated Shareholder's Agreement is for conversion which involved the exercise of a pre-existing right that GTH had already acquired.91 The Tribunal found support for this in a statement by a Canadian high ranking official who had taken the view that GTH was \"executing an option that [it] has held since its original investment in 2009 to convert nonvoting to voting shares.\"92\n\nAward, para. 329.\n\nAward, para. 330.\n\n125.\n\nRegarding the \"proper VCLT analysis\" referred to by Canada,93 it is not for the Committee to examine whether the Tribunal's interpretation of the Treaty is correct or incorrect. Such assessment would be equivalent to an appeal and to a *de novo* review of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, which is beyond the Committee's powers under the ICSID Convention.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 60.\n\n126.\n\nCanada argues that when GTH made its investment in Wind Mobile in 2008, GTH did not acquire Wind Mobile. It also states that the Majority recognized that the exercise of GTH's conversion rights to acquire ownership of a majority of voting shares in Wind Mobile was subject to applicable laws as well as the ICA Act, and that the ICA review was triggered because an acquisition of voting shares was contemplated which would have amounted to an acquisition of Wind Mobile through acquisition of control. Canada alleges that those two statements are untenable at the same time.94\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 66, 68-70.\n\n127.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal considered Canada's arguments and found that even when Subsection 28(1) of the ICA Act includes a reference to the acquisition of voting control, \"the difficulty for Canada is that the BIT refers to the 'acquisition of an existing business enterprise, or a share of an enterprise,' but not to the acquisition of voting control. One cannot be held to be necessarily subsumed in the other.\"95\n\nAward, para. 332.\n\n128.\n\nTherefore, the Committee acknowledges that the Tribunal stated that the acquisition of control required ICA review, because the ICA Act refers to \"control\" explicitly, but that the BIT only refers to acquisition in the sense of ownership.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal clarified its choice in the following way: \"[i]t should be added that the object and purpose of the treaty - a general interpretation standard under Article 31(1) of the VCLT - commands that potentially choosing a broad interpretation of the terms of the treaty so as to read a reference to an 'acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise' as including an acquisition of legal control should only be considered with caution. Broadening exclusions from the protections accorded in the BIT by a Contracting Party to nationals of the other Contracting Party, beyond their explicit terms, would hardly be conducive to the encouragement of the creation of favourable conditions for investors to make investments.\"96\n\nAward, para. 333.\n\n130.\n\nThe Majority of the Tribunal did not share the minority's view that \"from the point of view of the Contracting Parties, for whose benefit the Article II(4) exception is established, the acquisition of control is at least as significant in the context of the control of foreign investment (with which the BIT is by its nature essentially concerned) as is the acquisition of rights of financial participation in a business without any correlative rights to control that business.\"97\n\nAward, para. 336.\n\n131.\n\nCanada also alleges that \"GTH's ICA Application was not limited to the acquisition of new voting shares through the conversion of Class D shares. It also included the acquisition of AAL's shares in Wind Mobile, ultimately leading to GTH indirectly owning 99 percent of Wind Mobile's issued and outstanding shares\" and \"[g]iven that the transaction under review also included GTH's proposal to acquire AAL's shares in Wind Mobile, it is obvious that it related to an acquisition of shares of an existing business enterprise within the meaning of Article II(4)(b). The Tribunal therefore did not have jurisdiction over Canada's decision under the ICA Act with respect to the proposed transaction and the resulting acquisition of voting shares of Wind Mobile. As a result, by asserting jurisdiction, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\"98\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 80-81.\n\n132.\n\nThe Committee observes that the Tribunal had taken note that \"[REDACTED] Ultimately, GTH would have held over 99 percent of the voting and equity shares of Wind Mobile.\"99 As indicated in the Award, in the Tribunal's view it is the acquisition of voting control that triggers the ICA's Application. However, the Tribunal added that the acquisition of voting control could not be assimilated to acquisition of new enterprise or of a share thereof and so it was outside the exclusion set out in Article II(4)(b) of the BIT.100\n\nAward, para. 309.\n\nAward, para. 332.\n\n133.\n\nCanada submits that the Majority manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law in coming to its conclusions with respect to Article II(4)(b). Canada argues that \"given that the concepts of acquisition, ownership, and control of investments depend on domestic law, the Tribunal could not interpret these terms without reference to Canada's domestic law, as decided in *Nelson v Mexico.*\"101 Canada challenges GTH's arguments on the lack of evidence on Canadian law before the Tribunal on the grounds that Claimant never argued that they were relevant considerations and that the Tribunal had not granted Canada an opportunity to present evidence. It also argues that the Majority's reasoning with respect to the share conversion ignores the applicable domestic law or makes implicit assumptions about domestic law that are plainly erroneous.102\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 82.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 86-89.\n\n134.\n\nThe Committee recalls that in *Nelson v Mexico*, the respondent alleged that the meaning of corporate control had to be determined considering the *lex situs* (i.e., in that case, Mexican law), and the \"tribunal agree[d] with the respondent in that, in the case of a company such as [\u2026] the determination of whether or not the claimant has 'corporate control' of the corporation is also a matter of Mexican law.\"103\n\n*Joshua Dean Nelson v The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/17/1, Final Award, June 5, 2020, paras. 190-191 (**RL-389**).\n\n135.\n\nIn its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Canada submits that \"[t]he terms 'acquisition of an existing business enterprise or share of such enterprise' generally refer then to all forms of transactions that lead to gaining control or ownership of the enterprise, whether through share transactions, asset transactions or otherwise. For example, obtaining the majority of voting shares of an existing enterprise would therefore qualify either as the 'acquisition of shares' of an existing enterprise or the 'acquisition of an existing enterprise'.\"104 Furthermore, it stresses that \"[o]f importance to this arbitration is the review of investments that may be injurious to national security outlined in Part IV.1 of the ICA Act which applies in respect of an investment, implemented or proposed, by a non-Canadian: ... (b) to acquire control of a Canadian business in any manner described in subsection 28(1).\"105\n\nCanada's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 121.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 130.\n\n136.\n\nCanada indicates that \"[t]his provision, which sets out the scope of the national security review under the ICA, refers to the establishment of a new Canadian business and the acquisition of an existing Canadian business, and mirrors the language in Article II(4)(b) of the FIPA. Section 28(1) of the ICA Act further provides that a non-Canadian can acquire control of a Canadian business by 'the acquisition of voting shares of a corporation incorporated in Canada carrying on the Canadian business.' This acquisition of voting shares leading to control of an existing Canadian business enterprise can take place through the conversion of non-voting shares to voting shares. [REDACTED] Given this, any challenge of that decision cannot be subject to investor-State dispute settlement under the FIPA and this Tribunal is without jurisdiction over such a claim.\"106\n\nCanada's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 147.\n\n137.\n\nIn its Reply, Canada clarifies that it is not arguing that Canadian domestic law be the applicable law for the purpose of determining a breach of the Treaty or that it formed the only basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction; rather, domestic law has to be applied in the context of interpreting and applying the jurisdictional provision in Article II(4)(b).107 However, no mention is found in its Memorial on Jurisdiction of the domestic law which should have guided the Tribunal in its interpretation of the meaning of acquisition, ownership, or control.\n\nCanada's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 27.\n\n138.\n\nAs pointed out by the PCIJ in the *Case of German Interests in Upper Silesia,* \"[f]rom the standpoint of International Law and of the Court which is its organ, municipal laws are merely facts which express the will and constitute the activities of States, in the same manner as do legal decisions or administrative measures.\"108\n\n*Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v Poland),* Judgment of May 25, 1926, P.C.I.J. Reports Series A, No. 7, p. 19 (**CL-091**); GTH's Reply on Merits and Damages and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, para. 166.\n\n139.\n\nMoreover, in these annulment proceedings, Canada requested an authorization to submit new evidence on Canadian domestic law that was not included in the record of the underlying Arbitration proceedings. Canada requested the introduction of the OBCA which it deemed to be the applicable law. This Committee dismissed the request on the grounds of its non-pertinence because the annulment proceedings are not an opportunity to raise new arguments on the merits or introduce new contemporaneous evidence.109\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, Submission of New Evidence, paras. 2, 14, 27.\n\n140.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Tribunal had identified the applicable law and properly endeavoured to apply it. Accordingly, it finds no ground to conclude that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, in particular, that the non-application of domestic law in this respect would amount to an excess of powers. The Committee underscores in any case that Canada did not bring up domestic law during the underlying proceedings.\n\nB. **F****ailure to state reasons** **(A****rticle** **52(1)(****e****))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Canada's Position***\n--------------------------\n\n141.\n\nCanada contends that the Tribunal's assertion of jurisdiction over GTH's National Security Review Claims despite the wording of Article II(4)(b)\u00a0lacks any intelligible reasons that would allow the reader to understand how the Tribunal arrived at its conclusion. This is markedly different from all of its other findings in the Award. Canada states that on certain key points, the reasons expressed in the Award regarding Article II(4)(b) also contradict other findings made by the Tribunal. This further inhibits the comprehension of the Tribunal's reasoning. Such *lacunae* in the Tribunal's reasons for its decision to reject Canada's jurisdictional objection based on Article II(4)(b) constitute an annullable error and an additional ground to annul this part of the Award. It constitutes a failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based.110\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 108.\n\n142.\n\nCanada contends that it is not possible to understand which law the Tribunal applied when it asserted jurisdiction over the National Security Review Claims. To the extent any explanation was advanced, the Majority seems to have reached its conclusion based on a theory related to the treatment of corporate capital in the Shareholder's Agreement at issue that was not raised by the Claimant.111\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 151, 156.\n\n143.\n\nCanada explains that the Tribunal relied on its finding that acquisition of ownership is different from acquisition of control and that \"[o]ne cannot be held to be necessarily subsumed in the other.\" This finding led it to conclude that \"[a]bsent a reference in the BIT to the acquisition of legal control, and in conformity with the general rule of interpretation in Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the majority of the Tribunal considers that the BIT refers in Article II(4)(b) to the acquisition of an enterprise or a share thereof in the sense of ownership as opposed to control.\" Such conclusory reasoning, according to Canada, cannot satisfy the minimum requirement to state the reasons upon which an award is based. Notably missing in the Award is any analysis of what the Majority deemed was the correct interpretation of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT. In the absence of such analysis, the reader is not in a position to understand how the elements of the well-known analytical framework set out in Article 31(1) of the VCLT led the Majority to its conclusion.112\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 111-112.\n\n144.\n\nCanada submits that the Award contains no assessment of whether the ICA Application, [REDACTED], would have amounted to an acquisition of ownership of Wind Mobile. Without such an assessment, Canada adds, it is impossible to understand how the Majority came to the conclusion that the dispute settlement exclusion in Article II(4)(b) of the BIT did not apply. This failure constitutes grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.113\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 115.\n\n145.\n\nGTH argues that, contrary to Canada's assertion, the Majority's reasoning for dismissing Canada's Article II(4)(b) objection is not contradictory. There is no contradiction between: (1) the uncontested fact that GTH's initial investment in Wind Mobile complied with the O&C Rules; and (2) the Majority's finding that GTH's conversion of its non-voting shares in Wind Mobile to voting shares did not result in GTH increasing its ownership stake. In fact, the two propositions are complementary. GTH's equity ownership in Wind Mobile would have remained at 65.08 percent at all times, and the only change arising from the exercise of its conversion right was an increase in its voting shares from 32.03 percent to 65.08 percent.114\n\nGTH's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 31.\n\n146.\n\nCanada submits that the Tribunal failed to consider and address the fact that GTH's ICA Application also involved an acquisition of the shares held by AAL in Wind Mobile. The Tribunal ignored Canada's argument and evidence without providing any reasons whatsoever, although the issue was material to the outcome of Canada's jurisdictional objection under Article II(4)(b). This omission constitutes a failure to state reasons.115\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 126-128.\n\n***b. GTH\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------\n\n147.\n\nGTH alleges that the Majority did not fail to state its reasons. It considers that Canada advances the same factual complaints it has raised to support its claim that the Majority's reasoning should be annulled as a manifest excess of powers, namely, (1) the Voting Control Application did not result in an acquisition of Wind Mobile; (2) the Voting Control Application did not result in an acquisition of a share of Wind Mobile; and (3) [REDACTED]116\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n148.\n\nGTH contends that in the Award, the Majority walks through its reasons for dismissing Canada's Article II(4)(b) objection. It explains that: (1) the text of Article II(4)(b) does not encompass all ICA-related decisions and there must be an independent assessment of the provision's application to each case; (2) the ordinary meaning of the term of \"acquisition\" in Article II(4)(b), in the light of the context, object, and purpose of the BIT, did not extend to an acquisition of control and was limited to an acquisition of ownership; and (3) GTH's Voting Control Application contemplated an acquisition of control and not an acquisition of ownership because GTH was exercising a pre-existing conversion right in respect of shares it already possessed and was not acquiring new shares. For these reasons, the Majority concluded that the Voting Control Application Claims fell outside the scope of Article II(4)(b) and dismissed Canada's objection. Thus, a reader of this section of the Award is able to follow \"how the [majority] proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion.\" As Canada acknowledges, so long as a reader can \"follow how a tribunal proceeded through its reasoning\", there is no ground for annulment \"regardless of whether that reasoning includes 'a manifestly incorrect application of the law'.\" The Majority articulated a clear test which required GTH to accrue a new property interest which it did not previously possess (i.e., an \"annulment/issue/acquisition\" as opposed to a conversion).117\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 71-72.\n\n149.\n\nGTH considers that, in particular, Canada misleadingly asserts that: (1) the Tribunal found that \"GTH did not own Wind Mobile\" when it made its investment in 2008; and (2) there can \"be no doubt that a result of the transaction described in the [Voting Control] Application, GTH was seeking to become the owner of Wind Mobile.\" In fact, argues GTH, the only change between 2008, when the investment was made, and 2012, when the Voting Control Application was filed, was the possibility of lawfully increasing GTH's control of the enterprise. Thus, Canada's alleged inconsistency is false.118\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 74-75.\n\n150.\n\nGTH contends that Canada next takes issue with the Majority's alleged failure to refer to the terms of the Shareholder's Agreement and Ontario law in finding that the Voting Control Application did not relate to an acquisition of a share of Wind Mobile; but, as shown above, Canadian law was not the applicable law and, thus, the request must be dismissed.119\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 77-79.\n\n151.\n\nGTH adduces that disagreement with the Majority's reasoning is not a basis for annulment for a failure to state reasons. It states that, as Canada itself acknowledges and describes, the Majority's reasoning derives from its review and analysis of the terms of the Shareholder's Agreement. GTH considers that while Canada may disagree with the Majority's decision to reach a finding of fact based on its analysis of the Shareholder's Agreement, as opposed to referring to Canadian law (which was never presented in the Arbitration), the Majority's reasoning is intelligible and cannot amount to a failure to state120 reasons.\n\nGTH's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 34.\n\n152.\n\nGTH's Voting Control Application Claims relate to Canada's treatment of GTH's effort to convert its non-voting shares to voting shares, not the potential acquisition by GTH of AAL's shares on some later date. [REDACTED]121\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n153.\n\nGTH contends that, in any event, as Canada accepts, the Tribunal acknowledged Canada's argument that \"GTH planned a second stage of the transaction, in which it would purchase AAL and thereby acquire AAL's interests in Wind Mobile.\"122 So that Canada's request must be dismissed.\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 82.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nCanada submits that the Majority failed to state reasons for finding that GTH's proposed acquisition of voting control of Wind Mobile did not constitute the acquisition of an existing business enterprise.\n\n155.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal was not persuaded that a conversion of shares involves an acquisition of shares as advanced by Canada. First, the Tribunal relied on the Amended and Restated Shareholder's Agreement, which refers to conversion of shares and, as pointed out by the Tribunal, does so consistently. It also clarified that the fact that the shares had to be returned in order to get other class of shares does not involve an acquisition absent an *animus novandi.* Then, it recalled the statement of Canada's Assistant Deputy Minister at the time of the Voting Control Application denying acquisition.123\n\nAward, paras. 328-330.\n\n156.\n\nSecond, taking into consideration both the language of the ICA Act Section IV.I, which includes a reference to the acquisition of voting control and the acquisition, in whole or in part, or the establishment of an entity carrying on all or any part of its operations in Canada, and of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT, which refers only to \"acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise\", the Tribunal concluded that the acquisition of an enterprise or of a share thereof is a different concept than the acquisition of control. In this sense, the Tribunal was reluctant to equate the conversion of shares that GTH already had into voting shares to an acquisition of shares.124\n\nAward, para. 332: \"One cannot be held to be necessarily subsumed in the other. Absent a reference in the BIT to the acquisition of legal control, and in conformity with the general rule of interpretation in Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the majority of the Tribunal considers that the BIT refers in Article II(4)(b) to the acquisition of an enterprise or a share thereof in the sense of ownership as opposed to control.\"\n\n157.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal did not accept Canada's assertion that the challenged measures fall within the scope of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT as a decision not to permit the acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise and rejected the objection on jurisdiction.125\n\nAward, para. 334.\n\n158.\n\nCanada further argues that the Award contains contradictory findings that make it impossible to understand the reasons for which the Majority asserted jurisdiction over GTH's National Security Review Claims. Canada alleges that the finding that GTH's claims relating to its ICA Application fell within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal appears to contradict the Tribunal's unanimous finding that GTH's initial investment in Wind Mobile in 2008 complied with the O&C Rules. It also appears to contradict the finding that the conversion rights in the Shareholder's Agreement were subject to ICA approval. Indeed, the Tribunal accepted that GTH did not own Wind Mobile, which should necessarily have led the Majority to conclude that the proposed acquisition would have entailed an acquisition of ownership of Wind Mobile.126\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 116.\n\n159.\n\nThe Committee underscores that it is not the Tribunal which asserted that GTH's investment complied with the O&C Rules but rather Canada's judiciary in a decision by the Federal Court of Appeals of 8 June 2011, as indicated in the Award.127\n\nAward, para. 55.\n\n160.\n\nThe Committee also finds that the Tribunal decided that the proposed conversion of shares was subject to ICA Act, as indicated in its section IV.I, and was different from an acquisition of an existing business or a share thereof because the BIT was concluded after the ICA Act, so if it intended to exclude the acquisition of control, the BIT could have been more explicit.128\n\nAward, para. 332.\n\n161.\n\nCanada also alleges that as a result of the transaction described in the ICA Application, GTH was seeking to become the owner of Wind Mobile. Had the transaction gone ahead, GTH would have indirectly owned over 99 percent of both the voting shares and the equity of Wind Mobile.\n\n162.\n\n[REDACTED]129 As such when Canada asserts that \"[h]ad the transaction gone ahead, GTH would have indirectly owned over 99 percent of both the voting shares and the equity of Wind Mobile\", [REDACTED]130\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nC-027, p. 1, p. 5ii.\n\n163.\n\nCanada argues that although the Majority does not explain the test it applied to determine what constitutes ownership of an enterprise, such an extensive interest in Wind Mobile would satisfy any reasonable definition of the term. Moreover, the evidence on the record demonstrates that GTH shared this understanding. [REDACTED]131\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n164.\n\n[REDACTED]132 Thus, the Committee finds Canada's allegations on this point unpersuasive.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n165.\n\nCanada alleges that the Maj ority failed to state reasons for finding that GTH did not acquire a share of Wind Mobile. The Committee however finds that the Tribunal made clear the difference between the acquisition of an existing business or a share thereof, as provided for in Article II(4)(b) - an operation which was beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction - and the acquisition of control, as provided for in the ICA Act Section IV.I. As indicated above in this Decision, the Committee finds that the Tribunal explained the reasons that led it to such a distinction. It is not within the Committee's mandate to appraise the decision taken. Suffice it to state that the Tribunal's reasons are there and can be followed.\n\n166.\n\nCanada alleges that the Tribunal avoided considering that the share conversion of GTH's non-voting shares impliedly extended to the acquisition of shares that AAL held in Wind Mobile. As explained above, the Committee has reviewed the Parties' arguments and also the documents supporting the Award. [REDACTED]\n\n167.\n\nGiven all of the above, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did state its reasons in a way that allows the reader to follow from point A to point B. Therefore, the Committee dismisses this ground for annulment.\n\nC. **S****erious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure** **(A****rticle** **52(1)(****d****))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Canada's Position***\n--------------------------\n\n168.\n\nCanada submits that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, as provided for in Article 52(1)(d), because GTH never argued that Article II(4)(b) of the BIT was limited to acquisition of ownership of an enterprise, and the Tribunal never allowed Canada to address this unexpected and unreasonable interpretation.\n\n169.\n\nCanada argues that it was denied the right to be heard regarding the finding on Article II(4)(b)\u00a0three times: when the Tribunal interpreted the terms ownership and control without providing Canada with the opportunity to address such interpretation; when the Tribunal decided that acquisition of the majority did not involve acquisition of control because it considered that the Shareholder's Agreement should have contained a more detailed description of the share conversion process and the treatment of corporate capital; and, finally, when the Tribunal failed to engage with Canada's argument and evidence pertaining to GTH's proposed indirect acquisition of AAL's shares in Wind Mobile (which together with the share conversion would have resulted in GTH owning over 99 percent of the voting shares and of the equity in Wind Mobile).133 Canada considers it had no opportunity to respond to the reading of Article II(4)(b) that the Majority ultimately adopted.134\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 151.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 152.\n\n170.\n\nCanada asserts that the Majority never gave it an opportunity to explain that the Shareholder's Agreement had to be read with the applicable governing law, the OBCA, which specifically addresses treatment of corporate capital in the case of share conversions.135 Canada contends that it was denied its right to be heard on GTH's proposal to acquire AAL's shares in Wind Mobile.136\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 156.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 157.\n\n171.\n\nIn its Reply, Canada contends that the implications of these errors are particularly serious because, if allowed to stand, the Majority flawed findings on Article II(4)(b) provide a roadmap for foreign investors to structure their investments in such a way as to circumvent the dispute settlement exclusion in all of Canada's treaties that contain similarly worded dispute settlement provisions.137\n\nCanada's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 4.\n\n***b. GTH's Position***\n-----------------------\n\n172.\n\nFor its part, GTH affirms that Canada was given the right to be heard on the Article II(4)(b)\u00a0objection. It states that \"[i]n the Arbitration, both Parties were given the opportunity to extensively brief the Article II(4)(b) objection in written and oral submissions. Canada has not, nor could it, identified any points in the hearing where it was prevented from adducing evidence or making arguments in support of its preferred interpretation of Article II(4)(b).\"138\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 89.\n\n173.\n\nRegarding the three times on which Canada allegedly was denied the right to be heard, GTH submits the following arguments. First, Canada had the opportunity to address the proper test for determining ownership under Article II(4)(b) of the BIT. The ordinary meaning of the terms of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT was addressed extensively by the Parties, and the Majority's finding that Article II(4)(b) addresses the acquisition of ownership was squarely within that legal framework. Contrary to Canada's allegation that GTH never raised the argument, GTH affirmatively raised the argument that the Tribunal should limit the meaning of Article II(4)(b) to an acquisition of ownership. Canada then responded to this argument, albeit less than fulsomely. GTH made an argument and Canada was given the opportunity to respond. Therefore, concludes GTH, Canada's right to be heard has not been denied.139\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 90.\n\n174.\n\nSecond, GTH submits that the nature and effect of the share conversion process described in the Shareholder's Agreement was addressed by both Parties and, once again, the Majority's finding that the conversion of shares was not an acquisition of a share was squarely within the legal framework. GTH submits that the Majority adopted GTH's submission in the Award. Further, the Majority's use of the word \"enhanced\" does not make its finding a \"new theory.\"140\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 91.\n\n175.\n\nThird, according to GTH, the Majority sufficiently engaged with Canada's argument with respect to GTH's contemplated acquisition of AAL's shares in Wind Mobile.141\n\nGTH's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 92.\n\n176.\n\nFinally, in its Rejoinder, GTH argues that these claims are wholly without merit; that Canada does not come close to establishing a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure that would warrant annulment under Article 52(1)(d) and that the new arguments advanced in Canada's Annulment Reply are incorrect and unavailing.142\n\nGTH's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 43.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nCanada alleges that its right to be heard \u2013 which is a fundamental rule of procedure \u2013 was denied three times, namely, because it had no opportunity to explain what is meant by \"acquisition of an existing business or a share thereof\" under Canadian law; because it was not called to make its views known on the theory of the Tribunal regarding the conversion of shares and regarding GTH's acquisition of AAL's shares.143 It further alleges that the Tribunal adopted an interpretation of Article II(4)(b) that neither party raised in their pleadings.\n\nCanada's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 151.\n\n178.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the Parties' submissions in the underlying Arbitration. It notes that in Canada's Memorial on Jurisdiction, Canada proposed an interpretation of the words \"decision\", \"acquisition\" and \"establishment\" in accordance with definitions in the Oxford Dictionary. It also notes that Canada advanced its position that the acquisition of the voting control was included in the acquisition of an existing business or a share thereof as provided for in Article II(4)(b) of the BIT.144\n\nCanada's Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, paras. 120-121.\n\n179.\n\nThe Committee also notes that in its Reply on Merits and Damages and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, GTH introduces the distinction between the acquisition of an existing business or a share thereof and the acquisition of voting control. It concludes that \"[a]s is plain from the above, Article II(4) is only relevant in the context of Canada's decisions or decision-making relating to an 'acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise' or an 'establishment of a new business enterprise.' An investor cannot acquire or establish something it already owns.\"145\n\nGTH's Reply on Merits and Damages and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 160-161.\n\n180.\n\nTherefore, the Committee is not persuaded by Canada's allegation that the Tribunal adopted an interpretation of Article II(4)(b) that neither party raised in the proceedings. In the Committee's view, the Tribunal applied international law, viz., the rules on treaty interpretation embodied in the VCLT. In doing so, the Tribunal decided to follow GTH's interpretation of the BIT's relevant provisions. Further, in the Committee's view what Canada qualifies as a theory is not a \"theory\" but rather a description of what the Tribunal deemed a (hypothetical) transaction such as the one described by Canada would have looked like. An illustration used as part of its reasoning and intended to explain or clarify the Tribunal's basis cannot be said to take any party by surprise and cannot translate into a breach of the duty to be heard.\n\n181.\n\nCanada alleges that it was not invited to make its views known on the theory of the Tribunal regarding the conversion of shares. The Committee finds this allegation unpersuasive. First, Canada does not specify the alleged theory nor its content. In the Committee's view the Tribunal elaborated on the conversion of shares process accepting the arguments put forward by GTH in its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, mainly but not exclusively in paragraph 163. It supported its decision on the language consistently used in the Amended and Restated Shareholder's Agreement. The Committee is reluctant to consider that this is a \"theory\" encompassing arguments that were not put forward by the Parties. Rather it views the Tribunal's position as following the arguments advanced by GTH in its written piece and supported with an interpretation of the Shareholder's Agreement in the light of the rules on treaty interpretation embodied in the VCLT. The fact that the Tribunal follows one of the Parties' argument does not mean that it has not given the opportunity to be heard to the other.\n\n182.\n\nFinally, Canada alleges it was not heard on GTH's acquisition of AAL's shares. The Committee has already considered this argument in this Decision and will once again stress that, as the Tribunal pointed out, [REDACTED]146\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n183.\n\nIn the light of the above, and in application of the standard as set out in Section IV.C., the Committee finds that Canada was not deprived of its right to be heard in the Arbitration and, in particular, that it was not deprived of its right to be heard on the specific aspects raised by Canada. Indeed, for the reasons set out above, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not surprise the Parties with an issue or a theory that neither party brought to the record, and it ensured that each party had an effective opportunity to be heard on the crucial points of the reasoning adopted. Given that the Committee does not find a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, it does not need to analyse the second tier, viz, whether it is a \"serious\" one.\n\n184.\n\nThus, the Committee finds that this ground for annulment should be dismissed. In summary, the Committee dismisses Canada's application for annulment.\n\n**VI. GTH'S APPLICATION**\n-------------------------\n\n185.\n\nGTH submits that it is clear on the face of the Award that the Tribunal has failed to discharge its duties. First, the Tribunal founded its decision on the absence of certain evidence yet acknowledged the existence of that very evidence elsewhere in its Award. Second, the Tribunal did not decide one of GTH's standalone dispositive claims. Third, the Tribunal failed to address critical arguments and failed to state reasons for key findings. Fourth, the Tribunal decided one claim on the basis of a legal argument that was not advanced by either Party. Fifth, the Majority manifestly exceeded its power by declining to exercise jurisdiction over a claim that the Tribunal patently had jurisdiction to decide.147\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 3.\n\n186.\n\nSpecifically, first adds GTH, the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Blocked Sale Claim amounted to a failure to state reasons. First, the Tribunal's reasoning was contradictory with respect to GTH's claim that Canada breached its FET obligation by frustrating GTH's legitimate expectations. Second, the Tribunal failed to address GTH's argument that Canada breached its FET obligation because its decision to block GTH from being able to sell its investment was disproportionate; then, the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Free Transfer Claim amounted to (1) a failure to state reasons because it failed to address GTH's argument that the BIT protected transfers of investments and not just funds, and (2) a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure because it justified its interpretation by relying on arguments that were not advanced by either Party. Finally, the Majority's decision to decline jurisdiction over the National Treatment Claim on the basis of Article IV(2)(d)\u00a0and the Annex of the BIT amounted to (1) a manifest excess of powers because it declined to exercise jurisdiction despite finding that it had jurisdiction over the National Treatment Claim, and (2) a failure to state reasons because its interpretation of Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex lacked foundation and did not address key issues advanced by GTH.148\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 5.\n\n187.\n\nGTH states that in early 2008, it identified the purchase of set-aside spectrum licenses as a promising investment opportunity in the Canadian telecommunications market. Given the high upfront capital costs involved, GTH made the decision to invest after conducting the due diligence and carefully reviewing the Investment Framework. In particular, while GTH's objective at the outset of the investment was to create a long-term and successful New Entrant, the ability to transfer set-aside spectrum licenses to Incumbents on expiration of the five-year restriction provided a safety-net in the event the investment was unsuccessful.149\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 13.\n\n188.\n\nGTH explains that in July 2008, Wind Mobile was declared the provisional winner of 30 set-aside spectrum licenses in the 2008 AWS Auction for a total of CAD$ 442 million, and GTH paid for the set-aside spectrum licenses in August 2008. Canada raised CAD$ 4.3 billion in revenue through the 2008 AWS Auction.150\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 15.\n\n189.\n\nAccording to GTH, almost immediately following GTH's investment, Canada not only reneged on the fundamental conditions underpinning the Investment Framework but engaged in conduct which specifically targeted and harmed GTH and its investment. This delayed the launch of Wind Mobile and denied it a valuable first mover advantage *vis-\u00e0-vis* other New Entrants.151\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 16.\n\nA. **M****anifest excess of powers** **(A****rticle** **52(1)(****b****))**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. GTH's Position***\n-----------------------\n\n190.\n\nGTH considers that the Majority's decision to decline jurisdiction over GTH's National Treatment Claim on the basis of Article IV(2)(d) should be annulled because it amounts to manifest excess of powers.\n\n191.\n\nGTH states that in the Arbitration, it alleged that Canada breached its National Treatment obligation by subjecting GTH's Voting Control Application to a national security review procedure that only applies to foreign investors (the \"National Treatment Claim\"). In response, Canada objected to the Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide the National Treatment Claim, alleging that its measures were excepted from its National Treatment obligations by virtue of Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex of the BIT. Canada conceded that, in the event the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction, it had no defence to the merits of GTH's National Treatment claim and accepted liability.152\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 85.\n\n192.\n\nAs GTH explains in its Memorial, the Majority's finding must be annulled for two reasons: (1) the Majority's decision to decline to exercise jurisdiction which it possessed amounted to a manifest excess of powers in violation of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and (2) the Majority's analysis of Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex failed to address key arguments and reach critical findings, amounting to a failure to state reasons in violation of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.153\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 87.\n\n193.\n\nFor these reasons, GTH requests that the Committee annul the Majority's decision on the National Treatment Claim, as reflected in paragraph 728 of the *dispositif* and the corresponding paragraphs in the Award related to the National Treatment Claim (paragraphs 363-80, 683).154\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 88.\n\n194.\n\nGTH submits that despite the Majority's admission that Canada's jurisdictional objection to GTH's National Treatment Claim should have been advanced as a question of admissibility or merits (and was not a matter of jurisdiction), the Majority found that it did not have jurisdiction over the National Treatment Claim.155\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 89.\n\n195.\n\nGTH contends that the Majority declined jurisdiction to resolve the National Treatment Claim despite recognizing that Canada's \"jurisdictional\" objection was not a matter of jurisdiction at all. It considers that it was not open to the Tribunal to do so. If the Tribunal had in fact \"address[ed] Canada's objection as pleaded by the Parties\"- i.e., as a jurisdictional objection-it should have dismissed the objection and confirmed that it had jurisdiction. As committees have repeatedly explained, \"it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having jurisdiction under a BIT in respect of a claim based upon a substantive provision of that BIT, to dismiss the claim\", including by erroneously characterizing something as a jurisdictional requirement-i.e., adding a new jurisdictional requirement that does not exist in the BIT. By doing so, the Majority acted \"too little\" and failed to fulfil its mandate. Therefore, the Majority exceeded its powers by wrongly denying jurisdiction over GTH's National Treatment Claim.156\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 92.\n\n196.\n\nGTH insists that the Majority is not permitted to accept Canada's objection as a jurisdictional issue on the basis that \"[r]egardless of how one chooses to characterise Canada's objection, its operation is the same.\" The distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility or merits is important and cannot be blurred. The former relates to the scope of a tribunal's mandate to decide a particular dispute, whereas the latter is an assessment of substantive rights. A finding on jurisdiction is a precursor to a tribunal making an assessment of the admissibility or merits of a claim. The difference between the two concepts is not merely theoretical but can have practical consequences.157\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 93-94.\n\n197.\n\nBased on the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the National Treatment Claimant as a matter of jurisdiction, the Tribunal incorrectly placed the onus on GTH to show that its National Treatment Claim fell outside Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex, when in fact it should have been Canada's burden to demonstrate that the provisions applied to exclude GTH's investment from its National Treatment obligation.158\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 94.\n\n198.\n\nTherefore, concludes GTH, the Majority's decision to decline jurisdiction over the National Treatment Claim, while recognizing that Canada's objection was not a matter of jurisdiction, was a clear excess of powers. The \"manifest\" nature of this excess of powers is underscored by the Majority's frank acknowledgment that Canada's objection was not a jurisdictional objection. By the Majority's own admission, \"Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT concerns exceptions to national treatment, which is a substantive protection granted under the BIT\", and does not concern exceptions to the Tribunal's jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute. The Majority's failure is \"obvious\", \"clear\", and \"self-evident\" and amounts to a manifest excess of powers.159\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 96.\n\n199.\n\nGTH explains that the Majority's decision had serious ramifications. GTH points out that, as Prof. Born observed in his dissenting opinion, Canada conceded in the Arbitration that, if the Tribunal found it had jurisdiction over the National Treatment claim, it should be found liable on the merits. It contends that it follows from this that, if the Majority had concluded that it had jurisdiction (which it did), the Tribunal would have been obliged to find that Canada was in breach of the BIT. No other finding was open to the Tribunal because Canada had failed to articulate its claim as an admissibility objection (and even if it had done so, the Tribunal's decision may have been different). Like its refusal to exercise jurisdiction over the National Treatment Claim, this affirms that the Tribunal has done \"too little\" and failed to fulfil its mandate to resolve the merits of the National Treatment Claim in GTH's favour.160\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 97.\n\n200.\n\nIn its Reply on Annulment, GTH seeks to establish that the Tribunal's alleged mischaracterization of Canada's objection is both \"textually obvious\" and \"substantially serious.\" It argues that the text of Article IV clearly relates to the admissibility of claims and not to the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals and that, had the Tribunal correctly characterized Canada's objection, it \"could have\" dismissed the objection because Canada would have had the burden of establishing the inadmissibility of GTH's claim.161\n\nGTH's Reply on Partial Annulment, paras. 60-63.\n\n201.\n\nGTH concludes that by finding that it did not have jurisdiction over GTH's National Treatment Claim on the basis of provisions unrelated to its jurisdiction, the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the National Treatment Claim must be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.162\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 98.\n\n***b. Canada's Position***\n--------------------------\n\n202.\n\nCanada submits that the Parties mostly agree on the legal tests applicable to the grounds for annulment under Articles 52(1)(b), 52(1)(e), and 52(1)(d) of the Convention. However, it submits that there are disagreements when dealing with the specific grounds. In that sense, regarding Article 52(1)(b), it points out that in practice the Parties disagree on what constitutes a manifest error, or excess of powers.163\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 7-8.\n\n203.\n\n[REDACTED] GTH alleged that this measure caused it to divest itself of its investment and exit the Canadian market at a significant loss. The challenge was based on a number of provisions of the Treaty. Specifically, GTH claimed that the National Security Review breached the FET obligation in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty; the Full Protection and Security standard in Article II(2)(b); and the National Treatment obligation in Article IV(1).164\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 71.\n\n204.\n\nCanada challenges GTH's argument that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by upholding Canada's objection to the National Treatment Claim because it is based exclusively on what GTH claims is a mischaracterization of the nature of Article IV(2)(d). GTH does not call into question the Tribunal's interpretation and application of the exception contained in that provision. Canada states that GTH rightly does not argue that the Tribunal's interpretation and application of the National Treatment exception found in Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT amounts to a manifest excess of powers. Nor could it. Although it is possible to disagree with the Majority's interpretation of the provision, as Prof. Born did in his dissenting opinion, it cannot credibly be argued that the Majority's interpretation amounts to a manifest excess of powers. Any error in the interpretation of the provision would not meet the high threshold required by Article 52(1)(b).165\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 74.\n\n205.\n\nCanada submits that the only issue before this Committee is therefore whether the Tribunal's characterization of the exception contained in Article IV(2)(d)\u00a0as being jurisdictional in nature, and its dismissal of GTH's National Treatment Claim on that basis, amounts to a manifest excess of powers. GTH's argument is entirely based on an erroneous reading of the Award that assumes that the Tribunal made an affirmative finding that Canada's objection was an issue of admissibility. Moreover, even if the interpretation and application of Article IV(2)(d) was an issue that pertained to the admissibility of GTH's claim, which Canada denies, the characterization of the nature of the provision is inconsequential to the fate of GTH's National Treatment Claim as the Tribunal itself explicitly noted in its Award. The Tribunal's decision therefore cannot constitute a manifest excess of power and may not be annulled on that basis.166\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 75.\n\n206.\n\nAccording to GTH, \"[t]he majority concluded that Canada's jurisdictional objection to GTH's National Treatment Claim should have been advanced as a question of admissibility or the merits and was not a matter of jurisdiction.\" Canada contends that \"[e]ven a cursory reading of the Award reveals that the Majority arrived at no such conclusion. On the contrary, the Tribunal expressly stated that it would 'address Canada's objection as pleaded by the Parties' \u2013 in other words, within the legal framework presented by the parties, and therefore ruled on Canada's objection as a matter of jurisdiction, not admissibility.\"167\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 76.\n\n207.\n\nCanada submits that even if this Committee concludes that the Tribunal should have dealt with Canada's objection as a matter of admissibility and not jurisdiction, GTH's annulment application must still be dismissed as GTH has not shown that the Tribunal's failure to rule on Canada's objection as a matter of admissibility made a difference to the outcome of the Arbitration. GTH has not shown that the Tribunal would have rejected Canada's objection had it ruled on it as a question of admissibility instead of jurisdiction.168\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 80.\n\n208.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Canada states that while there is a conceptual difference between preliminary objections based on a tribunal's jurisdiction and those based on the admissibility of a claim, this conceptual difference is not always reflected in arbitral awards, particularly in awards rendered under the ICSID Convention.169 However, Canada relies on the decision adopted in April 2021 in *Mathias Kruck v Spain* where it is said \"that the distinction between those two elements is essentially that jurisdiction is an attribute of a tribunal, which has jurisdiction in respect of a certain limited category of disputes, whereas admissibility is a characteristic of the dispute actually submitted to the tribunal which, even if the dispute falls within the jurisdiction of a tribunal, may be rejected because it is for some reason (such as a failure to exhaust local remedies, in circumstances where exhaustion is required) inadmissible.\"170\n\nCanada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 54.\n\n*Mathias Kruck and others v Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/23, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, April 19, 2021, para. 192 (**RL-428**).\n\n209.\n\nIn the light of the above consideration, Canada concludes that its objection is jurisdictional in nature because it challenges an attribute of the Tribunal and not a characteristic of GTH's Claim. Therefore, it states, the Tribunal correctly ruled on Canada's objection as a matter of jurisdiction.171\n\nCanada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, paras. 55-56.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe Committee finds GTH's allegations unpersuasive. In fact, the Committee notes that the Tribunal considered and analysed the arguments put forward by the Parties in the light of the BIT and applicable international law rules. In so doing, it determined its own jurisdiction.\n\n211.\n\nIn that sense, the Tribunal noted \"as a preliminary point, \u2026 that Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT concerns exceptions to national treatment, which is a substantive protection granted under the BIT\" and commented that in its view \"the issue might be better characterised as a question of admissibility or even merits, given its relevance to substantive protection rather than to the dispute resolution provisions of the BIT. However, *this distinction carries no practical consequence in the present circumstances\u2026 Therefore, the Tribunal will address Canada's objection as pleaded by the Parties*.\"172\n\nAward, para. 363 (emphasis added).\n\n212.\n\nIt follows from the above statement that the Tribunal dealt with the objection as pleaded by the Parties, as a question of jurisdiction. At the same time, it has to be noted that the Tribunal admitted that the outcome would have been the same whether it were classified one way or the other, so the issue is not outcome-determinative. Therefore, the Committee finds no grounds for claims in these annulment proceedings regarding the [mis]characterization of Canada's objection as shown in GTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment.173\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 89, 92, 94, 96-97.\n\n213.\n\nNext the Tribunal dealt with the issue of whether Canada had validly made an exception under Article IV(2)(d) and, if so, whether the telecommunications sector is captured in that exception. The Tribunal announced it was going to interpret the relevant provisions of the BIT according to the general rule of interpretation embodied in Article 31(1) of the VCLT.174\n\nAward, para. 365.\n\n214.\n\nThe Tribunal found that Article IV(1) enshrines the right of the Parties to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation; paragraph 2 states that certain provisions of the BIT do not apply to subparagraphs a) to c); and in subparagraph d) \"the text makes clear that the right to make an exception in a sector or a matter is subject to only one condition: the sector or matter must be listed in the Annex\", where Canada lists five categories including \"social services\" and \"services in any other sector.\" The Tribunal concluded that \"this language, similar in all three authentic linguistic versions of the BIT, leaves no room for doubt that Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation with respect to 'services.' Unattractive as the result may seem to the dissenting minority, such is the Parties' agreement as recorded in the explicit terms of the BIT.\"175\n\nAward, paras. 366-367.\n\n215.\n\nOnce the Tribunal found that the Parties had the right to make exceptions to the National Treatment Obligation, it addressed the issue of whether the making or the maintenance of an exception was subject to any specific requirement, including notification, and it concluded that \"the correct, and most reasonable, interpretation of Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex supports Canada's position. In particular, there is simply no basis in the text of the BIT to impose an additional procedural requirement that triggers the effectiveness of the exception.\"176\n\nAward, para. 369.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal also added that \"the specificity of these categories also suggests that no further action by Canada is required or contemplated prior to its entitlement to rely upon these asserted 'exceptions.' Although 'services in any other sector' is broader than the other items listed, there is no indication in the text that it should be treated differently.\"177\n\nAward, para. 372.\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal made comments on the lack of clarity of the text (which the Committee considers to be *obiter dicta*)*,* and affirmed that \"[in] any event, the Tribunal must interpret the text of the BIT as it is, not as it should have been drafted in an ideal situation. As already mentioned, the text leaves no doubt that Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation in 'services,' and the Tribunal declined to subject that right to a notice requirement or other procedural hurdle which is not included in the BIT. Thus, the Tribunal concluded that under Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex, Canada may adopt or apply measures with respect to 'services' that are not in conformity with its national treatment obligation.\"178\n\nAward, para. 374.\n\n218.\n\nRegarding the scope of the expression \"services in any other sector\" and whether it includes Telecommunications, the Tribunal found that \"the only plausible interpretation is that all services, including social services, fall within the scope of the Annex.\"179\n\nAward, paras. 376-377.\n\n219.\n\nFinally, \"[i]n light of the findings above, the Tribunal concludes that GTH's national treatment claim, which relates exclusively to the telecommunications sector, is excluded from the scope of the BIT's national treatment provisions. Accordingly, the national treatment claim is dismissed and will not be considered on the merits.\"180\n\nAward, para. 380.\n\n220.\n\nThe Committee finds that GTH's claim on this point has not been adequately substantiated. Accordingly, the Committee does not find that the Tribunal committed an excess of powers in this respect, as it identified the applicable law and endeavored to apply it to the question of jurisdiction, both of which are matters governed under Section 3 of the ICSID Convention, \"Powers and Funcions of the Tribunal.\"\n\n221.\n\nAs indicated in Section IV.A., an annulment proceeding is not an appeal. The Committee finds that the role of *ad hoc* committees in safeguarding the ICSID system does not include reviewing the substance of tribunals' interpretation of the jurisdictional exceptions raised by the parties. In this case, the Tribunal exercised the powers to determine its own jurisdiction, which is how the Parties characterized the matter, per the principle of *comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence* enshrined in Article 41 of the ICSID Convention. The Committee agrees with other annulment committees that nothing in the ICSID Convention dictates a differentiation between grounds for annulment on the basis of jurisdiction or on the181 merits.\n\nSee *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Republic of Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29, Decision on Annulment, May 19, 2014, paras. 107 and *seq.* (**RL-369**).\n\n222.\n\nThe Committee has set out the logic followed by the Tribunal in its findings on jurisdiction above, noting that after hearing the Parties and reviewing all evidence, the Tribunal, by the majority of its members, selected one interpretation of the BIT over the other. The Committee finds that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers.\n\nB. **F****ailure to state reasons** **(A****rticle** **52(1)(****e****))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. GTH's Position***\n-----------------------\n\n*(i) The Tribunal's decision to dismiss GTH's claim on the frustration of legitimate expectations is contradictory and absent reasoning*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nGTH contends that while the Tribunal ultimately dismissed the Blocked Sale Claim, the relevant parts of the Award should be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention because the Tribunal failed to state reasons in respect of two of the key legal bases for GTH's claim: (1) Canada's breach of its FET obligation by frustrating GTH's legitimate expectation and (2) Canada's breach of its FET obligation by its disproportionate actions.182\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 53-54.\n\n224.\n\nTherefore, GTH requests that the Committee annul the Tribunal's decision on the Blocked Sale Claim, as reflected in paragraph 729(i) of the *dispositif* and the corresponding paragraphs in the Award related to the Blocked Sale Claim (paragraphs 539-71).183\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 55.\n\n225.\n\nGTH alleges that the Tribunal's decision to dismiss GTH's claim that Canada frustrated GTH's legitimate expectations is contradictory and without reasoning and must be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(e). In the Arbitration, GTH argued that Canada introduced a fundamental change to the *status quo* transfer regime and policy when it sought to block the transfer of those licenses by introducing new limitations on transfers which did not exist at the time GTH made its investment.184\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 57.\n\n226.\n\nGTH adds that the Tribunal concluded \"that GTH has not established the existence of any legitimate expectation that was violated, in breach of the BIT, by Canada's adoption and implementation of the Transfer Framework.\"185\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 58.\n\n227.\n\nGTH argues that the Tribunal's conclusion that \"no such evidence was presented to the Tribunal\" that \"Canada had fundamentally altered those policy documents, for example by prolonging the five-year finite restriction on transfer, or by deciding that no set-aside licence may be transferred at all at any time\" is directly contradicted by the Tribunal's other findings in its Award and ignores key evidence presented in the Arbitration.186\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 59.\n\n228.\n\nIn its Reply, GTH insists that these two findings - one that evidence of a particular fact was not presented (the so-called \"First Finding\"), and another that there was such evidence (the so-called \"Second Finding\") - directly contradict each other. The First Finding concludes there was no evidence that the five-year restriction on transferring set-aside spectrum licenses was prolonged by Canada. The Second Finding concludes that there was. [REDACTED] The two factual findings are simply irreconcilable.187\n\nGTH's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 14.\n\n229.\n\nGTH continues stating that this contradiction relates to an outcome-determinative issue. If the Second Finding is correct (and therefore the First Finding is wrong), the Tribunal-as it expressly recognized-could have concluded that Canada breached its FET obligation. In other words, the Second Finding could have been dispositive.188\n\nGTH's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 15.\n\n230.\n\nGTH finds support for its allegations in different paragraphs of the Award. It points out that, first, the Tribunal stated that \"[h]ad GTH succeeded in evidencing that, after it made its investment based on the terms and undertakings set out in the auction policy documents, Canada had fundamentally altered those policy documents, for example by prolonging the five-year finite restriction on transfer, or by deciding that no set-aside licence may be transferred at all at any time, there could have been an argument that Canada may have breached its obligation pursuant to Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. However, no such evidence was presented to the Tribunal.\"189 But, afterwards, it stated that \"[i]n particular, GTH evidenced no fundamental inconsistency with Canada's spectrum management policy objectives or with the objectives of the 2008 AWS Auction. The evidence adduced showed that references to spectrum concentration in the 2013 Transfer Framework that brought Industry Canada to block the transfer of set-aside spectrum licences to Incumbents were essentially adopted to enhance competition. [\u2026] the Tribunal does not find any illegitimacy or irrationality in the Canadian Government's considering in 1994 that the market was competitive and introducing ten years later, in 2013, a Transfer Framework to regulate spectrum concentration, given the important evolution in the market that was amply discussed at the Hearing. Wind Mobile's acknowledgment that 'the Government's primary policy objective' was 'to create, enhance, and sustain competition in the Canadian wireless telecommunications market' contradicts GTH's argument that the Transfer Framework was politically-motivated, and adopted to 'deflect public criticism' rather than to advance a legitimate policy objective.\"190\n\nAward, para. 559.\n\nAward, para. 565.\n\n231.\n\nIn any event, GTH concludes, the Tribunal's decision with respect to GTH's legitimate expectations claim also failed to state reasons because it failed to address evidence that had the potential to affect the outcome of the Award.191\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 62.\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal did not address GTH's claim of breach of FET by disproportionate action*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nGTH also alleges that the Tribunal failed to consider GTH's claim that Canada had breached its FET obligation by its disproportionate actions and decision on the Blocked Sale Claim. According to GTH, the Tribunal entirely failed to address a key basis of GTH's claim that Canada breached its FET obligation because its actions blocking GTH's ability to transfer the set-aside spectrum licenses to an Incumbent were disproportionate to Canada's purported objectives, in the light of the impact of Canada's decision on GTH and the existence of several alternative options. That is a breach on several grounds, including that such actions frustrated GTH's legitimate expectations and were unreasonable, arbitrary, non-transparent and inconsistent. GTH argued they were disproportionate as a separate and independent legal basis to advance that Canada had breached FET obligation.192\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 65-66.\n\n233.\n\nGTH contends that the Tribunal did not address GTH's separate claim that Canada's actions breached FET because they were disproportionate (i.e., failing to balance the significant harm the 2013 Transfer Framework caused to licensees, with its stated regulatory objective, when alternatives were available). On the face of the Award, \"the tribunal either failed to consider the argument or it did consider it but brought that [GTH's] arguments should be rejected.\" If the latter, \"that did not free the Tribunal from its duty to give reasons for its rejection as an indispensable component of the statement of reasons on which its conclusion was based.\"193\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 69-70.\n\n234.\n\nGTH concludes that as a result of its failure to address and give any reasons in respect of GTH's claim that Canada breached its FET obligation by its disproportionate actions, the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Blocked Sale Claim must be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.194\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 71.\n\n235.\n\nIn its Reply, GTH insists that, while it did decide on the other legal bases for breach of FET, the Tribunal simply neglected to decide whether Canada's actions were disproportionate in breach of its FET obligation. Assessment of this claim could have changed the outcome of the dispute: the Tribunal could have found\u2013on a proportionality analysis alone\u2013that Canada breached its FET obligation.195\n\nGTH's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 31.\n\n*(iii) The Tribunal gave no reasons for its decision to dismiss the Free Transfer Claim*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nGTH refers also to its Free Transfer Claim. It alleges that in the Arbitration, GTH argued that by restricting GTH from transferring its investments to an Incumbent, Canada breached the Free Transfer Guarantee contained in Article IX(1) of the BIT (the \"Free Transfer Claim\").196\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 72.\n\n237.\n\nGTH alleges that the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Free Transfer Claim should be annulled for two reasons: (1) the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its findings in violation of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and (2) the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by relying on a legal argument that was not advanced by either Party in violation of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.197\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 73. The Committee deals with the first reason in this section.\n\n238.\n\nWhen the Tribunal dismissed the Free Transfer Claim, it failed to state reasons in respect of two of the critical arguments advanced by GTH in the Arbitration.198 Therefore, GTH requests that the Committee annul the Majority's decision on the Free Transfer Claim, as reflected in paragraph 729(iii) of the *dispositif* and the corresponding paragraphs in the Award related to the Free Transfer Claim (paragraphs 702-707).199\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 75.\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 74.\n\n239.\n\nGTH states that it explained in the Arbitration, and the Tribunal accepted, that its investment was comprised of a bundle of rights associated with its indirect shareholding and loans to Wind Mobile, and that when Canada restricted GTH from transferring its investment to an Incumbent, this amounted to a clear breach of Article IX(1). In particular, GTH observed that Article IX(1) of the BIT is undoubtedly broad and refers to \"the unrestricted transfer of investments and returns.\" The broad scope of this provision was further reinforced by the second sentence of Article IX(1) of the BIT, which introduces a list of examples with the phrase \"without limiting the generality of the foregoing.\"200\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 77.\n\n240.\n\nGTH continues explaining that despite the arguments advanced by GTH and the language of the BIT, the Tribunal did not address the meaning of either of these critical phrases when it reached its confounding conclusion that Article IX(1) \"applies exclusively to the transfer of funds.\" First, the Tribunal did not address the meaning of \"the unrestricted transfer of investments and returns.\" Instead the Tribunal referred only to the definition of returns and the meaning of the term \"transfer.\" Second, the Tribunal did not address the meaning of \"[w]ithout limiting the generality of the foregoing\", the foregoing being the general principle that Canada shall guarantee \"the unrestricted transfer of investments and returns.\" Instead, the Tribunal jumped directly in its analysis to the enumerated list of examples of transfers which are also protected.201\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 78.\n\n241.\n\nBy failing to address these critical phrases of Article IX(1) and GTH's arguments in this regard, GTH alleges that the Tribunal undoubtedly \"[left] the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale\" when that point was \"necessary to the tribunal's decision.\" It is the Tribunal's duty to explain why no meaning should be given to these terms, which GTH argued was indispensable to interpreting the scope of the Free Transfer Guarantee contained in Article IX(1). By failing to do so, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its Award, and the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Free Transfer Claim must be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.202\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 79-80.\n\n*(iv) The Majority's decision to dismiss GTH's National Treatment Claim was also contradictory and absent key reasoning*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nAs a last argument regarding this ground for annulment, GTH alleges that the Majority's decision to dismiss GTH's National Treatment Claim was also contradictory and absent key reasoning, and therefore must also be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.203\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 99.\n\n243.\n\nGTH argues that the Majority (and Canada) conceded that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over GTH's National Treatment Claim, but subsequently held that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear the National Treatment Claim. This is a patent example of a contradictory position whereby the Majority adopted a position that \"relie[s] on hypotheses which the [majority] itself ha[s] rejected.\"204 GTH adds that Canada's objection was premised on Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT and the Annex. In particular, Canada alleged that in Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT and the Annex, Canada had exempted measures relating to the telecommunications industry from its National Treatment obligation.205\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 43, 100, citing *MINE v Guinea*, para. 6.107.\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 100-101.\n\n244.\n\nGTH recalls the interpretation of this provision by the Majority: \"[t]he text [of Article IV(2)(d)] makes clear that the right to make an exception in a sector or a matter is subject to only one condition: the sector or matter must be listed in the Annex. In the Annex, Canada 'reserves the right to make and maintain exceptions' in five categories, including 'social services' and 'services in any other sector.' This language, similar in all three authentic linguistic versions of the BIT, leaves no room for doubt that Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation with respect to 'services'.\"206\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 103.\n\n245.\n\nGTH points out that the Majority stated that it had \"no difficulty\" finding that \"'services in any other sector' includes telecommunications\" as \"[t]he only plausible interpretation is that all services, including social services, fall within the scope of the Annex.\" The Majority further adopted Canada's position that the \"right to make exceptions is the right to take inconsistent measures\" and \"there is simply no basis in the text of the BIT to impose an additional procedural requirement that triggers the effectiveness of the exception.\" Yet, in its summation, the Majority observed that \"the text of the Annex could have been drafted in clearer terms.\"207\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 104.\n\n246.\n\nGTH states that it concurs with Prof. Born's dissent and summarizes the failures in the Majority's Award. GTH considers that the Majority failed to address key arguments advanced by GTH and make key findings it was obliged to reach in order to dismiss GTH's National Treatment Claim for lack of jurisdiction.208\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 106.\n\n247.\n\nGTH argues that \"telecommunications\" does not appear in the text of Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex as a sector where Canada had reserved the right to make and maintain exceptions. To affirm the importance of this absence, GTH points to Canada's treaty practice that showed that whenever Canada sought to include \"telecommunications\" among its list of sectors or matters in other treaties, it had done so expressly. GTH contends that in its Award, and while relying on other aspects of Canada's treaty practice, the majority found that \"telecommunications\" could be read into the terms of the Annex under the category \"services in any other sector.\" Yet, in reaching this finding, the Majority did not address, either expressly or implicitly, GTH's argument with respect to Canada's treaty practice.209\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 107.\n\n248.\n\nGTH continues that, even accepting, *arguendo,* the Majority's decision that telecommunications falls into the category \"services in any other sector\", the Majority concluded that \"under Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex, Canada may adopt or apply measures with respect to 'services' that are not in conformity with its national treatment obligation.\" Thus, under the Majority's own reasoning, it must establish both that: (1) GTH's investment into Canada (to which GTH claimed Canada's National Treatment obligation was owed) was a \"service\" in the telecommunications sector and (2) Canada's impugned measure were \"measures with respect to [telecommunications] 'services'.\" The Majority did neither. In fact, states GTH, as Prof. Born explains in his dissent, the measure considered by the Majority relates to regulation of financial ownership and financial control by a foreign investor, not regulation of \"services\", including telecommunications services.210\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 108.\n\n249.\n\nFinally, GTH stresses that one of its fundamental arguments as to why Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex could not bar its National Treatment Claim was based on the text of the Annex, in which Canada merely \"reserves the right to make and maintain exceptions.\" GTH cited the reasoning of numerous tribunals that have confirmed that a reservation of a right does not equate to an exercise of a right, and therefore requires something more than the adoption of that of measure to be exempt. GTH also observed that the other prongs of Articles IV(2) ((a) through (c)), demonstrate the distinction between a reservation of rights to make an exception (prong (d)), and the imposition of a measure (prongs (a) through (c)). Prof. Born agreed, observing in his dissent that the phrase \"reserves the right\" is patently not synonymous with exercising that right - the reserved right still has to be exercised.211\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 109.\n\n250.\n\nGTH points out that in its decision, the Majority failed to address the above arguments when reaching its conclusion that there was no basis in the BIT to impose an additional procedural requirement that triggers the effectiveness of the exception. However, the Majority was not free to reach its conclusion without addressing these arguments, which formed a key part of GTH's position. The Majority's failure to address GTH's arguments in this regard is all the more serious based on the majority's recognition that \"the text of the Annex could have been drafted in clearer terms\" including \"[f]or instance, Canada could have stated that its national treatment obligation does not apply to non-conforming measures in the listed sectors or matters\"-i.e., what the Majority interpreted the Annex to say. This is an extraordinary conclusion, in which the Majority tacitly recognizes that the BIT's terms do not reflect its own holding.212\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 110.\n\n251.\n\nHaving recognized the text's lack of clarity, the Majority then determined that the text \"leaves no doubt that Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation in 'services,' and the Tribunal [sic] declines to subject that right to a notice requirement or other procedural hurdle which is not included in the BIT.\" The Majority \"declined\" to reach this finding despite GTH's very arguments that such a notice requirement was in fact \"included in the BIT\" and the Majority's own recognition that the text \"could have been drafted in clearer terms.\" In the circumstance, it was essential for the Majority to address GTH's arguments to resolve this question.213\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 110.\n\n***b. Canada\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------\n\n252.\n\nWith respect to Article 52(1)(e), the Parties disagree on its application to this case and whether there was an \"absence of reason.\"214 Committees' practice shows that they afford tribunals discretion in how they express the reasons and the level of detail that is required and avoid intruding into the legal and factual decision making of the tribunal and stresses that the key touchstone is intelligibility: if one can understand the reasoning on which the award is based.215\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 10.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 12.\n\n(i) *The Tribunal\u2019s decision to dismiss GTH's claim on the frustration of legitimate expectations is contradictory and absent reasoning*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nCanada alleges that the Tribunal's decision that the Transfer Framework did not breach FET should not be annulled. Canada observes that on its face, the Award's analysis on the Transfer Framework is well reasoned and based on extensive consideration of GTH's allegations and the large evidentiary record.216 Canada considers that the Tribunal stated reasons for its conclusion that the transfer framework did not frustrate GTH's legitimate expectations. Canada submits that the Tribunal has conducted an intelligible FET analysis on the transfer framework: the Tribunal enumerated the documented sources it analysed, and it concluded that there was no compelling evidence that Canada represented at the time of the AWS Auction that it would unconditionally permit New Entrants to transfer their set-aside licences to Incumbents, or that the Minister would approve all applications to transfer set-aside spectrum to Incumbents automatically after the expiry of the five-year transfer restriction.217\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 27.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, paras. 30-32.\n\n254.\n\nAccording to Canada, specific analysis conducted by the Tribunal of the policy documents allowed it to find that there were no assurances that after the five-year period there was right to transfer but instead that those documents did mention the requisite of Minister's approval for such transfer; the Tribunal also did not agree with the argument that the Minister's past approvals could create an expectation as to future approvals upon which GTH was entitled to rely.218 Furthermore, states Canada, the Tribunal concluded like this: \"[i]n sum, the record makes clear that Canada did not make any representation which could give rise to a legitimate expectation of GTH that it is assured of being permitted to transfer its spectrum licenses to an Incumbent after the expiry of the five-year restriction on transfers.\"219 Thus, the Tribunal's reasoning is clearly intelligible.220\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 34.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 35.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 36.\n\n255.\n\nCanada submits that GTH's allegation of a contradiction in the Award is unfounded and provides no basis for annulment. Canada alleges that the Tribunal concluded that \"no such evidence was presented to the Tribunal.\" The Tribunal's speculation on counterfactuals where there could have been an argument of a fundamental change of the policy framework - had GTH evidenced a prolongation of the five years restriction on transfers or the imposition of a complete prohibition on transfers - does not undermine the Tribunal's conclusion that Canada did not fundamentally alter that framework nor violate any alleged legitimate expectations of GTH. The impugned statement at paragraph 559 of the Award was *obiter* and cannot serve as grounds for annulment.221 According to the Tribunal, the Transfer Framework was a continuation of Canada's earlier policy and not a fundamental change - that is, before and after the Transfer Framework was adopted, the Minister had the authority to approve or disapprove of a licence transfer request, taking spectrum concentration into account. The Tribunal never found that the identification of spectrum concentration as a relevant factor bound the Minister to block all transfers to Incumbents.222\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 38 relying on *V\u00edctor Pey Casado and Foundation President Allende v Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on Annulment, January 8, 2020, para. 280 in that *obiter dicta* cannot be considered for annulment since they do not affect the outcome.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 39.\n\n256.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Canada comes back to the point: \"GTH's argument that the Tribunal contradicted its own findings is incorrect. GTH argues that a contradiction arises from the Tribunal's statement, at paragraph 565 of the Award, that '[t]he evidence adduced showed that references to spectrum concentration in the 2013 Transfer Framework that brought Industry Canada to block the transfer of set-aside spectrum licences to Incumbents were essentially adopted to enhance competition.' After citing part of this sentence, GTH characterizes the Tribunal's statement to mean the following: *'-i.e.,* prolonging the five-year finite restriction on transfer'.\" According to Canada, \"the Award did not use this language. The Claimant juxtaposes its own reading of paragraph 565 with the Tribunal's observation that the reference to spectrum concentration in the Transfer Framework brought Industry Canada to block the transfer of set-aside spectrum licences to Incumbents in order to enhance competition. In paragraph 565, the Tribunal was commenting on the fact that the Transfer Framework was in keeping with Canada's telecommunications policy - that the reason why Canada blocked certain transfers of set-aside licences to Incumbents related to the objective of enhancing competition. When viewed in the context of the rest of the paragraph and of the Award, as it must be, it is clear that the Tribunal was not making a finding that through the Transfer Framework, Industry Canada blocked *all* transfers of set aside licences to Incumbents or *de facto* prolonged the five-year moratorium, as GTH suggests.\"223\n\nCanada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 10.\n\n257.\n\nCanada submits that the logical flaw underlying GTH's alleged contradiction is that it assimilates an individual exercise of ministerial discretion to reject a transfer with a prohibition on all transfers to Incumbents. In fact, the Tribunal noted that after the adoption of the Transfer Framework, Industry Canada approved the transfer of spectrum licences from New Entrants to Incumbents. This confirms that the Tribunal did not understand the Transfer Framework as a prohibition on transfers or a prolongation of the moratorium. Thus, GTH's alleged contradiction is non-existent.224\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 40.\n\n258.\n\nGTH also argues that GTH's argument that the Tribunal \"failed to address evidence that had the potential to be relevant to the final outcome of the Award\", and points in particular to certain internal and public documents of Canada, has three key flaws. First, it is beyond the Committee's power to review the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence, or to substitute its own evaluation for that of the Tribunal. The Tribunal's choice not to discuss each piece of evidence in a voluminous record does not constitute grounds for annulment.225\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 41.\n\n259.\n\nSecond, Canada states that with respect to Canada's internal documents and their evidentiary impact, the Tribunal observed: \"[a]t the Hearing, the Parties debated the evidentiary impact of certain internal advice to the Minister not referring to spectrum concentration as a specific criterion in the outcome of the transfer review process.\"226 The Tribunal made a reasoned determination that this material was generally not relevant to the legitimate expectations claim. [\u2026] the Tribunal concluded that material not available to GTH when it made the investment could not form the basis for GTH's alleged legitimate expectation.227 Further, the Tribunal noted that internal documents did not necessarily support GTH's position \u2013 rather, certain documents supported Canada's position and confirmed the Tribunal's earlier findings.228\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 42 referring to Award, para. 567.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 43.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 44.\n\n260.\n\nFinally, and more generally, Canada argues that even if certain evidence was not specifically discussed, the Award demonstrates that the Tribunal engaged in an extensive and reasoned consideration of the evidentiary record. While the Tribunal highlighted certain evidence, it assured that its analysis was not limited to those specific documents. Indeed, the Tribunal confirmed that it reviewed \"the evidence adduced by the parties\" on the legitimate expectations argument.229 Canada adds that the Tribunal stated that the record makes clear that Canada did not make any representation which could give rise to a legitimate expectation of GTH.230 Canada submits that when the Award is read as a whole, it is impossible to conclude that the Tribunal \"ignored Canada's own contemporaneous internal and public documents.\"231 So that GTH fails to establish grounds for annulment based on the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence.232\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 45.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 47.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 48.\n\nCanada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, paras. 14-21.\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal did not address GTH's claim of breach of FET by disproportionate action*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nCanada challenges also the argument that the Tribunal did not address GTH's claim that the Transfer Framework was disproportionate. Canada considers that the Tribunal adequately did so.\n\n262.\n\nCanada submits that GTH's request for partial annulment because the Tribunal failed to consider its argument that the Transfer Framework was disproportionate has three main flaws. First, from an objective perspective, GTH's argument that the Transfer Framework was disproportionate was a sub-issue within GTH's claim that the Transfer Framework breached FET, not a stand-alone claim. GTH itself did not identify lack of proportionality as an independent breach, give it prominence in its arguments, or even argue it consistently. Instead, in the Arbitration GTH advanced two bases to claim that the Transfer Framework violated FET. The first concerned legitimate expectations. The second involved manifold accusations \u2013 that the measure was unreasonable, arbitrary, irrational, lacking in transparency, inconsistent, politically-motivated, disproportionate, lacking in due process, or otherwise improper.233 Canada points out that the Claimant varied these sub-issues throughout the Arbitration. GTH's Memorial on Merits and Damages advanced arguments based on reasonableness and arbitrariness. However, in this submission GTH did not argue that the Transfer Framework was disproportionate.234 GTH's proportionality argument did not feature prominently in its Reply.235At the Hearing, which spanned two weeks, GTH never argued that Canada's measure was disproportionate.236\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 49.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 50.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 51.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 52.\n\n263.\n\nAccording to Canada, the second flaw with GTH's annulment request based on the Tribunal's failure to address proportionality in its conclusions on the FET claim is that it fails to consider the Award in its totality; it does not account for the fact that the Tribunal noted GTH's position on proportionality and implicitly rejected it on the law.237 Absent an undertaking of the host State to stabilise the regulatory framework in the sector where the investment is made, a change in that framework to reflect the market evolution that is not arbitrary or aimed to harm the investor is not a breach of the FET standard.238\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 55.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 56.\n\n264.\n\nCanada alleges that having enunciated the legal test in this manner, the Tribunal implicitly rejected GTH's contention that the FET standard in the FIPA includes a separate requirement that State measures must be \"proportionate.\" Thus, there was no need to consider whether the Transfer Framework was disproportionate.239\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 57.\n\n265.\n\nThird, Canada argues that it can be inferred from facts set out in the Award that the Tribunal saw no basis to conclude that the Transfer Framework was disproportionate in any event. The Tribunal's analysis of the objectives of the Transfer Framework and of the reasonableness of the measure indicates that it did not consider the measure to be disproportionate to the objective of enhancing competition. Instead, the Tribunal noted the major evolution in Canada's telecommunications market that made it necessary for Canada to adopt the Transfer Framework to achieve its competition objectives.240 Ultimately, the Tribunal held that GTH had not met its burden of proving that the Transfer Framework was not based on legal standards, reflected an excess of discretion, prejudice or personal preference, or was politically motivated and without any legitimate policy objective.241\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 58.\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 59.\n\n266.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Canada summarizes that \"[a]ny consideration of the arguments that GTH presented on proportionality in the only submission where it made them - its Reply on Merits and Damages - confirms that GTH did not advance sufficient legal and factual argumentation supported by evidence for the Tribunal to resolve the proportionality allegation. GTH merely argued Canada 'knew the approach it took would have the most detrimental impact on the value of GTH's investment', and could have achieved its policy objective with an option that 'could have avoided the significant damage it caused to GTH.' Yet in the arbitration, GTH cited no evidence to support its argument that alternative approaches with lesser impact were available to Canada to achieve its policy objectives.\"242\n\nCanada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 26.\n\n(iii) *The Tribunal gave no reasons for its decision to dismiss the Free Transfer Claim*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nWith respect to GTH's allegation that the Tribunal gave no reasons for its interpretation leading to the dismissal of the Free Transfer Claim, Canada argues that the Tribunal rejected the broad interpretation proposed by GTH and found that Article IX of the BIT only protects the right of an investor \"to transfer the amount, proceeds and returns of its investment out of the host state.\" Summarizing its finding, the Tribunal noted, \"Article IX in its true construction offers no ground to GTH to claim relief.\"243\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 61.\n\n268.\n\nCanada firmly contends that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in dismissing GTH's claim that the restriction on the transfer of its investment amounted to a breach of Article IX(1). Canada recalls that GTH argues that the Tribunal failed to address certain textual elements of Article IX on which it had relied to support its interpretation of the provision. Notwithstanding GTH's efforts to package its argument as a failure to state reasons, in reality it is asking the Committee to revisit the fact that, in coming to its legal conclusion, the Tribunal gave weight to certain textual elements over others, and preferred Canada's interpretation to that put forward by the Claimant. GTH's contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its conclusion is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to re-argue its case with respect to the interpretation of a substantive Treaty obligation. Article 52(1)(e) does not open the door to such an exercise. As GTH itself acknowledged, an annulment is not an appeal.244\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 63.\n\n269.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Canada insists that \"[r]ather than argue an absence of reasons, GTH argues that the Award is not sufficiently reasoned because the analysis provided by the Tribunal does not specifically discuss the reasons for rejecting certain points raised by GTH in support of its position. In GTH's view, this renders the Tribunal's finding on the interpretation of Article IX impossible to understand.\"245\n\nCanada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 35.\n\n270.\n\nCanada states that the reasons for the Tribunal's conclusion on the interpretation of Article IX are far from being \"unintelligible\" or \"impossible to understand.\" To the contrary, they are set out plainly and in detail in the Award.246\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 64.\n\n271.\n\nCanada alleges that in reading this section of the Award the reader is able to understand how the Tribunal reached the conclusion that the provision \"applies exclusively to the transfer of funds.\" The analysis is far from \"confounding\" as the Claimant describes it. The Tribunal's legal conclusions are reasoned and intelligible and there is no doubt that the Award meets the minimum requirement under ICSID Article 52(1)(e). The Claimant cannot invoke Article 52(1)(e) simply because it is unhappy with the Tribunal's decision and wishes to re-litigate its arguments.247\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 67.\n\n272.\n\nMoreover, Canada insists in its Rejoinder in that \"[i]n its analysis of the issue, the Tribunal retained Canada's interpretation. It specifically emphasized certain words contained in Article IX by listing them in paragraph 702 of its Award, including 'transfer of investments and returns', the words that GTH takes issue with in these annulment proceedings. According to the Tribunal \"'*[a]ll of the terms of Article IX referred to above* point towards the construction of the term 'transfer' as denoting the free movement of the funds invested in the host State, or of the proceeds of the liquidation of an investment that takes the form of another category of qualifying asset, and the returns on investment that the investor yielded over the duration of the investment.' Having expressed its reasons for retaining an interpretation of Article IX that did not extend beyond transfer of funds, the Tribunal did not need to parse out all of the words in Article IX and discuss why they were supportive of its finding. The Tribunal also agreed with Canada's submission that the purpose of Article IX is to protect cross-border movements of funds related to an investment and not of the assets constituting an investment. In so holding, it referenced an authority that Canada had submitted in support of its contention.\"248\n\nCanada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 39.\n\n*(iv) The Majority's decision to dismiss GTH's National Treatment Claim was also contradictory and absent key reasoning*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nFinally, regarding GTH's allegation that the Majority's decision to decline jurisdiction over GTH's National Treatment Claim contains contradictory findings with respect to the characterization of the nature of Canada's objection based on Article IV(2)(d), Canada contends it should be rejected for the same reasons that the characterization does not constitute a manifest excess of powers. As Canada already explained, the Tribunal never ruled that Canada's objection pertained to the admissibility of the claim and it never rejected the \"hypothesis\" that Canada's objection pertained to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. It simply did not decide one way or the other whether Canada's objection pertained to its jurisdiction or the admissibility of GTH's claim. GTH is therefore wrong to allege that \"the majority (and Canada) conceded that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over GTH's National Treatment Claim.\"249\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 91.\n\n274.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Canada explains that \"[t]he Tribunal summarized in its Award GTH's argument based on Canada's treaty practice. The Tribunal was therefore certainly aware of the argument. The fact that it did not subsequently address it in its legal analysis is an indication that it considered the argument as irrelevant in view of its conclusions based on other arguments and facts. In any event, an annulment proceeding is not a forum in which to second-guess the merits of a tribunal's findings. As Canada noted in its Counter-Memorial on Annulment, the Majority did not need to engage with GTH's argument because the Tribunal noted that it had 'no difficulty' finding that 'services in any other sector includes telecommunications' and that it was the 'only plausible interpretation' based on the text of the provision.\"250\n\nCanada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 75.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nHaving analysed the positions of the Parties, the Committee does not find GTH's arguments persuasive. The Committee finds that the Tribunal considered the arguments put forward by the Parties and dealt with them in a manner that can be followed logically. Its conclusion does not support GTH's arguments.\n\n***a. The Tribunal's decision to dismiss GTH's claim on the frustration of legitimate expectations is contradictory and absent reasoning***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that to determine whether Canada's conduct frustrated GTH's legitimate expectations and, as a result, breached the FET standard as set out in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, it would examine whether, based on the evidence adduced by the Parties, it was possible to identify representations by Canada that could give rise to legitimate expectations by GTH, the extent to which GTH relied on those representations in its investment decision, and whether Canada fundamentally departed from those representations after GTH made its investment in reliance thereon.251\n\nAward, para. 539.\n\n277.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal analysed the policy documents regarding wireless telecommunications available to GTH when it decided to invest in Canada252 and concluded that it could not find any compelling evidence that Canada represented at the time of the AWS Auction that it would unconditionally permit New Entrants to transfer their set-aside licences to Incumbents, or that the Minister would approve all applications to transfer set-aside spectrum to Incumbents automatically after the expiry of the five-year transfer restriction.253\n\nC-003, C-004, C-041 and C-050.\n\nAward, para. 540.\n\n278.\n\nThe Tribunal stated very clearly that it could not accept GTH's position because it attempted to turn the restriction that effectively existed on transfers into a positive obligation of Canada to permit transfers after the five-year period. After close analysis of the relevant legal rules, the Tribunal concluded that GTH was reading them partially because the alleged transfers, which would become admissible after the five-year period, also required ministerial approval.254\n\nAward, para. 542.\n\n279.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal engaged in a precise distinction between admissibility and eligibility when dealing with the rules and the way in which GTH read them. It pointed out that \"while the policy documents repeatedly refer to the required approval of the Minister, they do not contain any assurance that such approval shall be granted where the eligibility criteria of the transferee are fulfilled, and the restriction period has expired. Meeting the eligibility criteria is necessary to apply for a license transfer; however, ministerial approval is still required for the transfer to be effective. In this sense, the eligibility requirements stand as an admissibility prerequisite: the Minister need not consider a transfer application that does not meet the prerequisite. The Tribunal concluded that GTH ignored the distinction between admissibility and approval when it argued that such a reading of the Minister's power rendered the five-year restriction redundant and of no meaning.\"255\n\nAward, para. 545.\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal was crystal clear when it affirmed that it \"notes the assertion by GTH that 'the evidence shows that the only express restriction on transfer contained in set-aside spectrum licenses was the 5-year restriction on transfer to an Incumbent.' That assertion, in the terms by GTH, casts light on a fundamental flaw in GTH's case: the five-year restriction on transfer is not the only restriction; meeting eligibility criteria and obtaining the Minister's approval of the application for transfer are prerequisites.\"256\n\nAward, para. 547.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that \"all of the policy documents must be read in the context of the underlying legislative and regulatory regime\"257 and pointed to the decision of Canada's Federal Court in *Telus v AGC,* which held: \"[n]othing in these statements constitutes a statement, or even an implication that, at the end of five years a party may freely, without review or constraint by the Minister, licence or acquire any or all of the set-aside spectrum, nor do any of these statements constitute an undertaking or assurance by the Minister that, after five years, the Minister may decline to exercise discretion to manage the spectrum.\"258\n\nAward, para. 549.\n\nAward, para. 550.\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed as evidence an internal memorandum brought by GTH purportedly stating that there was an entitlement to transfer the set-aside spectrum after the five-year period on the grounds that it was not available to GTH when it decided to invest and also because it found no reason to give priority to an internal memorandum over clear legal rules.259\n\nAward, para. 551.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal also analysed the past practice alleged by GTH as giving room to a precedent regarding the handling of those requests and it concluded that \"the record makes clear that Canada did not make any representation which could give rise to a legitimate expectation of GTH that it is assured of being permitted to transfer its spectrum licenses to an Incumbent after the expiry of the five-year restriction on transfers.\"260\n\nAward, para. 555.\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal found that GTH had not established the existence of any legitimate expectation that was violated, in breach of the BIT, by Canada's adoption and implementation of the Transfer Framework.261\n\nAward, para. 558.\n\n285.\n\nIn fact, the Tribunal dealt with allegations of unreasonability, arbitrarirness, and lack of transparency in Canada's conduct. As many other tribunals, it noted that \"absent an undertaking of the host State to stabilise the regulatory framework in the sector where the investment is made, a change in that framework to reflect the market evolution that is not arbitrary or aimed to harm the investor is not a breach of the FET standard.\"262 Also, in reply to an argument of inconsistency put forth by GTH, the Tribunal did not find any illegitimacy or irrationality in the Canadian Government considering in 1994 that the market was competitive and introducing ten years later, in 2013, a Transfer Framework to regulate spectrum concentration, given the important evolution in the market that was amply discussed at the Hearing.263 The Tribunal continued \"accordingly, and contrary to GTH's contention, the Tribunal does not see in the adduced evidence a fundamental change in the 2013 Transfer Framework, but rather different wording of the same policy that had been the consistent rationale for the AWS Auction since its inception.\"264 The Tribunal considered \"that neither the terms of the licences nor the statutes that underlie those licences can be read as committing Canada to freeze its telecom regulatory framework.\"265 This reasoning cannot be considered contradictory in the Committee's view, since the Tribunal justified the stability in the objectives of Canada's policies in the face of changed circumstances.\n\nAward, para. 563.\n\nAward, para. 565.\n\nAward, para. 566.\n\nAward, para. 568.\n\n286.\n\nThe above led the Tribunal to dismiss \"GTH's claim that Canada violated Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by denying GTH the ability to transfer the set-aside spectrum licenses to an Incumbent after expiry of the five-year transfer restriction period. GTH has not established that Canada frustrated GTH's legitimate expectations, or that Canada subjected GTH treatment that was arbitrary, unreasonable, non-transparent, politically motivated or without any legitimate policy objective.\"266\n\nAward, para. 571.\n\n***b. The Tribunal did not address GTH\u2019s claim of breach of FET by disproportionate action***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nHaving reviewed the Parties' allegations and the documents on file, the Committee is persuaded that the contention that the Tribunal did not address GTH's claim of breach of FET by disproportionate action is meritless.\n\n288.\n\nIn fact, as pointed out by Canada, GTH did not make an autonomous argument on the lack of proportionality of Canada's measures that allegedly amounted to a breach of FET. In GTH's Memorial on the Merits and Damages, GTH claims that the breach of FET occurred through the frustration of legitimate expectations and by unreasonably and arbitrarily blocking GTH from transferring Wind Mobile's licenses after five years.\n\n289.\n\nThe first use of the word \"disproportionate\" is found in paragraph 299 when GTH elaborated on the legitimate expectations argument and, after quoting the award in *Murphy v Ecuador,* GTH concludes, *inter alia,* that \"an investor cannot reasonably be expected to bear the cost associated with a State's decision to change its regulatory environment in an *'important\u2019* or *'fundamental\u2019* way, nor can it expect to suffer a State's regulatory conduct which is arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate, or otherwise improper.\"267\n\nGTH's Memorial on the Merits and Damages, para. 299 (emphasis added).\n\n290.\n\nAgain, in paragraph 390 of the Memorial on the Merits and Damages, GTH mentions the word disproportionate when elaborating on investors considered \"in the like circumstances\" but not as a stand-alone argument.268\n\nGTH's Memorial on the Merits and Damages, para. 390.\n\n291.\n\nIn fact, GTH's arguments on the point do not rely on the proportionality of the measures taken by Canada. Instead, GTH argues that Canada breached its obligation to afford FET by unreasonably and arbitrarily blocking GTH from transferring Wind Mobile's licenses after five years.269\n\nGTH Memorial on the Merits and Damages, para. 335 and *seq*.\n\n292.\n\nAs stated above, this Committee finds GTH's arguments on the grounds for annulment of the Blocked Sale Claim unpersuasive. GTH has failed to provide evidence regarding the alleged lack of reasons by the Tribunal.\n\n***c. The Tribunal gave no reasons for its decision to dismiss the Free Transfer Claim***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Committee will now consider GTH's arguments on the dismissal of the Free Transfer Claim. Having considered the positions of the Parties, the Committee finds that those allegations do not meet the standards for annulment.\n\n294.\n\nThe Committee notes that, as provided for in the BIT, the Tribunal envisaged the analysis of the arguments put forward by the Parties in the light of the applicable rules of international law. To that end, the Tribunal examined GTH's arguments according to the interpretation provisions in the VCLT, Articles 31 to 33.\n\n295.\n\nIn fact, the Tribunal found that GTH's claim in relation to unrestricted transfers was based on a misconception of the scope of the term \"transfer\" in Article IX of the BIT. Taking into account the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms in the context of the treaty and in the light of its object and purpose, the Tribunal found that *returns* as defined in Article I(i) of the BIT means all amounts yielded by an investment in and that \"all of the terms of Article IX referred to above point[ed] towards the construction of the term 'transfer' as denoting the free movement of the funds invested in the host State, or of the proceeds of the liquidation of an investment that takes the form of another category of qualifying asset, and the returns on investment that the investor yielded over the duration of the investment.\" Thus, the Tribunal concluded that \"'transfer' includes expatriation outside the host State, whether or not that movement consists of a repatriation to the investor's country. In all of those situations, Article IX precludes the host State from restricting the right of the investor to transfer the amount, proceeds and returns of its investment out of the host State, for instance by enacting capital or currency controls, subject to the exceptions listed in Article IX(3).\"270 That being so, the Tribunal endorsed \"Canada's submission that the purpose of Article IX is to protect cross-border movements of funds related to the investment.\"271\n\nAward, para. 702.\n\nAward, para. 704.\n\n296.\n\nIn order to confirm its reading of Article IX of the BIT, the Tribunal found support in the different authentic texts of the BIT and confirmed that the meaning of *transfer* that best reconciles the three authentic texts is the permission of the free circulation of the funds that consists in or result from the investment, as opposed to a guarantee of an unrestricted conveyance of ownership of that investment to an Incumbent at the end of the five-year period.272\n\nAward, para. 705.\n\n297.\n\nIn the light of the above considerations, the Committee finds that the Tribunal identified the applicable law and endeavoured to apply it to the Free Transfer Claim and provided reasons for its conclusions that allow the reader to get from point A to point B in a sound manner.\n\n***d. The Majority\u2019s decision to dismiss GTH\u2019s National Treatment Claim was also contradictory and absent key reasoning***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nWith respect to GTH's argument that the Majority's analysis of Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex failed to address key arguments and reach critical findings, amounting to a failure to state reasons in violation of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention,273 and after a close analysis of the respective arguments and of the documents on file, the Committee finds the claim unpersuasive.\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 87.\n\n299.\n\nIn fact, the reasoning of the Tribunal can be followed in the Award. First, the Tribunal announced its approach: \"[t]he Tribunal must determine whether, pursuant to Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex of the BIT, measures taken in the telecommunications sector are excluded from the scope of Canada's national treatment obligations. To reach that determination, the Tribunal will address in turn two main questions: (a) has Canada validly made an exception under Article IV(2)(d)? and (b) if so, is telecommunications captured by that exception? With respect to each of these questions, the Tribunal's fundamental task is to interpret the relevant provisions of the BIT in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT.\"274\n\nAward, para. 365.\n\n300.\n\nReferring to Article IV(2)(d), the Tribunal assessed that : \"[t]he text makes clear that the right to make an exception in a sector or a matter is subject to only one condition: the sector or matter must be listed in the Annex. In the Annex, Canada 'reserves the right to make and maintain exceptions' in five categories, including 'social services' and 'services in any other sector.' This language, similar in all three authentic linguistic versions of the BIT, leaves no room for doubt that Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation with respect to 'services.' Unattractive as the result may seem to the dissenting minority, such is the Parties' agreement as recorded in the explicit terms of the BIT.\"275\n\nAward, para. 367.\n\n301.\n\nThen, the Tribunal found \"that the correct, and most reasonable, interpretation of Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex supports Canada's position. In particular, there is simply no basis in the text of the BIT to impose an additional procedural requirement that triggers the effectiveness of the exception.\"276\n\nAward, para. 369.\n\n302.\n\nThe Tribunal continued stating that \"Article XVI(1) sets out a process by which the Contracting Parties are to notify one another of any existing non-conforming measures, but there is no such process prescribed for exercising the right granted by Article IV(2)(d). The obvious indication is that if the Contracting Parties had intended for that right to be subject to any notification requirement beyond listing the relevant sector or matter in the Annex, they would have included it in the text of the BIT.\"277\n\nAward, para. 371.\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal went ahead in its analysis: \"[w]ith regard to the Annex, the reference to 'services in any other sector' must be read in the context of the four other listed items. These refer to matters as specific as 'government securities - as described in SIC 8152' and 'residency requirements for ownership of oceanfront land' and 'measures implementing the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Oil and Gas Accords.' The specificity of these categories also suggests that no further action by Canada is required or contemplated prior to its entitlement to rely upon these asserted 'exceptions.' Although 'services in any other sector' is broader than the other items listed, there is no indication in the text that it should be treated differently.\"278\n\nAward, para. 372.\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal made some observations regarding the drafting of the Annex. They are however not essential to its decision. Indeed, the Tribunal itself stated \"[i]n any event, the Tribunal must interpret the text of the BIT as it is, not as it should have been drafted in an ideal situation\", but, more importantly, it stated that \"[a]s already mentioned, the text leaves no doubt that Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation in 'services', and the Tribunal declines to subject that right to a notice requirement or other procedural hurdle which is not included in the BIT. Thus, the Tribunal concludes that under Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex, Canada may adopt or apply measures with respect to 'services' that are not in conformity with its national treatment obligation.\"279\n\nAward, para. 374.\n\n305.\n\nThe Tribunal stressed that \"[i]t is important to emphasize that this exception is limited to the national treatment provisions of the BIT. Canada remains obligated to provide Egyptian investors fair and equitable treatment when adopting or applying any measures in relation to 'services' under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, and Canada must be reasonably transparent in the adoption of laws, regulations and procedures that might affect 'services' under Article XVI(2).\"280\n\nAward, para. 375.\n\n306.\n\nAs shown, the Committee finds that the Tribunal followed a path in its analysis and interpretation of the BIT and provided supporting reasons for its conclusion; such path, furthermore, is not contradictory. Therefore, the Committee determines that GTH's claim on this point should also be dismissed.\n\nC. **S****erious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure** **(A****rticle** **52(1)(****d****))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. GTH's Position***\n-----------------------\n\n307.\n\nGTH considers that the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Free Transfer Claim amounts to a serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure by relying on arguments not advanced by the Parties. GTH argues that a serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure, as a ground for annulment, recognizes that attached to a tribunal's power and authority to issue binding decisions, there is a concomitant duty to act with procedural fairness in order to preserve the legitimacy of the award.281 Accordingly, it states that a tribunal cannot \"surprise [\u2026] the parties with an issue that neither party has invoked, argued or reasonably could have anticipated during the proceedings.\"282\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 47.\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 50 citing *TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23, Decision on Annulment, April 5, 2016*,* para. 18 (**CL-216**).\n\n308.\n\nGTH alleges that the Tribunal's decision with respect to the Free Transfer Claim must also be annulled because the Tribunal has committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. GTH submits that not only does the Tribunal choose to ignore critical terms of the BIT and arguments made by GTH, the Tribunal relies upon an argument never advanced by the Parties in reaching its decision to dismiss the Free Transfer Claim.283\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 81.\n\n309.\n\nGTH alleges that in its Award, the Tribunal relies on the translation of the term \"transfer\" in the Arabic and French texts of the BIT to conclude that the Free Transfer Guarantee is limited to the movement of funds invested in the host State. Specifically, the Tribunal finds that if the Contracting Parties of the BIT had intended to protect an investor's ability to transfer ownership of an investment within the host State, the French text of the BIT would have used the French term \"transmission\" not \"transfert\" and the Arabic text of the BIT would have used \"\u0627\ufedf\ufe92\ufbff\ufeca\" or \"\u0627\ufedf\ufee4\ufee0\ufedc\ufbff\ufe94 \ufed7\ufede\" instead of \"\u0627\ufedf\ufe98\ufea4\ufeee\ufbfe\ufede.\" Having reached these conclusions, the Tribunal next applies Article 33 of the VCLT, and declares that \"the Tribunal adopts the meaning of 'transfer' which best reconciles the three authentic texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty\" \u2013 i.e., Article IX(1) should be limited to the transfer of funds.284\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 82.\n\n310.\n\nGTH argues that at no stage during the Arbitration did either Party address, refer to, or advance any arguments regarding the interpretation of the French or Arabic texts of Article IX(1) and, relatedly, the application of Article 33 of the VCLT to this Article. It was therefore wholly improper for the Tribunal to \"surprise [\u2026] the parties with an issue that neither party has invoked, argued or reasonably could have anticipated during the proceedings.\" To do so amounted to a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure as it breached GTH's right to be heard. This departure was serious: the Tribunal relied on this argument to resolve \"doubts\" in respect of its interpretation of Article IX(1). If GTH had been given the opportunity to fully brief this issue regarding any perceived meaning to be derived from the three authentic texts, it is possible that the Tribunal could have reached a different result.285\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 83.\n\n311.\n\nIn its Reply, GTH argues that \"[t]here appears to be no dispute that neither Party advanced arguments regarding the meaning of the Arabic and French texts, and they were considered *sua sponte* by the Tribunal.\"286\n\nGTH's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 51.\n\n312.\n\nIt continues, \"[b]y failing to allow the Parties to present arguments on the application of Article 33 of the VCLT and the meaning of the authentic treaty texts in the Arbitration, the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\"287\n\nGTH's Reply on Partial Annulment, para. 55.\n\n313.\n\nAccordingly, states GTH, the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and its decision to dismiss the Free Transfer Claim must be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.288\n\nGTH's Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 84.\n\n***b. Canada\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------\n\n314.\n\nCanada argues that the Tribunal did not seriously depart from a fundamental rule of procedure by referring to the authentic Arabic and French versions of the Treaty.\n\n315.\n\nCanada asserts that GTH's argument as regards the Tribunal's reference to the other authentic versions of the Treaty (i.e. the French and Arabic versions) mischaracterizes the basis for the Tribunal's conclusion regarding Article IX(1). In fact, the Tribunal did not rely on the French and Arabic versions of the provision for its interpretation. Rather, the Tribunal reached its conclusion as to the proper interpretation of Article IX in paragraphs 703 and 704 of the Award based on Article 31 of the VCLT. Then, in paragraph 705, the Tribunal added that the interpretation it retained was consistent with the other authentic versions of the Treaty.289\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 69.\n\n316.\n\nFurther, while the Parties never referred to the French and Arabic versions of the text specifically in relation to the interpretation of the Transfer of Funds provision, such an approach should not come as a \"surprise\" to the Claimant. Both Parties recognized that the three authentic versions of the Treaty were part of a proper VCLT analysis and relevant to interpreting the provisions of the Treaty. All three authentic texts were part of the record before the Tribunal, and both Parties raised textual arguments based on the three authentic versions with respect to other provisions of the Treaty.290\n\nCanada's Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, para. 70; Canada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 47.\n\n317.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Canada argues that \"[e]ven if that were not the case, the Tribunal did not commit an annullable error because the reference to the other authentic versions of the Treaty is of no consequence to the Tribunal's ruling. Therefore, it cannot constitute a serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure. Indeed, GTH is not able to show that the 'award might have been substantially different' had the Tribunal not referenced the French and Arabic versions or had it asked the parties to comment on these authentic versions. As Canada notes in its Counter-Memorial on Annulment, it is apparent from the language used in the Award that the Tribunal merely considered the Arabic and French version of Article IX to confirm a decision it had already made. Contrary to what GTH now alleges in its Reply on Annulment, the Tribunal's reference in its Award to 'remaining doubt' and the verb 'adopt[ed]' does not suggest that the Arabic and French versions of the Treaty informed the Tribunal's decision such that the decision may have been substantially different had the Tribunal only considered the English version, or had it solicited briefings from the parties on the Arabic and French versions of Article IX. Instead, it merely suggests that the Tribunal was comforted by the knowledge that its interpretation of the provision was consistent with all three versions of the Treaty.\"291\n\nCanada's Rejoinder on Partial Annulment, para. 48.\n\n**(2) The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nHaving analyzed the positions of the Parties, the Committee finds that GTH's allegations on this ground for annulment are not supported by the record.\n\n319.\n\nIn fact, the Committee finds that the Tribunal first identified the applicable law and applied it to the interpretation of the BIT. It subsequently complemented its findings having recourse to the rule of interpretation embodied in Article 33 of the VCLT regarding treaties authenticated in two or more languages. The Committee concludes that this exercise is clearly not a case where one could suggest that the Tribunal was \"relying upon an argument never advanced by the Parties\" but is instead a case of a tribunal applying the law indicated by the Parties. Further, the Tribunal's reliance on that specific interpretation is not outcome-determinative, so the ground for annulment cannot stand as it fails to pass all tests outlined by the Committee.\n\n320.\n\nAccordingly, in view of all that has preceded, the Committee finds that GTH has no basis to sustain its assertions that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons or committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nVII. **costs**\n--------------\n\nA. **P****arties****\u2019** **submissions**\n---------------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nGTH submits the following costs regarding its own Application:292\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Legal Fees: | US$ 956,132.25 |\n| Legal Expenses: | US$ 4,269.40 |\n| Costs of Arbitration: | US$ 150,000.00 |\n| Total: | US$ 1,110,401.65 |\n\nGTH's submission on costs, Annex A.\n\n322.\n\nGTH submits the following costs regarding Canada's Application:293\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Legal Fees: | US$ 632,665.75 |\n| Legal Expenses: | US$ 1,072.00 |\n| Cost of Arbitration: | US$ 150,000.00 |\n| Total: | US$ 783,737.75 |\n| Total regarding both Applications US$1,894,139.40 |\n\nGTH's submission on costs, Annex B.\n\n323.\n\nCanada presented a global costs submission according to which:294\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Professional Fees : | CAD$ 744,086,21 |\n| Costs of the Arbitration | CAD$ 422,056.81 |\n| Total: | CAD$ 1,166,143.02 |\n\nCanada's submission on costs, Annex I.\n\n324.\n\nOn 30 July 2022, the Parties informed the Committee that they had agreed that each party would bear their own costs of the proceedings.\n\nB. **T****he** **C****ommittee****\u2019****s** **D****ecision on** **C****osts**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe costs of the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in US$):\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **GTH\u2019s Application** | **Canada\u2019s Application** | **Total** |\n| Prof. Monica Pinto | US$ 34,875 | US$ 34,875 | US$ 69,750 |\n| Prof. Lawrence Boo | US$ 18,062.50 | US$ 18,062.50 | US$ 36,125 |\n| Ms. Dyal\u00e1 Jim\u00e9nez | US$ 25,312.50 | US$ 25,312.50 | US$ 50,625 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | US$ 126,000 | US$ 126,000 | US$ 252,000 |\n| Direct expenses | US$ 3,885.74 | US$ 3,885.75 | US$ 7,771.49 |\n| **Total** | **US$ 208,135.74** | **US$ 208,135.75** | **us$ 416,271.49** |\n\n326.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by both Parties pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 15(5).295\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to both Applicants.\n\n327.\n\nIn line with the Parties' decision referred to above, the Committee confirms that each party will bear its own costs and will equally share the costs of the proceedings.\n\n**VIII.
