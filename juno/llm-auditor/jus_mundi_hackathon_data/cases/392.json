Schwebel\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis challenge arises out of an arbitration between Merck Sharp & Dohme (I.A.) Corporation (the \"Claimant\") and the Republic of Ecuador (the \"Respondent\") under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, December 15, 1976 (the \"UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules\" or \"Rules\") pursuant to the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed on August 27, 1993 and entered into force on May 11, 1997 (the \"Treaty\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this case by Mr. Gary B. Born, Mr. David W. Ogden, and Ms. Rachael D. Kent of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP. The Respondent is represented by Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, Dra. Christel Gaibor, Ms. Diana Ter\u00e1n, and Mr. Juan Francisco Mart\u00ednez as well as by Mr. Mark Clodfelter, Mr. Ronald Goodman, Mr. Paul Reichler, and Mr. Alberto Wray of Foley Hoag LLP.\n\n3.\n\nBy a Notice of Arbitration dated November 29, 2011 and received by the Respondent on December 2, 2011, the Claimant commenced an arbitration against the Respondent pursuant to Article VI(3)(a)(iii) of the Treaty and Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Claimant, a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware, claims that Ecuador breached the Treaty with respect to the Claimant's investment in the pharmaceutical industry. In its Notice, the Claimant appointed Judge Stephen M. Schwebel as arbitrator.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated December 30, 2011, the Respondent appointed Judge Bruno Simma as arbitrator.\n\n5.\n\nBy letters dated February 14, 2012, the Claimant and the Respondent jointly requested that the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration act as appointing authority to appoint a presiding arbitrator.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent subsequently challenged the Claimant's appointment of Judge Schwebel under Article 10 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in a letter to the Claimant dated February 23, 2012.\n\n7.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent asked the PCA Secretary-General to suspend the process for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator until the challenge to Judge Schwebel had been resolved. The Claimant expressed its opposition to the Respondent's request for a suspension by letter dated February 25, 2012.\n\n8.\n\nThe PCA Secretary-General elected to suspend the appointment process until the resolution of the challenge in a letter dated February 27, 2012.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated February 29, 2012, Judge Schwebel acknowledged receipt of the notice of challenge and declined to withdraw as arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated March 1, 2012, the Claimant responded to the Respondent's challenge of Judge Schwebel, declining to agree to his removal from the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated March 15, 2012, the Respondent requested that the PCA Secretary-General decide its challenge to the Claimant's appointment of Judge Schwebel (\"Respondent's Request\") pursuant to Article 12(1)(b) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated March 16, 2012, the PCA acknowledged receipt of the Respondent's Request and established a schedule for further submissions on the challenge.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated March 26, 2012, the Claimant submitted its Response to the Respondent's Request (\"Claimant's Response\").\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated March 27, 2012, Judge Schwebel submitted his comments on the challenge (\"Judge Schwebel's Comments\").\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated April 3, 2012, the Respondent submitted its rebuttal to the Claimant's Response (\"Respondent's Rebuttal\").\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated April 9, 2012, the Claimant submitted its reply to the Respondent's Rebuttal (\"Claimant's Reply\").\n\n**II. THE CHALLENGE TO JUDGE SCHWEBEL**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent's challenge to Judge Schwebel's appointment arises out of a recent publication by Judge Schwebel in which he \"makes a number of statements that give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality to serve as arbitrator in the present case.\"1 The publication is a four-page \"Editorial Comment\" (\"Editorial Comment\" or \"Comment\") entitled \"Celebrating a Fraud on the Court\"2 which makes reference to a June 2011 conference commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the judgment of the International Court of Justice in the *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America)*.3 One of the Respondent's counsel in the present arbitration, Mr. Paul Reichler, served on Nicaragua's legal team in that case. The Respondent asserts that the Editorial Comment evidences bias against Mr. Reichler based on which an informed third person could reasonably conclude that Judge Schwebel would \"be influenced... by factors other than the merits of the present case.\"4\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 2.\n\n106 Am. J. Int'l L. 102 (2012).\n\n*Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.)*, 1986 ICJ Rep. 14 (June 27).\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 2.\n\n18.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the purpose of Judge Schwebel's comment is to depict the conference as a celebration of fraudulent behavior on the part of Nicaragua during the ICJ proceedings.5 In particular, Judge Schwebel writes that facts emerging after the issuance of the ICJ's judgment \"proved\" that an affidavit submitted by the Nicaraguan foreign minister was false and that \"the Sandinista government of Nicaragua grossly misled the Court.\"6\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 1.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 3, citing Editorial Comment at 103.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent's challenge is grounded primarily on Judge Schwebel's statement that the conference was \"arranged with the participation of individuals involved in the formulation and presentation of Nicaragua's case\"7 and an accompanying footnote referencing a law review article8 by Mr. Reichler which Judge Schwebel characterizes in a parenthetical as \"describing roles in proposing, developing, and arguing Nicaragua's case.\"9\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 3.\n\nPaul S. Reichler, *Holding America to Its Own Best Standards: Abe Chayes and Nicaragua in the World Court*, 42 Harv. Int'l L.J. 15 (2001).\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 3.\n\n20.\n\nFrom this footnote, the title and the overall content and tone of the Comment, the Respondent challenges Judge Schwebel's participation as arbitrator in these proceedings under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n*1. Justifiable doubts arising from the Editorial Comment*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent first argues that Judge Schwebel's Comment taken as a whole gives rise to justifiable doubts regarding his impartiality. Focusing on the totality of the views and statements advanced by Judge Schwebel, the Respondent believes the Comment implies that the \"Respondent's counsel was directly or indirectly associated with a fraud on the ICJ, through his role as a leading force behind the case.\"10 Thus, the Respondent asserts, an objective third party would reasonably believe that Judge Schwebel could be influenced by his \"unfavorable view of [the] Respondent's counsel.\"11 For example, the Respondent points to Judge Schwebel's remark that the conference was arranged \"with the participation of individuals involved in the formulation and presentation of Nicaragua's case,\" whereas, according to the Respondent, the conference was sponsored by four organizations.12 In the Respondent's view, Judge Schwebel's emphasis on individual participation, rather than the four entities, indicates his perception that the Respondent's counsel was directly involved in celebrating the anniversary of the case.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 5.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 6.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 6.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that Judge Schwebel \"singled out\" Mr. Reichler by referencing Mr. Reichler's 2001 article and describing that article as \"developing\" Nicaragua's case, which Judge Schwebel describes as having been tainted by fraud.13 According to the Respondent, this reference to Mr. Reichler's article and the assertion that Nicaragua committed a fraud before the ICJ as well as the proximity of the two references could reasonably be viewed as suggesting that Mr. Reichler participated in or facilitated an alleged fraud or neglected his professional or ethical duties.14\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 3 & p. 6.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 7.\n\n23.\n\nTo further emphasize the import of Judge Schwebel's reference to Mr. Reichler's article, the Respondent notes that the article identifies Mr. Reichler as having \"worked very closely with the foreign minister\" of Nicaragua.15 Whereas Judge Schwebel's 1986 dissent in the *Nicaragua* case expressed disapproval of Nicaragua's behavior, the Respondent maintains that the 2012 Comment raises the issue of fraud for the first time and draws new links between Nicaragua's actions and its counsel.16\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 8.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, pp. 6-7; Respondent's Request, p. 9, n.32.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that the title, primary thesis, and tone of the Comment, taken together with the reference to Mr. Reichler in particular could lead an informed third party to reasonably conclude that Judge Schwebel is incapable of separating his view of the Respondent's counsel from the merits of the present case and that Judge Schwebel might doubt the integrity or veracity of the Respondent's counsel.17 The Respondent further suggests that it is irrelevant whether there is any relationship between the Comment and the issues and Parties in this case.18\n\nRespondent's Request, pp. 8-9.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 9.\n\n25.\n\nRelying on Section 3.3.3 of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration Orange List which cautions as to the possibility of justifiable doubts arising from a \"close personal friendship\" between an arbitrator and counsel, the Respondent maintains that \"publicly expressed ill will\" by an arbitrator toward counsel will equally give rise to doubts about that arbitrator's impartiality.19\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 9.\n\n26.\n\nIn its Rebuttal, the Respondent remarks on Judge Schwebel's Comments submitted to the PCA as part of these challenge proceedings and notes that Judge Schwebel did not in those Comments disavow himself from any negative association with the Respondent's counsel. The Respondent argues that Judge Schwebel's failure to deny any ill will toward Mr. Reichler supports its position, noting that in *Perenco v. Ecuador*, a challenge was sustained even where the challenged arbitrator denied any unfavorable view toward the challenging party.20\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 6.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts in its Rebuttal that its right to select counsel of its own choosing supersedes the Claimant's right to select an arbitrator of its own choosing on the basis of Articles 4, 7 and 10 of the Rules.21\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 7.\n\n28.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that its challenge ought to be sustained as a precautionary measure to \"protect\" the integrity of the proceedings, stating that \"where matters are evenly balanced, it may be advisable to err on the side of admission of a challenge brought early in the arbitral proceedings.\"22\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 7.\n\n*2. Bias as a result of the Comment's inaccuracies*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the inaccuracy of the facts on which Judge Schwebel relies further substantiates its view that Judge Schwebel is biased against the Respondent's counsel. The Respondent argues that Judge Schwebel misconstrued the reasoning of the ICJ, presented witness testimony in a misleading manner, and made unreasonable assertions in the absence of relevant evidence in his depiction of the judgment and the proceedings in the *Nicaragua* case.23\n\nRespondent's Request, pp. 11-13.\n\n*3. Non-disclosure of the Comment*\n----------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Judge Schwebel's failure to disclose his Editorial Comment or his views toward counsel at the time he learned that Mr. Reichler would serve on the Respondent's legal team corroborates its position that an objective third party could maintain justifiable doubts as to his impartiality.24 The Respondent states that \"[i]t is very likely that Judge Schwebel was informed of Mr. Reichler's participation in the case very soon after [January 9, 2012].\"25 At the latest, Judge Schwebel was made aware of Mr. Reichler's participation on January 26, 2012, when Mr. Reichler expressly noted his representation in a letter to the two party-appointed arbitrators.26 Judge Schwebel acknowledged receipt of Mr. Reichler's letter the following day.27\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 13; Respondent's Rebuttal, p. 10.\n\nRespondent's Request, pp. 13-14.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 14.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 14.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent cites Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules which requires an arbitrator to disclose \"any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence.\" Pointing to *Alpha Projektholding GMBH v. Ukraine* in which an ICSID tribunal stated that certain facts or circumstances \"are of such a magnitude that failure to disclose them... [could] in and of itself indicate a manifest lack of reliability of a person to exercise independent and impartial judgment,\"28 the Respondent argues that Judge Schwebel's failure to disclose the publication of his Editorial Comment demonstrates his lack of impartiality.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 15, n. 48, citing *Alpha Projektholding GMBH v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Decision on Respondent's Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator Dr. Yoram Turbowicz (Mar. 19, 2010).\n\n**b. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the challenge should be dismissed for four reasons: first, the Editorial Comment has no relation to the present case, the Parties, or the issues; second, the Editorial Comment does not evidence a negative view of the Respondent's counsel or his suitability as counsel; third, the Editorial Comment takes no position on Mr. Reichler's role or conduct in the *Nicaragua* case; and, fourth, the Respondent \"manufactured\" this challenge by adding Mr. Reichler to its legal team after Judge Schwebel, whose views on the *Nicaragua* case are well known, had been appointed.\n\n*1. The Comment does not give rise to justifiable doubts*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant denies that the Editorial Comment gives rise to justifiable doubts as to Judge Schwebel's impartiality. It argues that the footnote on which the Respondent relies is \"devoid of any criticism, express or implied, of Mr. Reichler.\"29 Further, the Claimant disagrees that the Editorial Comment taken as a whole implies that Mr. Reichler committed any fraud or other misdeed; rather, in the Claimant's view, the Editorial Comment's reference to the role of the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister cannot substantiate the Respondent's argument that Judge Schwebel intended to imply that Mr. Reichler had committed any wrongdoing.30\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 3.\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 4.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimant likewise dismisses the Respondent's argument that Judge Schwebel's Comment \"singles out\" Mr. Reichler. By contrast, the Claimant characterizes the citation to Mr. Reichler's article as a reasonable reference for discussing the roles of the members of the Nicaraguan legal team.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimant also rejects the allegation that Judge Schwebel's Comment implicitly criticizes the organizers of the conference, including Mr. Reichler's firm, Foley Hoag LLP, representing the Respondent. It asserts that Judge Schwebel does not denigrate the event or its organizers in any way. The Claimant notes that Mr. Reichler was not affiliated with Foley Hoag at the time of the *Nicaragua* case and that the firm had no role in the ICJ proceedings.\n\n36.\n\nTurning to the legal basis for the Respondent's challenge, the Claimant argues that the two cases on which the Respondent relies for the proposition that public comments made by an arbitrator could give rise to a challenge are inapposite. According to the Claimant, in those cases, the challenged arbitrator \"(i) made critical comments about one of the parties... and (ii) arguably prejudged the merits of the arbitration.\"31 The Claimant observes that the public comments in both *Perenco v. Ecuador* and *Canfor v. United States* concerned the specific parties and the specific issues before the respective tribunals. Moreover, the Claimant submits that in four of the five other challenge decisions to which the Respondent refers, the challenge to the arbitrator was rejected. It distinguishes the fifth, *ICS v. Argentina*, on its facts, highlighting that the challenged arbitrator was simultaneously serving as counsel against the same respondent.32\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 7.\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 8.\n\n37.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's reference to the Orange List of the IBA Guidelines, the Claimant argues that Judge Schwebel's Comment conveys no ill will toward Mr. Reichler and that nothing in the Guidelines suggests that disagreements or dislike toward counsel constitute a basis for challenge of an arbitrator.33\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 9.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that Ecuador has \"cited no authority to support its contention than an arbitrator's alleged negative view of a party's counsel, even if proven, would sustain a challenge to an arbitrator.\"34\n\nClaimant's Reply, p. 1.\n\n39.\n\nLikewise, the Claimant asserts that there is no legal basis for the Respondent's suggestion that a challenge brought early in the proceedings should be sustained as a precautionary measure.35\n\nClaimant's Reply, p. 6.\n\n*2. Judge Schwebel did not rely on factual inaccuracies*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's argument that Judge Schwebel's criticisms of Nicaragua's factual representations in that case were unfounded, the Claimant points to statements in Mr. Reichler's article that, it argues, conflict with Nicaragua's representations before the Court and corroborate Judge Schwebel's criticisms.36\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 5-7.\n\n*3. The temporal aspect of the challenge*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nRegarding Mr. Reichler's appointment in this case, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's addition of Mr. Reichler to its legal team after the Claimant's appointment of Judge Schwebel cannot create a conflict requiring Judge Schwebel's recusal because the circumstances of the alleged conflict were known to the Respondent when Mr. Reichler was instructed. The Claimant asserts that the position taken by Judge Schwebel in his Comment adds nothing of relevance to what was already publicly known about Judge Schwebel's position in the *Nicaragua* case. In particular, the Claimant maintains that the Respondent and its counsel were \"necessarily on notice\" of Judge Schwebel's views of that case at the time Mr. Reichler was appointed as counsel and that the falsity of the Nicaraguan affidavit was noted in Judge Schwebel's dissent.37\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 3; Claimant's Reply, p. 3.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant further states that Mr. Reichler was not granted power of attorney by the Respondent until after the Respondent learned about Judge Schwebel's Editorial Comment. While acknowledging that under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules a party is free to appoint counsel of its own choosing, the Claimant argues that the Respondent added Mr. Reichler to its legal team only to contest the Claimant's choice of arbitrator.\n\n*4. Disclosure was not required*\n--------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nFinally, the Claimant disputes the Respondent's argument that Judge Schwebel's non-disclosure of his Editorial Comment gives rise to justifiable doubts regarding his impartiality. The Claimant stresses that the Comment does not relate to the Parties or the issues in the present case nor does it, in the Claimant's opinion, espouse any personal views toward Respondent's counsel. In the absence of any relationship between the substance of the Comment and the present case, Judge Schwebel's non-disclosure does not \"raise obvious questions\" about Judge Schwebel's impartiality.38 Moreover, the Claimant observes that the IBA Guidelines Working Group has noted that non-disclosure \"cannot make an arbitrator partial... ; only the facts or circumstances that he or she did not disclose can do so.\"39\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 11.\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 12.\n\n**c. Judge Schwebel's Comments**\n--------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn his comments dated March 27, 2012, Judge Schwebel states first that he voted with the majority of the Court on a number of issues in *Nicaragua v. United States.* He dissented in part from the Court's Order for Provisional Measures and from its Order on the Declaration for Intervention of El Salvador before dissenting also from the judgment. He further notes that the position of the dissenting judges was supported during the 2011 conference by a highly respected ICJ advocate and legal scholar, Professor James Crawford.40\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 2.\n\n45.\n\nBecause the parties in the *Nicaragua* case largely agreed on the \"essential question of law,\" Judge Schwebel observes that he focused his dissent and its 132-page appendix on the factual claims made by Nicaragua which he believed to be false. He points out that the appendix to his dissent refers to statements made by three members of Nicaragua's four-member legal team, including to an interview Mr. Reichler gave to *The New York Times*. Judge Schwebel goes on to observe that he has not been challenged as judge or arbitrator when the other three members of the team served as counsel in cases before him.41\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, pp. 3-4.\n\n46.\n\nIn Judge Schwebel's view, a stronger basis for a challenge, if one were to be made, against his participation in the present case would be his lengthy and detailed dissenting opinion. He maintains that his Editorial Comment repeats the \"essence\" of his dissent, including new information that came to light in 1993 after the conclusion of the case.42\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 2.\n\n47.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's principal assertions, Judge Schwebel replies that his Comment does not make any reference \"to any knowledge or activity of Mr. Reichler\" in the alleged fraud.43 Rather, Judge Schwebel describes the footnote citing Mr. Reichler's article as \"tangential\" to his thesis.44\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 4.\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 4.\n\n48.\n\nJudge Schwebel submits that no reasonable, informed third party would believe him to be influenced by factors other than the merits of the present case as nothing in the body of the Editorial Comment or in the aforementioned footnote suggests that Mr. Reichler is responsible for the attestation of the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister or that Judge Schwebel harbors any ill will toward Mr. Reichler.\n\n49.\n\nFinally, Judge Schwebel notes that, although the Respondent asserts that Judge Schwebel \"rejected\" an invitation to attend the conference, he clarifies that he declined to attend but indicated that he would be prepared to transmit a statement to be read out at the conference.45\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 4.\n\n**III. REASONING**\n------------------\n\n**a. Legal Standard**\n---------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Parties agree that the applicable standard for the resolution of the Respondent's challenge is found in the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n51.\n\nArticle 9 of the Rules requires an arbitrator to disclose \"any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence.\" Article 10(1) states that an \"arbitrator may be challenged if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence.\"\n\n52.\n\nIn evaluating a challenge to an arbitrator arising under Articles 9 and 10 of the Rules, the appointing authority must determine whether a reasonable, fair-minded and informed person would have justifiable doubts about the arbitrator's independence or impartiality.46 The IBA Guidelines, to which both Parties refer, state that \"doubts are justifiable if a reasonable and informed third party would reach the conclusion that there was a likelihood that the arbitrator may be influenced by factors other than the merits of the case.\"47\n\n*National Grid PLC v. Republic of Argentina*, LCIA Case No. UN 7949, Decision on the Challenge to Mr. Judd L. Kessler (Dec. 3, 2007).\n\nGeneral Standard 2(c).\n\n53.\n\nA party need not demonstrate actual bias or prejudgment for a challenge to be sustained.48 \"Justifiable doubts\" may therefore arise in the absence of persuasive evidence that the challenged arbitrator in fact lacks independence or has acted in a partial manner.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador*, PCA Case No. 2009/1, Decision on Challenge to Arbitrator Brower (Dec. 8, 2009).\n\n54.\n\nFinally, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules set time limits for a party to raise a challenge under Articles 9 and 10. Article 11 requires that a party \"send notice of [its] challenge within fifteen days after the appointment of the challenged arbitrator has been notified to the challenging party or within fifteen days after the circumstances mentioned in articles 9 and 10 became known to that party.\"\n\n**b. The Respondent's Challenge to Judge Schwebel**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent challenges Judge Schwebel's impartiality, not his independence. The main contention that underlies the Respondent's challenge is that Judge Schwebel has such a negative pre-existing view of one of the Respondent's counsel, Mr. Paul Reichler, that he is likely to \"be incapable of separating his subjective, negative view from the facts of the present case.\"49\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 8.\n\n56.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it first became aware of Judge Schwebel's \"negative view\" of Mr. Reichler on February 15, 2012, when it learned of Judge Schwebel's Editorial Comment regarding the conference on the twenty-fifth anniversary of ICJ's judgment in the *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America)*. The Respondent relies exclusively on the content and tone of the Editorial Comment to support its challenge against Judge Schwebel. Given that the Respondent learned of the Comment on February 15, 2012, the challenge, viewed on its face, meets the timeliness requirements of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n57.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent argues that (i) the Comment's title refers to a \"fraud\" on the ICJ by Nicaragua, although no such fraud took place, (ii) in its second footnote, following a reference to the conference participants, the Comment cites a law review article by Mr. Reichler recounting his involvement in preparing and presenting Nicaragua's case before the ICJ\u2014a citation that insinuates Mr. Reichler's complicity in the alleged \"fraud\", (iii) the Comment characterizes the conference's mood as \"celebratory\" in an attempt to criticize and show disdain toward the conference and its organizers, which included Mr. Reichler, and, (iv) the Comment's overall \"denigrating tenor\" is meant to convey Judge Schwebel's \"negative view\" of Mr. Reichler.\n\n58.\n\nIn evaluating this challenge, I have considered all the submissions of the Parties and the comments of Judge Schwebel. In ruling on the challenge, I address only the issues that I consider necessary to arrive at my decision.\n\n59.\n\nThe Comment's reference to Mr. Reichler is limited to mentioning his role in the \"formulation and presentation\" of Nicaragua's case and in \"proposing, developing and arguing\" that case. The *Nicaragua* case arose from a complex dispute. Its resolution on the merits required sixteen separate (and often split) holdings by the ICJ, and resulted in seven separate opinions and three dissents on various points of fact and law, in addition to the Court's 135-page judgment. Given the number and breadth of issues that were before the ICJ, a general reference to Mr. Reichler's article cannot reasonably be seen to imply that Mr. Reichler had knowledge of and/or enabled allegedly false testimony by Nicaraguan officials on certain factual points.\n\n60.\n\nThe available evidence also suggests that, among the former members of Nicaragua's legal team present at the conference, only Mr. Reichler published an article in a prestigious American law journal specifically dedicated to the experiences of the Nicaraguan legal team. By citing Mr. Reichler's article in his Comment, Judge Schwebel followed the common practice among authors in prominent publications of citing relevant sources in other similarly credible and high-profile publications.\n\n61.\n\nJudge Schwebel's Editorial Comment is undoubtedly critical of certain alleged conduct by Nicaragua. However, I find insufficient grounds to support the view that Judge Schwebel has attributed this alleged conduct to Mr. Reichler. Accordingly, I find no justifiable doubts arising from the Editorial Comment that could sustain a challenge to Judge Schwebel.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n**NOW THEREFORE**, I, Brooks W. Daly, Acting Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, having considered the submissions of the Parties and the comments of Judge Schwebel, and having established to my satisfaction my competence to decide this challenge in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,\n\n**HEREBY REJECT** the challenge brought against Judge Stephen M.

Christel Gaibor, Ms. Diana Ter\u00e1n, and Mr. Juan Francisco Mart\u00ednez of the Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado of Ecuador, as well as by Mr. Paul Reichler, Mr. Mark Clodfelter, Mr. Ronald Goodman, Mr. Alberto Wray, Ms. Janis Brennan, Ms. Diana Tsutieva, and Mr. Constantinos Salonidis of Foley Hoag LLP.\n\n3.\n\nBy a Notice of Arbitration dated 29 November 2011 and received by the Respondent on December 2, 2011, the Claimant commenced an arbitration against the Respondent pursuant to Article VI(3)(a)(iii) of the Treaty and Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Claimant, a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in the United States, claims that Ecuador breached the Treaty with respect to the Claimant's investment in the pharmaceutical industry. In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant appointed Judge Stephen M. Schwebel as arbitrator.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated December 30, 2011, the Respondent appointed Judge Bruno Simma as arbitrator.\n\n5.\n\nBy letters dated February 14, 2012, the Claimant and the Respondent jointly requested that the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\") act as appointing authority to appoint a presiding arbitrator.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter to the Claimant dated February 23, 2012, the Respondent subsequently challenged the Claimant's appointment of Judge Schwebel under Article 10 of the UNCITRAL Rules on the basis of bias against counsel for the Respondent demonstrated in an article recently published by Judge Schwebel.\n\n7.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent requested that the Secretary-General of the PCA suspend the process for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator until the challenge to Judge Schwebel had been resolved. The Claimant expressed its opposition to the Respondent's request for a suspension by letter dated February 25, 2012.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated February 27, 2012, the Acting Secretary-General of the PCA suspended the appointment process until the resolution of the challenge.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated March 15, 2012, after Judge Schwebel declined to withdraw and the Claimant declined to agree to the challenge, the Respondent requested that the Secretary-General of the PCA decide its challenge to the Claimant's appointment of Judge Schwebel.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated March 16, 2012, the PCA acknowledged receipt of the Respondent's Request and established a schedule for further submissions on the challenge.\n\n11.\n\nBy his \"Decision on the Challenge to Judge Stephen M. Schwebel\" dated April 12, 2012, the Acting Secretary-General of the PCA rejected the challenge to Judge Schwebel.\n\n12.\n\nOn May 8, 2012, the Acting Secretary-General of the PCA appointed Sir Franklin Berman KCMG QC as presiding arbitrator.\n\n13.\n\nBy e-mail of May 22, 2012, the presiding arbitrator convened a telephone conference-call with the Parties and circulated a \"Statement of disclosure by the Members of the Arbitral Tribunal\" (the \"Joint Disclosure Statement\"), stating, *inter alia*, as follows:\n\n3. Judge Schwebel has been previously appointed as arbitrator by the firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr as follows:\n\n- *Red Sea Islands Arbitration, Eritrea/Yemen, 1997;*\n\n- *Abyei Arbitration, Sudan/Sudan People's Liberation Movement, 2008.*\n\n4. Judge Schwebel rendered an expert opinion at the request of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr in *Shell Oil Company v. Sonia Eduardo Franco Franco et al., 2005.*\n\n5. Judge Simma currently serves as an arbitrator in the case *Copper Mesa Mining Corporation (Canada) v. Republic of Ecuador (PCA Case No. 2012-2)* appointed by the Republic of Ecuador through the law firm of Lalive, Geneva.\n\nNothing in the above affects the impartiality of the Tribunal or any of its Members or their independence of the Parties to this Arbitration.1\n\nJoint Disclosure Statement, May 22, 2012 (RCE-4).\n\n14.\n\nBy e-mail of June 6, 2012, counsel for the Claimant informed counsel for the Respondent as follows:\n\nPer your request on our call yesterday, I am attaching the expert opinion on Nicaraguan Special Law 364 submitted by Judge Schwebel in *Shell Oil v Sonia Eduarda Franco Franco et al.* (2005), where Wilmer was counsel for Shell. Judge Schwebel submitted the same opinion in a subsequent litigation, *Miguel Angel Sanchez Osorio v. Dole Food Co., et al* (2008), where he was retained by four co-defendants, including our client, Shell.2\n\nE-mail from Mr. Charles S. Beene to Mr. Mark Clodfelter, June 6, 2012 (RCE-5).\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated June 7, 2012, the Respondent notified the Claimant and Judge Schwebel of its second challenge to Judge Schwebel.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated June 8, 2012, the Claimant responded to the Respondent's challenge of Judge Schwebel, declining to agree to his removal from the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, Judge Schwebel rejected the challenge and declined to withdraw as arbitrator.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated June 21, 2012, the Respondent requested that the PCA Secretary-General, in his capacity as the appointing authority in this case, decide its second challenge to Judge Schwebel (\"Respondent's Request\").\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated June 22, 2012, the PCA acknowledged receipt of the Respondent's Request and established a schedule for further submissions on the challenge.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated July 9, 2012, the Claimant submitted its Response to the Respondent's Request (\"Claimant's Response\").\n\n21.\n\nBy letter dated July 10, 2012, Judge Schwebel submitted his Comments on the second challenge (\"Judge Schwebel's Comments\").\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated July 17, 2012, the Respondent submitted its Rebuttal to the Claimant's Response (\"Respondent's Rebuttal\").\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated July 24, 2012, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder to the Respondent's Response (\"Claimant's Rejoinder\").\n\n**II. THE CHALLENGE TO JUDGE SCHWEBEL**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent's challenge to Judge Schwebel's appointment arises out of his non-disclosure \"for almost six months after his appointment\" of two earlier appointments as arbitrator and one appointment as expert witness by parties represented by counsel for the Claimant, as well as his non-disclosure of another appointment as expert witness by a party represented by counsel for the Claimant.\n\n25.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Judge Schwebel did not make any disclosure upon his appointment by the Claimant on November 29, 2011 and until the presiding arbitrator transmitted the Joint Disclosure Statement on May 22, 2012. In the Joint Disclosure Statement, Judge Schwebel disclosed that he had been appointed through Claimant's counsel, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (\"WilmerHale\"), as arbitrator in the *Red Sea Islands Arbitration (Eritrea/Yemen)* and in the *Abyei Arbitration (Sudan/Sudan People's Liberation Movement)* and had been retained to render an expert opinion in *Shell Oil Company v. Sonia Eduardo Franco Franco et al*.3 According to the Respondent, two weeks after receiving the Joint Disclosure Statement, and in the course of its assessment of Judge Schwebel's disclosures, the Respondent was informed by the Claimant that Judge Schwebel had also been retained through counsel for the Claimant in 2008 to render an expert opinion in *Miguel Angel Sanchez Osorio et al v. Dole Food Company, Inc., The Dow Chemical Company, Occidental Chemical Corporation and Shell Oil Company*.4\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 9; Joint Disclosure Statement, May 22, 2012 (RCE-4).\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 10; e-mail from Mr. Charles S. Beene to Mr. Mark Clodfelter, June 6, 2012 (RCE-5).\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that \"[e]ach of the foregoing circumstances and their accumulation -the substance of the now-revealed relationship between Judge Schwebel and Claimant's counsel and Judge Schwebel's late disclosure and failure to disclose those relationships - raise justifiable doubts as to his impartiality and independence to serve as an arbitrator in this case\" under the applicable UNCITRAL standards, specifically, from the perspective of a \"reasonable and informed third party.\"5\n\nRespondent's Request, pp. 2, 9; Respondent's Rebuttal, p. 3.\n\n*1. Judge Schwebel's late and incomplete disclosures*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent first argues that Judge Schwebel's late and incomplete disclosure in itself gives rise to justifiable doubts concerning his independence and impartiality in this arbitration. The Respondent submits that under Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Judge Schwebel had a duty to disclose \"any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality and independence\" upon his appointment by the Claimant on November 29, 2011. The Respondent cites General Standard 3(c) of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration (\"IBA Guidelines\") to the same effect and adds that these require that \"[a]ny doubt as to whether an arbitrator should disclose certain facts or circumstances should be resolved in favor of disclosure.\"6\n\nRespondent's Request, pp. 4, 11, quoting *IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration*, General Standard 3(c), Disclosure by the Arbitrator, p. 9 (RCL-3); Respondent's Rebuttal, p. 6.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent further refers to international commentators and case law to argue that a failure to disclose circumstances that should have been disclosed may give rise to justifiable doubts. The Respondent quotes Article 4.1 of the IBA Rules of Ethics for International Arbitrators (\"IBA Rules of Ethics\") to the effect that \"[f]ailure to make [full] disclosure creates an appearance of bias, and may of itself be a ground for disqualification even though the non-disclosed facts or circumstances would not of themselves justify disqualification.\"7 It submits that \"[w]hether nondisclosure raises such doubts depends on whether the failure to disclose was inadvertent or intentional, whether it was the result of an honest exercise of discretion, ***whether the facts that were not disclosed raised obvious questions about impartiality and independence*****,** and whether the nondisclosure is an aberration on the part of a conscientious arbitrator ***or part of a pattern of circumstances raising doubts as to impartiality***.\"8\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 5, quoting *IBA Rules of Ethics for International Arbitrators*, Article 4.1 (RCL-8).\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 15, quoting S.A. Baker & M. D. Davis, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in Practice: The Experience of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal* (1992), p. 50 (RCL-31). Emphasis added by the Respondent.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent also points to General Standard 3(a) of the IBA Guidelines to argue that \"at the time of Respondent's challenge, Judge Schwebel was no more justified in considering that his prior appointments by Claimant's counsel would not corroborate or independently establish, *in the eyes of Respondent*, facts or circumstances giving rise to doubts as regards his impartiality or independence.\"9 It stresses that Judge Schwebel's assessment of his previous appointments as \"few, [...] years ago and [...] unrelated to the instant case\" do not \"comport with the explanation to the General Standard 3,\" which clarifies that with regard to disclosure \"*the parties have an interest in being fully informed about any circumstances that may be relevant in their view.* [\u2026] the Working Group in principle accepted [\u2026] *a subjective approach for disclosure*.\"10\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 6.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 6.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the \"fact that [Judge Schwebel] may have considered that his professional relationships with WilmerHale did not merit disclosure is irrelevant: he was required to reveal ***any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality and independence***.\"11 The Respondent disagrees with Judge Schwebel's justification that it did not occur to him to make disclosures while the first challenge against him was pending, because by then Judge Schwebel \"should have been *more* not *less* attuned to circumstances so obviously relevant to his appointment\" and \"his untimely and incomplete disclosure was deliberate and exposes an inclination [\u2026] to suppress relevant circumstances that had the potential of further compounding circumstances at the time of the first challenge which [\u2026] gave rise to justifiable doubts.\"12\n\nRespondent's Request, pp. 10-11. Emphasis added by the Respondent.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 5.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that Judge Schwebel's Comments do not address the lack of a disclosure in the \"approximately twelve weeks\" prior to the first challenge.13 In response to the Claimant's argument that the appointments were matters of public record, the Respondent cites *Tidewater v. Venezuela* for the proposition that \"in considering the scope of [his] duty of disclosure, the arbitrator may not count on the due diligence of the parties' counsel.\"14 It further argues that an obligation to research the record of U.S. District Courts, as would be necessary in this case, would be \"unreasonable\" and that Judge Schwebel's engagement in *Shell Oil v. Franco* was \"not a matter of public record at all.\"15\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 5.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 9, quoting *Tidewater v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Claimant's Proposal to Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator, December 23, 2010, para. 51 (CCL-7).\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 9.\n\n32.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a \"history of repeated selections constitutes precisely the kind of circumstances that are most relevant to the assessment of a party-appointed arbitrator's impartiality and independence\" and their disclosure \"promptly after an arbitrator's appointment is indispensable to afford the other party an opportunity to assess the suitability of an appointee and exercise of its procedural rights under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in case it finds such appointee unsuitable.\"16 The Respondent emphasizes that by not making the disclosures \"Judge Schwebel denied Respondent the opportunity to be fully informed, at the time of its first challenge, about any other circumstances that may be relevant in its view to the independence and impartiality of Judge Schwebel.\"17\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 10.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 8.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent notes, further, that both of Judge Schwebel's expert engagements concern \"issues of denial of justice, allegations which feature prominently in the instant case.\"18 The Respondent submits further that even if that were not the case, the \"prior appointments evidenc[e] instances of close cooperation between [Judge Schwebel and the Claimant's counsel].\"19 The Respondent rejects that the 2008 and 2005 Opinions may be conflated. It states that Judge Schwebel was \"remunerated separately\" for the engagements and that both opinions required \"deliberate and conscious effort on his part, as is reflected in the specific differences between the [opinions].\"20 The Respondent argues that the non-disclosure of \"this additional financial relationship\" raises justifiable doubts \"on its own right.\"21\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 11; Respondent's Rebuttal, pp. 8, 10.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 11.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 8.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 8.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that similar non-disclosures have been found to constitute grounds for the annulment of awards, and points in particular to two decisions of the French courts. In *Raoul Duval v. Markuria Sucden*, an award was set aside, because the arbitrator had not disclosed that \"he would start working for the respondent one day after the award was rendered.\"22 In *J&P Avax SA v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Tecnimont*, an award was first annulled by the Paris Court of Appeal for lack of disclosure by the presiding arbitrator of the extent of his law firm's work for the respondent, which raised concerns with regard to his independence, although he had not personally been involved in the work for the respondent. Later, on remand from the Cour de Cassation, the Reims Court of Appeal agreed that the failure of full disclosure may serve as grounds for annulment of an award, even if the information revealed as such does not raise reasonable doubts as to the challenged arbitrator's impartiality and independence.23 The Respondent notes that non-disclosure has also been considered grounds for annulment in the United States, the Claimant's country of nationality.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 12, citing P. Fouchard, *Note Cour d'appel de Paris (1re Ch. C.) 12 octobre 1995, V. v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Raoul Duval*, Revue de l'Arbitrage (1999), p. 327-328 (RCL-23).\n\nRespondent's Request, pp. 12-13, citing *S.A. J&P Avax S.A. v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Tecnimont SPA*, Paris Court of Appeal, February 12, 2009, Revue de l'Arbitrage (2009), p. 186 (RCL-24), *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Tecnimont SPA v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 J&P Avax*, Cour de Cassation, 1st Civil Chamber, November 4, 2010 (RCL-25), and Bertrand Derains & Yves Derains, Note on *S.A.J & P Avax v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Tecnimont SPA AS*, Reims Court of Appeal, Case No. 10/02888, November 2, 2011 (RCL-26).\n\n35.\n\nFinally, the Respondent stresses that enforcement by arbitral institutions of the duty of disclosure is important to \"encourage private entities and States to have confidence in the integrity of the investor-State arbitration process,\" and to ensure \"the finality of awards and in general the effectiveness of international arbitration,\" as well as the \"credibility\" of the system of investor-State arbitration.24 In its Rebuttal, the Respondent emphasizes that this is particularly necessary in case involving \"denial of justice due to judicial bias\" and submits that in cases where the PCA is acting as both registry and appointing authority it \"has a special duty to assure [its] reliability.\"25\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 14.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 1.\n\n*2. Judge Schwebel's past appointments on behalf of parties represented by counsel for the Claimant*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the four earlier appointments of Judge Schwebel by parties represented by counsel for the Claimant, twice as arbitrator and twice as expert \"on issues of denial of justice in a manner favorable to the Claimant's counsel and [\u2026] to Claimant in this case fall outside of the normal *contacts* among professionals in the international arbitration arena.\"26\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 15. Emphasis added by the Respondent.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent points to the IBA Guidelines' Orange List 3.3 and argues that \"a close relationship between an arbitrator and counsel can raise justifiable doubts regarding the independence and impartiality of an arbitrator.\"27 According to the Respondent, it is immaterial that the present situation is not expressly listed in the IBA Guidelines; the IBA Guidelines are \"not exhaustive, and legal commentators have long recognized that the Red and Orange Lists do not cover all possible scenarios\" and the Guidelines' drafters acknowledged that the three-year time limits of the IBA Guidelines \"may be too long in certain circumstances and too short in others.\"28 In this context, the Respondent also notes that Judge Schwebel's engagement in the *Abyei Arbitration* ended only in July 2009 and his engagement as expert in *Sanchez Osorio v. Dole et al.* continued until the U.S. District Court's judgment on July 7, 2010.29\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 15.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 16; Respondent's Rebuttal, p. 12.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, pp. 12-13.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"the nature of the collaborative efforts that exist in counsel-expert relationships [\u2026] may constitute circumstances giving rise to justifiable doubts [\u2026], particularly when the legal opinions rendered by the arbitrator relate to the issues relevant to this arbitration,\" and that the \"failure to disclose one of the expert opinions only aggravates the circumstances.\"30 The Respondent rejects the Claimant's and Judge Schwebel's argument that the expert opinions are unrelated to the present case and contends that they reject a principle which \"is central to Respondent's jurisdictional and merits defenses,\" namely \"that a court decision, against which there remains further recourse through the judicial process, does not amount to a denial of justice.\"31 It also submits in response to the Claimant that while the expert-counsel relationship is not comparable to a client-counsel relationship, \"the giving and receiving of [an expert opinion] assignment[] requires *trust between the parties*\" and, in the present case, led to a \"long-standing financial and professional 'relationship of trust' [which] gives rise to justifiable doubts.\"32\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 16.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 11.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 12, citing *Case KKO 2005:14,* Decision of the Finnish Supreme Court, discussed in: Bond and Bachand (eds.), International Arbitration Court Decisions (3rd ed., 2011), para. 24. Emphasis added by the Respondent (CCL-2).\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent draws a comparison with the facts of the challenge to Professor Gaillard in *Telekom Malaysia Berhad v. Ghana*, where The Hague District Court held that there were justifiable doubts as to Professor Gaillard's ability to carry out his task as arbitrator impartially and independently due to his involvement as counsel in another arbitration, *RFCC v. Morocco*, which concerned the same BIT protection against expropriation.33 The Respondent relies on the argument submitted by Ghana, which the court agreed with, that \"Professor Gaillard, who in his capacity of counsel opposes a specific notion or approach, cannot be unbiased in his judgment of that same notion or approach in a case in which he acts as an arbitrator.\"34\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 17.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 17, quoting *Republic of Ghana v. Telekom Malaysia Berhad*, District Court of The Hague, October 18, 2004, available in ASA Bulletin 2005(1), p. 186, 189 (RCL-35).\n\n40.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"Judge Schwebel's services as legal expert in two cases favoring the positions of Claimant's counsel and Claimant's stated and likely positions in this case *a fortiori* give rise to the appearance that it will not be possible for him, as arbitrator, to disengage fully from his preconceived opinions and his willingness to take the side advanced by Claimant and its counsel.\"35 The Respondent relies on LCIA Reference No. 5660 to argue that \"the arbitrator's partiality is established when there is a risk that he may favor one of the parties or the party's counsel. There can be no question but that the risk of bias exists here, and accordingly, that Respondent's challenge of Judge Schwebel should be sustained.\"36\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 19; Respondent's Rebuttal, p. 11.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 19.\n\n41.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the \"test of 'economic dependence'\" relied upon by the Claimant, as it \"fails to capture the circumstances that present themselves in [this] case\" and sets too high a threshold. It further notes that the cases relied upon by the Claimant in this regard, *Universal Compression v. Venezuela* and *OPIC Karimum v. Venezuela*, are inapposite, as they were decided under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, which by requiring a \"*manifest* lack of the qualities required of an arbitrator\" applies a stricter test than Article 10(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.37\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal, p. 10, citing *Universal Compression International Holdings, S.L.U. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/9, Decision on Claimant's Proposal to Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stern and Professor Guido Tawil, May 20, 2011, para. 71 (RCL-6), *OPIC Karimum Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/14, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Professor Philippe Sands, May 5, 2011, para. 45 (RCL-4).\n\n*3. The circumstances considered in the aggregate*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent argues that \"[w]hile each basis articulated above independently raises justifiable doubts as to the propriety of Judge Schwebel's service as an arbitrator in this case, in the aggregate they evince a pattern that, *a fortiori*, gives rise to justifiable doubts as to his reliability to exercise independent and impartial judgment in this arbitration. [...] The relevant circumstances, viewed globally, confirm the existence of a close professional relationship and combined efforts, including efforts on legal issues similar to those in this case, between Claimant's counsel and Judge Schwebel, on the basis of which any reasonable third party would conclude the he either is, or appears to be, partial and non-independent.\"38\n\nRespondent's Request, pp. 19-20.\n\n**b. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the challenge is \"without any credible factual or legal basis\" and should be dismissed. Specifically, the Claimant argues that Judge Schwebel's previous appointments as arbitrator and expert witness by parties represented by WilmerHale do not exceed the \"normal contacts among professionals in the international arbitration arena,\" and that the Respondent cannot rely on these grounds in the aggregate.39\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 1.\n\n*1. Judge Schwebel's past appointments on behalf of parties represented by counsel for the Claimant*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that \"WilmerHale's prior appointments of Judge Schwebel as arbitrator and expert witness cannot objectively give rise to justifiable doubts about his impartiality or independence\" under any relevant standard.40\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 4.\n\n45.\n\nWith regard to Judge Schwebel's two earlier appointments as arbitrator, the Claimant argues that the appointment in the *Red Sea Islands Arbitration* occurred in 1997, approximately fifteen years ago, and the appointment in the *Abyei Arbitration* occurred in 2008, approximately four years ago. In sum, \"[n]either case involved, in any conceivable fashion, either the Claimant MSDIA (or any Merck entity) or Ecuador; neither appointment was within the past three years; neither case was an investor-state arbitration; neither case involved issues similar to those raised in the present arbitration; both cases were matters of public record, well-known to counsel for Ecuador; and both cases involved only service as an independent and impartial arbitrator.\"41 The Claimant further notes that the *Red Sea Islands Arbitration* and the *Abyei Arbitration* differ significantly from the present arbitration. They were \"territorial and boundary disputes governed by public international law,\" adjudicated by a five-member tribunal and unconnected to the parties or issues arising in the present arbitration.42\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 2.\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 2, 4.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that the challenge is untimely, because both appointments were \"matters of public record\" and Ecuador's counsel must have been \"fully aware\" of them since the time of Judge Schwebel's appointment in this case.43\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 4.\n\n47.\n\nWith regard to Judge Schwebel's two engagements through WilmerHale as expert witness in two cases before U.S. federal courts, the Claimant notes that the cases were interconnected. Judge Schwebel was retained to consider the same question in both cases and submitted \"substantively identical expert opinions.\" In addition, in the second case, WilmerHale's client was one of four defendants who jointly retained and remunerated Judge Schwebel.44\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 5.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimant points to the IBA Guidelines Orange List 3.3.7 and argues that the present situation is not encompassed by the provision, because Judge Schwebel received only two and not \"more than three appointments by the same counsel\" and neither is within the three year period stipulated by the IBA Guidelines. The Claimant points out that a similar challenge based on repeat appointments was rejected on the basis of this provision in *Universal Compression Holdings Inc. v. Venezuela*.45 The Claimant argues that the date of the conclusion of the proceedings, relied upon by the Respondent, is irrelevant because the \"IBA Guidelines clearly and intentionally focus on the appointment of the arbitrator.\"46 It also points out that the standard established by the IBA Guidelines would not be met even if \"all four prior engagements and appointments should be treated the same, *i.e.*, as the equivalent of arbitrator appointments.\"47 Likewise, the Claimant notes that the Respondent fails to show why a different standard than that established by the IBA Guidelines should apply in this case and that the Respondent's argument that the IBA Guidelines are non-exhaustive contradicts its arguments as the \"situation here is directly addressed by the Guidelines.\"48\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 6, citing *Universal Compression v. Venezuela*, *supra* note 37, para. 86.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, p. 6.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, p. 5.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, pp. 5-6.\n\n49.\n\nBased on arbitral case law, the Claimant contends that the \"mere fact that an arbitrator was regularly nominated (by different arbitral parties) on the recommendation of the same Counsel or the same firm of solicitors ought not of itself to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence and impartiality.\"49 Further, the Claimant argues that repeat appointments are only relevant where they lead to a dependency of the arbitrator from counsel or to an \"obvious professional importance to the arbitrator of his relationship with [counsel which] would reasonably suggest a real possibility of bias.\"50 Otherwise, it asserts that the \"system of international arbitration would be unworkable.\"51\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, p. 3, quoting *LCIA Reference No. 81160*, Decision Rendered August 28, 2009, in Arbitration International, Special Edition On Arbitration Challenges, Volume 27, Issue 3 (2011), p. 451, para. 4.6 (CCL-5).\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 7, quoting *LCIA Reference No. 81160*, *ibid.*, para. 4.16.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, p. 7.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that, in *OPIC Karimum Corp. v. Venezuela*, the tribunal rejected a challenge based on a significantly larger number of repeat appointments, both in absolute figures and in proportion of total appointments, of Professor Philippe Sands by Curtis Mallet-Prevost Colt & Mosle LLP. The tribunal rejected the challenge on the basis that the repeat appointments did not by themselves demonstrate a lack of independence and the claimants were unable to show that Professor Sands was financially dependent on the repeat appointments.52 The Claimant submits that, in the present case, there is no \"relationship of dependence\" between Judge Schwebel and WilmerHale, because the two earlier appointments as arbitrator constitute \"barely three percent\" of Judge Schwebel's publicly known appointments as arbitrator in more than 60 cases, without even considering Judge Schwebel's \"serv[ice] as counsel or expert in countless other cases,\" or his previous position at the International Court of Justice.53\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 7-8, citing *OPIC Karimum Corp. v. Venezuela*, *supra* note 37, para. 21 (RCL-4).\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 2, 8; Claimant's Rejoinder, p. 3.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimant adds that \"[t]here is no legal basis for Respondent's position that the standard here should be lower than potential dependence [\u2026] Indeed, Respondent does not even attempt to articulate an alternative standard.\"54 In this context, the Claimant stresses the relevance of the ICSID decisions it relies upon, because the Respondent referred to them as well, and they \"are matters in which challenges were evaluated considering the principles articulated in the IBA Guidelines, principles that Respondent seeks to apply to this case.\"55 The Claimant also points to the non-ICSID case law it relies upon to confirm the applicability of the test of economic dependence and claims that the Respondent fails to address or refute it.56\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, p. 3.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, p. 4.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, pp. 4-5, citing *LCIA Reference No. 81224*, Decision Rendered March 15, 2010, in Arbitration International, Special Edition On Arbitration Challenges, Volume 27, Issue 3 (2011), p. 467, para. 4.4 (CCL-6), *LCIA Reference No. 81160*, *supra* note 49, para. 87, *Suez and others v.

It is not credible to allege that the past retention of Judge Schwebel to provide an expert witness opinion in two related matters on a single legal issue would affect impartiality or independence in this case today.\"59\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 8.\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 8-9, citing *LCIA Reference No. 97/X27*, Decision Rendered October 23, 1997 (CCL-4).\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 8.\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimant further rejects the allegation that there was a \"pattern of joint efforts by Judge Schwebel and the Claimant's counsel,\" considering that \"Judge Schwebel's service as an arbitrator or expert witness involved independent roles that he performed with integrity.\"60\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 9.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the *Ghana v. Telekom Malaysia* case \"has no bearing on the present case,\" because it \"involved a situation in which an arbitrator was poised to take *\"simultaneous*, arguably incompatible positions on a single treaty provision in separate proceedings.\"61\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 9, note 25; Claimant's Rejoinder, p.8, note 17. Emphasis added by the Claimant.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimant also contradicts the Respondent's argument that the content of Judge Schwebel's expert opinions bears any relevance upon the present case. It submits that the opinion concerned the legality of the Nicaraguan Special Law 364 under international standards of due process, and that Judge Schwebel's opinion \"principally provided an analysis of the law itself.\"62 According to the Claimant, \"[t]he opinion did not involve Ecuador or its courts, did not address the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, and did not involve issues of a lack of objectivity or bias by a judicial tribunal.\"63\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 5; Claimant's Rejoinder, p. 6.\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 9; Claimant's Rejoinder, pp. 7-8.\n\n56.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant points to the challenges to Professor Stern in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* and to Professor Campbell McLachlan in *Urbaser S.A. v. Argentina* to argue that \"even if Judge Schwebel had previously expressed opinions on issues relevant here, which he did not, that could not serve as a basis for disqualification.\"64 According to the Claimant, \"prior legal opinions, even on a similar issue, cannot serve as a basis for disqualification.\"65\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 10, citing *Tidewater v. Venezuela*, *supra* note 14, para. 67, *Urbaser S.A. v.

Judge Schwebel's late and incomplete disclosures*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant denies that the late and incomplete disclosure by Judge Schwebel in itself can sustain the Respondent's challenge or that it in any way aggravates the other grounds for the challenge.\n\n58.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, a \"failure to disclose is not itself a ground for challenge\" under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Further, the Claimant points to commentary, arbitral case law, and the IBA Guidelines to argue that only the facts and circumstances that were not disclosed can raise doubts regarding the arbitrator's impartiality and independence, not the fact of the non-disclosure itself.66 It submits that under the applicable standards of the UNCITRAL Rules Judge Schwebel was not obliged to disclose any of the circumstances and that, accordingly, the disclosures he made exceed his obligations under the UNCITRAL Rules.67\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 11-12; Claimant's Rejoinder, pp. 12-13, citing *LCIA Reference No. 81160*, *supra* note 49, para. 4.16 (CCL-5).\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 3. Claimant's Rejoinder, p. 10.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant likewise dismisses the Respondent's reliance on the IBA Rules of Ethics in this regard. It contends that the IBA Rules of Ethics \"were explicitly superseded by the later IBA Guidelines.\"68\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 12.\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that \"even if [the Respondent's] arguments about the governing legal standard had any merit, which they do not, Judge Schwebel in fact made timely disclosure in the Tribunal's Common Disclosure Statement circulated to the parties on 22 May 2012.\" It adds that the previous appointments as arbitrator and as expert witness were publicly known and easily discoverable.69 In any event, the Claimant considers the omission of the second appointment by Judge Schwebel as expert witness \"a mere oversight\" given the substantive identity of the two expert opinions of 2005 and 2008.70 The Claimant submits that the Respondent's \"allegation that Judge Schwebel intentionally gamed the timing of his disclosures in an effort to deceive Respondent is no more than reckless conjecture\" and \"without any evidentiary support.\"71\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 12-13.\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 13-14.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, p. 10.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the arbitrator appointed by the Respondent, Judge Bruno Simma, made an equally \"late\" disclosure of a previous appointment by Ecuador in a pending investment arbitration. While the Claimant emphasizes that it does not doubt Judge Simma's independence and impartiality, it \"does note, however, the inconsistency of Ecuador's argument that Judge Schwebel's disclosure in the Common Disclosure Statement of contacts with counsel more than three years ago constitutes grounds for disqualification when its own appointed arbitrator disclosed a ***concurrent*** appointment by a ***party*** to this arbitration at the very same time.\"72\n\nClaimant's Response, pp. 3, 13; Claimant's Rejoinder, pp. 2, 9.\n\n62.\n\nFinally, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's reference to the model disclosure statement of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules, because the rules are inapplicable in the present case and, because \"Judge Schwebel has had no relationship with MSDIA or Respondent, and so even under the model disclosure statement of the 2010 Rules, his disclosure of his prior appointments by WilmerHale was not required.\"73\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, p. 12.\n\n*3. The circumstances considered in the aggregate*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nRegarding the Respondent's argument that the facts and circumstances described above also give rise to justifiable doubts if considered in the aggregate, the Claimant argues that \"[t]his is not a serious argument\" and submits that the Respondent not only fails to \"elaborate meaningfully\" on it, but also does not provide \"any authority whatsoever in support of it.\"74 The Claimant adds that \"it makes no sense that a challenge could succeed by aggregating allegations that are themselves of no weight\" and stresses that the individual reasons relied upon by the Claimant have been rejected as basis for a challenge in earlier case law.75\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 14.\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 14.\n\n64.\n\nFinally, the Claimant refutes the Respondent's invocation of the grounds for its first challenge, stating that the grounds previously proffered to support an inference of bias against Respondent's counsel are completely irrelevant to the present challenge.76 In this context, the Claimants also considers exaggerated and unfounded the Respondent's references to an alleged ridiculing of the Respondent by Judge Schwebel in a publication two years ago, and to an alleged \"frequent academic collaboration between the Judge Schwebel and a member of Claimant's legal team.\"77\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 14.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, pp. 8-9.\n\n**c. Judge Schwebel's Comments**\n--------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nIn his comments dated July 10, 2012, Judge Schwebel asserts that the challenge is groundless.78\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 3.\n\n66.\n\nJudge Schwebel presents a summary of the facts of his earlier appointments by parties represented by counsel for the Claimant. First, he states that he was appointed in 1997 as arbitrator in the *Red Sea Islands Arbitration* (Eritrea/Yemen) by the Eritrean Government. He notes that Mr. Gary Born of WilmerHale (then Wilmer Cutler) only acted as co-counsel to lead counsel Professor Brilmayer and emphasizes that \"Mr. Born and the firm of Wilmer Cutler did not act in the second phase of the case.\"79\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 1.\n\n67.\n\nHe then states that he was appointed in 2008 as arbitrator by the Sudan's People Liberation Movement (the \"SPLM\") in the *Abyei Arbitration* (Government of Sudan/Sudan People's Liberation Movement) and that Mr. Gary Born acted as the SPLM's lead counsel in the case.80\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 1.\n\n68.\n\nThird, he states that, on January 14, 2005, upon request by WilmerHale on behalf of Shell Oil Company, he submitted a Declaration to a United States District Court in California in the case *Shell Oil Company v. Sonia Eduardo Franco Franco et al*. concerning the compatibility with Nicaragua's international legal obligations of the Nicaraguan Special Law 364 and a Nicaraguan court judgment against Shell Oil Company based thereon.81\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 2.\n\n69.\n\nFourth, Judge Schwebel states that, in 2008, he was requested by the same counsel and on behalf of the same company \"to give the very same opinion in the closely related case [\u2026] *Miguel Angel Sanchez Osorio et al. v. Dole Food Company, The Dow Chemical Company, Occidental Chemical Company, and Shell Oil Company,*\" which he submitted to the Circuit Court in Miami-Dade County on June 6, 2008.82\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 2.\n\n70.\n\nJudge Schwebel argues that due to the identity of the opinions submitted in 2005 and 2008, \"[i]n substance, I had given a single opinion used twice by Shell in the course of litigation over the same Nicaraguan law, and did not think to list separately two opinions\" in the Joint Disclosure Statement.83 In his view, reliance on his accidental conflation of the two identical opinions as grounds for a challenge is \"disproportionate.\"84\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 2.\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 2.\n\n71.\n\nJudge Schwebel argues that the allegation of a late disclosure should take into account Respondent's previous challenge of his appointment. According to Judge Schwebel, \"[t]hat strongly pressed challenge naturally consumed my attention. I was preoccupied with it and, in view of it, it did not occur to me while it was pending to disclose prior appointments by WilmerHale, the moreso because those appointment were few, made years ago, and in matters unrelated to the instant case.\"85 He notes that Judge Simma also thought reasonable to withhold disclosure or inadvertently failed to disclose his earlier and current appointments by the Respondent until shortly after the rejection of the Respondent's challenge when the Tribunal members issued their Joint Disclosure Statement.86\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, p. 3.\n\nJudge Schwebel's Comments, pp. 2-3\n\n**III. REASONING**\n------------------\n\n**a. Legal Standard**\n---------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Parties agree that the applicable standards for the resolution of the Respondent's challenge are found in Articles 9 and 10(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.87 Article 10(1) states that an \"arbitrator may be challenged if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence.\" Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Rules requires an arbitrator to disclose \"any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence.\" The disclosure shall be made to the parties at the time that the arbitrator is appointed or chosen, \"unless they have already been informed by him of these circumstances.\"\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 6; Claimant's Response, p. 4.\n\n73.\n\nBoth sides further recognize that the \"justifiable doubts\" standard established by Article 10(1) is an objective one: it requires that a reasonable and fair-minded third person, having knowledge of the relevant facts deems that \"circumstances exist which give rise to justifiable doubts as to [the arbitrator's] impartiality or independence.\"88\n\nRespondent's Request, pp. 6-8; Respondent's Rebuttal, p. 3, note 11; Claimant's Response, p. 4. *National Grid PLC v. Republic of Argentina*, LCIA Case No. UN 7949, Decision on the Challenge to Mr. Judd L. Kessler, December 3, 2007.\n\n74.\n\nThe Parties disagree, however, on the applicable standard and scope of disclosure required by Article 9. The Respondent argues that the standard is subjective and cites the test established by General Standard 3 of the IBA Guidelines that \"[i]f facts or circumstances exist that may, *in the eyes of the parties*, give rise to doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence, the arbitrator shall disclose such facts or circumstances [\u2026], prior to accepting his or her appointment.\"89 According to the Respondent, an arbitrator must therefore disclose \"any circumstances that are relevant to the parties' evaluation of the arbitrator's reliability to act with requisite impartiality and independence.\"90 The Claimant, meanwhile, argues that the test established by Article 9 is objective and \"presents a higher threshold for disclosure than the IBA Guidelines which provide a subjective test.\"91 The Claimant submits, in any event, that the IBA Guidelines \"do not adopt a purely subjective test\" as reflected in the Green List of situations that never give rise to justifiable doubts.92\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 3, quoting *IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration*, General Standard 3(c), Disclosure by the Arbitrator, p. 9 (RCL-3). Emphasis added by the Respondent.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 3.\n\nClaimant's Response, p. 11, note 30.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, p. 11.\n\n75.\n\nIt should be noted that the IBA Guidelines and Rules of Ethics (i) are promulgated by a private body that cannot purport to legislate for international arbitration generally; and (ii) in the IBA Guidelines themselves, it is expressly recognized that they \"are not legal provisions and do not override any applicable national law or arbitration rules chosen by the parties.\"93 In the absence of an agreement of the parties to a dispute on the application of the IBA Guidelines to a challenge, the IBA Guidelines represent only the non-binding views of one group of practitioners on arbitrator conflicts of interest.\n\n*IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration*, Introduction, para. 6 (RCL-3).\n\n76.\n\nWhile the IBA Guidelines look to the facts or circumstances that \"may, in the eyes of the parties, give rise to doubts,\" Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Rules requires that an arbitrator disclose \"any circumstance likely to give rise to justifiable doubts concerning his impartiality or independence.\" Any doubt should be resolved in favor of disclosure.\n\n77.\n\nNon-disclosure nevertheless does not automatically give rise to justifiable doubts pursuant to Article 10(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. As argued by the Respondent, this depends on the circumstances of the case, including \"whether the failure to disclose was inadvertent or intentional, whether it was the result of an honest exercise of discretion, whether the facts that were not disclosed raised obvious questions about the impartiality and independence, and whether the nondisclosure is an aberration on the part of a conscientious arbitrator or part of a pattern of circumstances raising doubts as to impartiality.\"94\n\nS.A. Baker & M. D. Davis, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in Practice: The Experience of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal* (1992), p. 50 (RCL-31).\n\n78.\n\nLastly, expert appointments, although different in nature from arbitrator appointments, remain relevant to the consideration of arbitrator independence and impartiality. The direct financial relationship and interaction between the party or its counsel and the expert renders such relationships relevant for disclosure under Article 9 and for consideration in the event of a challenge.\n\n**b. The Respondent's Challenge to Judge Schwebel**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nIn evaluating this challenge, I have considered all the submissions of the Parties and the comments of Judge Schwebel. In ruling on the challenge, however, I will address only the issues that I consider necessary to arrive at my decision.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent challenges Judge Schwebel's impartiality and independence on three grounds: first, late and incomplete disclosure by Judge Schwebel; second, multiple appointments of Judge Schwebel as arbitrator and expert on behalf of parties represented by counsel for the Claimant; and, third, an aggregate of the previous two grounds.\n\n81.\n\nJudge Schwebel made disclosures on May 22, 2012 in the Joint Disclosure Statement and on June 6, 2012, the Respondent learned by correspondence from the Claimant's counsel of Judge Schwebel's additional engagement as expert witness in *Miguel Angel Sanchez Osorio et al. v. Dole Food Company, Inc. et al*.95 Given that the Respondent gained knowledge of the additional expert engagement on June 6, 2012, the challenge, viewed on its face, meets the timeliness requirements of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 10; E-mail from Charles S. Beene to Mr. Mark Clodfelter, June 6, 2012 (RCE-5).\n\n*1. Judge Schwebel's late and incomplete disclosures*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that Judge Schwebel's late and incomplete disclosure is in violation of the duty of disclosure under Article 9 and gives rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality and independence under Article 10(1).\n\n83.\n\nFull disclosure by an arbitrator upon appointment is indispensable, not only to ensure the general legitimacy of arbitral proceedings, but also to allow the parties to assess whether they wish to exercise their rights to challenge an arbitrator under the UNCITRAL Rules if they are of the view that the arbitrator does not meet the requisite standard of independence and impartiality.96 Judge Schwebel was appointed as arbitrator by the Claimant on November 29, 2011. Yet, it was only on May 22, 2012 that he disclosed two earlier appointments as arbitrator in boundary arbitrations involving States on behalf of parties represented by counsel for the Claimant, as well as an engagement as an expert witness on behalf of a party represented by counsel for the Claimant in a U.S. district court proceeding. In addition, on June 6, 2012, the Respondent learned that Judge Schwebel had acted as an expert on behalf of the same party represented again by counsel for the Claimant in another case in a U.S. district court.\n\nGary Born, *International Commercial Arbitration* (2011), Vol. I, p. 1620.\n\n84.\n\nEven if the Respondent and its counsel knew or should be presumed to have known of Judge Schwebel's appointments in two public and high-profile arbitrations, this would not exonerate Judge Schwebel from his duty to make prompt and full disclosure. Judge Schwebel should have disclosed all his recent appointments as arbitrator or expert on behalf of parties represented by counsel for the Claimant promptly upon his appointment in this case. These circumstances clearly fall within the scope of his disclosure obligation, which Judge Schwebel failed to meet in this case.\n\n85.\n\nHowever, the circumstances of Judge Schwebel's late and incomplete disclosure do not support the inference that he lacks independence or impartiality. The precedents relied upon by the Respondent principally deal with non-disclosure, rather than the distinct situation of late disclosure. The disclosures made in the Joint Disclosure Statement, if late, were nonetheless of the Tribunal's own initiative. Judge Schwebel's non-disclosure of the second expert opinion also appears to be an inadvertent omission in an otherwise honest exercise of discretion, resulting from the connection between the two expert engagements and the nearly identical content of the two opinions. I therefore find this late and incomplete disclosure to be an aberration on the part of the arbitrator rather than part of a pattern of circumstances that could raise doubts about his impartiality.\n\n*2. Judge Schwebel's past appointments on behalf of parties represented by counsel for the Claimant*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent further bases its challenge on the fact that Judge Schwebel was appointed as arbitrator and as expert by the Claimant's counsel in four earlier cases and argues that these establish \"a pattern of joint efforts by Judge Schwebel and Claimant's counsel.\"97\n\nRespondent's Request, p. 15.\n\n87.\n\nThe issue of multiple appointments involves, but is not limited to, a consideration of financial dependence arising from the significance of the multiple appointments\u2014and expectation of future appointments\u2014to the arbitrator's income. The issue of multiple appointments also engages the question of an affinity developed by the arbitrator for the party or the counsel that has repeatedly appointed him or her. It should therefore not be limited to an examination of financial dependence arising from the arbitrator's income from the appointments. The question remains: do the number and significance of the appointments considered in context, and in light of the period of time over which the appointments were made, raise justifiable doubts in the eyes of a reasonable and fair-minded third person as to the arbitrator's independence or impartiality?\n\n88.\n\nThe previous appointments of Judge Schwebel as arbitrator on behalf of parties represented by counsel for the Claimant occurred in 1997 and 2008, and those as expert in 2005 and 2008, approximately fifteen, seven, and three and a half years prior to his appointment in this case.\n\n89.\n\nConsidered in the context of Judge Schwebel's total number of publicly known appointments as arbitrator or expert, the four prior appointments on behalf of parties represented by counsel for the Claimant do not give rise to justifiable doubts as to Judge Schwebel's financial independence. In terms of the potential effect that the appointments might hold for an appearance of bias on the part of Judge Schwebel, a closer look is warranted.\n\n90.\n\nJudge Schwebel's appointment in the *Red Sea Islands Arbitration* is remote in time\u2014the appointment being some fifteen years prior to the one under consideration. On the other hand, Judge Schwebel's appointment in the *Abyei Arbitration* is an important and relatively recent appointment. The retainer of Judge Schwebel as expert in the first Shell Oil matter is also significant. This potential conflict is however not significantly augmented by the second opinion. The submission of a nearly identical opinion in a related case involving the same party, counsel, and subject matter renders the second retainer akin to a continuation of the first.\n\n91.\n\nThe second opinion could, nonetheless, enhance an appearance of prejudgment to the extent that its contents are relevant to the present matter. However, beyond a general summary and analysis of the law on denial of justice at international law, the opinion focuses on the examination of a particular Nicaraguan law and judgments rendered pursuant thereto. It does not therefore express an opinion on any matter distinctly put in issue in the present arbitration. Nor does it demonstrate an unwillingness or apparent inability to consider alternative viewpoints and arguments that may be presented in the course of this arbitration. Indeed, the second opinion is almost identical to the first, except for the removal of a few paragraphs where Judge Schwebel had explicitly analyzed and drawn conclusions as to the compliance of the Nicaraguan law and proceedings with international due process. The second opinion therefore restricts itself more closely to a simple analysis of the relevant doctrine and jurisprudence on denial of justice, drawing principally on sources relied upon by the Respondent itself in these proceedings.\n\n92.\n\nTaking all relevant circumstances into account, the prior appointments of Judge Schwebel\u2014 while relevant disclosure items\u2014do not give rise to justifiable doubts in the eyes of a reasonable and fair-minded third person. The earlier appointments are limited in number and were spread over a significant period. They do not support the inference that Judge Schwebel has developed a particular affinity or close professional relationship with the counsel for the Claimant. Nor does the content of the expert opinions suggest that he has prejudged issues in the present case.\n\n*3. The circumstances considered in the aggregate*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThird, the Respondent argues that the above-circumstances, if viewed in the aggregate, \"confirm the existence of a close professional relationship and combined efforts [\u2026] between Claimant's counsel and Judge Schwebel, on the basis of which any reasonable third party would conclude the he either is, or appears to be, partial and non-independent.\"98\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, pp. 19-20.\n\n94.\n\nThere is merit in the argument that several circumstances can, considered in the aggregate, give rise to justifiable doubts concerning an arbitrator's independence and impartiality, even when each of the circumstances, if viewed separately, does not give rise to justifiable doubts. As previously discussed, neither the circumstances of Judge Schwebel's late and incomplete disclosure, nor the circumstances of his previous appointments on behalf of parties represented by counsel for the Claimant, give rise to justifiable doubts on their own. This assessment does not, in this case, change when considered in the aggregate. The earlier appointments coupled with the inadvertent omission of a previous appointment as expert in a case before a U.S. district court to render an opinion which is largely identical to a voluntarily-disclosed prior appointment does not, in the eyes of a reasonable, objective, and informed third person amount to a \"close professional relationship\" giving rise to justifiable doubts as to Judge Schwebel's impartiality or independence.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n**NOW THEREFORE**, I, Hugo Hans Siblesz, Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, having considered the submissions of the Parties and the comments of Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, and having established to my satisfaction my competence to decide this challenge in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,\n\n**HEREBY REJECT** the challenge brought against Judge Stephen M. Schwebel under Article 10(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules."}, {"Title": "Second Decision on Interim Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2016-09-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Second Decision on Interim Measures\n-----------------------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 7 March 2016 the Tribunal issued a Decision on Interim Measures under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules 1976 (the 'Interim Measures Order' or 'Order'), in which it ordered as follows:\n\n1. **Orders** that, in the event of a Judgment by the National Court of Justice reinstating in whole or in part the judgments of the Trial Court or the Court of Appeals in the litigation by PROPHAR against MSDIA:\n\nA. Ecuador shall forthwith ensure, by means of its own choosing, that all further proceedings and actions directed towards the enforcement of the judgments mentioned above are suspended pending delivery by the Tribunal of its final Award, and shall inform the Tribunal of the action that has been taken to that effect;\n\nB. Either Party in the Arbitration may thereafter apply to the Tribunal for variation of this Order in the light of the terms of the Judgment of the National Court of Justice.\n\n2. **Orders further** that Ecuador is under the obligation to communicate this Order without delay to the National Court of Justice and any other authority with jurisdiction to enforce the judgments referred to in paragraph 1 above.\n\n3. **Requests that**, if the parties have notice of the date or likely date of the National Court of Justice's Judgment, they should inform the Tribunal.\n\n2.\n\nOn 4 August 2016, the National Court of Justice (NCJ) handed down its Judgment ('the new NCJ Judgment'), which was transmitted to the Tribunal by the Claimant on the following day and in a complete version on 9 August 2016, followed by an English translation on 11 August 2016, accompanied by an urgent application for a new decision confirming the application of the Interim Measures Order to the new NCJ Judgment, later expanded in the course of subsequent correspondence to include, in the alternative, an application for a new decision varying the terms of the Order to take account of the new NCJ Judgment.\n\n3.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to recite once more the procedural and factual background of the arbitration or the representation of the Parties. The present Decision should instead be read together with the Interim Measures Order for those purposes. It will accordingly contain no more than a brief description of the correspondence and a summary of the Parties' written and oral submissions regarding the new NCJ Judgment. A full factual background and procedural history will be included in the Tribunal's forthcoming Award.\n\n**B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated 12 March 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Attorney-General of Ecuador, in compliance with the Interim Measures Order, had communicated its terms together with an unofficial translation to the Associate Judges of the Civil and Commercial Chamber of the National Court of Justice, to the Presiding Judge of the Civil Judicial Unit of the Metropolitan District of Quito, with copies to the President of the National Court of Justice, the Constitutional Court, and the Council of the Judiciary.\n\n5.\n\nThe new Judgment of the NCJ in the *PROPHAR v. MSDIA* litigation was handed down on 5 August 2016. It awarded PROPHAR USD 41,966,571.60 in damages for precontractual liability.\n\n6.\n\nIn its letter of 10 August 2016, the Claimant requested the Tribunal: (i) to confirm that the Interim Measures Order applies to the new NCJ Judgment and that Ecuador is, therefore, obliged to \"ensure, by means of its own choosing, that all further proceedings and actions directed towards the enforcement of the [Judgment] are suspended pending delivery by the Tribunal of its final Award\"; (ii) to \"direct Ecuador to inform the Tribunal of the specific steps it has undertaken and will undertake to ensure compliance with the Tribunal's Decision, as directed by the terms of that Decision.\"\n\n7.\n\nBy letters of 9 and 11 August 2016, the Tribunal reminded the Parties of the terms of the Interim Measures Order concerning enforcement (see above), and: (a) offered the Parties the opportunity, in the light of the apparent significance of the new NCJ Judgment, to submit observations on its effects on their final submissions in the arbitration and in other respects, and (b) requested the Respondent to respond to the question of whether the new NCJ Judgment fell within the scope of the Interim Measures Order and to indicate to the Tribunal the steps it had taken to comply with paragraph 2 of the Order, as well as any further steps it has now undertaken in the light of paragraph 1.A. of the Order.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 13 August 2016, the Respondent opposed the Claimant's request on the grounds that the new NCJ Judgment did not fall within the scope of the Interim Measures Order; it recalled the measures that had been taken by the Attorney-General of Ecuador (paragraph 4 above).\n\n9.\n\nFollowing a further exchange of correspondence between the Parties and the Tribunal on 13, 15, and 16 August 2016, the Claimant clarified, via e-mail, that its request was in the first place that the Tribunal should confirm that the new NCJ Judgment fell within the scope of the Interim Measures Order, and only if the Tribunal concluded to the contrary, that the Tribunal should modify its Order to protect against the enforcement of the Judgment.\n\n10.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, the Respondent, for its part, submitted: (i) that the Interim Measures Order did not apply to the new NCJ Judgment; (ii) that the Claimant's request to vary the terms of the Order would circumvent the requirements for interim measures; (iii) that Ecuador had fully complied with the terms of the Order; (iv) and that any schedule for further submissions should factor in the deadline for any possible Extraordinary Protection Action to be filed against the new NCJ Judgment.\n\n11.\n\nOn 18 August 2016, the Claimant, by e-mail, objected to the Respondent's \"attempt unilaterally to change the procedure established by the Tribunal for written submissions on the implications of the NCJ judgment,\" and noted that the Respondent had failed to confirm that Ecuador would take all steps to preserve the status quo until the Tribunal's decision on the Claimant's request.\n\n12.\n\nOn 22 August 2016, a hearing was held by telephone conference-call. All members of the Tribunal, and Counsel and Representatives from both Parties, participated in the hearing, along with the Tribunal's Assistant and members of the PCA. There were two rounds of oral argument and the Parties responded to questions put by members of the Tribunal. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal gave leave to each Party to introduce further documents, which were duly filed the following day.\n\n13.\n\nOn 24 August 2016, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to submit a brief response to a new argument raised by the Claimant during the hearing, which the Tribunal granted, and afforded the Claimant the possibility of replying briefly to the Respondent's comments once submitted. The Parties' responses were duly received on 24 and 26 August, respectively.\n\n**C. THE NEW NCJ JUDGMENT OF 4 AUGUST 2016**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn the basis of the Parties' written and oral submissions described above, and the English translation furnished by the Claimant, the Tribunal understands the essence of the new NCJ Judgment to be as follows: -\n\na) The NCJ \"partially set aside\" the judgment of the Court of Appeals rendered on 23 September 2011 because it failed \"to apply the substantive rule indicated in point 6.5.2 [Article 4 of Law 200-12 (Official Gazette No. 59 of April 17, 2000)] and also failed to provide the sufficient legal reasoning discussed in point 6.2.1 in section SIX of this decision.\"\n\nb) The NCJ then went on to take \"the place of the lower court, to complete and rectify the errors and render a judgment on the merits of the facts established in the judgment, as provided by Article 16 of the Cassation law.\"\n\nc) The NCJ found that MSDIA was extra-contractually liable, having committed an unintentional tort pursuant to Article 2211 of the Civil Code of Ecuador.\n\nd) The amount of damages was calculated on the basis of the expert report prepared by Mr. Cabrera during the Court of Appeals proceedings and then applying to the results reached therein the 20% maximum profit allowed under Article 4 of the Ecuadorian Law on the Production, Importation, Commercialization and Dispensing of Generic Medications for Human Use of April 17, 2000.\n\ne) On the above basis, PROPHAR was awarded damages in the amount of USD 41,966,571.60.\n\n**D. THE PARTIES SUBMISSIONS ON THE APPLICABILITY OF THE DECISION ON INTERIM MEASURES TO THE NEW NCJ DECISION**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant framed its written request in the following terms:\n\nthat the Tribunal issue an order:\n\n(1) confirming that its Decision of 7 March 2016 applies to the NCJ's 4 August 2016 Judgment, and therefore that Ecuador is obligated to \"ensure, by means of its own choosing, that all further proceedings and actions directed towards the enforcement of the [NCJ's 4 August 2016 Judgment] are suspended pending delivery by the Tribunal of its final Award\" (or alternatively varying the terms of its 7 March 2016 Decision to cover the NCJ's 4 August 2016 Judgment);\n\n(2) directing that all branches of Ecuador's government, including both the judicial and executive branches, ensure that all further proceedings and actions directed towards the enforcement of the NCJ's 4 August 2016 Judgment are suspended pending delivery by the Tribunal of its final Award; and\n\n(3) directing Ecuador to inform the Tribunal of the specific steps it has taken in this regard, as directed by the terms of the Tribunal's Decision.\n\n16.\n\nThis was justified on the basis that the First Decision \"was intended to prevent enforcement of a judgment against MSDIA that perpetuated the effects of the trial court and court of appeals judgments that are at issue\" and that the new NCJ Judgment reinstates at least in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals, as evidenced by the fact that the NCJ itself states that it is only partially setting aside the Court of Appeals' decision. The Judgment rejects MSDIA's grounds for cassation and in particular adopts the Court of Appeals' assessment of the evidence regarding both liability and damages and the Court of Appeals' calculation of damages. Moreover, the NCJ only reduced the damages holding to a portion of the damages awarded by the Court of Appeals, but in doing so relied exclusively, as the basis for its adjusted quantum of damages, on the \"blatantly irrational and likely corrupt expert report of Mr. Cristian Cabrera,\" despite this report having been dismissed as illogical by the previous two NCJ holdings.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant draws the conclusion that Ecuador is already under a subsisting obligation to take steps to avoid the enforcement of the new Judgment, with which it has not complied; Ecuador could, for example, have instructed the \"executive branch officials responsible for executing civil judgments to take no steps to enforce the NCJ's 4 August 2016 Judgment.\"\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant denies that the Tribunal's interim measures constitute interference with the independence of Ecuador's judiciary, as Article 363 of Ecuador's General Organic Code of Procedure requires national judges to enforce international arbitral awards and \"preventive orders\" issued by international arbitral tribunals such as the present one. Ecuador may not in any case assert the limitations of its domestic law as a defence to nonfulfilment of its international obligations. As regards the other provisions of Ecuador's Organic Code of Procedure relied on by the Respondent, they contain rules governing only domestic courts and not international arbitral tribunals. According to the Claimant, an international arbitral tribunal's authority to issue interim measures is broader than that set forth in Ecuador's Organic Code of Procedure\u2014as appears both from the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and from Article 9 of Ecuador's Arbitration and Mediation Law\u2014and Article 363 requires the enforcement of such interim measures despite these not being listed in Title III of the Organic Code of Procedure.\n\n19.\n\nFinally, the Claimant recalls and repeats its earlier submission that enforcement of the NCJ Judgment would cause irreparable harm, in the shape of the destruction of MSDIA's business in Ecuador considering that the amount awarded by the Third NCJ Judgment exceeds the total value of the assets of MSDIA's Ecuadorian branch. The Claimant submits that this was the risk which the First Decision on Interim Measures sought to prevent, irrespective of whether the NCJ's damages award was USD 150 million or a lesser amount, and reiterates the urgency, given the likelihood of swift enforcement as the NCJ had explicitly rejected the Interim Measures Order and had invoked \"the Constitutional Court's threat of criminal sanctions against any judge who does not comply with the Constitutional Court's dictates.\" It was possible that the enforcement proceedings, including the seizure of MSDIA's assets, could be complete by the beginning of September 2016.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn rebutting these arguments, the Respondent contends that the new NCJ Judgment does not \"reinstate in whole or in part the judgments of the Trial Court or the Court of Appeals\" in the terms of paragraph 1.A of the Interim Measures Order; it has not therefore taken any step in respect of that paragraph, but this does not imply a breach of the Order, since the only obligation arising from it is the one set forth in paragraph 2, which it had already complied with (see paragraph 4 above).\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the new NCJ Judgment does not reinstate the Court of Appeals' decision because, in accepting two of the grounds of cassation brought by MSDIA, it annulled the Court of Appeal's decision and consequently issued a new judgment which replaced and did not reinstate the decision of the lower court. Furthermore, (i) the NCJ found MSDIA liable exclusively for the commission of an unintentional tort and not liable on antitrust grounds as the Court of Appeals had done; (ii) the NCJ reassessed the evidence submitted by both parties in the national litigation; (iii) although the NCJ did not question the admissibility of the Cabrera Report, it did review the substance of the Report as seen by the fact that it substantially corrected the amount of damages specified by the expert and awarded by the Court of Appeals.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Interim Measures Order, if it applied in the manner argued by the Claimant, would impose a \"tremendous, even disproportionate burden\" on Ecuador, because it would apply to any NCJ decision independently of the amount awarded against MSDIA. The Respondent contends, to the contrary, that the purpose of the Order, as is evident from its terms and from the Claimant's submissions during the proceedings which led to the Order, was solely to protect MSDIA from a judgment of USD 150 million or more. According to the Respondent, the Claimant, in fact, \"never argued any other 'necessary level of gravity'.\"\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the NCJ did not reject the Interim Measures Order, which was in any event not directed to the NCJ itself, but to the judges responsible for the enforcement of an NCJ Judgment; all that the NCJ said was that the Order violated provisions of the Ecuadorian Constitution to the extent that it sought to interfere with the NCJ's internal and external autonomy.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimant's request for a variation of the terms of the Interim Measures Order was an attempt to circumvent its burden to satisfy the requirements for interim measures, for example by evading the need to demonstrate irreparable harm. In issuing any decision on interim measures, the Tribunal was required to balance the hardship on both Parties. Were the Tribunal to decide that the Third NCJ Judgment fell within the scope of its interim measures, the Respondent contends that its hardship would be greater by obliging Ecuador to act in contravention of its own laws, and moreover to violate Article 168 of the Constitution\u2014which guarantees the independence of the judiciary\u2014as well as Article 75 of the Constitution and Article 8 of the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights\u2014which guarantee the right to effective judicial protection. The Respondent submits that the Attorney General has no power to intervene in a private litigation, even just to comment on the hierarchy between the constitution and international treaties.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the argument that the Interim Measures Order is a \"preventive order\" in the sense of Article 363 of the Organic Law of Procedure, as Title III of that Law exhaustively sets out the available types of \"preventive orders\": sequestration of assets, retention of assets, prohibition on sale of real property, and orders not to exit the country. Article 363 could not in any event apply in contradiction with the Ecuadorian constitutional order which prohibits the interference with an otherwise enforceable judgment of an Ecuadorian Court, which is prohibited even for the Constitutional Court.\n\n26.\n\nAs to urgency, the Respondent submits that the procedure for the enforcement of the Third NCJ Judgment is slower than asserted by the Claimant and estimates that it would be completed only by late September 2016.\n\n27.\n\nAs regards the requirement of irreparable harm, the Respondent recalls that MSDIA is the Claimant in this arbitration and not its Ecuadorian branch, and that MSDIA as a whole could easily afford to make payment of either USD 34 or 42 million on the Third NCJ Judgment without suffering irreparable harm.\n\n28.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the NCJ's handling of the Cabrera Report did not constitute a denial of justice because it is a formal expert report which has a formal place in the hierarchy of evidence in the Ecuadorian legal order; Mr. Cabrera had been legitimately appointed as an expert by the Court of Appeals and thus that the Ecuadorian courts had all legitimately considered the Report. The NCJ had legitimately declined to reassess admissibility of the Cabrera Report, but reviewed its substantive content. The Respondent adds that it is not its place to defend the Report, but only to argue that the NCJ was entitled to use it as a starting point for calculating damages.\n\n**E. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal prefaces its decision by two preliminary observations.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal was gravely disturbed to read in the new NCJ Judgment that the Tribunal's Order on Interim Measures had been construed by that high jurisdiction as \"interference of the Arbitration Tribunal in the affairs of the National Court of Justice... in violation of Rule No. 1 of Article 168, which establishes that Courts shall have internal and external autonomy.\" Nothing could be further from the truth. To the contrary, the Tribunal was at pains to indicate its recognition of the important principle of judicial independence, as expressly set out in paragraph 2 of the Interim Measures Order in the following terms:\n\nThe Tribunal is acutely conscious of the importance of the principle that the courts of Ecuador, like the courts of any other country, should be independent, and free from direction by the Executive power. The independence of the judiciary represents an essential principle of the rule of law which must be upheld. The Tribunal notes, however, that the underlying issue is one which has confronted other international judicial bodies, including on several recent occasions the International Court of Justice itself, both in the context of judgments on the merits of disputes and in the context of interim measures, and has never been found to stand in the way of the issue of appropriately formulated relief. It is, of course, common ground between both Parties to the present arbitration and the Tribunal, that under international law the actions and omissions of the Courts engage the international responsibility of the State in the same way as other organs of the State.\n\n31.\n\nTo the above needs be added merely that, as recognized by the Respondent in the present proceedings, the interim measures ordered by the Tribunal (paragraph 1 above) were explicitly framed as a temporary (and contingent) restraint on enforcement, pending the issue of the Tribunal's Award, and could not by any stretch of the imagination be read as interference in the decision making of the competent court of record.\n\n32.\n\nThe second observation is one that should be equally plain, but in the circumstances seems worth spelling out. In drawing attention, quite properly, to the balance of hardship calculus inherent in any decision to order interim measures, the Respondent has once again made much of what it has described as the burden of having to act contrary to its own law if it were to be required to interfere with the enforcement of the judgment of a competent domestic court in favour of a private party.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal has no difficulty in grasping the point the Respondent seeks to make. It encounters, however, objections at various levels. At the purely factual level, as has already been pointed out above, the Interim Measures Order is a purely holding measure, pending the issuance of the Tribunal's Award, and the same would be true of any further decision emanating from the present proceedings. Furthermore, as also indicated, the issue is merely one of enforcement, not of external interference with the independent judicial function, and for good measure the Order specifically leaves to Ecuador the choice of means to achieve the stated end. At the legal level, the position is surely as follows: if the Tribunal were, in its Award, to find that it had jurisdiction and that the Claimant's rights under the BIT had been infringed, it would seem inevitably to be the case that the enforcement in the meanwhile of the new NCJ Judgment would be an aggravation of the treaty breach with adverse consequences for the Respondent's liability. In other words, a holding measure of limited duration would be to the ultimate advantage of both sides, not just one of them. The Tribunal adds in this connection its own firm endorsement of the point made in argument during the course of the oral hearing that it is never open to a Government to advance the state of its internal law as a justification for not complying with its international obligations.\n\n34.\n\nTo move now to the main point at issue, the Tribunal begins by noting that the Interim Measures Order, which in the circumstances was unavoidably contingent in character, incorporated by design a mechanism to cope with future eventualities. As expressed in its paragraph 1.B, \"Either Party in the Arbitration may thereafter [i.e. after the handing down of the Judgment] apply to the Tribunal for variation of this Order in the light of the terms of the Judgment of the National Court of Justice.\" Having made express provision for this eventuality, the Tribunal saw no advantage in diverging from it. It therefore indicated to the Parties in advance of the oral hearing that it would put them on a footing of equality, and treat the Claimant as (in effect) seeking the variation of the Order so as to make it apply explicitly to the new NCJ Judgment, while treating the Respondent as (in effect) seeking the discharge of the Order on the basis that the Judgment as actually delivered fell outside the intendment of the measures ordered in it.\n\n35.\n\nThis arrangement corresponds, in the view of the Tribunal, to the reality of the situation, in that the criteria of risk, urgency, harm, and balance of advantage remain as set out in the Decision of 7 March 2016, and the only question that remains is whether the assessment of any of these criteria is to be varied in the light of the circumstances now actually obtaining after the handing down of the new NCJ Judgment. The Tribunal's considered judgment is that they do not. As described above, the main arguments marshalled by the Respondent are (i) that the new NCJ Judgment does not, in strict jurisprudential terms, 'reinstate in whole or in part the judgments of the Trial Court or the Court of Appeals'; (ii) that the orders of magnitude are decisively altered, in that the damages awarded are now no more than USD 42 million, by comparison with an earlier 150 million; and (iii) that an amount of that magnitude can easily be met out of the worldwide resources of Merck Sharp and Dohme.\n\n36.\n\nPoint (iii) can be set aside without more, as the same point was extensively argued both within the main arbitration proceedings and those on the Interim Measures Order and was taken into account by the Tribunal in issuing that Order, as were the remainder of the requirements for interim measures which need not be re-decided here. Likewise, whether the Respondent's argument as regards point (i) is technically accurate or not, no further explanation is needed that the Tribunal's concern was, and remains, not the form of the domestic judgments, but rather their effect on the interests assessed as being in need of protection.\n\n37.\n\nThe central issue for consideration seems therefore to be point (ii). There is certainly no denying, as the Respondent says, that a judgment debt of 42 million is markedly different from one of 150 million. However, and without entering into questions of the merits which will be dealt with in the Tribunal's forthcoming Award, in the context of the Tribunal's broad powers under the UNCITRAL Rules to take any interim measures it deems necessary, the issue remains not the absolute quantum of liability under the domestic judicial decisions, but the risk of irreparable harm to the interests meriting protection. Seen in that light, it is clear to the Tribunal, on the basis of the arguments put to it in this phase of the proceedings and earlier, that a domestic liability of USD 42 million is not outside the range of risk previously assessed by it when issuing the Interim Measures Order. This being so, the Tribunal's assessment of the criteria for the taking of interim measures, and whether they are satisfied in this case, remains as in its Order of 7 March 2106. The Tribunal cannot therefore accede to the Respondent's submission that the Order should be discharged as no longer applicable.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides, pursuant to Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976, to vary the terms of the Interim Measures Order of 7 March 2016 to read as follows: -\n\nHaving regard to the Judgment of the National Court of Justice dated 4 August 2106 in the litigation by PROPHAR against MSD1A,\n\n1. Orders that Ecuador shall forthwith ensure, by means of its own choosing, that all further proceedings and actions directed towards the enforcement of that Judgment are suspended pending delivery by the Tribunal of its final Award, and shall inform the Tribunal of the action that has been taken to that effect.\n\n2. Orders further that Ecuador is under the obligation to communicate this Order without delay to any authority with jurisdiction to enforce that Judgment.\n\n3. Requests the parties to keep the Tribunal informed of any further developments affecting the matters referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above.\n\nThis Order may be referred to as the Second Order on Interim Measures."}]}
