Each such summary is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to reflect the Parties' principal arguments. For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee has carefully considered the entirety of the Parties' submissions in arriving at its determination, and the absence of reference to any particular matter should not be taken as an indication that the Committee has not considered the same.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn November 5, 2020, the Tribunal rendered its Award, which included a dissenting opinion of Arbitrator Charles Poncet (\"**Dissenting Opinion**\") and an additional declaration of President Alfredo Bullard and Arbitrator Alexis Mourre.\n\n6.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal found that Panama had breached certain provisions of the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama Concerning the Treatment and Protection of Investments signed on 27th of October 1982 in Washington, D.C., as amended by a Protocol Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Panama signed on the 1st of June 2000 (the \"**BIT**\" or \"**Treaty**\"). In particular, the Tribunal decided (*inter alia*) as follows:\n\n*b. Panama has violated Articles II and IV of the Treaty and international law with respect to the Claimant's investment, respectively, by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment, by impairing the management, operation, use and enjoyment by arbitrary measures; and by expropriating the Claimant's investment without prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\n\n*c. Panama shall pay damages to Dominion in an amount of US$ 14,111,140.80, plus pre- and post-award annually compound interest at a rate of U.S. Dollar LIBOR + 4% from March 26, 2012 until the date of Panama's full and effective payment.*\n\n*d. Panama shall pay additional direct damages to Dominion in an amount of US$ 1,861,689.25, plus pre- and post-award annually compound interest at a rate of U.S. Dollar LIBOR + 4% from November 30, 2017 until the date of Panama's full and effective payment.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*f. Respondent shall be responsible for (i) 25% of the Claimant's legal costs including attorney's fees and expenses, with the exclusion of any amount derived from the third party funding agreements, as well as (ii) 25% of the expended portion of the Claimant's advances to ICSID (as reflected in ICSID's final case account balance) plus post-award annually compound interest at a rate of U.S. Dollar LIBOR + 4% until the date of Panama's full and effective payment.*1\n\nAward, \u00b6780.\n\n7.\n\nOn March 4, 2021, Dominion filed its Application for Partial Annulment of the Award (\"**Application for Annulment**\") pursuant to Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\" or \"**Convention**\") and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n8.\n\nIn the Application for Annulment, Dominion submits that:2\n\n(i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention;\n\n(ii) there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention; and\n\n(iii) the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\nApplication for Annulment, \u00b610.\n\n9.\n\nOn the basis of these grounds, Dominion seeks annulment of (i) \"*the majority's decision as to damages as set forth in paragraphs 780(c) and 780(d) of the Award, together with the relevant reasoning set forth in Title VII \u2013 Damages, found at pages 145 to 190*\" (the \"**Award on Damages**\"); and (ii) \"*the majority's decision as to costs as set forth in paragraph 780(f) of the Award, together with the relevant reasoning set forth in Title VIII \u2013 Costs, found at pages 191 to 204*\" (the \"**Award on Costs**\").3 Dominion also requests that Panama bear all of the costs of the annulment proceedings, including its legal fees, with interest, pursuant to Articles 61(2) and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention.4\n\nApplication for Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 37.\n\nApplication for Annulment, \u00b6 37.\n\n10.\n\nOn March 17, 2021, the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or \"**Centre**\") registered the Application for Annulment.\n\n11.\n\nOn April 15, 2021, ICSID submitted a proposal for the composition of the *ad hoc* committee and invited the Parties to comment on it by April 26, 2021. Dominion and Panama filed their observations on April 26 and April 30, 2021, respectively.\n\n12.\n\nOn May 25, 2021, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that the three members of the *ad hoc* committee (\"**Committee**\") had accepted their appointments. Accordingly, the Committee was deemed to have been constituted and the annulment proceeding to have begun as of that date pursuant to Arbitration Rules 6 and 53.\n\n13.\n\nThe Committee is composed of Mr. Toby Landau QC, a national of the United Kingdom, President of the Committee; Ms. Loretta Malintoppi, a national of Italy; and Ms. Dyal\u00e1 Jim\u00e9nez Figueres, a national of Costa Rica. Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n14.\n\nOn May 27, 2021, the Committee wrote to the Parties regarding the arrangements for the first session to be held pursuant to Arbitration Rules 13(1) and 53 (\"**First Session**\"). The Committee proposed the following dates to hold the First Session by video conference: July 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 2021.\n\n15.\n\nAlso on May 27, 2021, ICSID requested the Applicant to make an initial payment of USD 200,000 (the \"**Advance Payment**\") pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e) by June 28, 2021.\n\n16.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, the Committee confirmed that the First Session would be held on July 16, 2021 by video conference.\n\n17.\n\nOn June 24, 2021, Panama submitted a *Request for the Stay of Enforcement of the Award and Application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5)*, together with factual exhibits RA-1 to RA-18, and legal exhibits RLA-1 to RLA-43 (\"**Panama's Stay Request**\" and \"**Panama's Rule 41(5) Request**\").5\n\nPanama's June 24, 2021 submission comprises both applications.\n\n18.\n\nOn June 28, 2021, Dominion requested a two-week extension to make the Advance Payment, *i.e.*, by July 12, 2021.\n\n19.\n\nOn June 29, 2021, the Committee granted the request of June 28, 2021.\n\n20.\n\nOn June 30, 2021, ICSID transmitted a draft Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\") and invited the Parties to confer concerning the items addressed in the draft PO1 and submit a joint proposal by July 12, 2021.\n\n21.\n\nAlso on June 30, 2021, the Committee invited Dominion to reply to Panama's Stay Request and Panama's Rule 41(5) Request by July 9, 2021, should it wish to do so.\n\n22.\n\nOn July 7, 2021, Dominion informed the Committee of its intention to respond to Panama's Stay Request and Panama's Rule 41(5) Request. It also provided an update regarding the Advance Payment, indicating that \"*it would be unlikely to be in a position to transfer funds by 12 July as requested.*\"\n\n23.\n\nOn July 9, 2021, Dominion submitted a *Reply to the Respondent's Request for the Stay of Enforcement of the Award*, along with factual exhibits CR-1 to CR-4 and legal exhibits CRL-1 to CRL-27 (\"**Dominion's Response on Stay**\").\n\n24.\n\nOn July 12, 2021, the Parties requested additional time to July 15, 2021 to submit joint comments on the draft PO1.\n\n25.\n\nOn July 13, 2021, not having received the Advance Payment, the Committee cancelled the First Session.\n\n26.\n\nOn July 15, 2021, Panama raised a concern that \"*Claimant's silence concerning Panama's preliminary objections could be prolonged far beyond Panama's proposed date for Claimant's reply submission (i.e., 23 July 2021)*\" and requested that the Committee \"*consider taking a decision on the deadline for Claimant to respond on Panama's application pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) prior to the first session.*\"\n\n27.\n\nOn July 16, 2021, the Committee fixed August 4, 2021 as the new date for the First Session. The Committee also directed Dominion to file a substantive response to Panama's Rule 41(5) Request, by July 29, 2021.\n\n28.\n\nOn July 23, 2021, the Parties submitted their joint comments on draft PO1.\n\n29.\n\nOn July 27, 2021, ICSID requested an update regarding the status of the Advance Payment.\n\n30.\n\nOn July 29, 2021, Dominion filed its *Reply to the Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules*, together with legal exhibits CRL-28 to CRL-35 (\"**Dominion's Response on 41(5)**\").\n\n31.\n\nOn July 31, 2021, ICSID informed the Parties that to hold the First Session on August 4, 2021, \"*the Committee requires a partial payment of USD 100,000 to be made by Tuesday 3 August at 12 noon Washington DC time*.\"\n\n32.\n\nOn August 3, 2021, not having received the Advance Payment, ICSID informed the Parties of the default and invited either party to make such a payment by August 18, 2021.\n\n33.\n\nOn August 18, 2021, Dominion informed ICSID that \"*it had been successful in raising the necessary funds*\" and requested a 30-day extension to wire the Advance Payment.\n\n34.\n\nNo payment having been received, on October 5, 2021, the Committee decided to grant the Applicant \"*a further and final extension of one month*\", requesting that the Advance Payment be made by November 5, 2021. The Committee further indicated that \"*[f]ailure to do so will leave the Applicant liable to a decision on the termination of this proceeding pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and (e).*\"\n\n35.\n\nOn November 24, 2021, ICSID confirmed its receipt of the Advance Payment.\n\n36.\n\nFollowing exchanges on scheduling, on January 12, 2022, the Committee confirmed that the First Session would be held on February 23, 2022 by video conference. It also fixed as agenda items for the session (i) the finalization of draft PO1 with the agreement of the Parties; and (ii) the procedural handling of Panama's two applications of June 24, 2021.\n\n37.\n\nOn February 23, 2022, the Committee held the First Session with the Parties by video conference.\n\n38.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, the Committee issued PO1, which recorded the Parties' agreements and the Committee's decisions on procedural matters. PO1 was accompanied by Annex A containing the procedural calendar.\n\n39.\n\nAlso on February 28, 2022, the Committee decided as follows regarding Panama's Stay Request and Panama's Rule 41(5) Request:\n\n*First, regarding the Respondent's Request for the Stay of the Enforcement of the Award, the Committee confirms that it does not require any further submissions and that a decision on this matter will be issued shortly.*\n\n*Second, as to the Respondent's Application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), the Committee requests further submissions by each Party on the following two points:*\n\n*(a) Paragraphs 8 & 9 of the Applicant's (Dominion Minerals Corp.) Reply dated July 29, 2021, and the authorities cited therein \u2013 and the submission that the test for dismissal under Arbitration Rule 41(5) at the annulment stage is more rigorous than at the arbitration stage.*\n\n*(b) Whether any further points require to be made on the basis of any authorities on Arbitration Rule 41(5) issued since the date of the Parties' submissions.*\n\n40.\n\nOn March 10, 2022, Panama filed its *Response to Claimant's Reply to Respondent's Objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5)*, with legal exhibits RAL-48 to RLA-60 (\"**Panama's Reply on 41(5)**\").\n\n41.\n\nOn March 16, 2022, Dominion requested that Part III of Panama's Reply on 41(5) be disregarded because it had gone beyond the Committee's directions of February 28, 2022. Alternatively, if the Committee considered Panama's Response on 41(5) in full, Dominion requested an opportunity to reply to Part III of such a submission.\n\n42.\n\nAlso on March 16, 2022, Panama objected to the above request by Dominion.\n\n43.\n\nOn March 17, 2022, the Committee decided to partially grant the Applicant's above request and directed Dominion to address in 15 pages all matters covered in Panama's Reply on 41(5) by March 25, 2022.\n\n44.\n\nOn March 25, 2022, Dominion submitted its *Rejoinder to the Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules*, together with legal exhibits CRL-36 to CRL-40 (\"**Dominion's Rejoinder on 41(5)**\").\n\n**III. PANAMA'S APPLICATION TO STAY ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n***1. Panama's Position***\n--------------------------\n\n45.\n\nPanama contends that \"*either party may at any time during the Annulment proceeding, request a stay of enforcement of all or part of the Tribunal Award*\" pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules.6 It further asserts that the stay of enforcement may concern \"*an award of damages, award of costs or some other form of relief ordered by the original Tribunal.*\"7\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 57.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 57.\n\n46.\n\nIt is Panama's case that the Committee may stay the enforcement of the Award \"*if it considers that the circumstances require it.*\"8 In examining such circumstances, Panama maintains that the Committee has \"broad discretion\"9 and \"*is free to evaluate the arguments of the Parties in view of the particularities of each case.*\"10\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 60.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 60.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 60, citing *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7)*,* Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award (November 30, 2004), \u00b6 23 [hereinafter: *Mitchell v. Congo*].\n\n47.\n\nPanama's Stay Request is premised on the following grounds:\n\n*(A) The stay of enforcement is usually granted, with the exception of cases involving \"very exceptional circumstances\"; (B) There is no proof that Panama would not comply with the award; and (C) Requiring security for a stay of enforcement is not provided by ICSID Convention, would create an unjustified imbalance between the parties, and serious harm to Panama.*11\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 59.\n\n48.\n\nFirst, Panama argues that a stay of enforcement of an award is the \"*common practice*\"12 in annulment cases, and \"*shall be granted*\" save for \"*cases involving 'very' exceptional circumstances that may jeopardize the enforcement of the arbitral award.*\"13 Panama submits that there are no such \"*exceptional circumstances*\" here and thus that the Committee should grant its Stay Request.14\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 60 citing (*inter alia*) *Mitchell v. Congo,* \u00b628, and *Elsamex S.A. v. Republic of Honduras* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/4)*,* Decision on continuation of the stay of enforcement of the award (January 7, 2014), \u00b6 86 (\"*La pr\u00e1ctica en casos previos de anulaci\u00f3n ha consistido en el otorgamiento de la continuaci\u00f3n de la suspensi\u00f3n.*\") [hereinafter: *Elsamex v. Honduras- Decision on Stay*].\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 63.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 64.\n\n49.\n\nSecond, Panama confirms that it will comply with the Award.15 Panama notes that it has incorporated the ICSID Convention into its own legal system and compliance with an ICSID award is therefore a legal requirement under Panamanian law.16 Moreover, Panama could have requested the \"*full annulment of the Award*.\"17 Instead, it \"*preferred to comply with the Award and initiate conversations with Claimant to establish the form and timing of payment.*\"18 According to Panama, Dominion has rejected its payment proposal19 and decided to file an Application for Annulment, \"*profiting from additional interests to those already established by the Tribunal in the Award*.\"20\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6\u00b6 65-70.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 65.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 66.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 66.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 68.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 68.\n\n50.\n\nPanama further contends that the effect of a stay is to \"*suspend the losing party's obligation to abide by and comply with the award,*\"21 thereby \"*effectively freez[ing] all binding aspects of the award, including its res judicata effect*.\"22 However, a stay \"*does not 'affect the intrinsic legal validity of the award*'.\"23 In sum, Panama concludes that \"*there is no proof that [it] would not comply with the Award.*\"24\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 69.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 69.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 69 citing *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Interim Order N\u00b01 on Guinea's application for stay of enforcement of the Award (August 12, 1988).\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 70.\n\n51.\n\nThird, Panama argues that the ICSID Convention does not provide for security as a condition for the stay of enforcement of an award.25 It further maintains that *ad hoc* committees have only ordered the posting of security as a condition for a stay in \"*exceptional circumstances.*\"26\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 72, citing *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12)*,* Decision on the Argentina Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (December 28, 2007), \u00b6 34 [hereinafter: *Azurix v. Argentina*].\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 76, citing *e.g*., *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (November 4, 2008), \u00b612.\n\n52.\n\nPanama further asserts that if security is required for the granting of its Stay Request, \"*an unjustified imbalance would be created between the parties.*\"27 Dominion would be placed in a more favourable position than that which prevailed before the Stay Request, given that it would then be entitled to more interest beyond the date of the Award, or in the alternative, beyond the date of its Application for Annulment (March 4, 2021).28 By contrast, Panama would suffer \"*serious harm*\"29 as \"*interest[] [would] continue to accrue until the decision on partial annulment or until the decision of the resubmission Tribunal (although unjustified)*.\"30 Moreover, Panama would be \"*penalized for exercising its legitimate right of defence*\"31 under the ICSID Convention.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 78.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 77.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6\u00b6 77 and 80.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 77.\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 78.\n\n53.\n\nAccordingly, Panama requests that the Committee:\n\n*a.* ***Order*** *the stay of enforcement of the Award until a decision on annulment is rendered in these proceedings in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54*.32\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 82.\n\n***2. Dominion's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n54.\n\nDominion states at the outset that it did not request a stay of the enforcement of the Award in its Application for Annulment \"*for the simple reason that the Award had already limited itself to awarding the minimum of damages to Dominion*.\"33 In its view, *\"[g]iven that the Award's findings as to liability are not subject to the partial annulment application, if the application is successful and if there is a resubmission of the issue of damages to a new tribunal, the sums invested remain the baseline damages for Panama's liability*.\"34\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 2.\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 2.\n\n55.\n\nNotwithstanding its opposition to the application to stay, Dominion confirms that it does not intend to enforce the Award until its Application for Annulment is decided.35\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 2.\n\n56.\n\nDominion contends that Panama's Stay Request should be denied because (i) a stay is not presumed in ICSID proceedings, but rather is granted only in exceptional circumstances; and (ii) Panama will not comply with the Award. If the Committee decides to grant the Stay Request, Dominion argues that it should only do so on the provision of security by Panama.36\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4.\n\n57.\n\nFirst, Dominion argues that a stay of enforcement is not to be presumed in proceedings such as these.37 Rather, a stay is \"*an exception in the context of the remedy of annulment that is itself limited and exceptional*.\"38 Dominion asserts that when deciding whether or not to stay enforcement of an award, prior committees have considered a range of circumstances, including:39 whether there is (i) a risk of prejudice or hardship; (ii) a risk of non-compliance with the Award; and (iii) post-award interest available to remedy any prejudice resulting from the delay in enforcing the award. Dominion alleges that Panama, as the party requesting the stay, bears \"*the initial burden of pro[ving]*\" such exceptional circumstances,40 and that there is \"*little doubt that a stay should not be issued here*.\"41\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 5 (\"*Some* ad hoc *Committees have, either implicitly or explicitly, presumed that a Stay of Enforcement should be continued if requested, while others have rejected this presumption*\").\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 6 citing *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award (August 31, 2017), \u00b6 73.\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14.\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 10 citing *Tethyan Copper Company Pty Limited v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No ARB/12/1), Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award (September 17, 2020), \u00b6 135 [hereinafter: *Tethyan v. Paksitan*], and *Carnegie Minerals (Gambia) Limited v. Republic of The Gambia* (ICSID Case No ARB/09/19), Decision on the Gambia's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (October 18, 2018), \u00b6 42 [hereinafter: *Carnegie v. Gambia*].\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 15.\n\n58.\n\nAs to (i), Dominion argues that there is no evidence of any risk of financial prejudice or hardship to Panama such as to render the granting of the Stay Request appropriate.42 To the contrary, \"*the risk here in fact is fully imposed on Dominion in the form of Panama's non-compliance with the Award*.\"43\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 15.\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 15.\n\n59.\n\nAs to (ii), Dominion notes that Panama has not complied with the Award to date, notwithstanding Panama's stated intention to comply with it. Further, if the Stay Request is *\"granted and the [Application for Annulment is] not successful, Dominion could be relegated behind others who in the interim may obtain awards against Panama for their own claims.*\"44\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 15.\n\n60.\n\nAs to (iii), Dominion observes that Panama's Stay Request is \"*presumably intended to stop interest from accumulating on the Award, or at least create a question as to this effect*.\"45 As to this, Dominion argues that there is no reason to stop the accumulation of interest or create any lack of clarity as to its accrual because any future award in Dominion's favour would include at least the same baseline amount in terms of damages as has been ordered in the Award.46\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 16.\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 16.\n\n61.\n\nSecond, as noted in paragraph 59 above, Dominion emphasises that Panama does not intend to comply with the Award.47 Even after the Award was issued on November 5, 2020, \"*Panama showed no inclination of paying*.\"48 If it had any such inclination, so Dominion argues, Panama would have submitted evidence in support of its application showing that it would do so, or that it had tried to do so. But it has not.49\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, Section B.\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 19.\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 18-22.\n\n62.\n\nThird, it is Dominion's position that in the event that the Committee grants Panama's Stay Request, it should do so only on the provision of security.50 Dominion asserts that \"*a common consideration*\" in ICSID decisions is whether a stay should be granted subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, namely, the posting of a bond, bank guarantee, letter of credit, or similar provision of security in the total amount of the award.51 Here, Dominion contends that if the Committee is minded to grant the Stay Request, Panama should provide \"*unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantees by reputable international banks, with no principal establishment in Panama in the current amount of the Award [*i.e., *US$ 29,676,554] plus 10% to reflect the enforcement effort should that be necessary*.\"52\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 23-29.\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 23.\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 29.\n\n63.\n\nAccordingly, on the basis of the foregoing grounds, Dominion requests the following relief:\n\n*(a) that Panama's application for a Stay of Enforcement be denied in full;*\n\n*(b) that Dominion be awarded the costs, fees and expenses of this application, inclusive of attorneys' fees;*\n\n*(c) in the alternative, that any Stay of Enforcement be conditioned upon Panama first having posted adequate security in the form of an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantees by reputable international banks, with no principal establishment in Panama in the current amount of the Award plus 10%; and*\n\n*(d) any further relief as the Committee may deem appropriate*.53\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, Section IV.\n\n**B. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n***1. Applicable Legal Standard***\n----------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe stay of enforcement of an award in the context of annulment proceedings is governed by Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n65.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n*The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.*\n\n66.\n\nAs noted in the Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, a stay of enforcement may concern \"*an award of damages, award of costs or some other form of relief ordered by the original Tribunal.*\"54\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 54.\n\n67.\n\nUnder Article 52(5), a committee's decision to stay the enforcement of an award depends on whether \"*it considers that the circumstances so require*.\" The ICSID Convention neither prescribes nor proscribes the circumstances that may be relevant, and nor does it identify the relative weight to be given to any particular circumstances. Rather, as observed in numerous prior cases, the determination is left entirely to the discretion of the Committee.\n\n68.\n\nHence, as identified in the Parties' submissions, prior *ad hoc* committees have invoked a wide range of factors in determining whether or not grant a stay, including (by way of example): the existence of adverse economic consequences on either party; the risk of non-recovery of sums due under the award if the award is annulled; non-compliance with the award if the award is not annulled; any history of non-compliance with other awards or failure to pay advances to cover the costs of arbitration proceedings; and the balance of both parties' interests.55\n\nSee *e.g*., the list of factors distilled in the Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 56.\n\n69.\n\nRule 54 of the Arbitration Rules (\"*Stay of Enforcement of the Award*\") does not confine the ambit of this discretion. Rather, it simply provides a procedural framework for stay applications, as follows:\n\n*(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.*\n\n*(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.*\n\n*(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3)*\n\n*(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n*(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.*56\n\nIn this case, no request for a stay was included in the Application for Annulment. Accordingly paragraph (2) and the first sentence of paragraph (3) have no application.\n\n70.\n\nThere has been some debate between the Parties as to whether there is a presumption in favour or against the grant of a stay, or whether a stay ought to be considered as an exceptional measure. This is a debate that is also reflected in prior decisions. Some *ad hoc* committees have suggested that the grant of a stay pending an annulment is \"*common practice*\",57 and that a stay should ordinarily be continued or granted if requested.58 On the other hand, there are some annulment committees that have proposed that a stay should be exceptional given the presumption of immediate enforceability of ICSID awards.59 Lastly, there is a (arguably more substantial) body of prior decisions that suggests there is no presumption either way, given the absence of any wording to suggest otherwise in Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention. Whilst Article 54(4) of the ICSID Convention requires that the applicant for a stay specify the circumstances said to require the stay, the instruction in Article 52(5) is simply that the committee \"*consider[] [whether] .. the circumstances \u2026 require*\" a stay.60\n\nSee *e.g*., *Mitchell v.

Pakistan*, \u00b6\u00b6 131, 132.\n\n***2. The Circumstances of the Present Case***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nIn the Committee's view, there is one key circumstance in this application which is of critical significance, and which justifies a stay on whichever of the approaches identified in paragraph 70 above is adopted: namely the fact that it is Dominion, the award-creditor, that has applied for partial annulment of the Award, and it is Panama, not Dominion, that is seeking a stay. Further, the application is aimed at the monetary portions of the award.\n\n72.\n\nThis circumstance has a number of consequences.\n\n73.\n\n*First*, it is readily understandable that Panama is reluctant to pay an Award which Dominion is challenging (and questioning the final amounts that are payable), unless and until the status of the Award is resolved.\n\n74.\n\nDominion's position in seeking partial annulment at the same time as resisting the stay is, in the Committee's view, problematic. On the one hand Dominion is asking that both the Award on Damages and the Award on Costs be overturned. Yet on the other hand, Dominion is also insisting that, in the meantime, Panama incur interest on both.\n\n75.\n\nDominion seeks to cure the apparent inconsistency by arguing that (i) the liability portion of the Award is not being challenged, so that Panama's liability to Dominion will remain as is, regardless of the outcome of the annulment proceedings;61 and (ii) \"*in its present form the Award provides for the minimum level of damages for any of the breaches of the treaty.*\"62\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 17.\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 17. See similarly Dominion's Response on Stay, \u00b6 27: \"*The damages and interest which the Award assessed for this liability are essentially the minimum that could be assessed for this liability.*\"\n\n76.\n\nIn the Committee's view, neither point cures the inconsistency.\n\n77.\n\nAs to (i), the fact that Panama's *liability* is unchallenged is of no relevance, since, in and of itself, the Tribunal's finding on liability provides no indication as to the quantum of damages or costs that may be payable. A party may conceivably be liable for breach of a treaty but obliged to pay only nominal damages.\n\n78.\n\nAs to (ii), the assertion that the current award provides \"*the minimum level of damages*\" that will be payable in any event is, in the Committee's view, entirely speculative. It is to be recalled that Dominion is seeking annulment of both the Award on Damages and Award on Costs on the basis (*inter alia*) that the Tribunal took an approach to quantification of both that disregarded the proper law of the Treaty. For example, Dominion takes issue with the Tribunal's adoption of a \"sunk costs\" approach to damages.63 Annulment, if granted, could therefore lead to a new assessment of both damages and costs on a different methodology. But in the absence of a determination of which methodology to employ, and the actual application of such methodology, there is no basis upon which the Committee can assess the level of damages or costs that would actually be payable.\n\nSee *e.g.,* Application for Annulment, \u00b6 15.\n\n79.\n\nEqually, the Committee considers that obliging Panama to pay damages or costs that have been awarded on what is said by Dominion to be a false basis would not only be wrong but also impractical since, in the end, adjustments to such payments may need to be made. This, in the Committee's view, strongly militates in favour of the grant of a stay.\n\n80.\n\n*Second*, as emphasised by Panama, absent a stay of the Award, interest will continue to accrue during the pendency of these annulment proceedings (assuming that Panama does not make payment in the meantime). But, as already noted, Panama's reluctance to pay the Award pending the outcome of these proceedings is understandable since the Award is now subject to challenge.\n\n81.\n\nImportantly, this is a situation brought about by Dominion's decision to seek partial annulment. Given that it is Dominion, not Panama, that is seeking partial annulment of the Award, it is difficult to see why Dominion should profit from this by the accumulation of additional interest while the Parties await the outcome. Dominion, in the end, could thereby be placed in a much better position than if it had not sought annulment.\n\n82.\n\nIn the Committee's view, the fairer approach would be to stop interest accruing by imposing a stay as of the date Dominion commenced the annulment proceedings, and for as long as it takes to reach a final outcome in these proceedings.\n\n83.\n\n*Third*, unlike the usual case in which the party seeking to annul the award is the one also seeking a stay, there can be no issue here that the application to annul itself reflects an intention on the part of one side to avoid complying with the award.\n\n84.\n\nIt is true that the question whether Panama intends to comply with the Award has been put in issue in this case by Dominion, but the Committee does not consider this a determinative matter, given (i) Panama's clear statements as to its intention to comply; (ii) the absence of anything to show that the pendency of these annulment proceedings will somehow render compliance with the Award less likely; and (ii) the fact that any criticism that Panama has not paid to date is difficult in circumstances when Dominion is seeking to overturn both the Award on Damages and the Award on Costs.\n\n85.\n\n*Fourth*, there is then the question whether a stay should be granted on terms, such as the posting of security by Panama. Here again, the fact that it is Dominion, not Panama, that is seeking partial annulment, is significant.\n\n86.\n\nPanama has submitted that there is no provision in the ICSID Convention providing for security as a condition for the stay of enforcement of an arbitral award, and cites the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Azurix v. Argentina* in support of the argument that imposing a requirement to provide security in this context would interfere with the regime in the ICSID Convention for the recognition and enforcement of awards. As stated by the committee in *Azurix*, it \"*would effectively abrogate the scheme for security in Section 6 (particularly under Article 54 ['Recognition and Enforcement of the Award'] and substitute for those expressly qualified rights an entitlement to absolute security*.\"64 Several other *ad hoc* committees have arrived at a similar conclusion.65\n\n*Azurix. v. Argentina*, \u00b6 34.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, *Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award (February 21, 2020), \u00b6 69; *Carnegie v. Gambia*, \u00b6 51; *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Argentina's Request for Stay of Enforcement of the Award (May 31, 2012), \u00b6\u00b6 52-55.\n\n87.\n\nIt is true that the ICSID Convention does not contain an express power for the imposition of conditions on the grant of a stay. This is in contrast, for example, to Article VI of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition of Foreign Arbitral Awards. It is also true that there are some indications in the history of the ICSID Convention that no such security mechanism was envisaged.66\n\nSee History of the ICSID Convention, Vol II-2, p.890. As stated by Chairman Broches with respect to the stay of enforcement: \"*Article 56 [\"Recognition and Enforcement of the Award\" \u2013 what is now Article 53 of the ICSID Convention] would then establish exactly what was intended, which was that Contracting States and investors would be on the same footing, that a Contracting State would not become obliged in those cases to carry out the award pending the decision, nor would an investor.*\"\n\n88.\n\nBut equally, there is nothing in the text of the Convention that limits the undoubtedly broad discretion of *ad hoc* committees in this regard, and the vast majority of *ad hoc* committees who have addressed the issue have determined that this broad discretion encompasses the power to impose conditions, and that there are many situations in which some form of security or other undertaking is required to justify the indulgence of a stay.67\n\nIndeed the number of such decisions is too extensive to list here.\n\n89.\n\nFor present purposes, the Committee proceeds on the basis that it has the power to impose conditions. But the same concern that has driven some committees to hold that there is no such power is of particular significance here as a matter of discretion \u2013 namely, the fact that the imposition of security will place Dominion in a better position than if there had been no application for partial annulment of the Award.\n\n90.\n\nThis concern was articulated by the *ad hoc* committee in *CMS v. Argentina* as follows:\n\n*It is true the provision of a bank guarantee puts a claimant in a better position that it would be if annulment had not been sought, since it converts the undertaking of compliance under Article 53 of the Convention into a financial guarantee and avoids any issue of sovereign immunity from execution, which is expressly reserved by Article 55 of the Convention.*68\n\n*CMS v. Argentina*, \u00b6 39.\n\n91.\n\nThis was balanced, however, by the *ad hoc* committee in *CMS v. Argentina* in the following way:\n\n*On the other hand, a request for annulment causes significant delay to the claimant, with the consequent possibility of prejudice. Although this can be dealt with by an award of interest in the event that the annulment application fails,*\n\n*nonetheless there will have been a further delay in the award becoming enforceable and this is a factor entitled to some weight.*69\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n92.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, the concern about placing Dominion in a better position is all the more acute \u2013 because (as mentioned above) it is Dominion, not Panama, which is seeking partial annulment. The Committee considers it fundamentally unfair to give Dominion the advantage of security, by virtue of its own decision to challenge the Award.\n\n93.\n\nFurther, the countervailing considerations of delay and prejudice noted in *CMS v. Argentina* have no application here. Any such delay would be caused by Dominion, not Panama.\n\n***3. Decision on the Stay Request***\n-------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committee is of the view that it is entirely appropriate in the circumstances of this case to grant a stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n95.\n\nTo be clear, the Committee's decision to stay enforcement of the Award means that no interest will continue to accrue upon any sums owing to Dominion under the Award, from the date of the Application for Annulment (March 4, 2021) until this Committee reaches its final determination.\n\n**IV. PANAMA'S APPLICATION UNDER ARBITRATION RULE 41(5)**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n***1. Panama's Position***\n--------------------------\n\n*(a) Standard and Burden of Proof*\n----------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nPanama argues that claims that are \"*manifestly without legal merit*\" can be dismissed at an early stage of the proceeding under Arbitration Rule 41(5),70 and that for a claim to be considered without legal merit, this \"*must be established clearly and obviously, with relative ease and dispatch.*\"71 The preliminary objection \"*must relate to a legal impediment and not a factual one*.\"72 It is therefore \"*not necessary to prove facts.*\"73\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 16.\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 16, citing *RSM Production Corporation and others v.

Grenada*].\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b617.\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b617.\n\n97.\n\nQuestions of fact, however, may still be discussed, according to Panama, but \"*[t]he ultimate question is what balance to strike so that facts are sufficiently yet selectively discussed, not for their intrinsic truth, but to prove or disprove the legal claims which they support.*\"74\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b617, citing Aissatou Diop, Objection under Rule 41(5) of ICSID Arbitration Rules, p. 326.\n\n98.\n\nPanama further notes that *ad hoc* committees have concluded that Arbitration Rule 41(5) applies to annulment proceedings, citing *Elsamex v. Honduras*75 and *Venoklim v. Venezuela*.76 According to Panama's Rule 41(5) Request:\n\n*As the tribunal in Elsamex v Republic of Honduras admits, Rule 41(5) may serve the purpose of avoiding a misconceived request for annulation [sic], for instance, when the applicant invokes grounds for nullity that simpl[y] do not exist under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention or attempts to re-litigate the merits of the* 77 *matter\u2026*\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 18, *Elsamex, S.A. v Republic of Honduras* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/4), Decision on the preliminary objection of Elsamex S.A. against the Request for Annulment of the Award submitted by the Republic of Honduras (January 7, 2014), \u00b6\u00b6 124-125 [hereinafter: *Elsamex v. Honduras \u2013 Decision 41(5)*].\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 18, *Venoklim Holding B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/22), Decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) (March 8, 2016), \u00b6\u00b6 80-82 [hereinafter: *Venoklim v. Venezuela \u2013 Decision 41(5)*].\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 18, citing *Elsamex v. Honduras \u2013 Decision 41(5)*, \u00b6\u00b6 131.\n\n99.\n\nAs noted below, in its Response on Rule 41(5), Dominion argued that in the context of annulment proceedings, a more exacting test is to be applied under Rule 41(5), and that these two examples constitute the only available prongs.78 In its Reply on 41(5), Panama refutes this contention, and the suggestion that the Rule 41(5) test has only \"*two prongs*.\" Rather, it contends that the *Elsamex v. Honduras* decision stands for the following proposition:\n\n*\u2026that Rule 41(5) may serve the purpose of avoiding a misconceived request for annulation[sic], and provided,* as an example*, the fact that the applicant invokes grounds for nullity that simpl[y] do not exist under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention or attempts to re-litigate the merits of the matter. Likewise, the [c]ommittee provides other examples including when the annulment procedure is clearly used to file an appeal or, when it is manifestly without legal merit even if its factual elements were presumed as valid*.79\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6\u00b6 2, 9.\n\nPanama's Reply on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 2.\n\n100.\n\nIn light of the above, Panama concludes that the *Elsamex v. Honduras* committee \"*merely provided some examples*\"80 or gave \"*indications*\"81 as to when an application under Arbitration Rule 41(5) may succeed in the context of annulment proceedings.\n\nPanama's Reply on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 8.\n\nPanama's Reply on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 8.\n\n101.\n\nAccording to Panama, the application of Arbitration Rule 41(5) to annulment proceedings (and other post-award remedy proceedings) serves the purpose of allowing for the early dismissal of unmeritorious and frivolous claims on an expedited basis, and that:\n\n*Even if one accepts that a higher standard should be applied to an objection under Rule 41(5) than at the arbitration stage, quod non, such a standard cannot deprive the provision from its objective and purpose*.82\n\nPanama's Reply on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 7.\n\n*(b) Application*\n-----------------\n\n102.\n\nPanama argues that for an application for annulment to have legal merit, \"*it is not enough to plainly state existing grounds under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention*\"83 and that instead Dominion's Application for Annulment needs to be \"*coupled with the analysis of the alleged grounds for annulment, as argued by Claimant in its petition for partial annulment*.\"84\n\nPanama's Reply on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 8.\n\nPanama's Reply on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 8.\n\n103.\n\nAt the heart of Panama's several objections is the assertion that once each of Dominion's grounds for annulment are so analysed, they constitute no more than an attempted review of the merits of the Award. Panama notes that annulment \"*is not an appeal*\"85 nor \"*a procedure aimed to interpret or revise arbitral awards.*\"86 Therefore, committees are \"*not empowered to amend or replace such awards, nor to review the merits of the dispute.

Rather, the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that Dominion \"*\u2026 ha[d] not provided evidence of the specific losses that each of the[] events caused*\", and that on the evidence, the \"*sunk-costs*\" approach offered the best valuation method.94\n\nPanama\u00b4s Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\n110.\n\nAccordingly, Panama contends that the complaint that \"*the Majority manifestly exceeded its powers by disregarding the proper law of the Treaty,*\" is \"*nothing more than a disagreement*\" with the Majority's analysis and with the amount awarded.95\n\nPanama\u00b4s Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 30;

(ii) the tribunal must have departed from it; and (iii) the departure must be serious, *i.e.,* producing a material impact on the award.100\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 37.\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 36 and \u00b6\u00b6 38 - 39.\n\n114.\n\nPanama refutes the argument that the Majority denied Dominion its right to be heard on damages due for breach of Article II and the presentation of evidence on the value of the concession.\n\n115.\n\nPanama contends that Dominion had numerous opportunities to present evidence on the value of the concession.101 *First*, Dominion filed a Memorial on Merits and Quantum, together with the Valuation Report and Damages Assessment of Broadlands Mineral Advisory Services Ltd and the Expert Opinion on Value of Behre Dolbear. *Second*, Dominion filed a Reply on the Merits and Quantum, accompanied by a second Valuation Report and Damages Assessment of Broadlands Mineral Advisory Services and a second Expert Opinion on value of Behre Dolbear. *Third*, the Parties submitted post-hearing briefs addressing questions posed by the Tribunal. *Fourth*, a hearing on closing arguments was held, as agreed by the Parties.\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 \u00b6 41 \u2013 42.\n\n116.\n\nFurther, the Parties filed submissions on costs, and were able to file their comments on the other party's submissions on costs.102\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 42.\n\n117.\n\nMoreover, Panama contends that the Tribunal \"*carefully reviewed the evidence presented by both Parties and the experts and has concluded that a sunk-costs approach offers the best valuation of the property as of the date of expropriation and absent the breaches to the FET standard.*\" The Tribunal also noted the significant factors that lead it to decide that the other approaches - income, rule of thumb, or comparable transactions - were unsuitable.103\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 40, citing the Award, \u00b6 632.\n\n118.\n\nFinally, Panama notes that Dominion did not complain about a serious breach of a procedural rule throughout the proceeding.104\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 43.\n\n(3) Dominion's Application under Convention Article 52(1)(e)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nPanama argues that Dominion's Application under Convention Article 52(1)(e) (*i.e.* that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based) is manifestly without merit.105\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, Section IV-C.\n\n120.\n\n*First*, Panama asserts that the failure to state the reasons on which the award is based is \"*strictly related to the requirement expressed in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, namely, that the award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.*\" However, Panama alleges that while a Tribunal must deal with every question submitted to it, a failure to do so does not automatically result in annulment. According to Panama, \"*the threshold to annul an award under this ground is high and should only take place when the point lacking reasoning is 'crucial or decisive', 'necessary for the Tribunal's decision', or 'essential for the outcome of the case.*'\"106\n\nPanama's Reply on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 13.\n\n121.\n\n*Second*, the Tribunal did provide reasons in its Award. It granted the sunk costs up to the amounts supported in the General Ledgers and *\"[a]ll the concepts and the calculation of the amounts awarded by the Tribunal are included in Appendix I of the Award*.\"107\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 29.\n\n122.\n\n*Third*, Panama refutes Dominion's contention that the Majority's reasoning on damages is \"*incoherent, contradictory and indeed inexplicable*\" by noting that the Award cannot be annulled on these grounds - only unreasoned awards can be annulled. As such, \"*an examination of the reasons presented by a Tribunal cannot be transformed into a re-examination of the correctness of the factual and legal premises on which the award is based.*\"108\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 49.\n\n123.\n\n*Fourth*, the Applicant's allegations are \"*not only flawed but also part of a false premise*\"109 because the Tribunal considered all of the relevant evidence when assessing the damages and costs and \"*clearly express[ed] the reasons*\"110 of its decision in the Award.\n\nPanama's Reply on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 12.\n\nPanama's Reply on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 12.\n\n124.\n\nAccordingly, Panama requests that the Committee:\n\n***Issue*** *a decision dismissing with prejudice all of Claimant's claims under the Treaty on the basis of Rule 41(5)*111\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 82.\n\n***2. Dominion's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n*(a) Standard and Burden of Proof*\n----------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nIt is Dominion's case that Arbitration Rule 41(5) sets up a \"*two-part test*\" pursuant to which an applicant must prove that the claim is (i) \"*manifestly*\" and (ii) \"*without legal merit*.\"112\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 4.\n\n126.\n\nAs to the first element, the ordinary meaning of \"*manifestly*\" requires the applicant to establish its objection \"*clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch*.\"113 In other words, Dominion contends that the applicant must show that its objection \"*is obvious from the face of the initial pleadings, taking the facts as given, and that no further investigation is needed to establish that the claim is invalid*.\"114\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 5.\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 5.\n\n127.\n\nRegarding the second element, \"*without legal merit*,\" Dominion asserts that the objecting party must demonstrate that the grounds for dismissal are legal, \"*without any need to consider the underlying facts and circumstances*\" because the Committee is not in a position to adjudicate disputed facts in a summary procedure.115\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 7.\n\n128.\n\nIn light of the above, Dominion emphasises that Arbitration Rule 41(5) therefore sets a \"*high bar on dismissal*\" and that the burden borne by Panama as the objecting party \"*is a heavy one.*\"116\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 6.\n\n129.\n\nFurthermore, Dominion argues that the test under Arbitration Rule 41(5) is more rigorous when applied at the annulment rather than at the arbitration stage because of the \"*summary nature of this type of objection and the severe consequences that a summary dismissal would carry with it*.\"117 As such, committees like *Elsamex v. Honduras* and *Venoklim v. Venezuela* have held that Arbitration Rule 41(5) sets \"*an extremely high bar*\" in an annulment proceeding.118\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6\u00b6 2 and 8.\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 2.\n\n130.\n\nIn *Elsamex v. Honduras*, the committee ruled that a Rule 41(5) objection could only succeed in two circumstances: namely, where the applicant \"*invokes an annulment ground which simply [does] not exist under Article 52 of the [ICSID] Convention*\" or is \"*seeking to re-litigate the merits of the case.*\"119\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 9.\n\n131.\n\nLikewise, in *Venoklim v. Venezuela*, the committee endorsed *Elsamex v. Honduras* and held that the test for granting a Rule 41(5) objection is stricter in an annulment context because of the lack of remedies against annulment decisions.120\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 10.\n\n132.\n\nDominion argues that *Elsamex v. Honduras* and *Venoklim v. Venezuela* remain the authoritative cases on the test for dismissal of an annulment application under Arbitration Rule 41(5), and that in ICSID's history, Rule 41(5) has only been invoked and ruled upon in three annulment proceedings to date. In each of these cases, the Rule 41(5) objection was rejected by the committee.121\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 9.\n\n*(b) Application*\n-----------------\n\n133.\n\nApplying the *Elsamex v. Honduras* test, Dominion argues that Panama has not shown that the Application for Annulment (i) invokes any ground for annulment that does not exist under Article 52 of the Convention, or (ii) \"*amounts to nothing more than a simple disagreement with the reasoning contained in the Award*.\"122\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 13.\n\n134.\n\n*First*, Dominion has identified three grounds for annulment which exist under Convention Article 52:123 (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b); (ii) there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d); and (iii) the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based under Article 52(1)(e). Dominion asserts that Panama \"*does not seek to make out any case that the three grounds for annulment \u2026 do not exist under Article 52*\"124 and hence, \"*accepts that it is not seeking dismissal of Dominion's Application for Annulment under the first prong*\"125 of the *Elsamex v. Honduras* test.\n\nSee Application for Annulment, \u00b610. Dominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Dominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 10.\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b612 citing the following sections of Panama's brief: Section IV(A) (\"*The Tribunal has not manifestly exceeded its powers*\"; Section IV(B) (\"*The Tribunal has not departed from a fundamental rule of procedure*\"); Section IV(C) (\"*The Tribunal has not failed to state the reasons on which the award was based*\").\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 12.\n\n135.\n\n*Second*, Dominion confirms that it is not seeking to appeal or \"*relitigate the merits of the case.*\"126 Instead, it has identified \"*several serious problems with the majority's decision that meet the standard for annulment under Article 52 of the Convention*.\"127\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 13.\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 13.\n\n(1) Dominion's Application Under Convention Article 52(1)(b)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nDominion argues that the Majority exceeded its powers under Convention Article 52(1)(b) when it failed to apply the proper law in its (i) Award on Damages and (ii) Award on Costs.128\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 16 and 19; Dominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 23.\n\n137.\n\nAs to the Award on Damages, the Majority disregarded the Treaty's full compensation standard which required the Tribunal to assess the fair market value of Dominion's investment prior to Panama's breaches129 In particular, Dominion contends that the Majority's sunk costs approach \"*disregarded the damage caused by Panama's breaches of Article II of the Treaty in 2008 and 2010 and instead focused solely on Panama's unlawful expropriation of Dominion's investment in 2012*.\"130 In this regard, Dominion clarifies that it is not seeking to appeal the Majority's choice of a sunk cost's approach.131\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 26.\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 16.\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 17.\n\n138.\n\nAs to costs, the Majority disregarded the proper law because it \"*refused to reimburse the Claimant for the costs of the third-party funding it was forced to incur as a result of Panama's breaches*.\"132\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6\u00b6 37 and 38.\n\n(2) Dominion's Application under Convention Article 52(1)(d)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nDominion contends that the Majority departed from a fundamental rule of procedure under Convention Article 52(1)(d) when it was denied the right to be heard and to present evidence on the damages arising from Panama's breaches of Article II of the Treaty. Moreover, this denial was \"*particularly serious*\"133 given the evidence the Tribunal already had before it.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 14.\n\n140.\n\nDominion states that it \"*pleaded its damages on the basis that Panama's measures constituted both a breach of Article II and a breach of Article IV*.\"134 Therefore, once the Majority found a breach of Article II but not Article IV, it should have invited the Parties to submit their respective positions on the damages caused by those breaches. Yet the Majority did not do so.135\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 13.\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 22.\n\n141.\n\nAlso, Dominion refutes Panama's argument that the Majority \"*did evaluate the relevance of the Lebovits [t]ransaction but considered that the calculation presented could not serve as a basis for assessing the FMV of the investment at hand.*\"136 According to Dominion, this argument \"*misses the point*\" because the Majority \"*only considered the Lebovits transaction in the context of Dominion's claim for damages based upon Panama's expropriation of its investment in March of 2012, and not any claim for damages based solely upon Panama's breaches of Article II.*\"137\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 15.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 15.\n\n142.\n\nFinally, Dominion rebuts the contention that this ground for annulment is without legal merit by stating that \"*Panama's argument must be judged against the strict standard under Rule 41(5) which requires the Committee to accept Dominion's allegations and assess whether those allegations provide a* prima facie *basis to annul*.\"138 According to Dominion, its Application under Article 52(1)(d) \"*clearly satisfies this standard.*\"139\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 11.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 11.\n\n(3) Dominion's Application under Convention Article 52(1)(e)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nDominion argues that the Majority failed to state reasons on which the Award was based under Convention Article 52(1)(e).\n\n144.\n\nThe Majority's reasoning on damages is \"*self-contradictory and impossible to follow in numerous respects*.\"140 According to Dominion, \"*[t]o say that a reader cannot follow the Award is an understatement.*\"141\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 18.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 18.\n\n145.\n\nFurthermore, a \"*core problem*\"142 with the Majority's reasoning is that it only assessed damages for Panama's 2012 Article IV breach but not the earlier Article II breach in 2008 and 2010. Therefore, the valuation \"*did not reflect everything that had happened in between which created uncertainty and lowered the project value.*\"143\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 18.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 18.\n\n146.\n\nAccordingly, Dominion requests that the Committee \"*deny in full*\" Panama's Rule 41(5) Request.144\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 31(a).\n\n**B. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n***1. The Standard and Burden of Proof***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nArbitration Rule 41(5) provides as follows:\n\n*Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.*\n\n148.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that, in its general application in ICSID arbitrations as distinct from annulment proceedings, this rule - and in particular the expression \"*manifestly without legal merit*\" - imposes a very high threshold, and places a heavy burden on the applicant.\n\n149.\n\n*\"Manifest\":* As noted by Dominion, the legal deficiency that is relied upon for the application under this Rule must be \"*manifest.*\" As stated in *Trans-Global v. Jordan* (the first arbitration that applied Rule 41(5)):\n\n*\u2026 the ordinary meaning of the word requires the respondent to establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch. The standard is thus set high.*145\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No ARB/07/25), The Tribunal's Decision on the Respondent's Objection Under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (May 12, 2008), \u00b6 88 [hereinafter: *Trans-Global v. Jordan*]. See also *RSM v. Grenada*, \u00b6 6.1.1.\n\n150.\n\nThis has been emphasized consistently by subsequent tribunals, both on the basis of (i) the word \"*manifest*\" and (ii) the severity of the consequences of a successful Rule 41(5) application for the claimant. The standard has been described as \"*very demanding and rigorous*\", reserved for claims that are \"*clearly and unequivocally unmeritorious.*\"146 Hence the tribunal in *Lotus Holding v. Turkmenistan* held that an application cannot succeed if the claimant's case is \"*arguable*\":\n\n*The consequence of a summary dismissal under Rule 41(5) is that the claim set out in the request for arbitration proceeds no further. The tribunal rules, in effect, that there is no point in proceeding with the claim because it cannot succeed: no matter what evidence is adduced, there is a fundamental flaw in the way that the claim is formulated that must inevitably lead to its dismissal. The inevitability of dismissal must be manifest. It must be obvious from the submissions of the parties that there is some unavoidable and indisputable fact, or some legal objection in relation to which no possible counter-argument is identified. If the claimant, in its submissions under Rule 41(5), can point to an arguable case, the claim should proceed: but if the tribunal is satisfied than no such arguable case has been identified, it is in accordance with the sound administration of justice that the claim should be halted and dismissed at that point.*147\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v. Independent State of Papua New Guinea* (ICSID Case No ARB/13/33), The Tribunal's Decision on the Respondent's Objection Under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (October 28, 2014), \u00b6 88.\n\n*Lotus Holding Anonim \u015eirketi v. Turkmenistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/30), Award (April 6, 2020), \u00b6 158.\n\n151.\n\nIt follows that this Rule is intended to dispose of \"*cases that are 'evident', 'clear' or 'obvious', not those which entail a greater degree of difficulty or which require a more thorough and extensive analysis of the legal and factual issues to dispose of the claim.*\"148\n\n*Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2), Decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objection under Article 45(6) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules (December 12, 2016), \u00b6 66.\n\n152.\n\n*\"Without Legal Merit\":* Further, the deficiency must not only be \"*manifest*\", but also a legal, not factual, impediment. This follows from the words of the provision, as well as the severely truncated procedural framework within which applications under Arbitration Rule 41(5) are to be determined. A tribunal at this early stage, without the benefit of a full presentation by all parties, cannot resolve contentious factual issues. It follows that for the purposes of a Rule 41(5) application, the respondent to the application need not prove facts. Instead, as Panama has itself accepted here, a claim is to be treated as without legal merit \"*[when the facts alleged], even if proven, are not capable of supporting a claim [...]*\".149\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b617, citing *Brandes Investment Partners, LP v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/3), Decision on the Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (February 2, 2009), \u00b6 70.\n\n153.\n\nIt is correct, as noted by the tribunal in *Trans-Global v. Jordan* that: \"*it is rarely possible to assess the legal merits of any claim without also examining the factual premise upon which that claim is advanced.*\"150 Thus, there may be occasions on a Rule 41(5) application in which a tribunal might have to explore the essential factual premises of a claim. But the Committee considers that this could only be a high-level enquiry, to establish whether the essential factual assertions could conceivably be susceptible of proof at all.\n\n*Trans-Global v. Jordan*, \u00b6 97.\n\n154.\n\n*Applicability in Annulment Proceedings:* It is common ground between the Parties that Arbitration Rule 41(5) applies in annulment proceedings. This follows from Arbitration Rule 53, which provides:\n\n*The provisions of these Rules shall apply mutatis mutandis to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award and to the decision of the Tribunal or Committee.*\n\n155.\n\nThis has been confirmed in previous annulment decisions, notably *Elsamex v. Honduras*151 and *Venoklim v. Venezuela*.152\n\n*Elsamex v. Honduras \u2013 Decision 41(5)*.\n\n*Venoklim v. Venezuela \u2013 Decision 41(5)*.\n\n156.\n\nBut there is then the question whether the demanding threshold in Arbitration Rule 41(5) is elevated still further when it is applied in the context of annulment proceedings.\n\n157.\n\nAs noted by Dominion,153 the two previous *ad hoc* committees that have applied Arbitration Rule 41(5) have done so applying even more rigour, or a stricter review. This has been for three reasons, namely: (i) that the ICSID Rules do not require petitioners to set out their case on annulment in any detail, and that it is expected that the parties will have a later opportunity to submit written arguments in support of their request after the *ad hoc* committee has been constituted; (ii) that, unlike the original award (including a ruling under Rule 41(5) by the tribunal), a summary dismissal of an annulment petition is final and not subject to any recourse under the ICSID rules and procedures; and (iii) the words \"*mutatis mutandis*\" in Arbitration Rule 53.154\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6\u00b6 2-9.\n\n*Elsamex v. Honduras \u2013 Decision 41(5)*, \u00b6\u00b6 120-125; *Venoklim v.* Venezuela- *Decision 41(5)*, \u00b6\u00b6 74 - 81.\n\n158.\n\nThe Committee considers this a justified approach. The nature of the test itself remains the same (*i.e.* \"*manifestly without legal merit*\"), but its application at the annulment stage requires even more care and scrutiny, or as put in earlier decisions a \"*higher standard of conviction*\", for these three reasons.\n\n159.\n\nThe Committee does not agree, however, with Dominion's assertion155 that when applied in annulment proceedings, Arbitration Rule 41(5) can only succeed in two circumstances, *i.e.* (i) where the applicant invokes an annulment ground which does not exist under Article 52 of the Convention, or (ii) where the applicant is in reality seeking simply to re-litigate the merits of the arbitration. There is nothing in the wording of either Arbitration Rule 41(5) or Arbitration Rule 53 to justify this limitation, or to reduce the scope of the test to these two specific \"*prongs.*\" Arbitration Rule 53 does use the expression \"*mutatis mutandis*\", but this is a general instruction which provides no identification of such specific restrictions. Further, the Committee reads the articulation of these grounds in *Elsamex* as by way of illustration only. The Committee considers that there will be other examples of legal impediments to an application for annulment that do not concern a non-existent ground, or an attempt to appeal. To this end, no further gloss or limitation on the test \"*manifestly without legal merit*\" is warranted.\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12-13.\n\n***2. Whether Dominion's Application under Convention Article 52(1)(d) Is Manifestly Without Legal Merit***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nFor Panama to succeed in its Application under Rule 41(5) with regard to Dominion's application for partial annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(d), Panama must show that even if the facts as alleged by Dominion are proven, Dominion's challenge is simply not viable as a matter of law.\n\n161.\n\nThere is no dispute that the ground for partial annulment invoked by Dominion exists. A denial of the right to be heard can constitute a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure for the purposes of Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention.156 By way of one example, in *Victor Pey Casado v Chile*, Chile sought annulment on the ground that the tribunal had failed to afford it an opportunity to be heard on the calculation of damages, the discussion of damages having only been in the context of an unsuccessful claim for expropriation. The *ad hoc* committee ruled that:\n\n*[The tribunal] should have allowed each party the right to present its arguments and to contradict those of the other party. Having reviewed the entire record, including the parties' submissions, the Committee can only conclude that the parties never pleaded the damages claims arising from the breaches of Article 4 of the BIT. [\u2026].*\n\n*In the Committee's view, these post-hearing exchanges [relating to the expropriation claim] do not constitute a fair opportunity to discuss the remedy for breach of Article 4 of the BIT [on denial of justice]. Even though the Tribunal did use objective elements for the valuation of damages (the data provided and discussed by the parties), at no time did it refer to arguments pleaded by either party. As explained in their Counter-Memorial on Annulment, the Claimants, at the January 2007 Hearing, argued that the compensation due was equivalent to the one resulting from the confiscation as Chile's breach of the BIT had the consequence of preventing the Claimants from obtaining compensation for the confiscation. The Tribunal, however, adopted another standard.*157\n\nSee *e.g.* the numerous cases collated in the ICSID Secretariat Report - *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID* (ICSID 2016).\n\n*Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No ARB/98/2), Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Chile (December 18, 2012), \u00b6\u00b6 262, 266.\n\n162.\n\nThe question, then, is whether it would be impossible as a matter of law for Dominion to make a case that, in this arbitration, the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by denying Dominion a right to be heard and to present evidence on the damages arising from Panama's breaches of Article II of the Treaty.\n\n163.\n\nTo recall (as summarised earlier), Dominion argues that it pleaded its case on the basis that Panama acted in breach of both Articles II and IV of the BIT, but did not explicitly plead its damages claim solely upon a breach of Article II.158 The Majority found that ANAM and MICI's actions in 2008 and 2010 constituted a breach of Article II but not Article IV, and Dominion maintains that the Tribunal should then have invited the Parties to submit their respective positions on the damages caused thereby.159 Hence, for example, Dominion argues that the Tribunal only considered the Lebovits transaction in the context of a claim under Article IV (expropriation) in March of 2012, but not Article II (despite the fact that this transaction is said to have occurred immediately before the relevant breaches of Article II).160\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 13.\n\nDominion's Response on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 22; Dominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 13.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6\u00b6 14 and 15.\n\n164.\n\nStated thus, and without expressing any view for now on the strength of Dominion's case, this is not an argument that is impossible as a matter of law. Equally, the Committee does not consider this a case in which the essential factual premises of Dominion's claim would be simply impossible to prove in any event.\n\n165.\n\nIf it can be shown that the Tribunal did in fact deprive Dominion of a right to be heard on the proper methodology for assessing damages, or deprived it of an opportunity of adducing evidence or other supporting materials, this could conceivably amount to a serious departure by the Tribunal from a fundamental rule of procedure. Whether or not this can be shown depends on a number of purely factual matters which the Committee cannot determine at this early stage.\n\n166.\n\nFor example, Panama's assertion that Dominion had numerous opportunities to put its case, and also to raise objections, depends upon the Committee considering each such opportunity as a matter of fact, together with the reasons advanced by Dominion as to why none could have cured the issue.\n\n167.\n\nIt follows that Panama's objections are not of a nature that can be resolved under the Arbitration Rule 41(5) mechanism. Rather, the Committee must consider the full factual position, which in turn requires that Dominion be afforded a proper opportunity to present that position.\n\n***3. Whether Dominion's Application under Convention Article 52(1)(e) Is Manifestly Without Legal Merit***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nSimilarly, for Panama to succeed in its Application under Rule 41(5) with regard to Dominion's application for partial annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(e), Panama must show that even if the facts as alleged by Dominion are proven, Dominion's challenge is simply not viable as a matter of law.\n\n169.\n\nWhilst Panama has emphasised that the threshold to annul an award under this ground is high, and that it \"\u2026*should only take place when the point lacking reasoning is 'crucial or decisive', 'necessary for the Tribunal's decision', or 'essential for the outcome of the case*'\",161 there is no dispute that if such can be shown, this would be a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention. Further, it is not contested that inconsistent or contradictory reasons may qualify under this ground.162\n\nPanama's Reply on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 13.\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 47.\n\n170.\n\nPanama's key complaint (as detailed earlier) is that in advancing this ground, Dominion is merely disagreeing with the Majority's reasoning, and seeking a re-examination of the correctness of the factual and legal premises on which the Award is founded.163\n\nPanama's Rule 41(5) Request, Section IV-C.\n\n171.\n\nBut whether or not this is so must depend upon a detailed analysis of each of the instances where Dominion submits the Tribunal's reasoning is self-contradictory and impossible to follow. To date, Dominion has identified a number of such instances, mostly arising from the fact that the Tribunal only assessed damages for Panama's 2012 expropriation under Article IV of the BIT, and not the earlier breaches in 2008 and 2010 of Article II of the BIT. For example, Dominion asserts that:\n\n*\u2022 The majority endorsed Panama's view that one should assess the fair market value of the investment at the last \"clean\" date preceding Panama's breaches of the Treaty.*164 *The Tribunal found that Panama first breached the treaty on 14 August 2008. The last \"clean\" date preceding Panama's breaches of the Treaty would thus have been just before this date. The Lebovits transaction took place on 10 July 2008. Thus, the Tribunal had a fair market value on that date which was \"clean\". Yet, the Tribunal rejected that valuation because it did not reflect the information in the Updated NI 43-101 Report which was published in September 2008. The NI 43-101 Report is thus after the date of Panama's first breach of the Treaty on 14 August 2008, and thus how it could be relevant to the valuation of the preceding clean date is anyone's guess.*\n\n*\u2022 The majority found that damages needed to reflect the \"uncertainties\" that the project faced which would need to be taken into account in order to determine the fair market value of Dominion's investment.*165 *Yet the Lebovits transaction was inclusive of all the uncertainties at the time it was made. Even worse, the majority found that the 2008 and 2010 Article II violations created \"uncertainty\" for the future operations of the investment, yet it failed to award any damage related to these acts and only awarded damages on the Article IV violation in 2012 which reflected the lower value caused by the prior breaches.*166\n\n*\u2022 The majority stated that it could not use the Lebovits transaction as it did not take into account the uncertainty created by the Panama Supreme Court's Provisional Suspension Order of 24 December 2009.*167 *Yet the Lebovits transaction predated the Panama Supreme Court's Provisional Suspension Order by eighteen months. Moreover, the Article II violation by ANAM had already caused the cessation of all work on the concession area as of 14 August 2008. Thus, any alleged uncertainty created by the Court's Order already existed as a result of Panama's prior breach through the actions of ANAM.*\n\nCiting the Award, \u00b6 686.\n\nCiting the Award, \u00b6\u00b6 633, 635, 643, 657, 671.\n\nCiting the Award, \u00b6 629.\n\nCiting the Award, \u00b6 687.\n\n172.\n\nEach of these assertions requires the Committee to determine exactly what was put before the Tribunal in terms of evidence and submissions (including, e.g., the precise nature and significance of the Lebovits transaction), and to assess the Tribunal's reasoning in light of all the factual circumstances of the arbitration proceedings. These are not matters that the Committee can resolve in the truncated process of a Rule 41(5) application.\n\n173.\n\nAgain without expressing any view for now on the strength of Dominion's case, if every fact asserted by Dominion were to be established, it cannot be said at this early stage that it would be impossible as a matter of law to establish a basis for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention. Equally, the Committee does not consider this a case in which the essential factual premises of Dominion's claim could simply not be proven in any event.\n\n174.\n\nPanama's assertions (as set out earlier) that the Tribunal did provide the reasons for the Award, and that Dominion is simply now seeking an appeal does not address the detail of the alleged inconsistencies.\n\n175.\n\nIt follows that in order to assess this ground for annulment, the Committee must consider the full factual position, which in turn requires that Dominion be afforded a proper opportunity to present that position.\n\n***4. Whether Dominion's Application under Convention Article 52(1)(b) Is Manifestly Without Legal Merit***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nOnce again, for Panama to succeed in its Rule 41(5) Request with regard to Dominion's Application for Annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(b), Panama must show that even if the facts as alleged by Dominion are proven, Dominion's challenge is simply not viable as a matter of law.\n\n177.\n\nAs set out earlier, Dominion's core complaint under this ground is that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law (public international law).\n\n178.\n\nA failure to apply the proper law is capable of amounting to an excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. For example, in *MINE v. Guinea*, the *ad hoc* committee sated as follows:\n\n*The Committee is of the view that the provision [of Article 42(1) of the Convention] is significant in two ways. It grants the parties to the dispute unlimited freedom to agree on the rules of law applicable to the substance of their dispute and requires the tribunal to respect the parties' autonomy and to apply those rules. From another perspective, the parties' agreement on applicable law forms part of their arbitration agreement. Thus, a tribunal's disregard of the agreed rules of law would constitute a derogation from the terms of reference within which the tribunal has been authorized to function. \u2026 If the derogation is manifest, it entails a manifest excess of power.*168\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Decision on Annulment (December 14, 1989), \u00b6 5.03. This does not appear to be contested by Panama \u2013 see: Panama's Rule 41(5) Request, \u00b6 25.\n\n179.\n\nDominion has set out in its Application for Annulment and in its responses to Panama's Rule 41(5) Request why it says the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law by disregarding what it says was the BIT's requirement for full compensation, which it says required the Tribunal (i) to assess the fair market value of its investment prior to Panama's breaches; and (ii) to accord full compensation for Dominion's third-party funding costs.\n\n180.\n\n*Award on Damages:* As to (i), Dominion notes that it had put forward a claim for damages calculated by reference to the net cash flows which it said the project would have generated had it been allowed to go forward, and based upon an income approach using the \"DCF\" method, or, alternatively, by reference to the fair market value (\"**FMV**\") of the investment, derived using a market approach premised on other comparable projects.169 Panama, on the other hand, had pleaded that Dominion's damages should be calculated by reference to the acquisition price of prior equity transactions involving Dominion, including a transaction with Bellhaven Copper & Gold Inc. in 2009 and a transaction Resource Capital Funds in 2010.170\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 27.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 27.\n\n181.\n\nDominion contends that in its Post-Hearing Memorial, it submitted that if the Tribunal were to follow Panama's methodology, it would need to consider the investment made by the Lebovits Group which was concluded on July 10, 2008, shortly before Panama's first breach of Article II on August 14, 2008 (when ANAM ordered the cessation of all work on the concession site pending Dominion's submission of an Environmental Impact Assessment). Dominion notes that it submitted at Annex A to its Post-Hearing Memorial a calculation which took the details of the Lebovits Group's transaction, and derived a FMV of Dominion's investment using the same valuation methodology as advanced by Panama.171\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 29.\n\n182.\n\nDominion complains that the Tribunal did not engage with this submission. In particular, the Tribunal acknowledged the validity of the valuation method proposed by Panama, but disregarded Dominion's calculation, despite the fact that Dominion had deployed the same method, and deployed what it says was undisputed evidence in the record.172 This was to disregard the applicable law of damages under the BIT by disregarding the minimum damages that could be awarded based upon the host State's own FMV methodology.173\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 29.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 34.\n\n183.\n\nDominion has detailed a number of points in this regard which it says amount to an overall manifest excess of powers, including (i) the majority's failure to assess the valuation of the project immediately prior to August 14, 2008, being the date on which Panama committed its first breach of the BIT, and its reliance on the Updated NI-43 101 Report which was only published a month after the breach, on September 23, 2008;174 (ii) the Majority's disregard of Annex A as a \"*mathematical exercise*\", as well as undisputed evidence that the market for minerals had increased in the period between Panama's breaches of Article II in 2008 and 2010 and its final breach of Article IV in 2012;175 and (iii) the Majority's disregard of the valuation based on the Lebovits transaction on the alleged basis that it did not reflect the Provisional Suspension Order of the Supreme Court, when that Order was issued on December 24, 2009, which was eighteen months after Panama's breach of Article II of the BIT.176\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 30.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 31.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 32.\n\n184.\n\n*Award on Costs:* As to (ii), Dominion argues that by disregarding Dominion's third-party funding costs, the Majority failed to apply the applicable legal principle of full reparation as set out in the *Chorzow Factory* case, by which compensation must \"*as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probably, have existed if that act had not been committed*.\"177 Dominion relies in particular on the alleged facts that (i) its requirement for third-party funding was the direct result of Panama's breaches which deprived Dominion of its sole asset; (ii) this alleged fact was never disputed by Panama, which expressly told the Tribunal that it was fully aware of the third-party funding costs that Dominion was being forced to incur due to the financial position in which Dominion found itself following the loss of the project (*e.g*. in Panama's Application for Security for Costs filed on November 27, 2017); and (iii) the Tribunal disregarded this evidence and held that Panama had not been informed of Dominion's third-party funding costs until the end of the arbitration.178 Overall, so Dominion contends, the Tribunal proceeded in a manner that disregarded the applicable standard for reparation or compensation.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6 36.\n\nDominion's Rejoinder on Rule 41(5), \u00b6\u00b6 36-38.\n\n185.\n\nAs detailed earlier, Panama emphasises (*inter alia*) that the annulment process is not an appeal, and that Dominion's case on the Award on Damages is simply a substantive disagreement with the Tribunal's application of an uncontested standard, rather than a failure to apply that standard itself. Similarly, again as detailed earlier, Panama contends that Dominion's case with respect to the Award on Costs is no more than a challenge to the Tribunal's undoubted and broad discretion on this issue.\n\n186.\n\nBut Dominion's cases on both the Award on Damages and the Award on Costs, as briefly outlined above, raises factual assertions that require a detailed investigation by the Committee. Once again without expressing any view for now on the strength of Dominion's case on either issue, if every fact asserted by Dominion were to be established, it cannot be said at this early stage that it would be impossible as a matter of law to conclude that the Tribunal disregarded the applicable standard for reparation or compensation (as opposed to incorrectly applying the correct standard), or to establish a basis for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention.\n\n187.\n\nEqually, the Committee does not consider this a case in which the essential factual premises of Dominion's claims could simply not be proven in any event.\n\n188.\n\nIt follows, once again, that in order to assess this ground for annulment, the Committee must consider the full factual position, which in turn requires that Dominion be afforded a proper opportunity to present that position.\n\n189.\n\nOverall, the Committee does not consider that the type of objections raised by Panama in this preliminary application, albeit objections that are appropriate in response to an annulment application, are within the scope of what was contemplated by Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n190.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee considers that Panama's Rule 41(5) Request must be dismissed.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n191.\n\nPanama has requested that the Committee:\n\n*Award Panama all of its costs and expenses associated with this phase of the proceeding.*179\n\nPanama's Stay Request, \u00b6 82.\n\n192.\n\nDominion has sought an order:\n\n*that Dominion be awarded the costs, fees and expenses of this application, inclusive of attorneys' fees;*180\n\nDominion's Response on Stay, Section IV.\n\n193.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that costs arising out of Panama's Stay Request and Panama's Rule 41(5) Request should be reserved for a subsequent stage of the proceedings.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n194.\n\nFor the reasons set out herein, the Committee decides that:\n\n(i) Panama's application to stay the enforcement of the Award is granted.\n\n(ii) Panama's application under Arbitration Rule 41(5) is dismissed.\n\n(iii) The costs arising out of Panama's application to stay the enforcement of the Award and Panama's application under Arbitration Rule 41(5) are reserved for a subsequent stage of the proceedings."}]}
