INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute arises out of the alleged investments of Mr. Georg Gavrilovi\u0107, a national of Austria, and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., a company organized under the laws of Croatia (together, the \"Claimants\"), in the Republic of Croatia (the \"Respondent\" or \"Croatia\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants commenced this arbitration under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Croatia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on November 1, 1999 (the \"BIT\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n3.\n\nOn October 31, 2014, pursuant to paragraph 15.1.3 of Procedural Order No 1 of August 21, 2013 (as amended on November 16, 2013 and February 19, 2014) (\"Procedural Order No 1\"), the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Preliminary Objections (the \"Counter-Memorial\") and a Submission in Support of Bifurcation of the Proceedings (the \"Request\").\n\n4.\n\nOn December 1, 2014, pursuant to paragraph 15.1.4 of Procedural Order No 1, the Claimants submitted their Observations on the Respondent\u2019s Bifurcation Request (the \"Observations\").\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated December 4, 2014, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal allow a second round of written submissions on the issue of bifurcation.\n\n6.\n\nThat same day, the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s request, setting forth a schedule for further submissions. The Tribunal also invited each party to propose a schedule for each of a bifurcated proceeding and a non-bifurcated proceeding.\n\n7.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s schedule, the Respondent filed its Reply on Bifurcation (the \"Reply\").\n\n8.\n\nOn 19 December 2014, the Claimants requested a three-day extension of time to file their rejoinder submission. The Tribunal granted this request.\n\n9.\n\nOn December 22, 2014, the Claimants subsequently submitted their Rejoinder on Bifurcation (the \"Rejoinder\").\n\n10.\n\nOn December 31, 2014, each party filed its proposed schedule for each of a bifurcated proceeding and a non-bifurcated proceeding.\n\n11.\n\nFollowing receipt of the parties\u2019 written submissions, the Tribunal considered the respective submissions of the parties, and deliberated.\n\n12.\n\nFor the reasons set out in Section IV below, the Tribunal has decided to refuse the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation of the proceedings into a jurisdictional phase and a merits phase.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Submissions**\n-----------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, the Respondent raises objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims. In the Request, the Respondent asks the Tribunal to hear and decide these objections as preliminary issues prior to considering the merits.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent raises the following objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction:\n\na. first, it contends that the Claimants have not made an \"investment\" in Croatia within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(1) of the BIT, as they have neither made a contribution of economic resources in Croatia nor assumed the necessary investment risk (the \"First Objection\");1 and\n\nb. second, it contends that legality is an express requirement of the BIT and an implicit condition of consent to ICSID arbitration, and the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment was acquired illegally in breach of Croatian and international law, and in contravention of international public policy (the \"Second Objection\")\" It follows, so it contends, that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction.2\n\nCounter-Memorial, Section III.B; Request, \u00b64.\n\nCounter-Memorial, Section III.C; Request, \u00b65.\n\n15.\n\nFurther or alternatively, the Respondent submits that the Claimants\u2019 claims are inadmissible and should be dismissed on the following grounds:\n\na. first, it says that, as a matter of general principles of law, international law and international public policy, a court or tribunal will not grant assistance to a party that has engaged in illegality, as the Claimants have done in this case (the \"Third Objection\");3 and\n\nb. second, it contends that the Purchase Agreement of November 11, 1991 contains an exclusive choice of forum clause providing that the Regional Commercial Court in Zagreb has jurisdiction over \"any dispute\" arising in relation to the agreement. Accordingly, the Tribunal should not consider the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claims concerning alleged non-performance of obligations in the Purchase Agreement (the \"Fourth Objection\").4\n\nCounter-Memorial, Section IV.A; Request, \u00b67.\n\nCounter-Memorial, Section IV.B; Request, \u00b68.\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal has the power to consider these objections as a preliminary matter and to suspend the proceeding on the merits pursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and Rules 41(3) and 41(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.5 Even if one were to assume that these provisions address only jurisdictional objections, the Respondent argues that \"the Tribunal has the discretion to rule on admissibility objections as a preliminary matter under its residual powers and Article 44 of the ICSID Convention\".6\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b612-15.\n\nReply, \u00b620.\n\n17.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is common practice in international investment arbitration to bifurcate proceedings between preliminary objections and the merits.7 The Respondent contends that early resolution of jurisdictional and admissibility issues \"avoids spending time and resources on issues that will become moot if the Tribunal turns out to be unable to hear the claims.\"8 Further, for the Respondent, the case for bifurcation of preliminary objections is particularly strong when the respondent is a sovereign State, as States \"need not give an account of themselves before an international court or tribunal on the substance of a dispute when jurisdiction has not yet been established\".9\n\nRequest, \u00b624, citing *inter alia* C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (CUP, 2009), pp. 537, 534.\n\nRequest, \u00b620.\n\nRequest, \u00b628, citing S. Rosenne, *The World Court: What it Is and How it Works* (Martinus Nijhoff, 2003), p. 81.\n\n18.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent points to procedural regimes such as the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976, the Swiss Rules 2012 and the Swiss Private International Law Act 1987, which the Respondent says \"adopt a presumption or general rule in favour of bifurcation in order to ensure that a tribunal seised of a case proceeds on a sound footing\".10 The fact that the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules contain no such explicit presumption does not suggest that bifurcation is to be discouraged in ICSID cases. Rather, the Respondent asserts that previous decisions in ICSID cases reflect the shared rationale that:\n\nnotwithstanding the importance of the specific circumstances and claims advanced, bifurcation makes sense where (i) an attempt is undertaken to make a State a party to proceedings and (ii) its consent to arbitrate or the admissibility of the claims are in doubt, especially where jurisdiction is sought based on the respondent State\u2019s unilateral advance offer in respect of a potentially unlimited number of cases.11\n\nRequest, \u00b621.\n\nReply, \u00b643.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the relevant considerations in determining whether bifurcation is appropriate are those set out by the tribunal in *Glamis Gold v United States of America* (\"*Glamis Gold*\").12 In *Glamis Gold*, the tribunal opined that bifurcation is not apt where the preliminary objections are: (i) frivolous; (ii) incapable of materially reducing the scope of proceedings; or (iii) unduly entwined with the merits.13 According to the Respondent, none of these factors is present in this case.\n\nRequest, \u00b625; Reply, \u00b66, citing *Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States of America*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised), 31 May 2005, \u00b6 12(c).\n\nId.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent deals with each of those factors in turn, as follows.\n\n*(i) Factor 1: Frivolousness*\n-----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent submits that its objections are \"anything but frivolous\"; indeed, they contend that they are substantial and supported by ample evidence.14\n\nRequest, \u00b631; Reply, \u00b621.\n\n22.\n\nIn relation to the First Objection, the Respondent considers it an uncontested fact that the payment made to acquire the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment, which was required by law to have gone to five separate bankruptcy estates in Croatia, was instead transferred to the Swiss account of a Panamanian company.15 It follows from this fact, it says, that \"there was no contribution or genuine economic arrangement amounting to a qualifying 'investment' for the purposes of the constituent treaties.\"16\n\nRequest, \u00b632; Reply, \u00b613.\n\nReply, \u00b613. See also, Request, \u00b633.\n\n23.\n\nIn relation to the Second and Third Objections, which are based on the Claimants\u2019 alleged unlawful actions, the Respondent submits that, in its Counter-Memorial, it identified a number of illegalities relating to the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment, including what they described in the Counter-Memorial as \"gross violations of Croatian and international law\" and infringements of \"transnational public policy\".17 Further, the Respondent points to current criminal investigations into the Claimants so as to highlight the seriousness of these objections.18\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6318.\n\nReply, \u00b614.\n\n24.\n\nIn relation to the Fourth Objection, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 contention that the objection is \"not tenable\". It contends that the Claimants have misrepresented the Respondent\u2019s position.19 According to the Respondent, this objection is substantial because:\n\nthe binding, voluntary and unqualified choice to resolve \"any\" dispute from the Purchase Agreement in the Commercial Court in Zagreb... provides a compelling reason why the Tribunal should not enter into the merits of such a dispute, even on the assumption that it might have jurisdiction under an international legal instrument.20\n\nReply, \u00b619.\n\nReply, \u00b619\n\n*(ii) Factor 2: Reduction in Scope of Issues*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent submits that early determination of its preliminary objections \"would result in a complete dismissal of the case or, at the very least, materially reduce its scope if the Respondent prevails\".21 Indeed, according to the Respondent, if either of its jurisdictional objections is upheld, or if the Tribunal finds the claims inadmissible, the case cannot proceed. At a minimum, bifurcation would shorten the proceedings and save costs.22\n\nRequest, \u00b635.\n\nRequest, \u00b638.\n\n26.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent contends that bifurcation could obviate the need for the parties and the Tribunal to engage in the complex and costly task of, respectively, making submissions upon, and determining, the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claims. Although the Respondent has submitted a Counter-Memorial on the merits, it contends that there is still extensive work outstanding, such as written pleadings, expert and witness testimony, oral hearings and document production. According to the Respondent, all of these processes will be narrower, less time-consuming and less costly if focused solely on preliminary objections.23 As an example, the Respondent contends:\n\naddressing the merits of the Claimants\u2019 case would involve examining and determining the ownership of no fewer than 80 commercial properties and 470 apartments spread out over more than three thousand plots of land throughout Croatia.24\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b639-44.\n\nRequest, \u00b641.\n\n27.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that it would be a waste of time and costs to address the Claimants\u2019 quantum claim any further before the Tribunal decides the jurisdictional and admissibility issues.25 In this regard, the Respondent says that the Claimants\u2019 claim for direct damages \"entails determination of the market value of 80 commercial properties and 470 apartments... as well as calculation of the income allegedly obtainable from letting some of those properties between 2002 and 2013\",26 and that the claim for indirect damages involves a range of \"complex variables affecting the Croatian meat industry\".27\n\nRequest, \u00b645.\n\nRequest, \u00b646.\n\nRequest, \u00b647.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that early determination of its Fourth Objection relating to the Purchase Agreement could significantly reduce the scope of claims before the Tribunal. Those claims, according to the Respondent, would require the determination of many issues of Croatian law, an exercise that could be avoided if the Fourth Objection were upheld in a preliminary phase.28\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b648-49.\n\n29.\n\nIn its Reply, the Respondent argues that the Claimants underestimate the extent of outstanding work in this case.29 In particular, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Tribunal need not consider \"strict ownership\" under Croatian law to decide their claims. Rather, the Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 right *in rem* under Croatian law is a necessary precursor to any question of liability under the BIT relating to Claimants\u2019 real property.30 Similarly, the Respondent asserts that, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 argument, the Tribunal will need to consider the status of thousands of land plots because it cannot take for granted that the Claimants have correctly bundled the plots as properties.31\n\nReply, Section V.\n\nReply, \u00b660.\n\nReply, \u00b661.\n\n*(iii) Factor 3: Connection with the Merits*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nIn relation to the third factor identified in *Glamis Gold*, the Respondent submits that its preliminary objections \"turn on discrete and self-contained questions of fact, Croatian and international law, and international public policy\", which are distinct from the merits.32 Therefore, there would be no duplication of work in a bifurcated proceeding. According to the Respondent, because its preliminary objections concern only the questions of whether consent exists and whether the claims are admissible, the Tribunal can decide these issues without touching upon the substance of the Claimants\u2019 claims.33\n\nReply, \u00b623.\n\nRequest, \u00b652.\n\n31.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent argues that the facts relevant to deciding the preliminary objections (including the alleged failure to pay for shares and misuse of bankruptcy proceedings) are not connected to the facts relevant to the Claimants\u2019 claims (relating to real property ownership and land registration).34 Similarly, in the Respondent\u2019s submission, there is no overlap between the evidence relevant to the preliminary objections and that which is relevant to the merits. For example, the witnesses and experts who would testify in relation to the merits would not be expected to testify in relation to the preliminary objections.35\n\nRequest, \u00b654.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b658-63.\n\n32.\n\nRegarding the First Objection - lack of an \"investment\" - the Respondent asserts that \"the issue can be resolved by assessing whether or not there was a contribution of value by the Claimants\" and whether any such contribution would be lost if the venture failed.36\n\nReply, \u00b624.\n\n33.\n\nWith respect to the Second and Third Objections - illegality - the Respondent argues that the relevant facts and evidence concern \"the source of the funds, the destination of the funds and the bankruptcy illegalities\".37 According to the Respondent, none of these matters is related to land ownership or registration, which is central to the Claimants\u2019 case on the merits. In this respect, the Respondent refers the decision in *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Australia*, in which the tribunal considered an objection based on nonconformity with host-State law to be:\n\nsuitable for bifurcation because it concerns the foundation of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the Treaty. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it can be considered as a discrete and self-contained question both factually and legally limited to the application of Australian law.38\n\nReply, \u00b625.\n\nReply, \u00b641, quoting *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 8 regarding Bifurcation of the Procedure, 14 April 2014, \u00b6111.\n\n34.\n\nAs to the Fourth Objection, the Respondent states that \"it is undisputed that this requires virtually no factual analysis at all and that it is not connected to the merits.\"39\n\nReply, \u00b627.\n\n35.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 apparent suggestion that bifurcation is not appropriate if the preliminary objections are \"fact-intensive\".40 In the Respondent\u2019s view, there is a benefit of potential cost and time savings in dealing with such objections separately when the relevant factual examination is unconnected with the merits.\n\nReply, \u00b628.\n\n*(iv) Procedural Fairness*\n--------------------------\n\n36.\n\nIn addition to its arguments relating to the three factors identified in *Glamis Gold*, the Respondent submits that bifurcation is appropriate in this case because \"the balance of procedural fairness favors the Respondent\".41 According to the Respondent, the Claimants will not be prejudiced by bifurcation of the proceedings because: (i) there is no risk of delay given that the Tribunal can set an efficient timetable for separate phases; (ii) there will be no waste of time because the preliminary objections must be heard and decided in any event; (iii) in light of the disconnect between preliminary issues and the merits, a decision on jurisdiction and admissibility could not prejudge the merits; and (iv) a decision on bifurcation can be made without prejudging the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections.42\n\nRequest, Section IV.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b665-68.\n\n37.\n\nIn this regard, in the Reply, the Respondent denies any suggestion made by the Claimants that bifurcation would affect the quality of evidence or unduly prolong the dispute.43 The Respondent specifically rejects the Claimants\u2019 use of empirical studies on bifurcation to suggest that bifurcation is time-consuming and inefficient. According to the Respondent these studies are not only \"empirically and methodologically questionable\", but they are based on an assumption that a respondent\u2019s objections will be rejected.44 In any event, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal \"should\u2014all other things being equal\u2014err on the side of caution rather than speed.\"45\n\nReply, Section VI.\n\nReply, \u00b647.\n\nRequest, \u00b674.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it would suffer serious prejudice if the preliminary objections are joined to the merits.\n\n39.\n\nFirst, the Respondent says that, in the absence of bifurcation, it would be burdened with the extensive task of defending itself in a full case in \"improper proceedings to which it did not consent\".46\n\nRequest, \u00b669.\n\n40.\n\nSecond, given that the Respondent has complied with the Tribunal\u2019s direction in Procedural Order No 1 to submit a full Counter-Memorial on the merits, it argues that at this stage, it would serve procedural fairness and equality of arms to address the Respondent\u2019s objections before considering the merits.47\n\nRequest, \u00b672.\n\n41.\n\nThird, the Respondent states that its request for bifurcation stands \"apart from routine bifurcation requests\" because the Claimants acquired their alleged investment unlawfully and \"now seek the assistance of the Tribunal to further profit from their own wrongs\".48\n\nRequest, \u00b673.\n\n**B. The Claimants\u2019 Submissions**\n---------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn their Observations and Rejoinder, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to refuse the Respondent\u2019s Request in its entirety.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the ICSID Rules do not contain a presumption in favour of bifurcation; indeed, the ICSID Administrative Council explicitly rejected such a policy when, as part of the 2006 amendments to the ICSID Arbitration Rules, it amended the previous rule that provided for automatic suspension of the merits.49 Citing *Ascension v. Hungary*, the Claimants state that a tribunal should exercise its discretion to bifurcate proceedings only after considering whether bifurcation would preserve or improve fairness and procedural efficiency.50\n\nObservations, \u00b613.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b69-10 and Rejoinder, \u00b645, citing *Accession Mezzanine Capital L.P. and Danubis Kereskedohaz Vagyonkezelo Zrt. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/3, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Notice of Jurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, August 8, 2013, \u00b638.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants say that the Respondent\u2019s analysis of different procedural regimes is \"irrelevant and inaccurate\".51 In particular, the Claimants contend that the Respondent has failed to consider that, in 2010, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules were changed \"to remove any previously existing presumption in favour of bifurcation\",52 and that *Glamis Gold* was decided under an out-dated version of these rules which did have such a presumption.53\n\nObservations, \u00b611.\n\nObservations, \u00b612.\n\nObservations, \u00b620; Rejoinder, \u00b657.\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s assertion that bifurcation is common practice in international investment arbitration, citing a study \"which found that only 45 out of 174 ICSID tribunals have bifurcated proceedings between jurisdiction, merits and quantum.\"54\n\nObservations, \u00b616, citing Lucy Greenwood, \"Does Bifurcation Really Promote Efficiency?\" *Journal of International Arbitration*, Kluwer Law International, Volume 28, Issue 2 (2011).\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that the three factors listed by the Tribunal in *Glamis Gold* are *among* the relevant considerations for determining whether to bifurcate proceedings but emphasise that they are not the only considerations that may be relevant.55 Instead, tribunals deciding whether to bifurcate proceedings must look \"through the lens of several factors that either promote or detract from procedural efficiency and judicial economy.\"56\n\nObservations, \u00b622; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b646-50.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b654\n\n47.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"statistical evidence and procedural fairness\" are relevant considerations in this case.57 Thus, the Claimants state that \"[a]s a baseline\", one must recognise that a bifurcated jurisdictional phase may add a year or more to the length of the proceedings and can be expensive to litigate; yet, they say that \"only less than a quarter of ICSID cases are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction\".58\n\nRejoinder, \u00b651.\n\nObservations, \u00b623.\n\n48.\n\nApplying these considerations to the present case, the Claimants argue that, for several reasons, bifurcation would not be procedurally efficient and would result in procedural and substantive unfairness for the Claimants. It is convenient to set out their arguments in relation to each of these two matters separately.\n\n*(i) Efficiency of the Proceeding*\n----------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nWith respect to the question of the efficiency of the proceeding, the Claimants argue that early determination of the Fourth Objection would be of no procedural advantage since the case would continue to the merits phase even if the objection were granted.59 Although the Claimants accept that the First, Second and Third Objections, if granted, could dispose of the entire case, they contend that there would be little cost or time savings from bifurcation because the facts underlying these objections are intertwined with the merits.60 In any event, they say that there is little chance the Respondent will prevail in respect of any of its objections.61\n\nObservations, \u00b629.\n\nObservations, \u00b630.\n\nObservations, \u00b631; Rejoinder, \u00b66.\n\n50.\n\nFirst, the Claimants point to the decision in *Mesa Power Group LLC v. Canada* to support their position that \"even a partial overlap of evidence\" between preliminary and merits issues is sufficient to deny bifurcation.62 Further, citing *Minnotte v. Poland* and *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*, the Claimants contend that \"tribunals confronted with allegations of fraud and that the investment at stake was not made in accordance with the host State\u2019s law typically decide to join such objections to the merits\", and that the Respondent has made such allegations in this case.63\n\nObservations, \u00b633, citing *Mesa Power Group, LLC v. Government of Canada*, NAFTA Chapter 11, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Procedural Order No. 2, January 18, 2013, \u00b616.\n\nObservations, \u00b636, citing *Minnotte and Lewis v. Republic of Poland,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/10/1, Award, May 16, 2014, \u00b6129.\n\n51.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"[t]wo factual matrices are central to both merits and jurisdiction questions: the bankruptcy proceedings and the pre-bankruptcy assets of Claimant Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o\".64 As such, the evidence relating to the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections is intrinsically and inextricably linked to the merits of the dispute.65 In particular, the Claimants contend that numerous exhibits to their Memorial on the Merits, most notably the Record and the Asset List, would need to be reviewed from the perspective of both jurisdiction and merits.66 In this regard, the Claimants reject as \"simply false\" the Respondent\u2019s statement that the Record and the Asset List are not mentioned in the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections; the Claimants point out that the Respondent references these documents in relation to its allegation that Mr. Gavrilovi\u0107 schemed with the bankruptcy trustee, and that the Respondent\u2019s \"Bankruptcy Law Expert Report\" discusses the Record extensively.67\n\nRejoinder, \u00b621.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b64, 41.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b641-46; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b621-30.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b631-32.\n\n52.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants state that \"at least half of the witnesses testify both as to the circumstances of the bankruptcy purchase (jurisdiction) and later breaches of FET by Croatia (merits)\".68 Thus, many witnesses would need to appear twice during this arbitration if the Tribunal were to bifurcate the proceedings.69\n\nRejoinder, \u00b637.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b647-50; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b633-37.\n\n53.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that \"to determine whether bifurcation is appropriate, it is necessary to make a preliminary determination of the likelihood of success of the preliminary objections\".70 Applying this test, the Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s objections are insufficiently substantial to warrant bifurcation.71\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b652-60.\n\nObservations, \u00b651.\n\n54.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the First Objection is \"particularly frivolous\" for several reasons, including that \"risk is already indicated by the existence of a dispute\" and that \"the origin of capital used in investments is immaterial\".72\n\nObservations, \u00b652.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants say that the Second and Third Objections are unsubstantiated because (i) the Respondent did not \"successfully challenge the purchase in the 23 years\" since the investment; (ii) Croatian courts have never refused to confirm the transaction\u2019s effectiveness; (iii) a senior state attorney of Croatia confirmed that the investment was made in accordance with Croatian legislation made pursuant to the BIT; (iv) the Respondent subjected the bankruptcy purchase to a state audit process which did not find any illegalities; (v) the Respondent\u2019s key witness for these objections is a convicted felon who recently entered into a plea agreement with the Respondent\u2019s state attorney\u2019s office reducing his punishment; (vi) the Respondent has \"not cited to one Croatian [statute] or other applicable law that either of the Claimants supposedly breached\"; and (vii) documents in the criminal file which the Respondent has concealed \"demonstrate that the transfer of funds to Mr. Gavrilovi\u0107 in connection with this investment was not unlawful\".73\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b654-63; Rejoinder, 8-17.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Fourth Objection is not substantial either because, as the tribunal explained in *Vivendi v. Argentina*, \"a forum selection clause in a contract pointing to domestic courts will not oust ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction\".74\n\nObservations, \u00b664.\n\n57.\n\nFinally in relation to issues of efficiency, the Claimants argue that dismissing their claims on the merits would not lead to substantially less cost and expense because: (i) the parties have already provided complete submissions covering all stages of the proceedings; (ii) the Respondent has \"grossly exaggerated\" the amount of outstanding work related solely to the merits by claiming that each land plot and property requires a unique determination, when in fact many can be addressed simultaneously and the parties have already submitted expert reports on this subject; and (iii) the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections are \"highly fact-based\", such that \"having one document production for the jurisdictional and merits phases will save considerable time and costs\".75\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 65-71; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b638-43.\n\n*(ii) Procedural Fairness*\n--------------------------\n\n58.\n\nTurning to the issue of procedural fairness, the Claimants argue that bifurcation of the proceedings would prolong the arbitration and with it the Respondent\u2019s illegal \"campaign of harassment and deprivation\", which the Respondent has, according to the Claimants, \"intensified\" since the filing of the arbitration. This conduct has caused \"serious damage to [the Claimants'] business reputation\" and relationships, and forms the basis of the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures.76\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b672-77; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b618-20.\n\n59.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants argue that, by delaying the merits phase, bifurcation could deprive the Tribunal of the opportunity to hear testimony from several witnesses \"due to their high age and health problems\".77 Thus, bifurcation would \"manifestly reduce the fairness of these proceedings.\"78\n\nObservations, \u00b678.\n\nObservations, \u00b67.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n60.\n\nHaving carefully considered the submissions of the parties, the Tribunal has decided to refuse the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation of the proceedings into, first, a jurisdictional and admissibility phase and, then, a merits phase.\n\n61.\n\nBefore turning to the reasons for this decision, it is necessary to put to one side some preliminary matters.\n\n62.\n\nFirst, it is clear that the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide a sufficient basis for the existence of the Tribunal\u2019s power to decide whether to bifurcate.\n\n63.\n\nSecond, as to the breadth of the discretion, while the Tribunal has been assisted by reference to the relevant regimes under other arbitration rules, and decisions of other tribunals, the exercise of its discretion is not to be unduly narrowed by reference to presumptions or circumstances in which other tribunals have considered it appropriate to (or not to) bifurcate on the facts of other cases. The Tribunal notes that, formerly, the ICSID Arbitration Rules provided that when a respondent State raised an objection to jurisdiction, all proceedings on the merits were automatically suspended until the tribunal either ruled on the respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections or ordered them to be joined to the merits.79 The present Rules provide for a discretion in such circumstances: Rule 41(3) now states that \"[u]pon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits\" (emphasis added). The present Rules, therefore, contain no such mandatory suspension; nor is there any reference to a presumption in favour of bifurcation.\n\nICSID Convention, Regulations and Rules, ICSID/15/Rev. 1 (2003), Rule 41(3).\n\n64.\n\nThird, the Tribunal considers that little assistance is gained by seeking to identify, if it may exist, the common practice of international arbitral tribunals.\n\n65.\n\nFourth, statistical data on how many bifurcation applications have been granted are apt to mislead.\n\n66.\n\nWhat is clear is that each case must turn on its own facts. And, this being so, the Tribunal does not consider that it should be placed in the \"straightjacket\" of considering this question by reference to the *Glamis Gold* factors, and nothing further. To do so would be to overlook what can be discerned from relevant cases, namely a governing principle that a decision on an application for bifurcation, like other procedural orders, must have regard to the fairness of the procedure to be invoked and the efficiency of the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings. To identify, and discuss in turn, only certain identified factors may distract from the task at hand.\n\n**A. The Objections Re-visited**\n--------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation rests on four objections to either jurisdiction or admissibility.80 While it is, of course, unnecessary for the purposes of this decision to rule on these objections, it is important, indeed critical, to the outcome to have regard to what would be involved in determining, in a bifurcated phase, whether the objections should be upheld. Before turning to consider the procedural advantages and disadvantages of considering each of these objections in a bifurcated phase, it bears briefly re-visiting the First to Fourth Objections.\n\na. The First Objection is a jurisdictional one. The Respondent claims that the Claimants have not made an \"investment\" in Croatia within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\nb. The Second Objection is also a jurisdictional one, namely that legality is an express requirement of the BIT and an implicit condition of consent to ICSID arbitration. As the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment was acquired illegally in breach of Croatian and international law, and in contravention of international public policy, it was obtained illegally and, thus, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction.\n\nc. The Third Objection can be considered together with the Second Objection - it, however, goes to the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims. As a matter of general principles of law, international law and international public policy, a court or tribunal will not grant assistance to a party that has engaged in illegality.\n\nd. The Fourth Objection relates only to alleged non-performance of the Purchase Agreement dated November 11, 1991. At least insofar as disputes under that agreement are concerned, they should be determined by the chosen court, namely the Regional Commercial Court in Zagreb, and not this Tribunal.\n\nSee paragraphs 14-15 above.\n\n**B. The First Objection**\n--------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s contention that the Tribunal is able to simply determine the issue of whether there is an \"investment\" has a superficial attraction to it. Indeed, the Respondent contends that the evidence in support of the First Objection arises from the Claimants\u2019 own evidence: \"A letter from the First Claimant\u2019s bank dated 18 March 1991 and two foreign transfer orders dated 6 and 16 March 1992 demonstrate that the money that should by law have gone to five separate bankruptcy estates in Croatia in return for five companies in bankruptcy. was instead transferred to the account of a Panamanian company. in Zug, Switzerland\".81\n\nRequest, \u00b632.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s present view is that there is merit in the Claimants\u2019 Response. It may be that the determination of whether there was a relevant \"investment\", and thus jurisdiction, will require consideration to be given, at least, to the bankruptcy proceedings that preceded the payment identified by the Respondent and the other salient aspects of the context in which the investment was (or was not) made. That this is so follows from the contentions relied upon by the Claimants to support the existence of an \"investment\". In their Observations, they identify four such contentions,82 namely (i) the broad interpretation of the term \"investment\"; (ii) the acceptance of an \"investment\" where the purchase price has been a nominal amount; (iii) the assumption of risk by the Claimants which is evidenced by the existence of a dispute; and (iv) the fact that tribunals have generally found that the origin of capital used in investments is immaterial. Whether these contentions ultimately succeed is another question, but the issue of whether a financial contribution was made may well necessitate the Tribunal\u2019s review of the relevant bankruptcy proceedings in considerable detail, so as to assess not only their legality under the domestic law, but also to determine exactly what assets were transferred, and to whom, in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, as the tribunal identified in *Kardasopoulous v. Georgia*, the prevailing political and economic climate may also inform the existence, or otherwise, of an assumption of risk.\n\nObservations, \u00b652.\n\n70.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal\u2019s opinion is informed by the approach of the tribunal in *Minnotte v. Poland*, where it was explained that the investment must be a real one. But the precise amount and value of which is not critical to the question of the existence, or otherwise, of jurisdiction.83 The First Objection, as to the ultimate veracity of which we say nothing, requires an investigation of that which preceded the relevant payment to identify whether, indeed, there was value which passed from the Claimants to the Respondent. That value may take many forms, and the fact that funds were deposited in a Swiss account (assuming that to be so) does not explain the provenance of those funds, nor the ultimate beneficiary of such funds. In short, the First Objection cannot, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, be determined by reference to a factual matrix as narrow as that posited by the Respondent. Indeed to do so would be to overlook what the Tribunal considers may, in an appropriate case (of which this may be one), be relevant to the determination of the existence, or otherwise, of an \"investment\", namely the other conduct which preceded and post-dated the relevant payment.\n\n*Minnotte and Lewis v Republic of Poland*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/10/1, Award, May 16, 2014, \u00b6112.\n\n71.\n\nAccordingly, insofar as the First Objection is concerned, the Tribunal does not accept the proposition, emphasised numerous times by the Respondent (in relation to this objection and others) that the preliminary objection can be determined on the basis of \"discrete and self-contained questions of fact\".84 The proceeding, in this regard, bears insufficient resemblance to *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Australia*, where it was said that the relevant question was a \"discrete and self-contained question both factually and legally limited to the application of [national] law\".85 Indeed, the Tribunal considers that deciding upon the First Objection is, indeed, a task requiring a considerable \"fact-intensive\" analysis.\n\ncf. Reply, \u00b661.\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No 8 regarding Bifurcation of the Procedure, 14 April 2014, \u00b6111.\n\n**C. The Second and Third Objections**\n--------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Second and Third Objections concern allegations of illegality which, in the Respondent\u2019s submissions, go to, respectively, jurisdiction and admissibility. That is, the Respondent alleges, *inter alia*, that the First Claimant \"orchestrated the bankruptcy of the Five New LLCs and fraudulently took possession of them\"86 or \"fraudulently took money belonging to the Croatian State\".87 The Respondent contends that a finding on these matters, at a jurisdictional or admissibility phase, would alleviate the need for the burdensome task of reviewing the propriety, or otherwise, of the ownership of no fewer than 80 commercial properties and 470 apartments throughout Croatia.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b620.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b633.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal is cognisant of the need to ensure procedural efficiency, and can see the good sense in considering an objection which, if upheld, would save the parties considerable time and expense in considering such fact-intensive inquiries. Indeed, the Claimants frankly concede that the Respondent\u2019s success on either of the Second or Third Objections (as well as the First Objection) would dispose of their claims in their entirety, and thereby obviate a need for a merits phase at all.88\n\nObservations, \u00b630.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal is not, however, satisfied that the proceeding can be neatly divided in the manner suggested by the Respondent. Absent consideration of the various factual disputes in relation to the bankruptcy proceedings, and perhaps the consideration of the provenance of the title of each and every property (that is, the determination of issues such as validity and proper registration of the relevant titles), no proper conclusion can be drawn as to the illegality (or otherwise) of the Claimants\u2019 conduct. This may well involve careful consideration of the propriety of the actions of various administrative and judicial authorities in registering (or refusing to register) title. To determine that question at the first stage, without the benefit of a comprehensive evidential basis, would be to risk prematurely dismissing the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent\u2019s argument that various documents can be effectively ignored for the purposes of determining the appropriateness of bifurcating the proceeding. By way of example, the Respondent contends that the Record and Asset List are each a sham produced to obscure the fact that various properties were not properly divided amongst the relevant companies. Whether that is so can only be determined on a proper analysis of the evidence in support of that proposition.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants rely on these very documents as evidence of their rights for the purposes of the merits of the dispute and highlight that the Respondent relies on the very same documents to posit illegality for the purposes of its jurisdictional and admissibility objections. It must follow, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, that the jurisdictional and admissibility stage, on the one hand, and the merits stage, on the other, will be linked, if not inextricably, at least closely. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that it was accepted by the tribunal in *Mesa Power Group, LLC v. Government of Canada*89 that the existence of \"closely linked\" facts may, of itself, be sufficient to justify a refusal of an application to bifurcate.\n\nNAFTA Chapter 11, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Procedural Order No. 2, January 18, 2013, \u00b616,\n\n77.\n\nFurther, the prospect of a division between these phases, especially in relation to the matters the subject of the Second and Third Objections, raises the prospect of witnesses having to give evidence on two occasions. That may be particularly problematic where, as here, there are serious allegations of fraud to be put to witnesses. The Tribunal considers that the possibility of it being asked to consider such allegations, and make findings as to credibility, at the jurisdictional or admissibility stage is such that the Tribunal may be asked to undertake this task where it has not yet had the benefit of the full factual matrix. Only a hearing of the entirety of the dispute will provide the Tribunal with all of the relevant evidence to properly consider such serious allegations. That is not to say that where allegations of fraud and illegality are made, bifurcation will never be appropriate. But where, as here, the allegations said to support the Second and Third Objections are, at least, closely linked, bifurcation is rendered difficult, if not impossible.\n\n78.\n\nFinally, the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the existence of a criminal investigation in Croatia90 as \"emphasis[ing] the seriousness of the Respondent\u2019s objections\"91 is, in our view, unhelpful. What matters to the Tribunal\u2019s ultimate determination of the illegality (or otherwise) of conduct in Croatia at the relevant time will turn on the evidence led by the parties, not the existence (or otherwise) of an investigation.\n\nSee further, paragraph 23 above.\n\nReply, \u00b614.\n\n79.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the reduction in scope of the issues identified by the Respondent is more apparent than real. At least insofar as the Second and Third Objections are concerned, the overlap between the factual matters is such that the jurisdiction or admissibility phase, even if it were considered to be appropriate, would be time-consuming. Indeed, if that objection failed, the length of the proceeding, as a whole, would be significantly increased because similar, if not identical, matters would have to be canvassed in evidence at the merits stage as well. As such, a hearing of the entirety of the dispute at once must be preferable.\n\n**D. The Fourth Objection**\n---------------------------\n\n80.\n\nAs to the Fourth Objection - the forum selection clause in the Purchase Agreement - the Tribunal accepts that this objection could be determined discretely. However, there are three reasons why the Tribunal is minded not to divide this issue from the merits phase for separate determination.\n\n81.\n\nFirst, it must be borne in mind that, as the Claimants emphasised, and as is well-established by decisions of other tribunals, a jurisdiction agreement pointing to domestic courts will not necessarily oust ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction.92 So much is recognised (perhaps implicitly) by the Respondent in identifying this objection as one that goes to *admissibility*, rather than jurisdiction.\n\nSee, eg, *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets LP v The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, January 14, 2004, \u00b691.\n\n82.\n\nSecondly, even if the Respondent were successful in its reliance on this agreement, it would not appear to obviate the need for a merits phase, at least in relation to those claims that are unrelated to the Purchase Agreement. Indeed, the scope of the dispute, although perhaps narrower, may not be so narrowed as to warrant the cost, expense and inconvenience of dividing the proceeding into two phases. Put simply, as the Claimants contend, it appears not to be a substantial enough objection, in and of itself, to justify bifurcation.93\n\nObservations, \u00b664.\n\n83.\n\nThirdly, in light of the conclusions in relation to the First, Second and Third Objections, the bifurcation of the Fourth Objection alone would be causative of unnecessary delay, in circumstances where the proceeding would be divided into two phases for very little procedural, or other, advantage. If it were appropriate to bifurcate the First, Second and Third Objections, the Tribunal would be persuaded to determine the Fourth Objection at the same time but, in and of itself, it does not warrant the bifurcation sought. Indeed, the Respondent does not appear to suggest otherwise.\n\n**E. Procedural Fairness**\n--------------------------\n\n84.\n\nBoth parties rely on arguments as to procedural fairness in support of their respective positions. They have been summarised above.94\n\nSee the summary of the Respondent\u2019s contentions at paragraphs 36-41 and the summary of those of the Claimants at paragraphs 58-59 above.\n\n85.\n\nIt is, of course, trite to observe that the provision of an adequate opportunity to be heard and to put one\u2019s case is fundamental to an arbitral proceeding.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the matters relied upon by the Respondent are not sufficient to persuade us that the Respondent will be deprived of the opportunity to fairly put its case if the proceeding is not bifurcated. In this regard, the Tribunal rejects the contention that the State has an entitlement to have jurisdiction determined before the merits.95 The objections of a State (whether jurisdictional or otherwise), like the objections of a nonState party, are entitled to be properly considered, and ruled upon. The Tribunal does not consider itself bound to afford a State a bifurcated hearing on the basis of a submission of such an entitlement; nor does it accept that it is bound by a \"general rule\"96 that States need not make submissions as to the merits unless, and until, jurisdiction is definitively established.\n\ncf. Request, \u00b628. The Respondent\u2019s contention in this regard is summarised more fully at paragraph 17 above.\n\ncf. Request, \u00b628. See further, paragraph 17 above.\n\n87.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal does not accept that the Respondent\u2019s provision of a full CounterMemorial on the merits is such that procedural fairness and equality of arms demand a bifurcated hearing. The provision of the full Counter-Memorial was required in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1 and, indeed, to enable the Claimants (and the Tribunal) to understand the Respondent\u2019s case. It is difficult to understand an argument that calls in aid the provision of a full Counter-Memorial as providing a basis why bifurcation must necessarily be ordered.\n\n88.\n\nThe fact that the Respondent relies upon the unlawful conduct of the Claimants does not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, necessarily support a decision in favour of bifurcation. Indeed, for the reasons explained in paragraph 77 above, the seriousness of the allegations suggests that they need be determined in the one hearing.\n\n89.\n\nIn short, a non-bifurcated proceeding can be conducted in a manner that ensures that both parties are accorded procedural fairness. The convenience of having particular issues determined first, so as to seek to either conclude the proceeding at an earlier stage or, at least, narrow the issues, does not go to the question of procedural fairness. Indeed, the Tribunal will, after publication of this decision, give the parties a (further) opportunity to make submissions on the question of an appropriate timetable.\n\n**F. Exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s Discretion**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nAs we have explained above, the Tribunal\u2019s discretion is a broad one. Its proper consideration of the Respondent\u2019s Request is not confined to the *Glamis Gold* factors or indeed the factors identified in other cases, each of which fell to be determined on the basis of its own facts.\n\n91.\n\nIn deciding the Respondent\u2019s request, therefore, the Tribunal also had regard to the other matters relied upon by the parties in support of their respective positions. In considering the matters above in the context of each of the First to Fourth Objections, the Tribunal was of the view that the relevant factors called in aid by the parties were such that, ultimately, bifurcation was not appropriate.\n\n92.\n\nThe balancing of these various considerations is often a difficult task. In this case, the Respondent has not satisfied the Tribunal that it is appropriate, having regard to all the circumstances, that bifurcation should be ordered. In particular, the Tribunal is not persuaded that bifurcated proceedings would enable the consideration of separate, and thus not overlapping, factual matrices at each of the jurisdiction and admissibility stage and at the merits stage. Put another way, the result of bifurcation may well require a consideration of the same, or similar, facts for the purpose of jurisdiction and admissibility and then, later, for the purpose of the merits. In these circumstances, the balance favours one single hearing where each party can present its full case as to jurisdiction, admissibility and the merits. As such, this is not an appropriate case for bifurcation.\n\n93.\n\nPut simply, a ruling on at least three of the four preliminary objections would in all likelihood require a detailed examination of the same evidence that will ultimately need to be examined at the stage of determining the merits. There is no procedural or other advantage with bifurcating the proceeding, so as to require not only the Tribunal to consider the same, or similar, evidence on two occasions, but so as to require witnesses to appear on two occasions, submissions to be prepared which canvass the same, or similar, matters, and the consequential cost and expense. Most fundamentally, it risks a determination on jurisdiction and admissibility divorced from the entirety of the factual matrix. Once a considerable factual overlap is accepted, which the Tribunal considers to be the case, little can be said in support of the division of the case. Indeed, such bifurcation would be unfair, both to the parties (in terms the cost and expense of preparing for two significant hearings) and the witnesses (who may be required to appear twice). Further, unavoidable delay would be thereby caused.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n94.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal refuses the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation of the proceedings into a jurisdictional phase and a merits phase.\n\n**V. FURTHER PROCEDURAL ORDERS**\n--------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nIn light of this decision, it will be necessary for the Tribunal to make further procedural orders for the conduct of the proceeding. Having had regard to the proposed schedule for a non-bifurcated proceeding submitted by each of the parties, the Tribunal will shortly circulate draft orders to the parties for their consideration."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Urgent Application for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2015-03-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Urgent Application for Provisional Measures\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nThis Order concerns the Claimants\u2019 urgent application, made by letter dated 13 March 2015 **(the Urgent Application).** By the Urgent Application, the Claimants seek an order that the Respondent temporarily suspend its interrogation of the First Claimant until the Tribunal rules on the pending application made by the Claimants on 15 December 2014 to stay, *inter alia,* the entirety of the criminal prosecution of the First Claimant.\n\n**Relevant Background**\n-----------------------\n\n[2].\n\nOn 15 December 2014, the Claimant made an application to the Tribunal, by a 44-page document entitled \"Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures\" **(the Claimants\u2019 Request),** for provisional measures.\n\n[3].\n\nIn Part IV of the Claimants\u2019 Request, they requested relief, which included:\n\n(i) Respondent shall take all appropriate measures to suspend any investigation relating to the Investigation Order dated November 25, 2014, and any other criminal investigatory actions or criminal proceedings initiated against [the First Claimant], and to suspend any other criminal proceedings or investigation related in any way to the present arbitration, until the arbitration is completed or upon a further decision of the Tribunal.\n\n(ii) Respondent shall refrain from engaging in any other course of action which may directly or indirectly jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration, aggravate or extend the dispute, alter the *status quo,* destroy the equality of arms between the parties or threaten the exclusivity of this ICSID arbitration...\n\n[4].\n\nIt is unnecessary for present purposes to set out the basis for the Claimants\u2019 Request, other than to note that, on the basis of the Claimants\u2019 Request and its supporting material, it is plain that it is a substantial and significant application requiring careful consideration by the Tribunal. Put another way, and not intending to indicate how the Tribunal may ultimately deal with the Claimants\u2019 Request, the application is not one which can be summarily dismissed.\n\n[5].\n\nOn 23 December 2014, the Tribunal ordered that the Respondent provide its reply to the Claimants\u2019 Request by 28 January 2015.\n\n[6].\n\nOn 28 January 2015, the Respondent provided its 67-page response, by way of a document entitled \"Respondent\u2019s Reply to Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures\" **(the Respondent\u2019s Reply).** It also provided supporting material.\n\n[7].\n\nOn 9 February 2015, the Claimants were invited by the Tribunal, if they wished to do so, to file a short Rejoinder to the Respondent\u2019s Reply by 24 February 2015. A short extension of this deadline was sought by the Claimants, and granted by the Tribunal, to 27 February 2015.\n\n[8].\n\nOn 27 February 2015, the Claimants filed a 26-page Rejoinder. It, too, was supported by evidential material.\n\n[9].\n\nOn 4 March 2015, the Respondent was invited by the Tribunal, if it wished to do so, to file a short Surrejoinder by 31 March 2015.\n\n[10].\n\nSo, by way of summary, before receipt of the Urgent Application:\n\n(a) the Claimants\u2019 Request had been pending before the Tribunal for nearly three months, while the Tribunal received submissions from the Parties;\n\n(b) each of the Parties had availed itself of the opportunity to file significant submissions and supporting evidence; and\n\n(c) pending receipt of the final submissions from the Respondent, the Tribunal was to rule on the Claimants\u2019 Request shortly after 31 March 2015.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n-----------------------\n\n[11].\n\nIn its Urgent Application, the Claimants explained (citations omitted):\n\nYesterday, March 12, 2015, [the First Claimant] received an official summons compelling his appearance next Friday, March 20, 2015, for an interrogation by Respondent pursuant to the investigation order filed against him on November 26, 2014 (the \"Investigation Order\") by the Respondent\u2019s State Attorney\u2019s \"Office for Suppressing Corruption and Organized Crime\" (\"USKOK\").... Pursuant to Croatian law, [the First Claimant] must attend the interrogation, and faces arrest if he refuses to do so. [The First Claimant's] responses to the questions of the State Attorney will be admissible during any eventual prosecution under the Investigation Order.\n\nThe allegations set forth in the Investigation Order are identical to certain of the jurisdictional objections set forth by Respondent in this arbitration. As such, an interrogation of [the First Claimant] by Respondent relating to these allegations would manifestly upset the equality of arms between the Parties, and would jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration.\n\nThis is especially true given the timing of Respondent\u2019s summons to [the First Claimant], As you know, on March 4, 2015, the Tribunal granted Respondent\u2019s request to submit a counter-rejoinder on March 31, 2015. The summons was issued two days later, on March 6, 2015, and fixes a date in advance of the submission of the counter-rejoinder.\n\nThus, Respondent intensifies its abuse of its sovereign powers to circumvent the procedural rules of this arbitration before the Tribunal will be in a position to finally rule on Claimants\u2019 request to enjoin such abuse.\n\nIn order to maintain the status quo, and to preserve the procedural integrity of this arbitration, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal order Respondent to temporarily suspend its interrogation of [the First Claimant] until the Tribunal rules on Claimants\u2019 Request to stay in its entirety the criminal prosecution of [the First Claimant],\n\n[12].\n\nThe next day, on 14 March 2015, the Tribunal invited the Respondent\u2019s response to the Urgent Application by 17 March 2015.\n\n[13].\n\nOn 17 March 2015, the Respondent provided a reply together with an English translation of Articles 229 and 239 of the Criminal Procedure Act of Croatia.\n\n[14].\n\nIn its reply, the Respondent stated, *inter alia:*\n\n\u2022 The interview will in no way affect, let alone cause serious or irreparty injury to, any of the existing rights of the Claimants in the arbitration.\n\n\u2022 The interview of a suspect is an intergral part of the Croatian Public Prosecution Servios\u2019 duty to investigate alleged criminal conduct.\n\n\u2022 The interview of the First Claimant will not in any way prevent him or the Second Claimant from fully participating in the arbitration.\n\n\u2022 The interview of the First Claimant is not being used to gather evidence for this arbitration.\n\n[15].\n\nThe Respondent further says that the criminal investigation must be completed within six months pursuant to Article 229 of the Croatian Criminal Procedure Act and that deadline expires on 25 May 2015. The Respondent further says that respect of human rights and the rule of law are part of the highest values Croatian Constitutional Order and that, since being issued with the investigation decision in November 2014, the First Claimant has been aware that he would be summoned for an intereview, and he has been given nearly 2 weeks notice of his proposed interview date.\n\n**Disposition**\n---------------\n\n[16].\n\nHaving regard to the chronology set out above, the Tribunal considers it is appropriate that any further steps to interrogate the First Claimant on 20 March 2015, or otherwise, should await the determination of the Tribunal on the Claimants\u2019 Request.\n\n[17].\n\nInterrogating the First Claimant now, in advance of the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the Cla im ants\u2019 Request, would render at least part of that request nugatory. That is to say, the relief sought by the Claimants\u2019 Request would be denied not by proper consideration of the Parties\u2019 respective contentions but by a decision, over which the Respondent has control, to facilitate an interrogation which, in the circumstances, would be premature.\n\n[18].\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that there is real, or any, prejudice to the Respondent or its agents by awaiting the outcome of the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the Claimants\u2019 Request. The Tribunal notes the Respondent\u2019s submission that the deadline for completing the investigation of the First Claimant expires on 25 May 2015. The decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request will be made soon after 31 March 2015 and the delay of the First Claimant\u2019s interrogation in respect of conduct over twenty years ago by a further period of no more than one month cannot, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, support a proper allegation of prejudice.\n\n**Order**\n---------\n\n[19].\n\nTherefore, pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, and so as to protect the integrity of this arbitration, the Tribunal hereby orders:\n\nThe Respondent and/or its agents be restrained from interrogating, examining, or otherwise compelling the attendance of, the First Claimant on 20 March 2015, or on any other date, until the Tribunal rules on the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures dated 15 December 2014 filed in this arbitration.\n\n**Postscript**\n--------------\n\n[20].\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the Urgent Application should not be seen as in any way to suggest, or be taken to suggest, the ultimate outcome of the Claimants\u2019 Request. Self-evidently, the determination of the questions the subject of the Claimants\u2019 Request are broader in nature and not attended by the urgency the subject of the Urgent Application. They will, like the Urgent Application, be considered on their merits."}, {"Title": "Decision on Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2015-04-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Provisional Measures\n--------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration arises out of the alleged investments of Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107, a national of Austria, and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., a company organised under the laws of Croatia (together, the \"Claimants\"), in the Republic of Croatia (the \"Respondent\" or \"Croatia\") (collectively, with the \"Claimants\", the \"Parties\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, the Claimants commenced this arbitration under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Croatia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 1 November 1999 (the \"BIT\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n3.\n\nThis Decision sets out the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of, and decision in respect of, the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures dated 15 December 2014 (the \"Claimants\u2019 Request\").\n\n4.\n\nFor the reasons elaborated in Section IV below, the Tribunal has decided to refuse the Claimants\u2019 Request.\n\n**II. RELEVANT PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 28 November 2014, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, on 26 November 2014, a crime unit of the Croatian State Attorney\u2019s Office, the Croatian Office for Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime (\"USKOK\") had issued a decision to conduct criminal investigations in respect of Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 (the \"Investigation Order\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 2 December 2014, the Claimants submitted a letter to the Tribunal, setting out several objections to the investigation initiated by USKOK and informing the Tribunal that the Claimants would file an application for provisional measures shortly.\n\n7.\n\nOn 15 December 2014, the Claimants submitted their Request, accompanied by the following evidential material:\n\n(a) a legal opinion of Professor Davor Derencinovic dated 12 December 2014 (the \"First Derencinovic Opinion\");\n\n(b) a witness statement of Amela Lovrekovic dated 12 December 2014;\n\n(c) a witness statement of Marko Dabic dated 12 December 2014 (the \"Dabic Statement\");\n\n(d) a witness statement of Suzana Juric Sekulic dated 12 December 2014; and\n\n(e) a witness statement of Tihana Prpic Luzaic dated 12 December 2014 (the \"Luzaic Statement\").\n\n8.\n\nIn short, in reliance on that evidential material, the Claimants seek relief ordering the Respondent to take all appropriate measures to suspend any criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, to refrain from any criminal prosecution of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, and to refrain from any other conduct which may jeopardise the procedural integrity of the arbitration.\n\n9.\n\nOn 16 December 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer regarding a procedural timetable for written submissions in relation to the Claimants\u2019 Request and to advise the Tribunal of their respective initial views as to whether an oral hearing was necessary.\n\n10.\n\nOn 22 December 2014, each of the Parties made submissions as to the procedural timetable for the written submissions. The Respondent proposed to submit its observations on the Request by 30 January 2015 and informed the Tribunal that it saw no benefit to holding an oral hearing. The Claimants proposed that the Respondent submit its observations by 31 December 2014 and made no submissions regarding an oral hearing.\n\n11.\n\nOn 23 December 2014, having considered the Parties\u2019 respective submissions as to the procedural timetable, the Tribunal ordered that the Respondent provide its reply to the Claimants\u2019 Request by 28 January 2015. The Tribunal reserved its decision on whether to hold a hearing.\n\n12.\n\nOn 28 January 2015, the Respondent provided its Reply to the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures (the \"Respondent\u2019s Reply\"), together with a legal opinion of Professor Petar Novoselec dated 27 January 2015.\n\n13.\n\nOn 9 February 2015, the Tribunal invited the Claimants, if they so wished, to provide a rejoinder to the Respondent\u2019s Reply by 24 February 2015.\n\n14.\n\nOn 10 February 2015, the Claimants requested that the deadline for the submission of any rejoinder be extended to 27 February 2015. The Tribunal granted that request.\n\n15.\n\nOn 27 February 2015, the Claimants provided their Rejoinder in Support of their Request for Provisional Measures (the \"Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder\"), together with a supplemental legal opinion of Professor Davor Derencinovic dated 27 February 2015 (the \"Second Derencinovic Opinion\").\n\n16.\n\nOn 4 March 2015, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit any surrejoinder by 31 March 2015.\n\n17.\n\nOn 13 March 2015, while the Tribunal was awaiting the Respondent\u2019s submission of the surrejoinder, the Claimants made an urgent application to the Tribunal. The Claimants informed the Tribunal that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 had, the day prior, received an official summons compelling his appearance on 20 March 2015 for an interrogation by the Respondent. In those circumstances, the Claimants sought relief as follows:\n\nIn order to maintain the status quo, and to preserve the procedural integrity of this arbitration, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal, order Respondent to temporarily suspend its interrogation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 until the Tribunal rules on the Claimants\u2019 Request to stay in its entirety the criminal prosecution of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent immediately sought leave to respond to the Claimants\u2019 application, and on 14 March 2015, the President of the Tribunal requested that the Respondent submit its response by 17 March 2015. The Respondent subsequently filed its response on that date.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal duly considered each Party\u2019s submissions and ultimately granted the relief sought in an Order dated 19 March 2015. That relief expires, according to the terms of the Order, when \"the Tribunal rules on the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures dated 15 December 2014 filed in this arbitration\". This Decision constitutes such ruling; therefore, the urgent relief granted on 19 March 2015 expires as of the date of this Decision.\n\n20.\n\nOn 31 March 2015, the Respondent provided its Surrejoinder to Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder in Support of their Request for Provisional Measures (the \"Respondent\u2019s Surrejoinder\"), together with a supplemental legal opinion of Professor Petar Novoselec dated 30 March 2015.\n\n21.\n\nIn the cover letter to the Respondent\u2019s Surrejoinder, the Respondent requested that an inperson hearing on the Claimants\u2019 Request be held, and informed the Tribunal of its availability to attend such hearing in April. It explained that \"considering the importance for what is at stake for the Respondent - namely, interference with its undisputable sovereign right and duty to investigate suspected criminal activity in its territory - the Respondent considers that such a hearing is necessary to ensure that the Arbitral Tribunal engages the issue with the appropriate level of care and attention\".\n\n22.\n\nOn 1 April 2015, the President invited the Claimants to comment on the Respondent\u2019s request for an in-person hearing.\n\n23.\n\nOn 2 April 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal, asserting that any oral argument could be easily achieved by in a telephone hearing. In so doing, it proffered some further (unsolicited) submissions on the subject matter of the Claimants\u2019 Request and submitted two additional exhibits.\n\n24.\n\nOn 3 April 2015, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal objecting to these unsolicited submissions and seeking that they be struck off the record or, alternatively, that it be given the opportunity to make submissions in response. In addition, with respect to the issue of a hearing, the Respondent contended that only an in-person hearing would allow the Respondent to rigorously test the evidence of the Claimants\u2019 lay and expert witnesses.\n\n25.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 respective submissions as to the need for an oral hearing (whether by telephone or in-person), the Tribunal concluded that such hearing was unnecessary and informed the Parties accordingly on 7 April 2015. This was so because, as is apparent from Section III below, the legal submissions of the Parties are very extensive and the Tribunal was, and remains, of the view that the testing of the witnesses was unnecessary to resolve the matters in dispute.\n\n26.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal, of course, considers that, irrespective of whether a hearing is held or not, it has given, and will continue to give, the issues between the Parties appropriate care and attention. Indeed, in coming to the conclusions set out herein, it has given careful consideration to all of the submissions of the Parties, and the evidential material relied upon. To contend that an in-person hearing is necessary to *ensure* that appropriate care and attention be given to a matter is a submission that is of no assistance to the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nOn 9 April 2015, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to file a brief response as soon as possible in relation to the submissions the subject of the Claimants\u2019 letter dated 2 April 2015.\n\n28.\n\nOn 13 April 2015, the Respondent provided those submissions.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**(A) The Claimants\u2019 Request**\n------------------------------\n\n*(i) Introduction*\n------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 Request is made pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. They request that the Tribunal order the Respondent \"to take all appropriate measures to suspend criminal investigations recently initiated against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and to refrain from engaging in any other conduct which may jeopardize Claimants\u2019 rights\".1 More specifically, their Request for Relief, as set out in both Section IV of their Request and Section IV of their Rejoinder, seeks a decision providing as follows:\n\n(i) Respondent shall take all appropriate measures to suspend any investigation relating to the Investigation Order dated November 25, 2014, and any other criminal investigatory actions or criminal proceedings initiated against Mr. Georg Gavrilovi\u0107, and to suspend any other criminal proceedings or investigation related in any way to the present arbitration, until the arbitration is completed or upon a further decision of the Tribunal. [(\"Request No. 1\")]\n\n(ii) Respondent shall refrain from engaging in any other course of action which may directly or indirectly jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration, aggravate or extend the dispute, alter the *status quo*, destroy the equality of arms between the parties or threaten the exclusivity of this ICSID arbitration, including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) conducting health or safety inspections of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. in a manner and frequency that is inconsistent with the manner and frequency in which such inspections were conducted prior to the date this arbitration was commenced; and\n\n(b) publicizing any allegations of health and safety violations of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. until such allegations are proven.\n\n[(\"Request No. 2\")]\n\n(iii) Respondent shall refrain from providing any instructions or warning to potential witnesses not to communicate with Claimants or their counsel, and shall provide Claimants with written notices, in a form to be approved by the Tribunal, ensuring witnesses and potential witness that they may speak with the Claimants and Claimants\u2019 representatives, and appear as witnesses in this arbitration, without fear of reprisal from the Respondent. [(\"Request No. 3\")]\n\n(iv) Respondent shall provide to Claimants copies of all evidence collected during the course of the criminal investigation to date, and any such evidence collected in the future. [(\"Request No. 4\")]\n\n(v) Respondent shall pay all costs associated with the Tribunal\u2019s issuance of provisional measures.\n\n(vi) And any such relief as the Tribunal deems just and proper.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a71.\n\n30.\n\nThe gravamen of the Claimants\u2019 concern is summarised as follows:\n\nThis investigation, and the initiation of criminal proceedings through the Investigation Order are obviously intended to advantage Respondent in this arbitration and deprive Claimants of their right to a fair hearing. \"Evidence\" obtained by Respondent\u2019s criminal investigation authorities appears to provide the basis for its jurisdictional arguments in this arbitration. Furthermore, Respondent has used its police powers to intimidate current and potential witnesses in this arbitration.\n\nSuch egregious conduct obviously prevents Claimants from preparing their case and, if not restrained by this Tribunal, will destroy any possibility that Claimants will be fairly heard in this matter.\n\nUnder Croatian law, Respondent\u2019s criminal authorities have enormous powers to intimidate Claimants and their witnesses: Respondent may intercept and record telephone calls and emails and other electronic data of any individual or legal entity, use undercover investigators and informants, forcibly question witnesses inside and outside Croatia, and restrict or impose conditions for travel from Croatia. Furthermore, pursuant to the Investigation Order, the Respondent may arrest and incarcerate Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 for at least two years, without further notice or a trial.2\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7\u00a74-7.\n\n*(ii) Factual Background: The Criminal Investigation*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe factual background to the Request in relation to the criminal investigation is as follows.\n\n32.\n\nAs already noted,3 on 26 November 2014, USKOK issued the Investigation Order. The Investigation Order alleged that the State Attorney could show a reasonable suspicion that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 induced an \"abuse of power in the privatization process\". Those allegations concern the investments made by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 in 1991 and 1992 which are the subject of this arbitration.\n\nSee \u00a75 above.\n\n33.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, the State Attorney released to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 the material which allegedly supports the charge.\n\n34.\n\nIn essence, the Claimants contend that the material released to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 demonstrates that the investigation was commenced in response to the Claimants filing the arbitration, rather than as a *bona fide* attempt to investigate any potential crimes. It follows, the Claimants say, that the Respondent\u2019s criminal investigation, which is supported by USKOK\u2019s broad investigative powers, is being used to advantage the Respondent in this arbitration and deprive the Claimants of their right to a fair trial.\n\n35.\n\nReturning to the factual background, the Claimants point to the following facts in support of their Request:\n\n(a) While the crimes cited in the Investigation Order are alleged to have occurred in 1991 and 1992, and were the subject of civil and criminal proceedings in 1996, the first investigatory action in the criminal case file that was made available to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 took place on 23 April 2013.\n\n(b) This is more than 22 years after the alleged wrongdoing and only months after the Claimants commenced this arbitration on 21 December 2012.\n\n(c) In the letter to the Tribunal dated 28 November 2014,4 the Respondent\u2019s counsel said that the Respondent\u2019s investigation resulted from \"new evidence\", but, when the investigation commenced in 2013, the only \"new evidence\" could have been the materials filed with the request for arbitration. Other material, especially the Order of the Bankruptcy Court to submit payment to Inacomm International SA Panama dated 3 March 1992, cannot be \"new evidence\", as it has been known to the Respondent for over 20 years.\n\n(d) In these circumstances, the Claimants say that the only possible \"new evidence\" generated by the Respondent\u2019s investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is the appearance of Mr Ivica Pape\u0161, and the Respondent admits that it only found Mr Pape\u0161 after the Claimants filed their memorial on the merits, at least 10 months after the investigation commenced.\n\n(e) Mr Pape\u0161 is a convicted felon currently on probation. In 2012, he was convicted of tax fraud and abuse of power in connection with his theft of over 2 million kuna (HRK) from a Croatian company. He was sentenced to 11 months of imprisonment with five years of parole.\n\nSee \u00a75 above.\n\n36.\n\nPointing to the wide criminal investigation powers vested in USKOK under Croatian law, the Claimants contend that:\n\n(a) the Respondent is using its investigation to intimidate current and potential witnesses in the arbitration; and\n\n(b) the Respondent is using its investigation to obtain evidence in this arbitration.\n\n37.\n\nBefore turning to the Claimants\u2019 particularisation of (a) and (b) of the preceding paragraph, the Claimants contend that the powers of USKOK are extensive. They point to the availability of \"special discovery measures\" and \"precautionary measures\" and, specifically, to the availability, after the issuance of an investigation order, of a power vested in the State Attorney to request that a judge order that the suspect be put in \"investigative prison\", which may last over three years, depending on the crime of which he or she is suspected.\n\n38.\n\nAs to the alleged intimidation of current and potential witnesses, the Claimants point to various matters, including (i) the warning of potential witnesses to not speak to the Claimants and their counsel; (ii) statements by the Respondent\u2019s officials that attempts by the Claimants or their representatives to speak to persons with relevant information for the criminal proceeding (which parallels the relevant information for the arbitration) may be construed as a crime of \"influencing witnesses\"; and (iii) the commencement of the USKOK investigation, which \"by its nature is a powerful deterrent to any potential witness to give evidence contrary to the Respondent\u2019s position in the arbitration\".5\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a728.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, since the investigation has been publicised, the Claimants have experienced a reduced willingness among potential witnesses to speak with the Claimants and their representatives. Even those who have previously co-operated have been reluctant to co-operate further due to a fear of testifying because of retaliatory measures.\n\n40.\n\nThe high watermark of the Claimants\u2019 case appears to be the following:\n\nThe means by which the Respondent has attempted to gain information for its defense from potential witnesses has been particularly shocking and intimidating. One of the potential witnesses reported having been woken very early in the morning by Croatian police forces. The officers brought him to a government building in which he was interrogated by a large group of state attorneys for almost 20 hours without breaks and without food. He was denied the right to call an attorney and the interviewers refused to provide him a copy of the interrogation-protocol when the questioning ended. Before the officers permitted him to leave the premises they issued a \"warning\", saying that he \"better not get in touch with Claimants\" and \"refuse to talk to Claimants\" if he were approached.6\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a734.\n\n41.\n\nNo evidence was provided by this person, anonymously or otherwise.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants contend that these matters are such that they could be a violation of human rights, in particular Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhumane, degrading treatment or punishment. The Claimants also identify a number of cases in which Croatia has been found to have contravened Article 3.7\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a737, citing *Gladovic v Croatia,* no. 28847/08, ECHR 2011; *Testa v Croatia,* no. 20877/04, ECHR 2008; *Longin v Croatia,* no. 49268/10, ECHR 2012; *Pilcic v Croatia,* no. 33138/06, ECHR 2008.\n\n43.\n\nFurther, the Claimants contend that the inappropriate and intimidating interrogation techniques extend to what occurred during the Respondent\u2019s excessive raid at Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s factory on 21 October 2014. As to this event, they rely on the evidence of Ms Tihana Prpic Luzaic, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s head of production of semi-durable sausages and meat. Her witness statement attests to the following facts:\n\n(a) After the 13-hour long raid, the Respondent\u2019s police forces ordered her to the local police station for questioning.8\n\n(b) She was interrogated for 2 hours.9\n\n(c) She was denied defence counsel.10\n\n(d) The leading officers warned her that she had to tell them everything, and that a failure to do so would lead to liability.11\n\n(e) Further, an officer told her several times that the police had clear evidence against the Claimants and it would be better for her to tell everything immediately.12\n\n(f) At the conclusion of the interrogation, she was required to sign a \"confidentiality declaration\", the officers telling her that the contents of the interrogation must be kept secret.13\n\nLuzaic Statement, \u00a712.\n\nId.\n\nLuzaic Statement, \u00a713.\n\nId.\n\nId.\n\nId.\n\n44.\n\nAs to the use of the investigation to obtain evidence for the arbitration, the Claimants point to a number of matters, including:\n\n(a) The criminal investigation and the Respondent\u2019s defence are \"clearly linked\".14\n\n(b) Several of the Claimants\u2019 witness statements in this proceeding, including various exhibits, and correspondence from the Claimants\u2019 solicitors, form part of the criminal file.\n\n(c) The Respondent has admitted in correspondence to the Tribunal that it plans to use additional evidence from the criminal investigation in the proceeding.15\n\n(d) An analysis of the criminal investigation file discloses that the primary purpose of the criminal investigation is to support the Respondent\u2019s defence, as evidenced by the subject of the questioning of witnesses.\n\n(e) The Respondent has abused State powers by requesting documents from the Republic of Austria, which are relevant to the arbitration, and not to the criminal allegations.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a740.\n\nSee letter dated 12 December 2014 from the Respondent\u2019s to the Tribunal.\n\n*(iii) The Criminal Investigation is Without Legal Basis*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Investigation Order is invalid and does not support the criminal investigation. They assert that the Investigation Order does not set forth factual allegations or evidence that lead to a reasonable suspicion that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 committed the alleged offences.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants make this submission in reliance on evidence of Professor Davor Derencinovic, a Doctor of Law in criminal law sciences, Master of Law in criminal law sciences, a Fulbright scholar, and a university professor, with significant experience on matters related to criminology, criminal sciences, Croatian criminal law and human rights law.\n\n47.\n\nIn essence, Professor Derencinovic testifies that the Respondent has improperly issued the Investigation Order against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.16\n\nSee, especially, First Derencinovic Opinion, \u00a755; Second Derencinovic Opinion, \u00a748.\n\n48.\n\nIn coming to that conclusion, Professor Derencinovic explains that \"the Investigation Order does not meet the standard for issuing an investigation order under Croatian law, because it does not show the existence of a reasonable suspicion that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 committed the alleged crimes\".17 Further, Professor Derencinovic emphasises that the statute of limitations would have expired long before but for the State Attorney\u2019s reliance on the Act on the Abolishment of the Statute of Limitations for Crimes of War Profiteering and Privatization Crimes (the \"War Profiteering Act\"). But Professor Derencinovic explains that the retroactive exception to the rule that criminal offences must be prosecuted within a certain period of time would be restrictively interpreted, and that the Investigation Order does nothing to explain how Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s alleged crimes fall within that exception.\n\nFirst Derencinovic Opinion, \u00a756.\n\n49.\n\nFurther, the Claimants point to allegations of facts that are not relevant to the charges cited in the Investigation Order but are relevant to the Respondent\u2019s defences. The Claimants allege that their inclusion goes to its central contention that \"the true nature of the Investigation Order [is] not aimed at the *bona fide* prosecution of crimes that... Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 allegedly committed 23 years ago, but... at destroying Claimants\u2019 ability to pursue their claims in this arbitration\".18\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a768.\n\n50.\n\nAlthough an appeal by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 against the validity of the Investigation Order failed, the Claimants contend that that failure does not mean that the Order was properly issued under Croatian law. In this regard, they rely on Professor Derencinovic\u2019s testimony, including his statement that there is a \"well-established, yet extremely questionable, practice of almost unconditional judicial granting of the investigation orders issued by the USKOK\".19 The decision is also criticised for not providing any analysis of the deficiencies in the Investigation Order and its internal contradiction.\n\nFirst Derencinovic Opinion, \u00a750.\n\n51.\n\nIn short, therefore, for these reasons, the Claimants say that \"[t]he Investigation Order is not legitimate, but rather was issued to harass Claimants, their witnesses and otherwise unbalance the equality of arms in this arbitration\".20\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a775.\n\n*(iv) Factual Background: Other Harassment and Intimidation*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s harassment and intimidation has not been limited to its conduct in relation to the Investigation Order, but that conduct extends to conduct by which the Respondent subjected Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. to a vastly increased number of extraordinary health and safety inspections, including a dawn raid on 21 October 2014, to which reference has already been made.\n\n53.\n\nIn relation to the increased number of inspections, the Claimants point to the fact that there were 11 health and safety inspections in 2014, but only three, five and two in, respectively, 2011, 2012 and 2013.21\n\nSee Dabic Statement, \u00a711; Exhibit C-0199.\n\n54.\n\nIn relation to the so-called dawn raid on 21 October 2014, the Claimants contend that the raid was grossly disproportionate to the allegations. In particular, the Claimants point to Ms Luzaic\u2019s testimony that a force of 30 Croatian police officers arrived at the factory at dawn, ordered employees to stand motionless in the corner and threatened them with personal liability if requested information was not provided.22 This raid was required, the Claimants emphasise, only to pick up meat samples from the factory, a task that in the past has been undertaken by a single inspector.\n\nLuzaic Statement, \u00a7\u00a75-6.\n\n*(v) The Respondent\u2019s Harassment Drains the Claimants\u2019 Resources and Threatens the Continued Existence of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants contend that this harassment and intimidation has not only affected the procedural integrity of the arbitration, but has severely harmed the reputations of the Claimants and, if continued, will likely cause Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. severe financial distress, and may well threaten the survival of the company.\n\n56.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants point to the fact that commercial survival in the food industry depends on strong brand name and the trust of consumers in the safety of the products, all of which has been affected by the disproportionate police raid, the media coverage and the enormous harm so caused. This is particularly so given that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is the \"face\" of the Gavrilovi\u0107 brand.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants point to the fact that, particularly since the issuance of the Investigation Order, certain business partners no longer wish to be associated with the Gavrilovi\u0107 name.23 Further, there has been a significant strain on human resources and the management of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. The Claimants contend that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s \"entire management is currently working tirelessly on damage control, to the severe detriment of its normal responsibilities. The October raid alone led directly to nearly 1,200 lost man-hours\".24\n\nDabic Statement, \u00a7\u00a77-9\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a793, citing Exhibit C-0199.\n\n*(vi) The Provisional Measures Should be Granted*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal should grant the provisional measures sought to protect the Claimants\u2019 rights to: (i) the procedural integrity of the arbitration; (ii) the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute; (iii) equality of arms; and (iv) the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n59.\n\nAs already noted, the Claimants\u2019 Request is made pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Claimants contend that, as the tribunal explained in *City Oriente v Republic of Ecuador,* Article 47 of the ICSID Convention:\n\nprovides authorization for the passing of provisional measures prohibiting any action that affects the disputed rights, aggravates the dispute, frustrates the effectiveness of the award or entails having either party take justice into their own hands.25\n\n*City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00a755.\n\n60.\n\nFurther, the Claimants contend that, while Article 47 and Rule 39 use the word \"recommend\", \"it is generally recognized that arbitral tribunals are empowered under these provisions to order provisional measures with binding force and that the parties are obliged to comply with such orders\".26\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a799, citing *Tethyan Copper Company Pty Limited v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12, Decision on Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures (13 December 2012) *,* \u00a7120; *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures (17 August 2007), \u00a758; *Tokios Tokeles v Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/2/18, Order No. 1 - Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures (1 July 2003), \u00a7\u00a751-53.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimants contend that to be entitled to an order for provisional measures, a party must satisfy three requirements:\n\n(a) the party has a right (whether substantive or procedural) which can be protected;\n\n(b) the need for the provisional measures sought is urgent; and\n\n(c) the provisional measures are necessary to protect those rights.\n\n*(vii) Prima Facie Jurisdiction*\n--------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nBefore turning to these three requirements, the Claimants first address the question of jurisdiction, contending that an ICSID tribunal may recommend provisional measures even where (as here) it has yet to decide the question of its jurisdiction.27\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7102, citing *Quiborax SA Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7108.\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants contend that all that is required is that the provisions invoked appear *prima facie* to afford a basis for jurisdiction to decide the merits. To support this contention, the Claimants cite a number of authorities, including the *Case Concerning Passage Through the Great Belt*, where the International Court of Justice stated:\n\nWhereas on a request for provisional measures the Court need not, before deciding whether or not to indicate them, finally satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction on the merits of the case, yet it ought not to indicate such measures unless the provisions invoked by the Applicant appear, prima facie, to afford a basis on which the jurisdiction of the Court might be founded.28\n\n*Case Concerning Passage Through the Great Belt (Finland v Denmark)*, ICJ Order (29 July 1991), \u00a714.\n\n64.\n\nThis, the Claimants suggest, is a low threshold, which is satisfied in this case, particularly because: first, the Respondent does not contest the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione persone* or *ratione temporis* ; second, although the Parties are in dispute in relation to jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* and *ratione materiae*, *ratione voluntatis* has been established by the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration in Article 9 of the BIT; and, third, jurisdiction *ratione materiae* can be affirmed on the basis of the Claimants\u2019 submissions in their Request for Arbitration and Memorial on the Merits and their continued operation of a going-concern in Croatia.\n\n*(viii) Requirement (1): Rights to be Protected by Provisional Measures*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nAs already noted at \u00a758, the Claimants point to four rights which are to be protected by the grant of provisional measures.\n\n66.\n\nTurning first to (i) - the procedural integrity of the arbitration - the Claimants point to their right to have their claims \"fairly considered and decided by the Arbitral Tribunal\".29 Referring to *Quiborax v Bolivia*30 and *Biwater Gauff v Tanzania*,31 the Claimants point to various aspects of procedural integrity, including the access to and integrity of the evidence, the minimisation of any scope for external pressure on any party, witness, expert or other participant in the process, a level playing field and the avoidance of \"trial by media\". In particular, the Claimants refer to the tribunal\u2019s statement in *Quiborax* that:\n\n[E]ven if no undue pressure is exercised on potential witnesses, the very nature of these criminal proceedings is bound to reduce their willingness to cooperate in the ICSID proceeding.32\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7110, quoting *Plama Consortium Limited v Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order (6 September 2005), \u00a740.\n\n*Quiborax SA Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010).\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB 05/22, Procedural Order No. 1 (31 March 2006).\n\n*Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7146.\n\n67.\n\nFurther, the Claimants cite *Lao Holdings v Laos*, where the respondent similarly alleged potential criminal behaviour by or on behalf of the claimant in relation to the respondent\u2019s government officials. As in this case, Laos sought to pursue criminal proceedings arising out of the same facts and at the same time as the arbitration. Because of the direct relationship between the subject matter of the arbitration and the criminal investigation, and the timing of the investigation, the tribunal concluded:\n\n[T]he integrity of the arbitral process would be compromised by permitting the Respondent to run a criminal investigation concurrently with the arbitration directed to the same people and the same facts at the same time.33\n\n*Lao Holdings NV v The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order (30 May 2014), \u00a7\u00a737-39.\n\n68.\n\nThe tribunal identified the fact that the parallel criminal investigation would be \"disruptive\", as it would \"inevitably divert at least some of the Claimant\u2019s resources\" needed for the arbitration \"to dealing with issues arising out of police interviews with people now or in the past associated with the Claimant\".34 Further, the tribunal was there concerned that concurrent criminal investigations would have a \"chilling effect\" and constitute a \"powerful deterrent\" to witnesses giving evidence contrary to the respondent\u2019s position.35 The tribunal concluded that such domestic criminal investigations would \"aggravate the dispute, by endangering the procedural integrity of the arbitral proceeding\".36 The Claimants contend that the same conclusions follow from the Respondent\u2019s conduct in this case. Further, they say that the Respondent\u2019s actions are similar to those of Bolivia in *Quiborax*, in that the pressure placed on potential witnesses by the criminal investigation has reduced their willingness to cooperate in this arbitration.\n\nId, \u00a740.\n\nId, \u00a741.\n\nId, \u00a742.\n\n69.\n\nAs to (ii) - the aggravation of the dispute and disruption of the *status quo* - the Claimants rest their case on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which they contend is based on the principle that \"once a dispute is submitted to arbitration, the parties should not take steps that might aggravate or extend their dispute or prejudice the execution of the award\".37 It follows that the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute are rights capable of protection by provisional measures.38\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7120, quoting G Kaufmann-Kohler & A Antonietti, \"Interim Relief in International Investment Agreements\", in K Yannaca-Small, *Arbitration Under International Investment Agreements - A Guide to the Key Issues* (OUP, 2010), p 522.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7120, citing *Churchill Mining plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 9 (8 July 2014), \u00a790.\n\n70.\n\nConcerning Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., the Claimants contend:\n\nThrough the announcement of the USKOK Investigation, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is at risk of incarceration and extradition. Moreover, Respondent\u2019s continued and intensified attacks on the Claimants\u2019 business threaten the viability of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s business. Respondent\u2019s actions also create serious obstacles for Claimants\u2019 presentation of their claim and put intolerable pressure on Claimants to abandon their claims. Respondent has continued to disrespect its obligation to treat foreign investors such as the Claimants in accordance with fair and equitable treatment-standard set forth in the Treaty. As such, Respondent\u2019s misconduct constitutes (a) a gross aggravation of the dispute and (b) a departure from the *status quo* between the parties.\n\n\u2026\n\n[T]he Claimants own and operate a going-concern in Croatia which severely suffers from the Respondent\u2019s harassment. And it is not just any going-concern that is at risk, but a long lasting family tradition which is today one of the most successful meat processing businesses and one of the largest employers in the region. In addition, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and his family reside in Croatia and are fully exposed to all of the pressures resulting from Respondent\u2019s improper criminal investigation.39\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7\u00a7122, 126.\n\n71.\n\nAs to (iii) - equality of arms - the Claimants contend that equality of arms is a fundamental rule of procedure, emphasising that tribunals have the \"inherent power\" and a duty to proactively restore equality of arms if it is affected by a State which abuses its \"dual role as both equal-level party to an arbitration and, simultaneously, as sovereign State\".40\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7129, quoting T Walde, \"'Equality of Arms\u2019 in Investment Arbitration: Procedural Challenges\" in K Yannaca-Small (ed), *Arbitration Under International Investment Agreements: A Guide to the Key Issues* (OUP, 2010), pp 161-162, 180-182.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants contend that such abuse has occurred here by virtue of the Respondent having used the investigative powers of the USKOK - Croatia\u2019s most powerful investigative body - in service of evidence gathering, including interviewing potential and actual witnesses, and having circumvented the arbitration\u2019s document production processes by use of judicial assistance under EU law. Further, the Claimants particularise the following actions in support of this submission: surveillance and technical recording of telephone conversations and other means of communication, interception, gathering and recording of electronic data, and entry into the premises for the purpose of conducting surveillance and technical recording at the premises. Finally, the Claimants identify the possibility that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 may be arrested and detained at any time and held for up to three years.\n\n73.\n\nAs to (iv) - circumvention of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention - the Claimants assert that their right to international adjudication under the Convention \"to the exclusion of any other remedy\" is being infringed by the Respondent\u2019s misconduct. The Claimants point to the fact that, by investigating the alleged criminal conduct, the Respondent is raising in alternate fora the issues that are presently, and exclusively, before the Tribunal relating to the jurisdiction and admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims. That is to say, \"[i]t is evident that Respondent is using the criminal investigation to build its case on the objections on jurisdiction, thereby bringing the criminal investigation in line with this arbitral proceeding and the issues in dispute\".41\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7143.\n\n74.\n\nWhile the Claimants do not contest that the Respondent has the sovereign power to investigate and prosecute conduct within its territory that may constitute a crime if it has sufficient evidence to justify prosecution, they highlight that such prosecutorial powers \"must be exercised in good faith and with due respect for Claimants\u2019 rights\".42 The Claimants say that, as in *Lao Holdings*, this is a case which warrants a departure from the general rule entitling a state to enforce its criminal laws. Indeed, they contend this is a stronger case than *Lao Holdings,* where like relief was granted; effectively, the Claimants say, the Respondent\u2019s conduct is such to remove from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal the very subject matter of this proceeding and, in so doing, to act without due respect for the Claimants\u2019 rights.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7144, quoting *Lao Holdings NV v The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order (30 May 2014), \u00a725.\n\n*(ix) Requirement (2): Provisional Measures are Urgent*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimants note that, while there is no urgency requirement in the language of Article 49 of the ICSID Convention or Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules, previous tribunals have held that provisional measures are only appropriate if a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits.\n\n76.\n\nThey contend that Tribunals have applied a \"low threshold\" to the element of urgency and that the observation of the tribunal in *Biwater Gauff* is apposite:\n\n[T]he degree of \"urgency\" which is required depends on the circumstances, including the requested provisional measures, and may be satisfied where a party can prove that there is a need to obtain the requested measure at a certain point in the procedure before the issuance of an award.43\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB 05/22, Procedural Order No. 1 (31 March 2006), \u00a776.\n\n77.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants point to the Respondent\u2019s misconduct in threatening the physical integrity of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, the Claimants\u2019 representatives and witnesses with incarceration and extradition, any or all of which require immediate action from the Tribunal. The Claimants emphasise that the Respondent has offered no indication that it will cease what they describe as a \"campaign against the Claimants\", absent being so ordered by the Tribunal. Further, the Claimants also submit that the circumstances of this arbitration give rise to the question whether the Claimants will have the opportunity to properly present their case and whether they may rely on the integrity of specific evidence. Accordingly, the provisional measures, the Claimants contend, are intended to protect the jurisdictional powers of the Tribunal, the integrity of the arbitration and the final award, among others - it follows *a fortiori*, that such measures are \"urgent by definition\".44\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7153, quoting *Quiborax SA Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7153.\n\n*(x) Requirement (3): Provisional Measures are Necessary to Safeguard the Claimants\u2019 Rights*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe third requirement identified by the Claimants is that the provisional measures are \"necessary\" to avoid harm or prejudice being inflicted on the applicant (here, the Claimants).\n\n79.\n\nThe Claimants concede that investment treaty tribunals have taken different approaches with respect to the intensity of the harm required to justify provisional measures. Those approaches are as follows:\n\n(a) first, some earlier tribunals, including those in *Occidental* and *Plama*, applied a test of \"irreparable prejudice\", concluding that provisional measures could only be ordered if there is a threat of \"irreparable\" harm incapable of being compensated by an award of monetary damages;45 and\n\n(b) second, on the other hand, a series of recent decisions of ICSID tribunals have invoked a lower threshold and adopted a standard of \"harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages\".46 Other tribunals have required \"the existence of a risk of irreparable or substantial harm\"47 or even the lower threshold of \"a sufficient risk of harm or prejudice\".48\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation v Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures (17 August 2007), \u00a792; *Plama Consortium Limited v Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order (6 September 2005), \u00a746.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc v Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Resource\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (29 June 2009), \u00a775; *Quiborax SA Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7155.\n\n*Churchill Mining PLC & Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 & 12/40, Procedural Order No. 9 (8 July 2014), \u00a769.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB 05/22, Procedural Order No. 3 (31 March 2006), \u00a7146.\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the threat of harm to them by the Respondent\u2019s conduct is such that it meets either of these standards. Further, an order of provisional measures would be proportionate, because the Claimants\u2019 interest in such measures greatly outweighs any harm or disadvantage to the Respondent. Indeed, the continuation of the Respondent\u2019s harassment, the Claimants allege, will ultimately lead to the eradication of the investment itself. A monetary award cannot compensate such harm. Alternatively, the Claimants contend that, even if a monetary award were practicable, \"irreparable harm\" has a flexible meaning and, adopting the words of the UNCITRAL tribunal in *Paushok v Mongolia*, \"the possibility of monetary compensation does not necessarily eliminate the possible need for interim measures\".49\n\n*Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v The Government of Mongolia*, UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures (2 September 2008), \u00a768.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the approach of the tribunal in *City Oriente* should be followed. There, the tribunal held, referring to Article 17A of the UNCITRAL Model Law:\n\nIt is not essential that provisional measures be necessary to prevent irreparable harm, but that the harm spared the petitioner by such measures must be significant and that it exceeds greatly the damage caused to the party affected thereby.50\n\n*City Oriente Limited v.

The tribunal considered that the provisional measures requested by the claimant - including the stay of all proceedings affecting the claimant\u2019s offices or employees - \"are necessary to preserve Claimant\u2019s rights and the claims it has asserted\" in the arbitration.51\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7167, quoting *City Oriente Limited v The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador*), ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures and Other Procedural Matters (13 May 2008), \u00a757.\n\n83.\n\nIn particular, the tribunal found that \"pending a decision on this dispute, the principle that neither party may aggravate or extend the dispute or take justice into their own hands prevails\" over Ecuador\u2019s sovereign right to prosecute and punish crimes.52 For these reasons, the tribunal ordered Ecuador to \"take such measures as may be necessary in order that the Ecuadorian prosecutor\u2019s office will not pursue any procedures or make any inquiries that may affect claimant or claimant\u2019s offices or employees, or which may require them to make an appearance, throughout the full force and effect of this provisional measure\".53\n\n*City Oriente Limited v The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures (19 November 2007), \u00a7\u00a757, 62.\n\nId, \u00a766.\n\n*(xi) The Provisional Measures are Proportionate*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that the provisional measures are proportionate. Invoking what was said by the tribunal in *Paushok v Mongolia*, the Claimants assert that the Tribunal \"is called upon to weigh the balance of inconvenience in the imposition of the [provisional measures] upon the parties\".54\n\n*Sergei Paushok v The Government of Mongolia*, UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures (2 September 2008), \u00a779.\n\n85.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants assert that ordering the Respondent to suspend the criminal investigations against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 concerning acts that occurred more than 20 years ago and restraining further harassment or intimidation would not harm the public interest of Croatia or its citizens. A mere stay of criminal investigations does not seriously affect the sovereign rights of a state.55 The Claimants point out that the Respondent could have initiated the investigation more than 20 years ago; therefore, a decision to stay that process now has little or no impact on the Respondent\u2019s sovereign rights. Likewise, no prejudice results from prohibiting the Respondent from publicising any allegations against the Claimants until proven. On the other hand, the Claimants will suffer substantial and irreparable harm without the provisional measures.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7170, citing *Quiborax SA Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7165; *Lao Holdings NV v The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order (30 May 2014), \u00a774.\n\n**(B) The Respondent\u2019s Reply**\n------------------------------\n\n*(i) Introduction*\n------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 Request should be dismissed in its entirety. Its case is encapsulated in \u00a72 of its Reply:\n\nThere is no material risk of serious or irreparable injury to the Claimants\u2019 existing rights. Specifically, neither the First Claimant\u2019s physical integrity nor the Second Claimant\u2019s existence are at risk, nor is there any other grave threat of serious harm. The Respondent has not engaged in any intimidation or harassment of the Claimants or any witnesses. Access to and integrity of evidence is unimpaired. Equality of arms is maintained, and the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is not threatened. There is no question here that cannot await the outcome of this arbitration.\n\n*(ii) Factual Background in Summary*\n------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent identifies the two events that the Claimants rely upon to found their Request as (i) the health and safety inspections conducted at the premises of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. and, in particular, the inspection of 21 October 2014; and (ii) the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent contends that both of these events have been misdescribed and mischaracterised by the Claimants. The Respondent asserts, in summary:\n\n(a) as to (i) - the health and safety inspections - the number of health and safety inspections since the Claimant has filed its Request for Arbitration has decreased, rather than increased, and the inspection on 21 October 2014 was conducted in good faith, with respect for due process and has involved serious violations of EU health and safety laws; and\n\n(b) as to (ii) - the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, which was initiated *before* the commencement of this arbitration and is legally justified, has been conducted in good faith and does not undermine the integrity of the arbitral process.\n\n*(iii) Factual Background: The Health and Safety Inspections*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the two factual premises upon which the Claimants rely -namely that throughout 2014, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. was subjected to a vastly increasing number of health and safety inspections and that the \"dawn raid\" on 21 October 2014 was excessive - are false.\n\n90.\n\nAs to the number of inspections, the Respondent asserts that in 2012, there were 171 planned and seven unplanned inspections, in 2013, there were 88 planned and eight unplanned inspections and, in 2014, there were 24 planned and three unplanned inspections.56 The allegation is, thus, unsubstantiated and undeveloped.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a711; Exhibit R-0089.\n\n91.\n\nAs to the 21 October 2014 inspection, the Respondent states that:\n\n(a) it was a standard health inspection, ordered on the basis of an anonymous complaint;\n\n(b) the inspection was conducted in good faith and respected due process; and\n\n(c) the inspection revealed numerous breaches of EU health and safety regulations and infringements of corresponding provisions of Croatian law.\n\n*(iv) Factual Background: The Criminal Investigation*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nTurning now to the factual background to the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, the Respondent contends that the allegations made by the Claimants are also false. In this regard, the bases identified by the Claimants - each of which are contested by the Respondent - are that \"the Respondent\u2019s investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was a direct response to the commencement of this arbitration, not a *bona fide* use of police powers to investigate [crime]\" and that the \"Respondent has already used its investigat[ory] powers to intimidate actual or potential witnesses\".57\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7\u00a715, 11.\n\n93.\n\nIn relation to the former, the Respondent contends that the public prosecution service opened its inquiry into the relevant events in 2011 *before* the Claimants commenced this arbitration, on 16 November 2012. In this regard, it relies on the fact that, in 2010, with the passing of the War Profiteering Act, a complaint was received by the public prosecution service in Zagreb alleging a number of illegalities in respect of the sale of the five Gavrilovi\u0107 companies to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.\n\n94.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that it was not until early 2014 that the focus of the investigation turned to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 himself. The Respondent states that Mr Pape\u0161 independently approached the public prosecution service for the first time at around this time with information concerning the events surrounding the sale to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 of the five companies in bankruptcy. The Respondent relies, in particular, on the following summary of Mr Pape\u0161' interview:\n\nMr Pape\u0161 alleged during the interview and produced documentation confirming that, in March 1992, a couple of days after informing Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 that he had deposited DEM2,000,000 of State money [in] a bank account in Frankfurt, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 came to his house with then Minister of Finance, Mr Joso Martinovi\u0107, who requested that Mr Pape\u0161 transfer that money to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107. Mr Pape\u0161 did so.58\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a728 (citations omitted).\n\n95.\n\nThis evidence, according to the Respondent, precipitated the expansion of the inquiry and interviews with further individuals. The Respondent contends, however, that none of these witnesses who were interviewed after Mr Pape\u0161 approached the public prosecution service are among the Claimants\u2019 witnesses in the arbitration or employed by Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\n\n96.\n\nOn 25 November 2014, pursuant to Article 27(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act, USKOK issued the Investigation Decision referred to in the Claimants\u2019 Request. In this regard, the Respondent contends that:\n\n(a) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was provided with all information gathered during the inquiry;\n\n(b) the Investigation Decision was issued on the basis that there is a reasonable suspicion that: (i) as an accessory, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 induced another to commit the criminal offence of abuse of office and official authority; and (ii) as principal, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 committed the criminal offence of abuse of office and official authority;\n\n(c) the underlying facts of the investigation are set out therein; and\n\n(d) in accordance with the due process rights provided by Article 218 of the Criminal Procedure Act, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 appealed the Investigation Decision. The County Court in Zagreb held that the evidence collected during the pre-investigation stage satisfied the threshold required to establish a reasonable suspicion for the commission of the offences.59\n\nRuling of the Investigating Judge of the County Court in Zagreb, Ref No: 3 Kir-Us-551/14 (9 December 2014), Exhibit C-0201.\n\n97.\n\nIn relation to the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the Respondent has already used its investigatory powers to intimidate actual or potential witnesses, the Respondent contends that the investigation is being conducted in good faith, namely with the exclusive purpose of enforcing, and adhering to, its criminal law. By way of particularisation, the Respondent points out that:\n\n(a) it is a party to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and is committed to its enforcement;\n\n(b) the public prosecution service is duty-bound to inquire into, investigate and prosecute alleged offences where a reasonable suspicion exists that those offences have been committed;\n\n(c) the expert evidence of Professor Petar Novoselec, the former President of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Croatia and former head of the Criminal Law Department at the University of Zagreb, shows that reasonable suspicion exists and the Investigation Decision is compliant with Croatian law and European Union standards;60\n\n(d) the public prosecution has at all times protected the rights of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, which are enshrined in Croatian law.\n\n(e) the criminal investigation is legally justified because the evidence establishes a reasonable suspicion that: (i) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 induced Mr Martinovi\u0107 to commit the criminal offence of abuse of office and official authority; and (ii) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 as principal committed the criminal offence of abuse of office and official authority;61\n\nSee Professor Petar Novosalec\u2019s expert report dated 27 January 2015.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on Professor Petar Novosalec\u2019s expert report dated 27 January 2015 in this regard.\n\n98.\n\nThus, according to the Respondent, the criminal investigation respects due process, and the rights of the individuals are at all times respected. In this regard, the Respondent states that \"[t]he Claimants make outrageous and irresponsible statements about the preinvestigation stage of the proceedings, alleging that the Croatian police and public prosecution service have abused their powers to threaten witnesses and interrogate them under pressure\".62 The Respondent contends that none of these allegations is supported by any evidence.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a757.\n\n99.\n\nFurther, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 \"generalisations about the Croatian criminal justice system\".63 The Respondent describes the Claimants\u2019 appeal to the most extreme procedural measures as \"a baseless caricature\".64 In that regard, the Respondent notes that it has not sought any of the measures identified by the Claimants, namely \"special discovery measures\" or \"precautionary measures\". Specifically, in relation to the detention of a person pursuant to investigative detention, the Respondent notes that \"there is no suggestion that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is a flight-risk, or that special circumstances exist that would indicate, at this stage, that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 has or will tamper with evidence, commit a further offence, hinder the conduct of the criminal investigation, or fail to show up at a court hearing\".65 Further, given Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s age, only in \"exceptional circumstances\" would detention be appropriate.66\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7II(2)(b)(ii).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a766.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a771.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a773.\n\n100.\n\nIt bears emphasis that, with regard to the conduct of the criminal investigation, the Respondent specifically contends as follows:\n\n[T]he investigation has shown the utmost respect for Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s due process rights and, as required by the Criminal Procedure Act, will continue to do so going forward.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Criminal Procedure Act ensures that, during the questioning, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s basic rights, including his due process rights, will be respected. In particular, *(i)* prior to the questioning, the respective authority must confirm that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 has received and understood the list of basic rights provided with the Investigation Decision, *(ii)* Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s lawyer must be present at the questioning; *(iii)* the questioning must be filmed; *(iv)* Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is entitled to use notes during the questioning and must be given the opportunity to comment on all the circumstances surrounding the alleged offences and to present all the facts supporting his defence, and *(v)* following the questioning, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 must be given the opportunity to fill any gaps and remove any contradictions or ambiguities in his statement.\n\n...If charged, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is... entitled to submit an objection to the indictment within eight days from the day of its service....\n\n...[T]he only measures that could, allegedly, prevent Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 from fully participating - \"precautionary measures\" or investigative detention - will not and could not be applied, as the particular facts of the Case and Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s personal circumstances do not warrant them.67\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7\u00a758, 63, 76 (citations omitted; emphasis added).\n\n*(v) The Criminal Investigation in no Way Interferes with the Arbitration*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nBefore turning to the requirements for the granting of provisional measures, the Respondent argues that the criminal investigation will not interfere in any way with the arbitration by making the resolution of the ICSID dispute more difficult. In this regard, the Respondent makes three submissions.\n\n102.\n\nFirst, the criminal investigation does not affect the Claimants\u2019 rights to pursue this arbitration. In this regard, the Respondent asserts that any \"precautionary measures\" and investigative detention will not be applied; thus, the on-going investigation does not prevent the Claimants\u2019 participation in the arbitration. The Respondent also points to the fact that, even if charged, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 will remain at liberty for the course of the trial and will be able to fully participate in the arbitration.\n\n103.\n\nSecond, the criminal investigation does not prevent any witnesses from testifying or sharing information with the Claimants or their lawyers. Indeed, the Respondent contends that only one of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses has been interviewed, and emphasises that \"with the exception of this one witness, none of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses will be questioned during the course of the formal investigation\".68 Further, the Respondent states that individuals interviewed by the public prosecution service will be at liberty to discuss with the Claimants and their representatives everything they know about the subject matter of the arbitration; the only restriction is that those individuals are unable to discuss what was revealed to them by the public prosecution service, which given the nature of the interviews, would be limited to who conducted the interview, the documents shown and the questions asked.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a778.\n\n104.\n\nThird, the criminal investigation does not disadvantage the Claimants or advantage the Respondent. In this regard, the Respondent points to the fact that the public prosecution service has not collected any evidence beyond that which is strictly necessary for the inquiry. Further, in short, it contends that: (a) whatever may have been the case during the inquiry that led to the Investigation Decision, when the exact nature and characterisation of the offences was not known, the investigation is now limited to those alleged offences cited in the Investigation Decision; (b) the investigation and arbitration are being carried out by distinct agencies - respectively, the public prosecution service and the civil division of the State Attorney\u2019s Office - and the work of the former is confidential and the substance of its inquiries cannot be disclosed; and (c) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 has, and has already exercised, the right to request the entire case file of the investigation.\n\n*(vi) The Requirements for Granting Provisional Measures*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent notes that it is common ground that this Tribunal has power to grant provisional measures under specific conditions. It makes submissions directed to four topics.\n\n106.\n\nFirst, in relation to the legal framework, the Respondent submits that Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 govern the Tribunal\u2019s power to recommend provisional measures.\n\n107.\n\nSecond, the Respondent emphasises that the Claimants bear the burden of proof of establishing the requirements for provisional measures. In this regard, the Respondent contends that the Claimants must provide sufficient evidence to show that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction, that there is an urgent need for the requested measures and that the Claimants have a *prima facie* case on the merits.\n\n108.\n\nThird, and without prejudice to its jurisdictional objections, the Respondent does not contest that the Tribunal need not satisfy itself of its jurisdiction in respect of the merits of the dispute for the purposes of determining the Claimants\u2019 Request. Nevertheless, the Respondent points out that provisional measures are not a means to expand the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and contends that the fact that it has raised serious preliminary objections in relation to admissibility and jurisdiction is relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s exercise of discretion in relation to the Claimants\u2019 Request.\n\n109.\n\nFourth, and most fulsomely, the Respondent identifies a number of factors which inform the appropriateness (or otherwise) of provisional measures.\n\n110.\n\nThe first factor the Respondent identifies is the exceptional nature of provisional measures. The Respondent cites *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic*, where the tribunal reasoned that \"provisional measures are extraordinary measures which should not be recommended lightly\".69 The Respondent explains:\n\nThe core rationale for provisional measures is to protect the object of the litigation, i.e. the decision to be given. Neither party should render proceedings meaningless or frustrate a potential result. Those are evidently extreme situations.70\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd v The Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Decision on Provisional Measures (6 April 2007), \u00a733.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a799.\n\n111.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues that particular stringency is required where, as in this case, the jurisdiction of the tribunal has not yet been established, citing *Perenco v Ecuador*.71 It emphasises the high threshold to be met, relying on the commentary of Kaufmann-Kohler and Antonietti, who explain:\n\n[A]pplicants are faced with a high threshold when seeking to establish that the interim relief requested is urgent and needed. This may explain the reluctance of the vast majority of the tribunals to grant interim relief in the context of investor-state arbitration, whether in the ICSID system or under UNCITRAL rules.72\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd v The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Provisional Measures (8 May 2009), \u00a759.\n\nG Kaufmann-Kohler & A Antonietti, \"Interim Relief in International Investment Agreements\" in K Yannaca-Small, *Arbitration under International Investment Agreements: A Guide to the Key Issues* (OUP, 2010), p 550.\n\n112.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asserts that this stringency is further supported by the fact that the Tribunal can review any conclusion it reaches now, if relevant circumstances change.\n\n113.\n\nThe second factor to which the Respondent points is the existence of a right requiring preservation. In this regard, the Respondent emphasises that the purpose of provisional measures is to safeguard *existing* rights, not to assert hypothetical rights or prejudge the substance of a dispute.\n\n114.\n\nThe third factor identified by the Respondent is the urgent necessity to avoid irreparable harm. The Respondent contends that, consistently with the exceptional nature of provisional measures, provisional measures may only be issued if they are necessary and urgent.73 The Respondent contends:\n\nA measure is said to be necessary if it is required to avoid a party causing or threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked. Accordingly, where less intrusive relief is available, typically monetary damages, provisional measures are inappropriate.74\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7107, citing *Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7113.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7108 (citations omitted).\n\n115.\n\nFurther, the Respondent points to established international legal practice, including past decisions of ICSID tribunals, which it contends does not recognise a need for provisional measures in situations where the alleged prejudice, if established, can be readily repaired by an award of damages at a later stage of the proceedings. It quotes the *CEMEX* tribunal, which, on the basis of a survey of the relevant cases, concluded:\n\nIn the light of the preceding analysis, the Tribunal sees no reason not to retain the generally accepted standard of 'irreparable harm' as criterion for the \"necessity\" required by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.75\n\n*CEMEX Caracas Investments BV and CEMEX Caracas II Investments BV v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15, Decision on Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures (3 March 2010), \u00a7\u00a746, 56.\n\n116.\n\nIt follows, the Respondent argues, that a measure can be considered to be urgent only where the action which would irreparably harm the rights of a party is very likely to be taken before a final decision is rendered. That is, the Respondent submits that the threatened harm must be imminent, and not just theoretical.\n\n117.\n\nThe fourth factor raised by the Respondent is the fact that conducting criminal investigations is the duty of a State. The Respondent contends that \"[s]imply by virtue that they filed for ICSID arbitration, the Claimants cannot seek to prevent [the] criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, when the competent authorities have independently established that wrongful conduct is likely to have occurred\".76 Further, the Respondent submits that provisional measures in the context of domestic criminal investigation require \"special consideration\", such criminal law being an obvious and undisputed part of State sovereignty. It follows, the Respondent says, that \"the already high threshold. for recommending provisional measures is further increased in the context of criminal investigations\".77 The Respondent relies on various ICSID authorities to support this position.78\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7116.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7117.\n\nSee, eg, *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v The Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision Regarding Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures (31 July 2009), \u00a7137; *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 & 12/40, Procedural Order No. 14 (22 December 2014), \u00a772; *Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7129; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Procedural Order No. 2 (16 October 2002), \u00a736.\n\n*(vii) The Circumstances do not Justify Provisional Measures*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that the following are existing rights vested in all disputing parties and, in principle, susceptible of protection: (i) the integrity of an arbitration; (ii) nonaggravation of a dispute; (iii) equality of arms; and (iv) the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings.\n\n119.\n\nBut, according to the Respondent, there are six reasons that point against the recommendation of provisional measures in this case, each of which is set out below.\n\n**(I) The Claimants are not entitled to confidential or privileged information under the guise of a request for provisional measures**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThis contention responds to the Claimants\u2019 request that they be provided \"all evidence collected during the course of the criminal investigations to date, and any such evidence collected in the future\".79 The Respondent objects in particular to the inclusion within this category of correspondence between the Respondent and its legal counsel in the ICSID arbitration.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, Section IV, \u00a7(iv).\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent characterises the Claimants\u2019 application for such an order as, in reality, an application for disclosure, rather than a request for provisional measures. In that regard, the Respondent submits that provisional measures cannot give the Claimants more rights than they possess and can claim. More specifically, the Respondent explains that \"the Claimants have no existing right to confidential information or privileged documentation, including correspondence with counsel\".80\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7128.\n\n**(II) The integrity of the arbitral proceedings is not at risk**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nRegarding the Claimants\u2019 reliance on the threat to the integrity of the arbitral proceeding as a basis for the provisional measures, the Respondent points, as a general matter, to the fact that \"it is established tribunal practice that an exercise of the procedural power to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings is an extraordinary step that should be resorted to only if extreme circumstances have been established\".81 Further, the Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 two assertions concerning access to, and integrity of, evidence\n\n- supposed interference with witnesses and supposed efforts to improperly obtain evidence\n\n- are without merit.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7133, citing *Commerce Group Corp & San Sebastian Gold Mines Inc v Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/17, Decision on El Salvador\u2019s Application for Security for Costs (20 September 2012), \u00a7\u00a744-45.\n\n123.\n\nTurning first to access to and integrity of witness evidence, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not particularised any concrete instance of harassment, intimidation or otherwise abusive behaviour regarding actual or potential witnesses that would endanger the integrity of the arbitration. Rather, it characterises the Claimants\u2019 Request as one \"replete with unsubstantiated supposition\".82\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7136.\n\n124.\n\nIn short, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have identified no witnesses who can give evidence of such matters. Insofar as the Claimants rely on the testimony of persons such as Ms Luzaic, the Respondent points to the fact that, first, she has provided a witness statement and is not in any way prevented from participating in the proceedings, and, second and in any case, it is difficult to see how her questioning in relation to the semidurable sausage production in an unrelated health and safety matter could impair the Claimants\u2019 ability to fairly present their case in this arbitration. Further, the Respondent contends that decisions regarding provisional measures are highly context-dependent and, on this basis alone, *Quiborax* and *Lao Holdings* can be distinguished.83\n\nSee *Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7\u00a7142-146 and *Lao Holdings NV v The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order (30 May 2014), \u00a7\u00a728, 32, 37, 40.\n\n125.\n\nInsofar as the Claimants point to Croatian law and criminal procedure in support of this limb of their argument, the Respondent contends that their submissions are misleading. Two points are highlighted by the Respondent: (a) the standard instructions public prosecutors are obliged to issue to interviewees do not prevent them from appearing as witnesses or divulging personal knowledge in the arbitration - those instructions prevent only disclosure of confidential information given to him or her by the State; (b) people are invited back for interviews because information gathered in the (preliminary) inquiry stage is inadmissible in criminal proceedings, so official questioning must occur at a later point.\n\n126.\n\nAs to the independence of the criminal investigation from the arbitration, the Respondent points, again, to the fact that there is no substantiation by the Claimants of any evidence having been improperly obtained. In relation to the commencement of the investigation, the Respondent explains, as it has already, that the inquiry commenced in 2011, nearly two years before the Claimants initiated the arbitration. Further, the Respondent contends that the decisive evidence supporting the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections and the documentation relevant thereto was obtained independently from the criminal investigation and the health inspections. The Respondent identifies three sources, namely Mr Pape\u0161, the Claimants\u2019 voluntary disclosure in the course of the arbitration and the original bankruptcy file, none of which were obtained through improper use of the criminal investigative powers of the State.\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent also argues in this regard that the issues and evidence in the arbitration are not identical to those in the criminal investigation. It submits that the arbitration concerns the Respondent\u2019s purported treaty violations and the Claimants\u2019 claim for damages, while the criminal investigation is about whether Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 embezzled corporate funds and incited a government minister to abuse his position. Similarly, the Respondent contends that the core issues and arguments are distinct, pointing out that the bankruptcy irregularities at issue in the arbitration are civil law matters while the criminal investigation concerns abuse of a management position by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the criminal investigation is not, as the Claimants allege, a fishing expedition. It asserts that the asking of what the Claimants describe as irrelevant questions during the informal process is explicable on the basis that a preliminary inquiry will cover more ground than that which is ultimately the subject of a formal investigation. And, even if some irrelevant questions were asked, the Respondent submits that this cannot imply coercion, bad faith or that the rights of the Claimants are being defeated.\n\n129.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that it has always acted transparently in informing the Tribunal of its criminal investigation, including by providing the Tribunal with a copy of its letter dated 12 December 2014. The Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 argument that this letter constitutes an admission that the investigation serves the arbitration, and argues that in any event, \"even an admission that an investigation was directed at conduct relevant to a defence in an arbitration would not itself be a sufficient basis for enjoining a State\".84\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7178, citing *Lao Holdings NV v The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order (30 May 2014), \u00a729.\n\n**(III) The Investigation Decision does not affect the regular, fair and orderly conduct of this arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThird, the Respondent contends that the Investigation Decision does not affect the regular, fair and orderly conduct of the arbitration. Insofar as the Claimants contend that the Investigation Decision disrupts the *status quo* and aggravates the dispute because Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is at risk of incarceration and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. suffers threats to its continued existence, the Respondent contends that these submissions are wrong in fact and law. Before turning to those matters, the Respondent emphasises that the Claimants have not satisfied the burden of proving such egregious conduct.\n\n131.\n\nAs to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s personal integrity, the Respondent contends that the proposition that he is at risk of incarceration or personal endangerment is impossible to credit.85 The Respondent again points to the fact that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 continues to enjoy the full range of due process rights. In short, therefore, the Respondent\u2019s position is that the Claimants have not shown, and cannot show, that the Respondent has engaged in, or will engage in, the alleged harassment, intimidation, seizure or any other abusive treatment of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.\n\nAt the time of the Reply, the Respondent was able to contend that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 had not even been invited to be formally questioned, but that has now changed: see \u00a717 above.\n\n132.\n\nFurther, the Respondent points to the fact that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 has not brought any judicial review proceedings, any criminal complaints, any civil action concerning the accusations made in the Request with respect to his personal well-being or that of his family or any objection to the conduct of the public prosecution service. Notably, even though Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 brought his appeal against the Investigation Decision, he made no allegations therein about the risk of abuse that is the subject of the Request.\n\n133.\n\nInsofar as the Claimants otherwise pursue this ground, the Respondent contends that the submissions involve generalised misrepresentations of Croatian law and criminal procedure, as to which the Respondent\u2019s submissions have been summarised at \u00a7125 above.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent summarises its contentions in this regard as follows:\n\nIn sum, the Claimants have not demonstrated how the resolution of this arbitration is being made more difficult by the Investigation Decision, let alone any abusive conduct or threat to [Mr Gavrilovi\u0107's] liberty or welfare. The offences that form the subject of the investigation in Croatia are not claims before this Tribunal. They will not affect the Claimants\u2019 pursuit of their monetary claims here or the Tribunal\u2019s ability to dispose of them. Provisional measures are hence inappropriate.86\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7199 (citations omitted).\n\n135.\n\nAs to the continued existence of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. or any risk to it of substantial damages, the Respondent again points to the fact that the Claimants have not provided any evidence demonstrating that any of the Respondent\u2019s alleged actions threaten to, as they say, \"destroy the Claimants\u2019 investments\".87 The Respondent contends that:\n\n(a) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s ownership of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. and the corresponding shares is not contested, whether by the Investigation Decision, the health and safety inspection of 21 October 2014, or otherwise;\n\n(b) there is no indication that the relationship between the foreign investor and the host State will come to an end;\n\n(c) the official documentation of the Ministry of Agriculture\u2019s Directorate for Veterinary and Food Safety shows that any health and safety inspections are instances of genuine concern by Croatian authorities, and nothing more;\n\n(d) as to the Investigation Decision, there is no evidence that this will, or could, cause Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s imminent demise or seriously harm it; and\n\n(e) in any case, there is no reason why any such damage could not be compensated by an award of monetary damages.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7165.\n\n136.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. is not being intimidated, harassed or otherwise harmed. Highlighting that there is no evidence to support the Claimants\u2019 contentions, the Respondent argues that the criminal investigation is based on reasonable suspicion, that there is no basis for the allegation that the number of health and safety inspections has increased, and that the inspection on 21 October 2014 was warranted on the facts. These submissions have been summarised above. Specifically, in relation to the inspection on 21 October 2014, the Respondent further emphasises that any allegation that employees of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. were mistreated is contradicted by the fact that no complaint was made at the time.\n\n137.\n\nFinally in relation to this factor - the fact that these matters do not affect the regular, fair and orderly conduct of the arbitration - the Respondent refutes the allegation that there has been an orchestrated \"media campaign\" against the Claimants. It contends that, first, the Respondent has not publicised any information on the inspection of 21 October 2014 or the investigation, and, second, and in any case, freedom of the press is a constitutional right in Croatia and any publicity cannot be attributed to the Respondent.\n\n**(IV) Equality of arms is maintained**\n---------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the allegation that it has upset the equality of arms between the Parties. Noting that it is common ground that equality of arms denotes basic procedural fairness including equal rights to be heard and put one\u2019s case, the Respondent points to its previous submissions, summarised above, that the Claimants\u2019 capacity to argue their claims, including through witnesses, has not been effected. That leaves only what the Respondent contends is a groundless assertion of inequality derived from the Respondent\u2019s status as a State. The Claimants\u2019 factual allegations, including describing the surveillance of the Claimants as an \"open secret\",88 are not supported by evidence.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7134.\n\n**(V) The Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is not being usurped**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThis fifth point addresses the Claimants\u2019 argument that the current and future criminal proceedings should be enjoined to maintain the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings enshrined in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent contends that Article 26 protects the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to resolve the investment dispute before it. Citing various ICSID awards,89 the Respondent contends that exclusivity extends only to investment disputes and does not apply to criminal investigations. With respect to this case, the Respondent contrasts the subject matter of the arbitration, which concerns whether the Respondent has breached international obligations under Articles 2, 3(1), 4(1) and 8(2) of the BIT, with that of the criminal investigation, which concerns whether the legal and evidential requirements to charge Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 are satisfied. The Respondent further submits that, since the subject matter and facts are not identical, the evidence is also different. It follows, the Respondent contends, that the criminal proceedings initiated in Croatia do not threaten the exclusivity of the ICSID arbitration or the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\nSee *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v The Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2 (28 October 1999), \u00a723; *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 1 (1 July 2003), \u00a71; *Lao Holdings NV v The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order (30 May 2014), \u00a721; *Perenco Ecuador Ltd v The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Provisional Measures (8 May 2009), \u00a759; *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 & 12/40, Procedural Order No. 9 (8 July 2014), \u00a786; *Quiborax SA Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7129.\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that, in any case, as several ICSID tribunals have explained,90 a mere relation between criminal proceeding and an investment arbitration does not threaten the exclusivity of an arbitration. In particular, any duplicate use of materials or evidence is not improper, as the tribunal explained in *Quiborax* :\n\nEven if the criminal proceedings result in evidence that is later used by Respondent in this arbitration, that would not undermine the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to resolve the Claimants\u2019 claims, if such jurisdiction is established at the appropriate procedural instance.91\n\nSee, eg, *Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7128; *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 & 12/40, Procedural Order No. 9 (8 July 2014), \u00a785.\n\n*Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7130.\n\n**(VI) Provisional measures are neither urgent nor necessary**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nSixth, and finally, the Respondent contends that the provisional measures are neither urgent nor necessary. In short, the Respondent contends that it has not taken any on-going actions, or is not currently taking any actions, that impact the Claimants\u2019 identified rights in this arbitration. In particular, the Respondent refutes the Claimants\u2019 contention that urgency is \"satisfied easily in practice\",92 instead contending that the circumstances must be serious and extreme.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00a7148.\n\n142.\n\nIn regard to this sixth point, the Respondent makes three submissions.\n\n143.\n\nFirst, it contends that the measures requested are not required to achieve their stated aim. More specifically, the Respondent says that, even leaving aside the Claimants\u2019 failure to demonstrate substantial or irreparable harm, restraining the criminal investigation is not required to safeguard Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s physical integrity. At the time of the Reply, the Respondent also contended that there was no urgency on the basis that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 had not yet been invited for questioning. The Respondent also relies on Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed presumption of innocence and right of defence. Further, the Respondent emphasises that there are no other criminal investigatory actions or criminal proceedings initiated against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, and there is no urgency attendant to the conduct and frequency of food inspections. Insofar as any loss arises from the improper publications of allegations of health and safety violations, which the Respondent denies, damages would be adequate compensation.\n\n144.\n\nSecond, the measures requested by the Claimants would, the Respondents say, constitute a disproportionate interference with the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia. The Respondent emphasises that the balancing between the prejudice to be suffered by each party cannot be used to circumvent the particularly high threshold to be met by the Claimants, where the subject matter of the application for provisional measures is a criminal investigation. The Respondent submits that \"[a] tribunal should be mindful not to unduly encroach on State activities serving the public interest [and] [i]nvestigation and prevention of crime are paramount amongst these\".93\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7284.\n\n145.\n\nThird and finally, the Respondent contends that the measures sought are too broad and unspecific. In particular, they constitute a disproportionate interference with the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia, and any compliance would be impossible and unsafe. The Respondent points to the ambiguity surrounding what investigations or proceedings are \"relate[d] in any way to the present arbitration\" and to the imprecise and open-ended nature of the injunction sought.94 And any restraint on the Respondent providing \"instructions or warnings\" to potential witnesses would lead to the Respondent being required to violate provisions of the Croatian Constitution and basic due process requirements.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00a7287.\n\n**(C) The Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder**\n--------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nIn their Rejoinder, the Claimants further refine the focus of their application. In particular, the Claimants state:\n\nThe most important basis for Claimants\u2019 Request, is that the Respondent has, through a specialized crime unit under the auspices of the State Attorney\u2019s Office, the [USKOK] concurrently with this arbitration, conducted a criminal investigation of [Mr Gavrilovi\u0107] that is closely related to the facts of its jurisdictional objections (though those facts occurred over 20 years ago), and on November 26, 2014, issued [the Investigation Order].95\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00a73.\n\n147.\n\nPointing to the chronological order of events described in their Request, the Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s characterisation of the criminal investigation as an innocent coincidence should be rejected. Indeed, the Claimants explain that \"[m]ost tellingly, although the Respondent claims that Croatian law requires the independence of the arbitration and litigation, it appears that a State Attorney with the civil division of the State Attorney\u2019s Office working on this arbitration, and a Criminal State Attorney from USKOK were both present at at least one interrogation included in the criminal case file\".96\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00a75.\n\n148.\n\nThe Claimants maintain their position that: (a) the Respondent\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of independence should be rejected, the criminal investigation should be stayed pending the conclusion of this arbitration, and any improperly gained fruits should be made available to the Claimants; and (b) the extraordinary health and safety inspections should also be enjoined because such harassment threatens the very existence of the Claimants.\n\n149.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder is divided into two main submissions, each of which will be considered separately, namely: (i) the Respondent misstates or mischaracterises certain relevant facts; and (ii) the Claimants\u2019 Request should be granted to safeguard the Claimants\u2019 rights.\n\n*(i) The Respondent Misstates or Mischaracterises Certain Relevant Facts*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 submissions in this regard are three-fold.\n\n151.\n\nFirst, they contend that the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is directly linked to the arbitration. Indeed, they say that \"it is obvious that the criminal investigation and the arbitration are fundamentally linked\".97\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00a79.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the only fact used to substantiate the commencement of the inquiry is the file number assigned to the investigation. They emphasise the lacunae in the Respondent\u2019s evidence, namely the failure to provide the complaint that supposedly precipitated the investigation, the date it started and what, if anything occurred, between 2011 (when the file was allegedly opened) and 2013 (when the Claimants contend the first undisputed action occurred on the file). The Claimants further assert that the file itself supports the true (improper) purpose of the investigation. In this regard, the Claimants state:\n\n[T]he content of the criminal file shows that the true purpose of the criminal investigation was to gain evidence for the arbitration, rather than a *bona fide* investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 for the crimes included in the Investigation Order, as the evidence contained that file deals with issues such as the bankruptcy proceedings of the Gavrilovi\u0107 companies, and Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s payment for those companies, that are not relevant to the alleged crimes Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 committed.98\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00a712.\n\n153.\n\nFurther, the Claimants point to the fact that three additional interviewees are named in the Investigation Order, who have no knowledge of the matters raised by Mr Pape\u0161' testimony, but do have knowledge of matters related to the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. And the Claimants contend that \"most concretely... Ms Ines Videnic, a State Attorney with the civil division of the State Attorney\u2019s Office whom Respondent\u2019s counsel has copied on multiple emails to the distribution list in this arbitration, and a Criminal State Attorney Gordana Haramina Hranilovic, were both present at at least one interrogation included in the criminal case file\".99\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00a718.\n\n154.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is interfering, and will continue to interfere, with the conduct of the arbitration. They point, again, to the wide variety of investigative powers at the State\u2019s disposal, and identify one other witness extensively questioned by the State Attorney in 2014, who was a long-time employee of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. Further, in this regard, they repeat the content of their Request, insofar as they allege that (i) the Respondent has approached potential key witnesses and employees of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.; (ii) has warned them not to speak to Claimants or their counsel; (iii) under threat of criminal charges; and (iv) denied them their right to defence counsel.\n\n155.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants again contend that the Investigation Order is not justified under Croatian law; they assert that Professor Novoselec\u2019s conclusion has no merit. They further rely on the First and Second Derencinovic Opinions, which set out three matters, each of which renders the Investigation Order inappropriate, namely:\n\n(a) the Investigation Order does not set out a reasonable suspicion that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 induced an abuse of authority. The Claimants refer to the First Derencinovic Opinion, and criticise the First Novoselec Opinion as being based on the assumption or invention of relevant facts;\n\n(b) the limitation period applicable to the alleged crimes has long expired. In this regard, the Claimants again point to the First Derencinovic Opinion, contending that the War Profiteering Act would be read restrictively, and thus not retrospectively. In any case, the crimes cited in the Investigation Order do not fall within the ambit of that Act, which applies to matters that are a direct threat to independence and territorial sovereignty of the State; and\n\n(c) furthermore, USKOK does not have jurisdiction over the prosecution of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 because he is not an \"official person\", and USKOK would have power to prosecute him only in conjunction with a prosecution of Mr Martinovi\u0107.\n\n156.\n\nThird, the Claimants describe the health and safety inspections of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. as extraordinary. Two broad submissions are made in response to the Respondent\u2019s Reply, namely:\n\n(a) the Respondent cannot claim good faith for the excessive raid, it having not even attempted to explain the need for such police force. This is particularly so, the Claimants say, given the fact that the matters being investigated (namely, the so-called \"fresh return\" issue and the use of sodium nitrate in one sample) are minor. Specifically, the Claimants say that \"a force of around 30 armed policemen is clearly out of proportion for investigating such violations (even if true, which Claimants deny)\";100 and\n\n(b) the Respondent\u2019s stated number of inspections are disconnected from reality. In this regard, the Claimants seek to draw a distinction between \"ordinary\" inspections and \"extraordinary\" inspections, the latter of which has increased considerably. And any justification for the increased health and safety inspections, including any legitimate concern for food safety, is unfounded.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00a745.\n\n*(ii) The Claimants\u2019 Request Should be Granted to Safeguard the Claimants\u2019 Rights*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Claimants also make four substantive submissions in response to the Respondent\u2019s Reply, supporting their contention that the Request should be granted to safeguard the Claimants\u2019 rights.\n\n158.\n\nFirst, they contend that the Respondent proposes an improperly high standard for granting provisional measures under Article 39(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n159.\n\nBefore turning to the different approach advocated by the Claimants, some semblance of agreement between the Parties is to be found in their concession that they appear to agree that the fundamental standards that are applicable to a request for provisional measures are that they are necessary to protect the rights of the applicant, they are urgent and they are proportional. The Claimants make three specific submissions:\n\n(a) They say that the appropriate standard is \"material risk\", which is lower than irreparable harm. In this regard, the Claimants point to the recent decision of *PNG v Papua New Guinea*, where the tribunal said:\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the term \"irreparable\" harm is properly understood as requiring a showing of a material risk of serious or grave damage to the requesting party, and not harm that is literally \"irreparable\" in what is sometimes regarded as the narrow common law sense of the term. The degree of \"gravity\" or \"seriousness\" of harm that is necessary for an order of provisional relief cannot be specified with precision, and depends in part on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the relief requested and the relative harm to be suffered by each party; suffice it to say that substantial, serious harm, even if not irreparable, is generally sufficient to satisfy this element of the standard for granting provisional measures.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Tribunal is also of the view that the requesting party need not prove that \"serious\" harm is certain to occur. Rather, it is generally sufficient to show that there is a material risk that it will occur. The requirement of showing material risk does not, however, imply a showing of any particular percentage of likelihood, or probability, that the risk will materialize. The proper requirement is that the requesting party must establish the existence of a sufficient risk or threat that grave or serious harm will occur if provisional measures are not granted.101\n\n(b) Insofar as the Respondent relies on *Perenco v Ecuador*102 to suggest that \"particular stringency is warranted\", the Claimants submit that this view is not shared by other investment tribunals.103 In particular, the Claimants refer to the decision in *Caratube v Kazakhstan*, where the tribunal stated that there was \"no room\" for the approach followed in *Perenco v Ecuador*.104\n\n(c) The Claimants contend that the Respondent is wrong to argue that tribunals do not question the sovereign rights and duties of States to conduct criminal cases. Instead, the Claimants rely on *Burlington v Ecuador*, where the tribunal stated:\n\n[B]y ratifying the ICSID Convention, [the Respondent State] has accepted that an ICSID tribunal may order measures on a provisional basis, even in a situation which may entail some interference with sovereign powers and enforcement duties.105\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd v Independent State of Papua New Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (21 January 2015), \u00a7\u00a7109-111 (emphasis in Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder).\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd v The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Provisional Measures (8 May 2009).\n\nSee, eg, *Helnan International Hotels A/S v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Decision on Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (17 May 2006), \u00a727; *Phoenix Action Ltd v The Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Decision on Provisional Measures (6 April 2007), \u00a729; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ARB/01/13, Procedural Order No. 2 (16 October 2002), \u00a720 *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No 1 (1 July 2003), \u00a76; *Railroad Development Corporation v Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Decision on Provisional Measures (15 October 2008), \u00a731.\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures (4 December 2014), \u00a7108.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc v Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Resource\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (29 June 2009), \u00a766.\n\n160.\n\nIt follows, the Claimants contend, that the appropriate inquiry is not whether the requested relief interferes with sovereign powers, but the ultimate prejudice caused by such interference, compared to the prejudice the investor might suffer if the measures are not granted. They rely on *PNG v Papua New Guinea*, where the tribunal stated that \"in deciding whether to grant provisional measures, tribunals also generally look to the nature of the provisional measures that are requested, and the relative injury to be suffered by each party\".106\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd v Independent State of Papua New Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (21 January 2015), \u00a7113.\n\n161.\n\nSecond, the Claimants submit that the requested measures are urgent and necessary to protect the procedural integrity of the arbitration and equality of arms. They submit:\n\n(a) The available evidence shows that the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is not independent from the arbitration. The Claimants assert that the \"strong linkage\" to which reference was made in *Lao Holdings* is satisfied here.107 The Claimants again point to the chronological link between the commencement of the arbitration and the opening of the criminal file. They also cite the communications between the Respondent\u2019s counsel in this arbitration and USKOK regarding their concurrent cases, as well as the fact that \"there can be no legitimate disagreement that the events relevant to Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction in the arbitration, and the evidence contained in the criminal file and relied upon in the Investigation Order, are substantially similar, if not identical\".108\n\n(b) The criminal investigation has been, and may continue to be, used to interfere with witnesses. The Claimants explains that the fact that certain of the allegations are not supported by witness statements points to the threat of criminal prosecution if potential witnesses were to testify.\n\n*Lao Holdings NV v The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order (30 May 2014), \u00a737.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00a769.\n\n162.\n\nThird, the Claimants contend that the requested measures are necessary to avoid aggravation of the dispute and to preserve the *status quo*. The Claimants continue to submit that the incarceration of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 would threaten the procedural integrity of the arbitration, and say that no comfort is to be drawn from the Respondent\u2019s submissions which suggest that there is no imminent danger of his arrest. Further, the Claimants point to, as a particular of this contention, the prosecution of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and continued harassment of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. through the extraordinary health inspections.\n\n163.\n\nFourth, the Claimants submit that the Respondent is wrong to characterise the provisional measures as disproportionate and too broad. Indeed, they contend that the measures sought are narrowly tailored to address any remedial harm the Claimants have suffered due to the Respondent\u2019s actions, and avoid any future harm. In this regard, the Claimants point to the acceptance of a temporary stay of a criminal investigation in *Lao Holdings*.109 Insofar as the Claimants seek copies of all documents collected during the course of the criminal investigation, and any evidence in the future, the Claimants assert that this is to remedy past harm. Indeed, they say that this measure will restore a level playing field.\n\n*Lao Holdings NV v The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order (30 May 2014), \u00a770.\n\n**(D) The Respondent\u2019s Surrejoinder**\n-------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Overarching Submissions*\n-----------------------------\n\n164.\n\nIn its Surrejoinder, the Respondent makes various overarching submissions, namely:\n\n(a) the Claimants\u2019 Request should be seen as an attack against the Respondent to shield themselves from their own wrongdoing;\n\n(b) the alleged conduct of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 involves serious violations of Croatian law and \"[i]t is only natural, therefore, that a State governed by the rule of law investigates them\".110 The public prosecution service was duty-bound to investigate the conduct;\n\n(c) the War Profiteering Act, which was adopted in 2011, opened a wide-ranging inquiry into conduct that had occurred many years prior, during the privatisation period;\n\n(d) the Investigation Decision was issued in full compliance with Croatian law and the *acquis communautaire* of the European Union;\n\n(e) there is no substance to the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the investigation began after the Claimants commenced the arbitration;\n\n(f) being an EU Member State, the Republic of Croatia has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law and human rights; and\n\n(g) \"[c]onsidering *(i)* the seriousness of the offences for which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is being investigated, *(ii)* the respect for fundamental rights that is enshrined in the Croatian justice system, and *(iii)* the fact that criminal law and procedure are a most obvious and undisputed part of State sovereignty, the stakes in this matter could not be higher\".111\n\nRespondent\u2019s Surrejoinder, \u00a74.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Surrejoinder, \u00a713.\n\n*(ii) This Arbitration, and the Claimants\u2019 Request, was Brought Solely to Obstruct the Lawful Investigation of a Suspected Criminal*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Respondent again points to the timing of the commencement of the criminal investigation, this time to establish that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is using the arbitration to avoid criminal prosecution. According to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 Request should be viewed similarly.\n\n166.\n\nRegarding the Claimants\u2019 allegation that 20 years have passed since Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 committed the acts cited in the Investigation Decision, the Respondent points out that until the passage of the War Profiteering Act, these offences were time-barred. Further, the Respondent cites the complaints filed on 8 December 2010 by an association of former employees of the Gavrilovi\u0107 companies in which, *inter alia*, allegations of unlawful possession of State property are made. The Respondent refers to these complaints to support its chronology of events from the commencement of the criminal investigation in 2011.\n\n*(iii) The Claimants Continue to Fail to Provide any Evidence of the Alleged Urgent Need for Provisional Measures*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that, despite having had opportunities to do so, the Claimants have failed to provide any evidence demonstrating a serious risk of substantial or irreparable harm to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, the continued existence of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. or the orderly and fair conduct of these arbitral proceedings. The Respondent contends that \"[t]he reason is obvious. There is no such evidence, and the Request must fail because the Claimants have not even remotely met their heavy burden of proof\".112\n\nRespondent\u2019s Surrejoinder, \u00a730.\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent makes three specific submissions.\n\n169.\n\nFirst, it asserts that the provisional measures are not urgently needed to safeguard Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s personal integrity. The Respondent notes, in this regard, that the Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder does not dispute the availability and effectiveness of the full range of due process rights and remedies available to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107. It contends that \"[i]nstead of being genuinely concerned about any irreparable prejudice, the Claimants are, fully in line with their strategy of abusing the arbitral process as a shield from legitimate criminal investigation, simply trying to run out the clock for the criminal investigation\".113 The Respondent points to the fact that the Investigation Order expires on 25 May 2015, and alleges that the Claimants\u2019 Request is an attempt to stall the investigation.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Surrejoinder, \u00a735.\n\n170.\n\nSecond, the provisional measures are not urgently needed to save Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. from imminent ruin or substantial harm. The Respondent points again to the alleged absence of any evidence to this effect. Further, it says that the Claimants seek to reverse the onus of proof and rejects the Claimants\u2019 suggestion that the Respondent had conceded that compensable harm was caused to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. by the hygiene inspection or that the company\u2019s existence is threatened. Finally, the Respondent describes the Claimants\u2019 attempt to contest the misdemeanour charges regarding the reprocessing of certain types of meat or the contamination of food products with excessive sodium nitrate as misplaced.\n\n171.\n\nThird, according to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 \"direct link\", \"interference\" or \"procedural integrity\" argument is a meritless ruse contrived to evade lawful investigation for suspected crimes. In relation to this argument, the Respondent repeats what it has stated elsewhere in relation to, *inter alia*, the relevant timeline for the investigation and the commencement of the arbitration and the inadequacy of the Claimants\u2019 grounds for its Request.\n\n*(iv) The Balance of Convenience Cannot Substitute the Lack of Material Risk of Substantial or Irreparable Injury*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 reliance on an inappropriately low threshold for the recommendation of provisional measures should be rejected. The Respondent refers, in this regard, to its Reply, where it contended that an exceptionally high threshold to interfere with criminal proceedings is appropriate. The Respondent criticises the test the Claimants propose, suggesting that it \"would make provisional measures available in every case where an applicant is simply more inconvenienced than a respondent, irrespective of whether an issue can await a final award. This defeats the purpose of awards on the merits\".114 Further, it points to *PNG v Papua New Guinea*, where the tribunal emphasised that, \"of course, the harm alleged by the requesting party must not be purely hypothetical or theoretical\".115 In relation to that case, the Respondent cites four points made by that tribunal which support the Respondent\u2019s position, namely: (i) it considered measures unwarranted where the applicant was not even sure the alleged actions were planned; (ii) it expressly affirmed the high threshold in matters of criminal justice; (iii) it held that a connection between criminal proceeding and an arbitration was not enough; and (iv) it rejected similarly illusory allegations of harassment.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Surrejoinder, \u00a771.\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd v Independent State of Papua New Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (21 January 2015), \u00a7112.\n\n*(v) The Investigation Order is Justified Under Croatian Law*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Second Derencinovic Opinion appears to have dropped the allegation that there does not exist a reasonable suspicion that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 committed the criminal offence of abuse of official and official authority to the detriment of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. But, in any case, the Respondent contends that his opinion is irrelevant. The Respondent explains that \"[s]ince the Claimants are seeking provisional measures, the question at issue is not whether the investigation order was issued in accordance with the law (which it was), but whether there is such a risk of prejudice that the Claimants cannot await an award on the merits\".116 Further, the Respondent criticises the Second Derencinovic Opinion for raising a new jurisdictional argument and contends that, in any case, USKOK has jurisdiction to investigate the alleged crimes, relying in this regard on the Second Novoselec Opinion. Indeed, the Respondent relies upon that opinion to undermine the evidence offered by the Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr Derencinovic. In short, based on the Second Novoselec Opinion, the Respondent contends that the Investigation Order issued against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was in full compliance with Croatian and European standards.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Surrejoinder, \u00a776.\n\n*(vi) The Claimants\u2019 Manipulation of these Arbitral Proceedings Causes Prejudice to the Respondent and Should be Remedied*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 Request is an abuse of process and seeks the entirety of its costs of defending it.\n\n**(E) Further Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n*(i) The Claimants\u2019 Letter Dated 2 April 2015*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nOn 2 April 2015, the Claimants, ostensibly for the purpose of making submissions as to the appropriateness, or otherwise, of an oral hearing, made further substantive submissions to the Tribunal. Therein, they submit that:\n\n(a) the Respondent has not presented any evidence or testimony of any investigatory acts prior to April 2013 that could have alerted the Claimants to this existence of the investigation before this arbitration was commenced in December 2012;\n\n(b) the Respondent is wrong to say that the criminal investigation had to be completed within six months, as this deadline can be extended by one year, pursuant to Article 229(1) of the Croatian Criminal Procedure Act;\n\n(c) the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the requested provisional measures are inappropriate because Croatia \"has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, and human rights\" should be rejected. The Claimants refer to the latest *Global Corruption Barometer* by Transparency International, a global anti-corruption NGO, in which 70% of survey participants believe that the Croatian judiciary is \"corrupt\" or \"extremely corrupt.\" According to the Claimants, the poor state of the justice system in Croatia is further reflected in the *Global Competitiveness Report 2014-2015* of the World Economic Forum, in which Croatia ranks 100th out of 144 countries in judicial independence, behind Bolivia - which was ordered to suspend criminal proceedings until completion of the arbitration in *Quiborax117* - and Laos - which was ordered to suspend criminal proceedings by the tribunal in *Lao Holdings*.118\n\n*Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010).\n\n*Lao Holdings NV v The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order (30 May 2014).\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimants also point to two further factual developments since the filing of the Claimants\u2019 Request that they consider support their position. First, they noted that a potentially important witness had been interviewed as part of the investigation, yet the statement was not in the criminal file. Second, one of the two misdemeanor charges that resulted from the police raid on 21 October 2014 was dismissed by the Misdemeanor Court of Sisak.\n\n*(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Letter Dated 13 April 2015*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent characterises the five matters raised in the Claimants\u2019 correspondence dated 2 April 2015 as being \"unsubstantiated allegations\", \"false and misleading\" and, indeed, not supporting the need or urgency for provisional measures. The Respondent makes five brief submissions:\n\n(a) first, it matters not whether the Claimants were aware of the criminal investigation from 26 November 2014, or earlier - rather, what matters is the fact that the investigation was started before the Claimants commenced the arbitration, thus showing the \"fiction\" that the State is responding to the arbitration by commencing a criminal investigation;\n\n(b) second, while a twelve month extension of the criminal investigation may be granted, this would demand an especially complex case and the approval of the Public Prosecutor General of the Republic of Croatia, such approval not being guaranteed;\n\n(c) third, the Claimants\u2019 reliance on what the Respondent describes as internet opinion polls and surveys is of no utility and, in any case, the EU Commission has observed that Croatia enjoys \"efficient, effective and unbiased investigation, prosecution and court rulings in organised crime and corruption cases at all levels\";119\n\n(d) fourth, the Claimants\u2019 reliance on the fact that one of the misdemeanour charges brought after Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. failed a standard hygiene inspection was dismissed on procedural grounds is irrelevant. Indeed, the Respondent points to the ruling as evidence that Croatia has an independent and functioning judiciary; and\n\n(e) fifth, the Respondent notes that the Claimants have decided to not defend their misrepresentations, other than by issuing bare denials. This, the Respondent says, is in marked contrast to the Respondent, who has provided specific and substantiated responses to the Claimants\u2019 misstatements in the Surrejoinder and elsewhere.\n\nEU Commission, *Monitoring Report on Croatia\u2019s Accession Preparations* (26 March 2013), \u00a75.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n178.\n\nHaving carefully considered the submissions of the parties, the Tribunal has decided to deny the Claimants\u2019 Request.\n\n179.\n\nDespite the length of the submissions, and extensive material, filed on behalf of each Party, the ultimate resolution of the Claimants\u2019 Request turns on various discrete issues as part of a careful analysis of the material in relation to what, for the most part, are accepted principles. Insofar as any of the arguments summarised above are not referred to below, that should not be taken to mean that the argument has not been considered. Rather, all arguments have been considered, and the analysis that follows is intended to set out the reasoning of the Tribunal so as to explain the basis of its decision, rather than reciting its consideration of each and every argument. Not only is this sufficient, but it is appropriate where there is, at least in the view of the Claimants, an urgency attendant to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of this application.\n\n180.\n\nBefore turning to the reasons for the Decision, it is necessary to put to one side some preliminary matters, namely jurisdiction and the appropriate standard to be applied.\n\n**(A) Jurisdiction**\n--------------------\n\n181.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal has no hesitation in confirming its jurisdiction to hear, and determine, the Claimants\u2019 Request. While acknowledging that the Respondent has made various jurisdictional and admissibility objections, each of which will be considered at the hearing on preliminary objections and the merits in March 2016, those objections do not prevent the consideration by the Tribunal, and its consideration now, of a request for provisional measures. An ICSID tribunal may recommend provisional measures even where it is yet to decide the question of its jurisdiction.120\n\n*Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7105.\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimants contend, and the Tribunal accepts, that all that is required is that the provisions invoked appear *prima facie* to afford a basis for jurisdiction to decide the merits. While the Tribunal is not, of course, finally satisfied that it has jurisdiction on the merits of the case, it is satisfied that the provisions invoked by the Claimants are such that this Tribunal has the requisite *prima facie* jurisdiction. Indeed, the Respondent does not strongly contend otherwise. It does submit, by reference to *Perenco v Ecuador*,121 that particular stringency is required where the question of jurisdiction is yet to be determined. However, the matters relied on in support of that argument, including the writing of Kaufmann-Kohler and Antonietti,122 are matters which the Tribunal considers are appropriately considered in exercising the discretion to recommend provisional measures, rather than in shutting an applicant for interim relief out as a jurisdictional matter. While the Tribunal notes, as the Claimants have, that there is some doubt as to whether the caution expressed by the tribunal in *Perenco* is correct, it is unnecessary to determine that question here. Even when \"particular stringency\" is applied, it is plain to the Tribunal that it is empowered to consider the questions raised by the Claimants\u2019 Request. (The Tribunal does, in any case, note that the weight of authority does appear to disfavour the approach in *Perenco*,123 but it need not form a final view on this question.)\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd v The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Provisional Measures (8 May 2009), \u00a759.\n\nG Kaufmann-Kohler & A Antonietti, \"Interim Relief in International Investment Agreements\", in K Yannaca-Small, *Arbitration Under International Investment Agreements - A Guide to the Key Issues* (OUP, 2010), p 522.\n\nSee, eg, the decisions cited by the Claimants at \u00a715959(b) above, especially *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures (4 December 2014), \u00a7108.\n\n183.\n\nSo, therefore, it is clear that the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide a sufficient basis for the existence of the Tribunal\u2019s power to decide the questions the subject of the Claimants\u2019 Request.\n\n**(B) The Appropriate Standard**\n--------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe second preliminary matter is the appropriate test to be applied. The Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, in particular, showed a sharp distinction in the test said to be applicable to the question of the appropriateness of a recommendation of provisional measures.\n\n185.\n\nWhile it is right to say, as the Claimants acknowledged, that the Parties agree on the fundamental standards that are applicable to a request for provisional measures, namely that such measures are necessary to protect the applicant\u2019s rights, are urgent and are proportional, the schism appears when one considers where the threshold is to lie.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimants, on the one hand, contend that the standard is one of \"material risk\". The Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the appropriate standard is one of \"irreparable harm\".\n\n187.\n\nIt is again correct, as the Claimants note, that some ICSID tribunals have utilised terminology suggestive of a lower standard. Indeed, the Claimants place significant reliance on the recent decision of *PNG v Papua New Guinea*, where the tribunal used language suggestive of a distinction between a higher threshold of \"irreparable\" harm and a lower, and preferable one, in their view, of some \"serious harm\".124 More fully, the tribunal explained that, as will be recalled, \"the term 'irreparable' harm is properly understood as requiring a showing of a material risk of serious or grave damage to the requesting party, and not harm that is literally 'irreparable' in what is sometimes regarded as the narrow common law sense of the term. The degree of 'gravity' or 'seriousness\u2019 of harm that is necessary for an order of provisional relief cannot be specified with precision, and depends in part on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the relief requested and the relative harm to be suffered by each party\". The tribunal continued, \"suffice it to say that substantial, serious harm, even if not irreparable, is generally sufficient to satisfy this element of the standard for granting provisional measures\".125\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd v Independent State of Papua New Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (21 January 2015), \u00a7109.\n\nId.\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent contends that this threshold is insufficiently discerning.\n\n189.\n\nIt is not necessary in this case to set out the test that would apply in all cases of requests for provisional measures. One must ascertain what test is appropriate in the circumstances of a case, such as this, where the relief sought would interfere with the exercise of a sovereign State\u2019s rights and duties to investigate and prosecute crime.\n\n190.\n\nNo doubt, it was this concern which underlay the approach of the tribunal in *Caratube v Kazakhstan*, where it explained:\n\nThis Tribunal feels that a particularly high threshold must be overcome before an ICSID tribunal can indeed recommend provisional measures regarding criminal investigations conducted by a state.126\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures (4 December 2014), \u00a7137.\n\n191.\n\nIt is trite to say that criminal law and procedure are a most obvious and undisputed part of a State\u2019s sovereignty. That (trite) fact supports the approach adopted here by the Tribunal, namely that any obstruction of the investigation or prosecution of conduct that is reasonably suspected to be criminal in nature should only be ordered where that is absolutely necessary. As will be seen, this is not such a case.\n\n**(C) Findings**\n----------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimants identify four rights as the basis for their Request, namely: (i) the procedural integrity of the arbitration; (ii) the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute; (iii) equality of arms; and (iv) the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent accepts that these rights, if relevantly infringed, are rights capable of protection by provisional measures.\n\n193.\n\nBefore turning to those rights, it is necessary to return to the factual background in some more detail, so as to expound upon the underlying basis for the Claimants\u2019 Request. In so doing, the Tribunal will make some findings which support its conclusions.\n\n194.\n\nAs is apparent from the submissions summarised above, the factual sub-stratum encompasses two distinct aspects: (a) the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107; and (b) the health and safety inspections of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. Each is dealt with in turn now.\n\n*(i) The Criminal Investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nAs noted at the outset of the Parties\u2019 respective submissions, the gravamen of the Claimants\u2019 case for provisional measures rests on their allegation that this investigation, and the initiation of criminal proceedings through the Investigation Order, is intended to advantage Respondent in this arbitration and deprive Claimants of their right to a fair hearing. The Claimants\u2019 submission is not supported by the evidence.\n\n196.\n\nTrue it is that the Claimants point to a number of facts which suggest that there is more than coincidence between the initiation of this arbitration and the commencement of the investigation, or at least the time when substantive actions were taken, but, even taking these matters together, the Tribunal cannot reach the conclusion that the criminal investigation is being used as a vehicle through which to assist it in this arbitration.\n\n197.\n\nTaking the Claimants\u2019 case at its highest, and assuming that the criminal investigation did commence after the Claimants initiated this arbitration, the Tribunal considers that this fact would still have to be seen against the backdrop of the serious criminal allegations made against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107. Trite though it is to say that States have the power, indeed duty, to investigate criminal conduct, this is an important contextual factor.\n\n198.\n\nIn May 2011, when the War Profiteering Act enabled the prosecution of persons who had committed crimes as early as the 1990s by extending the limitation period, the Croatian State was empowered to investigate crimes which form part of that State\u2019s law. It was not required to have regard to the fact that an alleged perpetrator was in dispute with the State about commercial matters which are related to those alleged crimes. While, of course, the investigation could not be *used* for the sole or predominant purpose of advantaging Croatia in this arbitration, a fact which, if found, would satisfy the high threshold of an application of this type, this Tribunal should be slow to interfere with the Respondent\u2019s rights (and duties) to enforce its own criminal law.\n\n199.\n\nA further prong to the Claimants\u2019 argument is that the Investigation Order itself is invalid. In this regard, it will be recalled that the Claimants rely on the evidence of Professor Derencinovic to establish that the Investigation Order does not meet the standard for issuing an investigation order under Croatian law on the basis that it does not show the existence of reasonable suspicion that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 committed the alleged crimes.127\n\nSee \u00a7\u00a746-50 above.\n\n200.\n\nProfessor Novoselec, the Respondent\u2019s expert on Croatian law, opines to the contrary, concluding that the Investigation Order is, in fact, valid.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it unnecessary, for the purposes of this application, to opine on this dispute in the evidence. This is so because it is satisfied that, where the Croatian courts have decided on the validity of the Investigation Order, it would be inappropriate, absent manifest error, to conclude that the judicial determination of the validity of the Investigation Order should be ignored, as the Claimants would have it.\n\n202.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the fact that an appeal by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 against the validity of the Investigation Order failed does not necessarily mean that the order was properly issued under Croatian law standards. This may be so. However, where, as here, there is a conflict in the evidence of two experts, and no manifest error in the decision itself, the Tribunal cannot be satisfied of the allegation of invalidity. The submission, premised on the evidence of Professor Derencinovic\u2019s evidence that there is a \"well-established, yet extremely questionable, practice of almost unconditional judicial granting of the investigation orders issued by the USKOK\",128 does not assist the Tribunal. Indeed, the Claimants appear, on one hand, to criticise the Croatian judicial system (as here) but, where the decision is favourable (as is the case with respect to the recent dismissal of one of the two misdemeanour charges), to embrace that same system.\n\nFirst Derencinovic Opinion, \u00a750.\n\n203.\n\nLeaving the issue of the validity aside, the Tribunal accepts that even if a valid Investigation Order were in place, it could, albeit only in narrow circumstances, support an application for provisional measures. The Claimants allege that it was issued to harass the Claimants, their witnesses and otherwise unbalance the equality of arms in this arbitration. But this Tribunal cannot be satisfied that the harassment and inequality of arms alleged is established by the evidence.\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 evidence on such matters is insufficient. While the submissions allege instances supporting such a conclusion, the Claimants suggest, implicitly in places and explicitly in others, that the reason for that absence of evidence is the fear preventing people from speaking to the Claimants and their representatives. But that leaves the Tribunal in a difficult position. It can, indeed must, act on evidence, and not on speculation or conjecture. Perhaps it would be unsurprising that no witnesses would come forward if the Claimants\u2019 (unfounded) allegations are true, but there must be sufficient evidential foundation to support the relief sought, which is not the case here.\n\n205.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal is not satisfied of the factual findings the Claimants wish it to make in relation to the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.\n\n*(ii) The Health and Safety Inspection of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe second factual basis for the Claimants\u2019 Request is the pressures placed on Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. and, by necessity, also Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, in the form of health and safety inspections, particularly the \"raid\" on its factory on 21 October 2014. The Claimants contend that such inspections are intended to place pressure on the Claimants, and, again, to benefit the Respondent in this arbitration.\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimants point to the evidence of various employees of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. in relation to, particularly, the \"raid\" on 21 October 2014. Indeed, Ms Luzaic refers, in the evidence summarised at \u00a742 above, to her treatment at the hands of the relevant officers on that occasion. Taking her evidence at its face value, however, the Tribunal remains unsatisfied of that which the Claimants must establish, namely that that raid was directed at infringing the rights of the Claimants in respect of this arbitration. Such a finding is a metaphorical bridge too far, and would require giving more weight to the evidence of those called on behalf of the Claimants than is warranted.\n\n208.\n\nAs to the number of health and safety inspections since the Claimant has filed its Request for Arbitration, the Parties present differing pictures. The Claimants claim that there has been a marked increase, particularly in 2014. The Respondent, on the other hand, says that the number of inspections has decreased, rather than increased, and that inspections have uncovered serious violations of EU health and safety laws. Interestingly, for the first time, in their Rejoinder, the Claimants seek to explain the decrease identified by the Respondent as being based on a distinction between \"ordinary\" and \"extraordinary\" inspections.\n\n209.\n\nBe that as it may, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to decide between the two versions. What is required is, however many inspections have occurred, that there is some malicious intent on the part of the Respondent (namely, that the inspections are used to put improper pressure on the Claimants). The Tribunal cannot be satisfied of that intent.\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimants also rely on the publicity generated by the inspections, and its consequent effect on the reputation of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. But the Respondent, not unreasonably, points to the fact that it has no control of what is publicised by media outlets in Croatia. Absent some link between the conduct of the Respondent and that publicity, by way of some illegal disclosure of information, of which there is none, this additional basis provides no assistance to the Claimants.\n\n*(iii) Conclusion*\n------------------\n\n211.\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, having regard to the evidential material provided by the Claimants to support their Request, the Tribunal simply cannot be satisfied that the high threshold necessary to found the relief sought has been met.\n\n212.\n\nThat conclusion is fatal to the Claimants\u2019 Request. That is, having so concluded, the Tribunal must dismiss the Claimants\u2019 Request.\n\n213.\n\nIt may nevertheless be useful to the Parties, especially the Claimants, to understand why, having regard to these findings, the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the provisional measures are urgent and necessary to safeguard the Claimants\u2019 rights must be rejected. It is to that question to which attention now turns.\n\n**(D) Are the Provisional Measures Urgent and Necessary to Safeguard the Claimants\u2019 Rights?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Request No. 1: Stay of the Criminal Investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nBy Request No. 1, the Claimants seek the following order:\n\nRespondent shall take all appropriate measures to suspend the [Investigation Order] and any other criminal proceedings initiated against Mr. Georg Gavrilovi\u0107, and to suspend any other criminal proceedings or investigation related in any way to the present arbitration, until the arbitration is completed or upon a further decision of the Tribunal.\n\n215.\n\nHaving concluded that the Claimants have failed to convince the Tribunal that the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is improper, or being conducted improperly, there is no basis for this relief.\n\n216.\n\nIt bears emphasis, again, that what is being sought is a restraint on the sovereign power of Croatia to investigate crimes against its law within its territory. To meet the threshold, the Tribunal would need to be satisfied that the conduct of a government agency, charged with investigating criminal offences, was improper. It should be slow to come to that conclusion. The Tribunal cannot here.\n\n*(ii) Request No. 2: Injunction to Protect Integrity of the Arbitration and Equality of Arms*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nBy Request No. 2, the Claimants seek the following order:\n\nRespondent shall refrain from engaging in any other course of action which may directly or indirectly jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration, aggravate or extend the dispute, alter the *status quo*, destroy the equality of arms between the parties or threaten the exclusivity of this ICSID arbitration, including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) conducting health or safety inspections of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. in a manner and frequency that is inconsistent with the manner and frequency in which such inspections were conducted prior to the date this arbitration was commenced; and\n\n(b) publicizing any allegations of health and safety violations of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. until such allegations are proven.\n\n218.\n\nRequest No. 2 depends on a finding that the health and safety inspections and/or impugned publicity are such as to have an effect on this arbitration. The Tribunal, for the reasons already explained, cannot be so satisfied.\n\n219.\n\nWhile the rationale for respect for the sovereignty of a State\u2019s criminal jurisdiction is perhaps not as strong with respect to the issue of health and safety inspections, it is nevertheless relevant to consider that those governmental agencies charged with regulating this field perform a very important function. For the Tribunal to interfere with that function would need clear evidence of the use of that vehicle in such a way to achieve an ulterior, and improper, purpose.\n\n*(iii) Request No. 3: Injunction in Relation to Contact with Witnesses*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nBy Request No. 3, the Claimants seek the following order:\n\nRespondent shall refrain from providing any instructions or warning to potential witnesses not to communicate with Claimants or their counsel, and shall provide Claimants with written notices, in a form to be approved by the Tribunal, ensuring witnesses and potential witness that they may speak with the Claimants and Claimants\u2019 representatives, and appear as witnesses in this arbitration, without fear of reprisal from the Respondent.\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimants here seek careful regulation of the criminal investigation by the Tribunal. Even assuming that the Tribunal were willing to assume the obligations the Claimants wish to confer upon it by this (mandatory) order, there would be a risk that such an order would interfere with what is otherwise a valid criminal investigation. As such, the Tribunal considers that the appropriate arbiter of the form of notices, if any, to be given to particular witnesses is a matter for Croatian officials. It would be inappropriate to grant an injunction ordering the Respondent, or indeed any party, to comply with the law.\n\n222.\n\nInsofar as threats are said to be made to prospective witnesses, the Tribunal is not satisfied on the evidence that such threats have been, or will, be made. As explained above, there is not a proper evidential basis for such a conclusion.\n\n*(iv) Request No. 4: Access to Documents Related to the Criminal File*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nBy Request No. 4, the Claimants seek an order that:\n\nRespondent shall provide to Claimants copies of all evidence collected during the course of the criminal investigation to date, and any such evidence collected in the future.\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is unnecessary for the safeguard of the Claimants\u2019 rights to ensure that such documents, insofar as they are relevant to this arbitration, be provided by way of a provisional measure.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal makes two observations in this regard:\n\n(a) first, insofar as the criminal file contains documents that are relevant to this arbitration and are within the scope of any disclosure ordered, the Tribunal would expect that the Respondent would, of course, disclose those documents; and\n\n(b) insofar as the Respondent comes under an obligation under *Croatian criminal law and procedure* to disclose the documents related to the criminal file, that is a matter for the Croatian authorities in whom that duty vests. Of course, the Tribunal would expect that the Respondent\u2019s agencies would comply with Croatian law in this regard and, in any case, insofar as there was some failure to so comply, the Claimants have redress as a matter of Croatian law.\n\n226.\n\nOne specific matter in this regard must be mentioned. It will be recalled that, in their letter dated 2 April 2015, the Claimants indicated that a potentially important witness had been interviewed as part of the investigation, yet the statement was not in the criminal file. The Tribunal makes no order in relation to this allegation, it not being sought, nor being supported by any specific request for relief in the nature of discovery.129 If the Claimants\u2019 characterisation of Croatian criminal law and procedure is correct, presumably they will be able to rely on their rights thereunder to seek access to this document. It would be inappropriate for this Tribunal to say any more.\n\ncf. \u00a7(iv) of the relief sought refers generally to documents in the criminal file, not identifying this statement specifically.\n\n**(E) Costs**\n-------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Respondent has been successful in its opposition to the Claimants\u2019 Request. In those circumstances, it seeks an order that the Claimants bear all costs incurred in connection with the Claimants\u2019 Request on an indemnity basis, including, but not limited to, legal fees and expenses.\n\n228.\n\nNo submissions have been made by any of the Parties on the issue of costs. The Tribunal considers it unnecessary to decide this issue at this point in time. In those circumstances, it is appropriate that the issue of the costs of, and incidental to, the Claimants\u2019 Request, be reserved.\n\n229.\n\nThe Parties will be invited, if they so wish, to make submissions regarding the costs of the Claimants\u2019 Request at a later stage, before the Tribunal decides the question of the costs of the arbitration.\n\n**(F) Concluding Remarks**\n--------------------------\n\n230.\n\nIf circumstances arise which the Claimants consider impede the arbitration in any way or prevent the Claimants from presenting their case, the Claimants may renew their application for provisional measures.\n\n231.\n\nIt is noteworthy, however, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, that, in the course of its submissions, the Respondent has acknowledged a number of matters of Croatian criminal law and procedure, which will govern the future conduct of the Respondent in the course of its investigation. Indeed, further, it has specifically relied upon Croatia\u2019s status as a member of the European Union in seeking to defeat the Claimants\u2019 Request. That contention should be set out here in full:\n\nThe Republic of Croatia is an EU member State which, as required for EU membership, has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. The independence of the Croatian judiciary is guaranteed by the Constitution, as are the protection of fundamental rights. These rights are further underpinned by the international conventions to which the Republic of Croatia is a signatory, not least of which is the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.130\n\nRespondent\u2019s Surrejoinder, \u00a712.\n\n232.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal points especially to the following assertions set forth in the Respondent\u2019s submissions:131\n\n(a) the Respondent will continue to respect Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s due process rights;\n\n(b) under the Criminal Procedure Act, during any questioning of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, his basic rights will be respected, including, but not limited to, the respective authority confirming that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 has received and understood the list of basic rights provided with the Investigation Decision, his lawyer being present at the questioning, the questioning being filmed, his entitlement to use notes and to present all the facts supporting his defence and, following the questioning, he must be given the opportunity to fill any gaps and remove any contradictions or ambiguities in his statement;\n\n(c) the present circumstances are such that \"precautionary measures\" or investigative detention will not and could not be applied;\n\n(d) the criminal investigation does not prevent any witnesses from testifying or sharing information with the Claimants or their lawyers (save that those individuals are unable to discuss information *revealed* to them by the public prosecution service); and\n\n(e) the public prosecution service has not (and the Tribunal assumes will not) collect any evidence beyond that which is strictly necessary for the inquiry.\n\nSee further, \u00a7\u00a7 100, 103 and 104 above.\n\n233.\n\nNo undertakings have been given in this regard by the Respondent (a point noted by the Claimants), but the Tribunal is confident that, as a nation State and a member of the European Union, the Respondent will comply with its obligations under Croatian, European and other law.\n\n234.\n\nThe Claimants, of course, have liberty to apply to this Tribunal if they consider that the confidence so reposed in the Respondent by the Tribunal is not met by appropriate conduct on the Respondent\u2019s part (whether as part of the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, the health and safety inspections of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o or otherwise). In such circumstances, the Claimants may, of course, return to this Tribunal to seek further relief.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n235.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal refuses the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n236.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal decides:\n\n(1) The Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures dated 15 December 2014 is refused.\n\n(2) Any decision regarding the costs incurred during this procedure on provisional measures is reserved."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Respondent's Request", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2018-04-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent's Request\n------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration arises out of the alleged investments of Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107, a national of Austria, and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., a company organised under the laws of Croatia (together, the \"**Claimants**\"), in the Republic of Croatia (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Croatia**\") (collectively, with the Claimants, the \"**Parties**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, the Claimants commenced this arbitration under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Croatia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 1 November 1999 (the \"**BIT**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Preliminary Objections was filed on 31 October 2014.\n\n4.\n\nThe substantive hearing of the issues for determination in this arbitration was held in March 2016. A hearing following the submission of post-hearing briefs was held in September 2016.\n\n5.\n\nThe parties were informed in March 2018 that the Tribunal expected that the award may be issued in a few months.\n\n6.\n\nThis Decision sets out the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of, and decision in respect of, the Respondent\u2019s request to fix a schedule for pleadings on its \"supplementary preliminary objections\" raised by letter of 4 April 2018 (the \"**Request of 4 April 2018**\").\n\n7.\n\nFor the reasons in Section IV below, the Tribunal has decided to dismiss the Respondent\u2019s Request of 4 April 2018, and, therefore, it will not fix a schedule for pleadings concerning the same.\n\n**II. RELEVANT PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 4 April 2018, the Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal to draw attention to the ruling of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"**CJEU**\") in Case C-284/16 *Slowakische Republik (Slovak Republic) v Achmea B.V.* (\"***Achmea***\"), and raise supplementary preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims. Accordingly, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal fix a schedule for the Respondent\u2019s supplementary preliminary objections.\n\n9.\n\nAt the invitation of the Tribunal, on 11 April 2018, the Claimants submitted a letter to the Tribunal in response, asking that the Respondent\u2019s request be dismissed and providing short submissions in support.\n\n10.\n\nOn 14 April 2018, the Respondent submitted a further letter in support of what it characterised as its request to fix a schedule for pleadings on its supplementary preliminary objections.\n\n11.\n\nAt the invitation of the Tribunal, on 20 April 2018, the Claimants submitted comments on the Respondent\u2019s letter of 14 April 2018.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Request of 4 April 2018**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the ruling of the CJEU in *Achmea* is \"a new circumstance of a fundamental nature that will decisively affect the outcome of this arbitration\" that calls for further submissions by the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent states that in *Achmea* the CJEU ruled \"that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union precludes provisions in an international agreement concluded between EU Member States under which an investor from one of those Member States may bring arbitral proceedings against the other Member State.\"\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the judgment of the CJEU was unknown to the Tribunal and the Respondent before 6 March 2018, and the Parties could not have addressed it in their earlier case presentations.\n\n15.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to fix a schedule for pleadings limited to the Respondent\u2019s supplementary preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims, including pursuant to Article 11(2) of the BIT.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Response of 11 April 2018**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent\u2019s request of 4 April 2018 should be dismissed, as it was raised too late in the proceedings and was based on a \"gross misinterpretation of the reach and effect\" of the *Achmea* decision.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, first and foremost, the ICSID Arbitration Rules require that jurisdictional objections must be raised as early as possible, but no later than the expiration of the time limit for the filing of the Counter-Memorial. According to the Claimants, because the Respondent failed to raise any European Union law related objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in compliance with this provision, it should now be barred from doing so.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the jurisdictional objections related to the EU law compatibility of certain elements of investor-State arbitration were not previously \"unknown\" to the Respondent, and have been raised in numerous cases over the past 10 years. Rather, the Claimants posit that the Respondent \"simply decided not to plead EU law related preliminary objections in this case.\"\n\n19.\n\nFurther, the Claimants contrast the situation in *Achmea* with that in the present case, where the relevant State measures and the filing of the Request for Arbitration predate Croatia\u2019s accession to the EU on 1 July 2013. According to the Claimants, it is well established that the CJEU has no jurisdiction to interpret EU law in matters where the facts arose prior to a country\u2019s accession, such that EU law, including the ruling in *Achmea*, have no application here.\n\n20.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s consent to this arbitration was perfected when the Claimants filed the Request for Arbitration on 16 November 2012. From that date, in accordance with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, \"no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\", including through any alleged change in internal law that would invalidate such consent, or an alleged incapacity to have entered into such consent. Thus, the Claimants submit that, regardless of any alleged effects of *Achmea* on the Austria-Croatia BIT, it can have no bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this case.\n\n21.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s Request \"is nothing more than a[n] attempt to further prolong the resolution of the dispute before this Tribunal\", and, at this stage, no further submissions should be allowed.\n\n**C. The Respondent's Comments in Reply of 14 April 2018**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent contends that its objections based on the *Achmea* judgment are timely. ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) permits objections to be raised later than the CounterMemorial if \"the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\" The Respondent says that it bases its objections on the *Achmea* judgment of the CJEU of 6 March 2018. According to the Respondent, it is undisputed that this is the date when the supreme court of the European Union in matters of EU law determined that intra-EU investor-State arbitration clauses, such as Article 9 of the Austria-Croatia BIT, are precluded by EU law. It follows, according to the Respondent, that this is the earliest possible point in time when the Respondent could advance its objections based on this new and authoritative ruling that addresses the situation at hand (namely, investment arbitration between EU nationals and an EU Member State). The Respondent raised its objections shortly thereafter on 4 April 2018. Any discussions pre-dating the *Achmea* judgment could not take into account the repercussions of the ruling of the Grand Chamber of 6 March 2018 \"and any related observations\".\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent also points to Article 41(2) and contends that \"objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal cannot be ignored if raised during the pendency of the proceedings, as here.\" Further, the Tribunal has a duty to verify its jurisdiction *ex officio* and it is empowered to deal with jurisdictional questions of its own motion \"at any stage of the proceeding\" under Arbitration Rule 41(2).\n\n24.\n\nFurther, the Respondent says that the Claimants also make submissions on the substance of the Respondent\u2019s supplementary preliminary objections, and advance the following short observations in response. First, the Claimants\u2019 suggestion that EU law and the *Achmea* ruling have no application *ratione temporis* is mistaken. It is sufficient to dispose of the Claimants\u2019 objection to note that the Claimants also impugn State measures postdating the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the EU, including land registrations that took place in 2017. It is also settled case law that rulings of the CJEU under the preliminary reference procedure, as in *Achmea*, must be applied *ab initio* from the time the respective provisions (here, what are currently known as Articles 267 and 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"**TFEU**\") entered into force.\n\n25.\n\nSecondly, Article 11(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT illustrates that there was never an offer of consent to arbitrate investor-State disputes if this is \"incompatible with the legal acquis of the European Union (EU) in force at any given time.\" Accordingly, the Claimants\u2019 argument that consent was allegedly irrevocably perfected with the filing of the Request for Arbitration on 16 November 2012 is \"ill-considered.\"\n\n26.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent submits that Article 9 of the BIT is inapplicable and this arbitration must come to an end forthwith.\n\n**D. The Claimants' Second Round of Comments of 20 April 2018**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nFirst, in response to the Respondent\u2019s (new) argument that the *Achmea* judgment is a \"fact\", the Claimants contend that the judgment is a legal ruling, not a \"fact\" as envisaged by Rule 41(1). Moreover, even if it is assumed, for the sake of argument, that the *Achmea* judgment constitutes a \"fact\" pursuant to Rule 41(1), it is not the fact upon which the Respondent\u2019s objection will truly be based: the relevant fact is simply that the Claimants rely on a BIT in place between two EU Member States, a fact which has been known to the Respondent since its accession to the EU on 1 July 2013.\n\n28.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants note the Respondent\u2019s argument that Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 41(2) give rise to a \"duty\" of the Tribunal to hear any preliminary objection, so long as it is brought during the pendency of the proceedings. In response, the Claimants posit that this proposition would render Rule 41(1) meaningless, and point out that the Respondent cites no authority for its proposition. Although Rule 41(2) states that the Tribunal \"may, on its own initiative\" consider its jurisdiction at any stage of the proceedings, the Claimants stress that numerous tribunals have declined to exercise this discretion when a party raises a belated preliminary objection, based on the language of Rule 41(1).\n\n29.\n\nThirdly, the Claimants argue that the inconvenience and disadvantage to the Claimants in permitting the briefing of the Respondent\u2019s supplementary objections is \"manifest\". The Claimants point to the fact that they brought their claims over five years ago, and have spent considerable effort and expense responding to the numerous preliminary objections already submitted by the Respondent. Further, to add delay and expense to these proceedings 18 months after the last hearing in this case, as the Tribunal prepares to render its Award, to address an additional objection the Respondent \"chose not to bring in a timely manner\", would be a severe disadvantage and inconvenience to the Claimants. This is said to be particularly true as the Second Claimant, Mr Gavilrovic, continues to fight criminal charges brought by the Respondent.\n\n30.\n\nFinally, the Claimants address the Respondent\u2019s contention that it is \"undisputed... that the [CJEU] determined that intra-EU investor-State arbitration clauses such as Article 9 of the Croatia-Austria BIT are precluded by EU law\", submitting that the Claimants certainly do dispute Respondent\u2019s characterisation of the *Achmea* decision, and in particular its application in the present case.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimants commenced this arbitration under the auspices of ICSID on the basis of the BIT between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Croatia and the ICSID Convention.\n\n32.\n\nArticle 9 of the BIT provides for the settlement of investment disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party. If a dispute cannot be settled within three months of a written notification of sufficiently detailed claims, the dispute shall be subject to conciliation or arbitration by ICSID, or arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules (Article 9(2)).\n\n33.\n\nNotably, Article 11(2) of the BIT, concerning the application of the Agreement, provides:\n\n*The Contracting Parties are not bound by the present Agreement insofar as it is incompatible with the legal acquis of the European Union (EU) in force at any given time.*\n\n34.\n\nOn 4 April 2018, the Respondent raised supplementary preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims, including pursuant to Article 11(2) of the BIT.\n\n35.\n\nThe Parties cite the following provisions as relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request of 4 April 2018.\n\n36.\n\nArticle 41(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.*\n\n37.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) establishes that:\n\n*Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the countermemorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time* [emphasis added].\n\n38.\n\nFinally, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) provides:\n\n*The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence* [emphasis added].\n\n39.\n\nHaving carefully considered the submissions of the Parties, for the reasons that follow, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not raised the supplementary preliminary objections \"as early as possible\", as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1). It follows that the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s request to brief the proposed supplemental jurisdictional objections.\n\n40.\n\nFirst, the question of the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal that is not part of the judicial system of the EU to determine a dispute between an investor of the EU and an EU Member State, and its invocation as a defence in investor-State arbitration, is a notorious one which has been hotly disputed in many cases involving EU Member States. By way of example, the Claimants appositely refer to *EDF v Hungary*, in which the European Commission\u2019s intervention specifically addressed Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, being the articles at issue in *Achmea*, and in which counsel for the Respondent represented the claimant.1\n\n*E.D.F. International S.A. v Republic of Hungary*, PCA Case No 2009-13, Written Observations of the European Commission dated 14 May 2013, pp 14-15, available at: ec.europa.eu/dgs/legal\\_service/submissions/arbitrage/pca\\_2009\\_13\\_obs\\_en\\_red.pdf.\n\n41.\n\nSecondly, and more particularly, many of the facts concerning *Achmea* are not new. The decision of the arbitral tribunal was issued in December 2012. The respondent Member State, Slovakia, sought to set aside the award in the Frankfurt am Main Higher Regional Court. When the court dismissed the action, Slovakia appealed on a point of law against the dismissal to the Federal Court of Justice of Germany. In March 2016, the Federal Court of Justice referred to the CJEU questions concerning whether Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU preclude the application of a provision in a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member States of the EU under which an investor of a contracting state, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other contracting State, may bring proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal. The fact that the matter was submitted to the CJEU was public knowledge, and the judgment was expected in the first half of this year. While no one could know how the Court would rule, these facts should have been known to the Respondent.\n\n42.\n\nThere is a dispute between the Parties as to whether the decision of the CJEU in *Achmea* is a fact or ruling of law. To some extent it may be regarded as both. Clearly, the handing down of the decision is a fact. But the decision itself is legal rather than factual in nature: it clarifies the law in the EU. On balance, the Tribunal considers that the \"fact\" of the ruling in *Achmea* does not suffice as a basis for the objection(s) that the Respondent seeks to raise at this stage of the proceeding.\n\n43.\n\nThirdly, even if the Respondent decided not to rely on the so-called intra-EU BIT objection in the absence of a ruling by the CJEU, the Respondent could have stated at a minimum that it reserved the right to raise the objection if the CJEU ruled in favour of Slovakia. Alternately, the Respondent could have requested that the Tribunal suspend the proceeding until the judgment was rendered, arguing that the application of the dispute settlement provision of the BIT was contingent upon the ruling of the CJEU. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not been reluctant to make other reservations of rights in the course of this arbitration. However, the Respondent did not raise the matter of compatibility of the BIT with EU law as an issue, let alone an objection. Nor was there a reservation of rights.\n\n44.\n\nFourthly, the terms of Article 11(2) of the BIT reinforce the Tribunal\u2019s view. The explicit requirement - that the Contracting Parties are not bound by the BIT insofar as it is incompatible with the legal *acquis* of the EU in force at any given time - is not contained in many other intra-EU BITs. Together with the (then) impending decision of the CJEU, and the view that intra-EU BITs were embraced by the European Commission for a number of years, the Respondent could have raised the issue in some form at an earlier stage of the proceedings. The Respondent could not have been ignorant of the existence of Article 11(2).\n\n45.\n\nFifthly, as foreshadowed, the Tribunal is mindful of the stage of the proceedings. The Request for Arbitration was filed on 26 November 2012, and was registered on 21 December 2012. The Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Preliminary Objections was filed on 31 October 2014. The last hearing in this case was held in September 2016. The parties were informed in March 2018 that the Tribunal expected that the award may be issued in a few months.\n\n46.\n\nFinally, Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention does not give rise to a mandatory obligation on the part of the Tribunal to hear any preliminary objection to jurisdiction, provided that it is raised during the pendency of the proceedings. Rather, the Tribunal agrees with the conclusion in *Siag & Vecchi v Egypt* :\n\n*It is* [Arbitration Rule 41] *which grants the right to a party to object to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and it is the right granted by Rule 41 which the Claimants assert has been waived as a result of a failure to invoke that right \"as early as possible.\" The alternative, which is a logical extension of Egypt\u2019s argument, is that a party could never waive an objection to jurisdiction no matter how dilatory had been that party\u2019s conduct, because the right to object to jurisdiction at any time was protected by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal does not accept that proposition*.2\n\n*Waguih Elie George Siag & Clorinda Vecchi v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award dated 1 June 2009 (\"***Siag & Vecchi***\") (CL-0060), \u00b6 288.\n\n47.\n\nFurther, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) states that the Tribunal \"may, on its own initiative\" consider its jurisdiction at any stage of the proceedings. Tribunals have declined to exercise this discretion when a party raises a belated preliminary objection, based on the language of Rule 41(1).3 As the tribunal in *Vestey v Venezuela* stated, \"the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power to review its jurisdiction *ex officio* does not absolve the parties from compliance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1).4 For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal likewise declines to exercise the discretion provided for in Arbitration Rule 41(2).\n\n*See, eg*, *Siag & Vecchi* (CL-0060), \u00b6 288 (dismissing untimely objection) and *Vestey Group Ltd v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award dated 15 April 2016 (\"***Vestey***\"), \u00b6 150 (same). *But see also* *AIG Capital Partners Inc. and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/6, Award dated 7 October 2003, \u00b6\u00b6 9.1-9.2 (allowing objection to jurisdiction raised shortly after submission of the counter-memorial, but before the hearings).\n\n*Vestey*, \u00b6 149\n\n48.\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, the Tribunal considers the Respondent\u2019s Request of 4 April 2018 untimely and thus inadmissible. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s request to fix a schedule for pleadings concerning the proposed supplementary preliminary objections.\n\n**V.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**ICSID**) on the basis of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Croatia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 1 November 1999 (**BIT**) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (**ICSID Convention**).\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 (**Mr Gavrilovi\u0107** or **First Claimant**), a natural person having the nationality of the Republic of Austria, and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. (**Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.** or **Second Claimant**), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Croatia (together, **Gavrilovi\u0107** or **Claimants**).\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Croatia (**Croatia** or **Respondent**).\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are the parties to this arbitration (collectively referred to as the **Parties**). The Parties\u2019 representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute relates to the Claimants\u2019 alleged investments in Croatia\u2019s food products industry.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 26 November 2012, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 16 November 2012 from Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. against the Republic of Croatia, together with Exhibits C-0001 through C-0050 (**Request**), as supplemented by letter of 20 December 2012.\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID (**Secretary-General**) registered the Request, as supplemented, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n8.\n\nBy letters of 7 January 2013 and 1 February 2013, the Parties confirmed their agreement that the tribunal should consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each Party, and the President of the Tribunal appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nIn the Request, the Claimants appointed Dr Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, as Arbitrator in this case.\n\n10.\n\nOn 1 February 2013, the Respondent appointed Mr Matthias Scherer, a national of Switzerland, as Arbitrator in this case.\n\n11.\n\nOn 19 June 2013, the Parties agreed to appoint Dr Michael C. Pryles, a national of Australia, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 26 June 2013, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (**ICSID Arbitration Rules**), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms Lindsay Gastrell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. The Parties were later informed that Ms Jara M\u00ednguez Almeida, ICSID Legal Counsel, had replaced Ms Gastrell as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 8 August 2013 by teleconference.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 21 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 1 (**PO 1**) embodying the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. PO 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules would be those in effect as of 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. Annex A of PO 1 sets out a schedule with respect to the initial pleadings.

On 31 August 2017, the Claimants submitted the Registration Documents into the record as Exhibits C-0636 through C-0639.\n\n65.\n\nOn 10 August 2017, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation of 13 July 2017, the Claimants submitted their observations on Exhibit R-0374, together with Legal Authorities CL-0277 and CL-0278 and a Third Supplemental Expert Report of Prof Davor Derencinovic dated 1 August 2017 (**Fourth Derencinovic Report**).\n\n66.\n\nBy email of 11 August 2017, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal requesting that it strike the Fourth Derencinovic Report from the record and order the Claimants to resubmit their comments without reference to Prof Derencinovic\u2019s testimony. Upon invitation from the Tribunal, the Claimants responded by email of that same date stating that the Respondent\u2019s objection to the Fourth Derencinovic Report was without merit.\n\n67.\n\nBy letter of 16 August 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it decided to admit the Fourth Derencinovic Report into the record; the Tribunal also invited the Respondent to submit its observations on the Fourth Derencinovic Report by 24 August 2017.\n\n68.\n\nOn 24 August 2017, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Fourth Derencinovic Report.

The Respondent requested that the Tribunal fix a schedule of pleadings so as to address this development.\n\n76.\n\nBy letter dated 11 April 2018, the Claimants responded to the Respondent\u2019s application of 4 April 2018, resisting that application on the basis that the Respondent could have raised its jurisdictional objection earlier, and that the substance of the argument which was considered in the *Achmea* decision was known to the Respondent. The Claimants further pointed to at least one previous investor case in which the Respondent was involved wherein similar arguments to those raised in *Achmea* were also raised.\n\n77.\n\nBy letter dated 14 April 2018, the Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 letter of 14 April 2018 pressing its application, and pointing to Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, contending that the Tribunal has a duty to verify its jurisdiction *ex officio*.\n\n78.\n\nBy letter dated 21 April 2018, the Claimants responded to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 14 April 2018 reiterating their objection to the Respondent\u2019s application.\n\n79.\n\nBy letter and decision dated 30 April 2018, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent\u2019s application on the basis that it was untimely and thus inadmissible.\n\n80.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on 4 May 2018.\n\n81.\n\nOn 4 May 2018, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal setting out its objection to the Tribunal\u2019s decision of 30 April 2018 and reserving its rights.\n\n**III. FACTUAL OVERVIEW**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. The Gavrilovic Enterprise**\n--------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nWhile the Parties tend to disagree over much of the factual background in this case, they agree that the Gavrilovi\u0107 Enterprise7 has endured. The Claimants state that their meat business was established as early as 1690 in Petrinja, then a town in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.8 From that date forward and through World War II, the Gavrilovi\u0107 Enterprise continued to evolve, and at times flourish, as its products became renowned throughout the region.9 During these 250 years, the Gavrilovi\u0107 Enterprise was transformed through various corporate iterations retaining either the Gavrilovi\u0107 name or its connection to the family.10\n\n\"Gavrilovi\u0107 Enterprise\" is a catchall term that denotes the meat company and its affiliates from their inception to the present day in all corporate forms, whether socially or privately owned.\n\nI.

The self-regulatory system of socialist enterprises recognised the \"workers\u2019 organisations\" as the main self-regulated production unit: *see* SFRY Constitution (CL-0002), Art 35; Associated Labour Act (CL-0007), Arts 16 and 346; and Enterprises Act (CL-0008 / RL-0168), Arts 1 and 13. The workers\u2019 organisations could establish or join a common-roof organisation called a \"complex organisation of associated work\" (**SOUR**) (SFRY Constitution (CL-0002), Art 38). The structure of socialist enterprises was further regulated by the Associated Labour Act (CL-0007) and the Enterprises Act (CL-0008 / RL-0168).\n\n*See generally*, SFRY Constitution (CL-0002), Art 36; Associated Labour Act (CL-0007), Arts 13-16 and 320; and Enterprises Act (CL-0008 / RL-0168), Art 13.\n\n85.\n\nAlso following World War II, the First Claimant\u2019s father was convicted to a life sentence after being subjected to a politically motivated tri al.16 After enduring seven years of forced labour, the First Claimant\u2019s father was released and fled to Austria with the First Claimant.17 They earned Austrian citizenship in 1959 and renounced their Yugoslavian citizenship.18 The First Claimant and his father returned to Yugoslavia in 1966, and retained their Austrian citizenship continuously since 1959.19 Upon their return, the First Claimant continued his university studies and his father worked at the now socially-owned Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR as a consultant.20\n\nDecision of the Government of the Republic of Croatia (Administrative Commission) regarding the Confirmation of the Status of a Political Prisoner dated 13 September 1993 (C-0006). *See also* Interview, \"Gavrilovi\u0107 is coming to 'Gavrilovi\u0107'\", published in *Privredni Vjesnik* and internal newspapers of the Nine Companies on 6 May 1991 (C-0007); and Decision of District Court N.O.

The enterprise was therefore reorganised into a parent company with five subsidiaries (**Six Socialist Companies**), and Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR transferred to these six companies the right of administration, use and disposition over its moveable and immoveable property.22 The transfer of these assets was recorded in the land register, as required.23 The Six Socialist Companies were:\n\n(i) **Complex Company Gavrilovi\u0107 Petrinja**, which acted as a bank that provided accounting and finance expertise and included the Gavrilovi\u0107 Housing Association;\n\n(ii) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo**, the most profitable company, which included slaughterhouse operations and the manufacturing of meat products;\n\n(iii) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture spo,** which raised livestock and feedstock to support the processed meat operations;\n\n(iv) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce spo**, which had multiple functions, namely the commercialisation and distribution of the meat production. This spo owned retail food markets throughout Yugoslavia, trucks and a maintenance facility, and hotels in Petrinja and Biograd;\n\n(v) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade spo**, which coordinated the sale of meat products abroad and the import of raw material to support meat production and other operations; and\n\n(vi) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Small Economy spo**, which manufactured souvenirs.24\n\n*See* Enterprises Act (CL-0008 / RL-0168).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 34.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Land Registry Entry for Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture spo dated 7 September 2014 (R-0011).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 28.\n\n87.\n\nThe Six Socialist Companies were functionally and legally independent, but matters affecting the group were decided by an executive board with representatives from each one.25\n\nRospaher Statement, \u00b6 19.\n\n88.\n\nFollowing the reorganisation of Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR into the Six Socialist Companies, all socially-owned enterprises were subsequently required to transform into privately held companies with a definite owner by 30 June 1991.26 In preparation for this change, the corporate organisation of Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR underwent successive transformation from the period beginning with the 1989 reorganisation through the collapse of Socialist Yugoslavia and the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence in June 1991.\n\nSurvey of Legal Aspects of the Status and Legal Transformation of the Gavrilovi\u0107 Companies dated 21 February 1991 (**Survey**) (C-0013), p 1.\n\n89.\n\nTo prepare for the departure from social ownership, Complex Company Gavrilovi\u0107 Petrinja commissioned a survey detailing the corporate transformation to be undertaken in preparation for private ownership (**Survey**).27 The result of the Survey provided for a four-stage approach, which was carried out as follows. First, in April 1991, the Six Socialist Companies merged into a newly incorporated limited liability company (**Food Industry**).28 In transferring the assets, the Six Socialist Companies disclaimed all rights to the assets and ceased to exist.29 Second, on 23 April 1991, Food Industry transformed into a holding company (**Holding d.o.o.**).30 Third, on 26 April 1991, Holding d.o.o. established nine new LLCs (**Nine Companies**) corresponding to the various business activities of Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR.31 The assets of Food Industry, now Holding d.o.o., were divided among the Nine Companies according to their business activities and allocated nominal capital.32 Fourth, the new Nine Companies would be transferred out of social ownership by the sale of their shares to a private entity.33\n\nSurvey (C-0013).\n\nSurvey (C-0013), p 3; Agreement on the Merger of the Enterprises dated 9 April 1991 (**Merger Agreement**) (C-0014).\n\nMerger Agreement (C-0014).\n\nResolution on the Organising of the Holding Company dated 23 April 1991 (**Resolution**) (C-0015).\n\nResolution (C-0015).\n\nRegistry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0016); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0017); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0018); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0019); and Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0020).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 100.\n\n90.\n\nThe Nine Companies were:\n\n(i) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry**, which succeeded Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo and to which assets in the amount of 259,288,807.20 dinar were allocated, the majority of which was composed of buildings and equipment;\n\n(ii) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture**, to which assets in the amount of 132,242,962.40 dinar were allocated, the majority of which was composed of buildings, agricultural land, and equipment;\n\n(iii) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade**, to which assets in the amount of 2,660,017.30 dinar were allocated;\n\n(iv) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce**, to which assets comprised of buildings and equipment in the amount of 71,188,085.90 dinar were allocated;\n\n(v) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport**, to which assets in the amount of 10,605,44.70 dinar were allocated;\n\n(vi) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging**, to which assets in the amount of 34,309,580.00 dinar were allocated;\n\n(vii) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Motel Biograd**, which would manage a hotel in Biograd and to which assets in the amount of 12,205,787.00 dinar were allocated;\n\n(viii) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Shoe Factory**, a leather shoes and goods business, to which assets in the amount of 6,699,520.00 dinar were allocated; and\n\n(ix) **Gavrilovi\u0107 Small Economy**, a home artisanship business to which assets in the amount of 49,800.90 dinar were allocated.34\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 38-40.\n\n91.\n\nThe assets allocated to each of the Nine Companies corresponded to the book values set out in the final statement of accounts of the Six Socialist Companies dated 31 December 1990.35 However, the Parties agree that the Resolution directing the incorporation of the Nine Companies and registered in the Regional Commercial Court in Zagreb did not include an itemised list of assets corresponding to the asset value allocated to each company, even though a detailed division of assets was foreseen.36 The Resolution stated, \"[T]he final division of the assets which will be allocated to [each] company will be determined pursuant to the final statement of accounts.\"37\n\nResolution (C-0015), Art 17.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 41; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 53.\n\nResolution (C-0015), Arts 9-17.\n\n92.\n\nThe final, itemised asset allocation to each company did not occur because most of the Nine Companies were placed into bankruptcy shortly after their inception.38\n\nRospaher Statement, \u00b6 51\n\n**B.

however, as there was no formal transfer of title of those assets to the Nine Companies before the bankruptcy sale, the Asset List is of no help to the Claimants in establishing the property transferred to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.57 Given the flawed formulation of the Record and Asset List, the list of assets owned by the Five Companies, which was submitted as Annex II to the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, is a fiction in the Respondent\u2019s view.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 II.F.1(b)(iii).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 185.\n\n102.\n\nAlso in March 1992, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 paid DEM 3,305,000.00 for the Five Companies, with DEM 1 million financing from Bankhaus Feichtner.58\n\nGavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 32-35;

The Respondent Alleges the First Claimant Purchased the Gavrilovic ENTERPRiSE THROUGH A CORRUPT SCHEME**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s version of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s efforts to purchase the Five Companies stands in sharp contrast to the Claimants\u2019 retelling of the same story. According to the Respondent, the First Claimant exploited the privatisation process in a corrupt scheme to retake the Five Companies for a mere \"pittance.\"63\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 59.\n\n106.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the First Claimant\u2019s alleged corrupt scheme began in the latter half of the 1980s when the First Claimant and his wife worked at the Austrian consulate, allegedly as low-ranking officials.64 During this time, the Respondent states that the First Claimant used his well-known name and veiled himself as a wealthy foreign investor in order to make the acquaintance of wealthy businesspersons and other high-ranking officials in Croatia, some of whom purportedly played a hand in the denationalisation of Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR.65 The Respondent alleges that these acquaintances positioned the First Claimant to fraudulently take possession of the Five Companies.66 The Respondent asserts that the First Claimant\u2019s fraudulent scheme to purchase the Five Companies had four components.\n\n*See* Pape\u0161 Statement, \u00b6 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 62.\n\n107.\n\nFirst, the First Claimant, directly and through intermediaries, tipped the Five Companies out of restructuring and into bankruptcy, paving the way for their sale into the First Claimant\u2019s hands.67 According to the Respondent, the First Claimant\u2019s well-connected ally, Mr Slavko Degoricija, positioned himself to oversee the Government\u2019s role in ensuring the successful privatisation of the Five Companies.68 In that role, he replaced the Acting President of the board of Holding d.o.o., after which the long-planned reorganisation of Holding d.o.o. and its subsidiaries halted.69 Instead, the Five Companies promptly filed for bankruptcy.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 II.C.2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 70.\n\nPresentation by Mr Mladen Mikulic, Acting President FO, during a meeting with the Vice President for the Economy of Croatia, Mr Franjo Greguric, 29 March 1991 (C-0025), p 1.\n\n108.\n\nAs proof of a fraudulent scheme in favour of a bankruptcy sale, the Respondent alleges that the bankruptcy petitions were not accompanied by a certification that the companies were incapable of paying their debts, which was a *sine qua non* to bankruptcy.70\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 76; *see also* Proposition for Initiation of Bankruptcy of Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry d.o.o. dated 19 August 1991 (R-0018); Proposition for Initiation of Bankruptcy of Gavrilovi\u0107 Trade d.o.o. dated 19 August 1991 (R-0019); Proposition for Initiation of Bankruptcy of Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture d.o.o. dated 19 August 1991 (R-0020); Proposition for Initiation of Bankruptcy of Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade d.o.o., dated 19 August 1991 (R-0021); Proposition for Initiation of Bankruptcy of Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport d.o.o. dated 19 August 1991 (R-0022).\n\n109.\n\nSecond, the Respondent claims that the First Claimant ensured, through intermediaries, that the Bankruptcy Court would not sell off the assets of the Five Companies on a piecemeal basis, and instead sell them in a singular sale, which was unprecedented.71\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 II.C.2(b); *see also* Bankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 2.\n\n110.\n\nThird, the Respondent argues that it was improper for the First Claimant to have entered into the Purchase Agreement and to have been registered as the Five Companies\u2019 owner before they received any ownership rights over property.72 Here the Respondent criticises the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to allow the sale without allocating assets to the Five Companies and, as a result, none of these Five Companies had demonstrable title to any property.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 II.C.2(c).\n\n111.\n\nFourth, the Respondent alleges that the First Claimant orchestrated the extension of the purchase price payment beyond what was allowable in the Purchase Agreement and assumed the risk of perfecting ownership of the assets belonging to the Five Companies given the lack of demonstrable title.73\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 II.C.2(d).\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent further alleges that the First Claimant raised the funds to pay for the Five Companies by siphoning off funds from certain properties and procuring funds deposited in Austrian banks that belonged to the Croatian State.74\n\n*See* Bogovic Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 6-13; *see also* Pape\u0161 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 8 *et seq.*\n\n113.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondent, once the funds were raised, the purchase price was paid not to the bank accounts of the Five Companies in bankruptcy but rather to the Swiss bank account of a Panamanian company, Inacomm International S.A. (**inacomm**), which had no relation whatsoever to the Five Companies.75 Instead, it was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Croatian oil company INA, and during the relevant period, the First Claimant\u2019s known ally, Mr Slavko Degoricija, was the head of the INA oil industry management board.76\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 II.C.5(a).\n\nDegoricija Statement, \u00b6 16.\n\n**D. The Claimants Rebuild the Gavrilovic Enterprise**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nAs the purchaser of the Five Companies, the First Claimant sought to rebuild the business. After the conclusion of the Purchase Agreement, he changed the name of Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry to \"Gavrilovi\u0107 - The First Croatian Factory for Salami, Cured Meat, and Lard Mate Gavrilovi\u0107 and Descendants d.o.o.\" (**Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.**).77 The other four of the Five Companies purchased in the bankruptcy proceedings were then incorporated into Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.78\n\n*See* Excerpt from the Commercial Court Registry in Zagreb dated 9 September 2012 (C-0059).\n\n*See* Announcement of the Regional Commercial Court in Zagreb in Official Gazette No 73 dated 31 December 1991 (C-0060).\n\n115.\n\nOnce the bankruptcy proceedings concluded and Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 took the helm of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., the company struggled, as most of its valuable assets, such as the meat processing factory, were in the Occupied Properties in Petrinja.79\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 90.\n\n116.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the following years were incredibly difficult, but the company was able to maintain solvency. In August 1995, when the Croatian War of Independence ended, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was able to return to Petrinja to gain access to the Occupied Properties.80 A month later, after restoring the war-torn assets, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. commenced production and became the most important employer in the region.81\n\nInterview with Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 published in the newspaper *Globus* on 20 September 1996 (C-0064); Z.

The Claimants Allege the Respondent Failed to Protect and Promote THEiR iNvEsTMENT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nIn this proceeding, the Claimants allege that the Respondent undermined their investment\u2014the purchase of the Gavrilovi\u0107 Enterprise\u2014after the end of the War of Independence.82 According to the Claimants, the return of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. to Petrinja should have resulted in the formal transfer of possession and ownership of all Occupied Properties to the company.83 Instead, the Claimants allege that almost immediately after the war, the Croatian authorities began to deny the legitimacy of the First Claimant\u2019s purchase. The Claimants complain of seven measures.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00a7 II.D.\n\nRecord (C-0049), p 7 (stating that, with regard to the Occupied Properties \"the possession and ownership will be transferred to the Buyer as soon as it will be possible to take possession of that property.\")\n\n118.\n\nFirst, the Claimants allege that Croatia sought to annul the Purchase Agreement.84 When the Croatian State Attorney Office investigated the First Claimant\u2019s purchase of the Five Companies, a claim for annulment was registered on 22 May 1996 in the Municipal Court of Zagreb citing irregularities in the bankruptcy sale (**Annulment****Action**).85\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00a7 II.D.1.\n\nJudgment of the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb dated 6 May 1996 pertaining to File No P-1729/96, signed by State Attorney Mr Petar Sale (C-0077).\n\n119.\n\nDuring the pendency of the Annulment Action, the State Attorney issued public statements calling the First Claimant\u2019s investments null and void, an allegation that was echoed in multiple press reports.86\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Z. Maljevac, \"State Sues Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 for Criminal Privatisation of the Petrinja Giant\", *Panorama*, 26 August 1996 (C-0078); N.

Maljevac, \"State Sues Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 for Criminal Privatisation of the Petrinja Giant\", *Panorama*, 26 August 1996 (C-0078).\n\n121.\n\nThe Annulment Action never got off the ground. In four years, only four hearings were held.88 When a new government was seated in Croatia in 2000, the State Attorney was eventually instructed to withdraw the Annulment Action and to enter into settlement talks. The Annulment Action was later withdrawn and a decision to close the case was issued on 22 November 2000.89\n\n*See* Gulam Statement, \u00b6 21.\n\n*See* Gulam Statement, \u00b6 21; Ruling of the Municipal Court in Zagreb pertaining to File No P-3284/96/42 dated 22 November 2000 (C-0083).\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Annulment Action adversely affected their investments because a pendency notice was registered in the land registry as soon as the proceeding commenced in 1996 and remained in force until 2002\u2014two years after the closure of the Annulment Action.90 The pendency notice prevented any formal transfer of title to or from Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. of the Accessible or Occupied Properties, and local authorities such as the tax authority refused to cooperate with the Claimants until the notice was lifted.91\n\nProposal from the Deputy State Attorney of Croatia to the Municipal Court of Petrinja dated 8 August 1996 (C-0132); Gulam Statement, \u00b6 24.\n\nLetter from Mr Miljenko Rospaher, CFO of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., to the Tax Administration Office (Regional Office in Sisak) of the Ministry of Finance dated 23 December 1998 (C-0084); Letter from the Tax Administration Office (Regional Office in Sisak) of the Ministry of Finance to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. dated 30 December 1998 (C-0085); *see* also Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 134.\n\n123.\n\nSecond, Croatia initiated criminal proceedings against the First Claimant for inducing a public officer, the Liquidator, to exceed his authority; it also initiated criminal proceedings against the Liquidator himself for abuse in the discharge of his fiduciary duty.92 The charges related to the preparation of the Record and Asset List with the First Claimant without authorisation by the Bankruptcy Court.93\n\nLetter from the State Attorney General Mr Petar Sale regarding a summary referring to the sale in bankruptcy of five companies d.o.o. with the \"Gavrilovi\u0107\" Company dated 9 January 1998 (C-0087); Letter from State Attorney General Mr Petar Sale to Mr Radovan Santek, Zagreb County State Attorney dated 10 September 1996, containing the Indictment of the State Attorney against Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 (No A-199/96) (C-0088); Ruling of the County Court in Zagreb pertaining to File No IX-II-Kv-503/00-2 dated 16 November 2000 (C-0046).\n\n*See* Criminal Act, Arts 215(1), (3) and (5), amended as of 19 April 1996 (CL-0021).\n\n124.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the State Attorney provided no specific explanation to the First Claimant regarding the basis for the charges.94 At one point the police sought to question the First Claimant, but after that, the First Claimant never received any notice as to how the investigation progressed and if it was closed.95 The criminal action against the First Claimant was withdrawn, and the Liquidator was cleared of wrongdoing on appeal.96\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 139.\n\nGavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 75 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 157, 159.\n\n125.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent argues that \"as long as these civil and criminal investigations did not result in the annulment of the Purchase Agreement or the indictment of the First Claimant, the Respondent protected and promoted the First Claimant\u2019s alleged investment.\"97\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 160.\n\n126.\n\nThird, the Claimants allege that the Respondent launched a public campaign to deny the legitimacy of the First Claimant\u2019s investment as early as spring 1996.98 According to the Claimants:\n\n*These public attacks came from the Members of the Croatian Parliament, the Public Attorney, the local government, and the state-owned Holding d.o.o. and shared common themes: (1) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s purchase was null and void; (2) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s purchase was immoral because the purchase price was insufficient; (3) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s purchase was a product of nepotism and corruption; and (4) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was himself a Serb and/or favors the Serbs. In the sensitive post-war atmosphere in Croatia, the last argument was especially pernicious and effective. All of these allegations were false*.99\n\nNewspapers summarise the campaign in the following terms: \"after the action 'Storm' and the liberation [of Petrinja], in Banovina a fierce campaign was waged against Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 and the sale of the five companies under bankruptcy\" in [untitled], *Nacional*, 5 April 1996 (C-0091); \"Let us only remind that, soon after the liberation of Petrinja, the leaders of 'Gavrilovi\u0107 Holding' tried to bring into question the legality of the contract on purchase and other resolutions [...] [a]ll the conflicts were ended and started without much of a cause\" in Z.

Petracic, \"The Sale of Gavrilovi\u0107 Ltd. will be Overturned\", *Vecernji list*, 6 February 1997 (C-0081) and \"How Will Dispute Over the Assets of 'First Croatian Factory of Salami, Dried Meat and Fat, Mate Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s Descendants\u2019 Go\", *Vecernji list*, 1 February 1998 (C-0082).\n\n129.\n\nThe director of the State-owned Holding d.o.o. also entered the debate claiming that the Purchase Agreement was \"null and void\", that the purchase price for the Five Companies was inadequate, and that the First Claimant managed to purchase the Five Companies through family connections.102 The director went so far as to paper the windows in Petrinja with the complaint in the Annulment Action: \"We put those posters to the shop windows to inform the people of the Public Attorney\u2019s views about the Gavrilovi\u0107 sale. Because Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 just won't stop with his illegal actions.\"103\n\n\"Drivers of Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 Occupied the Transport Plant at Dawn, Workers of Gavrilovi\u0107 Holding Occupied in a Counterattack 54 Shops of the Trgovina Company\", *Nacional*, 5 April 1996 (C-0102). *See also* \"The Austrian Chancellor Klima Does Not Want to Come to Croatia as Long as the Gavrilovi\u0107 Dispute is Not Resolved\", *Vecernji list*, 21-22 June 1999 (C-0080); \"A Sausage War is Raging in Petrinja\", *Slobodna dalmacija*, 13 August 1996 (C-0100).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 153, *citing* \"A Sausage War is Raging in Petrinja\", *Slobodna dalmacija*, 13 August 1996 (C-0100).\n\n130.\n\nIn efforts to calm the rumours, the First Claimant published the Purchase Agreement and the court decisions confirming its validity.104\n\nAnnouncement regarding the purchase of the Gavrilovi\u0107 companies by Georg Gavrilovi\u0107, published in *Vecernji list*, 5 September 1996 (C-0103).\n\n131.\n\nConcerning the effects of the negative publicity, the Claimants explain:\n\n*Since Krajina was liberated and the situation has consolidated, Croatian government and party circles have attempted to bring the company Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. under their control* [\u2026] *This objective is being pursued by systematically launching a public campaign against my company and me personally as well as by initiating legal steps (and their discussion in the media) on the part of the State of Croatia.* [\u2026]\n\n[T]*his campaign is extremely critical for the survival of this Austrian company as it damages its creditworthiness in a certain audience that is not too susceptible to legal arguments or is, by nature, acting rather carefully (credit-granting banking institutes). Without a doubt, any such damage done to the creditworthiness is geared towards taking over my\u2014meanwhile up-and-coming\u2014business for as good a price as possible, a pattern widely observed in takeovers of businesses in Croatia by certain HDZ circles*.105\n\nLetter from Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 to Dr Alois Mock, retired Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs dated 14 October 1996 (C-0104).\n\n132.\n\nFourth, the Claimants assert that local police failed to provide police protection to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. when gangs organised by Holding d.o.o. violently took over Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s shops and offices and later violently took over the factory.106 Instead of protecting Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., the police refused on the ground that ownership of the relevant Properties was at issue:\n\n*We* [the police] *do not have a clear insight into who exactly are the owners of the buildings, which is why we are for now unable to proceed according to your request* [to protect the properties from violent takeover] *- i.e. until such time the public authorities or the judicial branch of government of the Republic of Croatia finally decide, and we as representatives of the legal order be informed of that decision by one or the other party, under whose title the buildings belong*.107\n\nAccording to the Claimants, other immediate and repeated pleas with the police for protection were unanswered, and the Claimants hired private protection.108\n\nLetter from Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. to Croatia Ministry of the Interior - Petrinja Police Station dated 21 November 1995, regarding Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s request for protection of property and means of work (C-0105), p 1. *See also* Letter from Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 to the Embassy of the Republic of Austria in Zagreb dated 22 April 1996 (C-0106).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 162, *citing* Letter from Commander Joso Fakcevic to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. responding to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s letter regarding protection of property and means of work dated 7 December 1995 (C-0107).\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 160 *et seq*.

According to the Chief of the Petrinja Police Station, the police were responsive to the First Claimant\u2019s security concerns and went \"beyond what was strictly required\" in ordering officers to secure various facilities continuously for years, until November 1995 when the First Claimant hired private security.109\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 170; Fakcevic Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\n134.\n\nFifth, the Claimants allege that the Respondent blocked Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s attempts to register its ownership of the Occupied Properties (once Petrinja was liberated) and they became accessible for the first time to the Claimants.110 From 1996 to 2002, the Claimants state that the Respondent frustrated all registration efforts.\n\n*See* Registration Proceedings of File Nos Z-786/96 and Z-2171/91 at the Municipal Court of Petrinja, Appellate Decision of the County Court of Sisak dated 17 February 1997 (C-0110).\n\n135.\n\nThese efforts began in February 1996, when the Claimants sought to register many of the Occupied Properties in the Petrinja Municipal Court at the same time that Holding d.o.o. sought to register the Occupied Properties in its favour. The Municipal Court denied registration to both entities, noting too that the Purchase Agreement did not identify the properties purchased.111 The ruling was affirmed on appeal with the caveat that if Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. could \"obtain the valid document for the land-registry transfer [clearly identifying the land] subsequently, they may ask that the requested registration be carried out by a new proposal.\"112\n\nThe request was made to register Claimants\u2019 ownership over 700 plots on the territory of Petrinja and surrounding municipalities. After making the request, the Claimants learned that Holding d.o.o. had made a request to record its ownership already in 1991 under File No Z-2171/91. The Municipal Court in Petrinja joined the two proceedings into one: Registration Proceedings of File Nos Z-786/96 and Z-2171/91 at the Municipal Court of Petrinja, Appellate Decision of the County Court of Sisak dated 17 February 1997 (C-0110), p 4; *see also* Land Registry Act, Arts 39, 81 (CL-0022) (requiring that an ownership registration petition contain a precise designation of land, including at a minimum, the land plot number and cadastral municipality).\n\nRegistration Proceedings of File Nos Z-786/96 and Z-2171/91 at the Municipal Court of Petrinja, Appellate Decision of the County Court of Sisak dated 17 February 1997 (C-0110), p 3.\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimants also cite the pendency notice on file in the land registry, discussed at paragraph 122 *supra*, which blocked registration of the Occupied Properties until 2002.113\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 183.\n\n137.\n\nBeginning in 2003, after the pendency notice expired, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. initiated seventeen cases to register ownership of the Occupied Properties, six of which were successful, six more of which were initially successful until the Respondent sought to overturn and record its ownership over the properties at issue, and five of which were denied.114\n\nProposal to the Municipal Court of Petrinja dated 29 April 2004, File No Z-516/04, (C-0118); Proposal to the Municipal Court of Petrinja dated 1 September 2004, File No Z-1229/04 (C-0119); Proposal to the Municipal Court of Petrinja dated 24 March 2005, File No 458/05 (C-0120); Proposal to the Municipal Court of Gvozd dated April 15, 2005, File No Z-683/04 (C-0121); Proposal to the Municipal Court of Sisak dated 13 January 2006, File No Z-71/06 (C-0122); Proposal to the Municipal Court of Sisak dated 26 March 2008, File No Z-51/07 (C-0123); further proceedings are displayed in Gulam Statement, Annex I.\n\n138.\n\nSixth, the Claimants claim that the Respondent sold apartments owned by Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. without compensation (**Apartments**).115 Socially-owned companies such as Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR were required by law to provide housing to their employees.116 In keeping with this requirement, Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR had a special organisation known as the Gavrilovi\u0107 Housing Association to manage employee housing.117\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00a7 II.D.6.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 186.\n\nNotification of Deletion of OSIZ, County Commercial Court in Zagreb dated 5 March 1991, attached to Decision of the County Commercial Court in Zagreb No Iz-23/79 dated 18 February 1980 (C-0012).\n\n139.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Croatian courts confirmed six times between 1992 and 1995 that the apartments used for employee housing were owned not by Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR, but instead by Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.118 However, in early 1996, the First Claimant received reports that the City of Petrinja began selling the Apartments. The Claimants allege that the City of Petrinja took months to respond to the First Claimant\u2019s objections over the sale, claiming at the time that Article 5 of the Act on Sale of the Apartments allowed a local authority to sell the Apartments if the owner is unknown.119 When the Claimants asserted ownership of the Apartments on the basis of the six court actions and the Agreement, the State Attorney interfered to inform the City of Petrinja that it was seeking annulment of the Agreement, recommending that the City \"immediately starts selling the said flats that used to be managed by [the Gavrilovi\u0107 Housing Association].\"120 The sale of the Apartments continued for fifteen years, and the Claimants received no compensation for the sale of these properties.121\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Confirmation issued by the Bankruptcy Court to the Municipal Court in Sisak dated 11 February 1992 (C-0074).\n\nLetter from Government of the City of Petrinja to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. dated 8 May 1996 (C-0128).\n\nState Attorney Office\u2019s Opinion No M-292/96, contained in a letter from State Attorney Mr Petar Sale to the Mayor of the City of Petrinja regarding the Opinion on the sale of flats that were managed by the former OSIZ \"Gavrilovi\u0107\" in Petrinja dated 6 August 1996 (C-0130).\n\nZeljko Baranovic, Report addressed to Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 30 November 2009 (C-0133); *see also* Amendment to the Act on Housing Relations (Official Gazette of Croatia No 22/92), Art. 102 (CL-0024), which reads: \"An occupancy right will cease for all those persons who committed or commit acts or hostilities against Croatia.\" The OSCE Mission in Croatia reports that approximately 20,000 people lost housing rights on the basis of this provision: United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT), *Housing and Property Rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro*, Status Report No 12 dated 3 July 2003 (C-0004).\n\n140.\n\nSeventh, the Claimants allege that the Respondent\u2019s conduct prohibited Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. from obtaining financing to expand its operations.122 To begin, the Claimants contend that the Respondent \"frustrate[ed] [the company's] post-war expansion plans.\"123 The Claimants refer to potential financing from the International Finance Corporation (**iFC**), representatives of which visited Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. and advanced funds to prepare a business plan that set out future investment needs and a business strategy.124 The investment plan foresaw investment ranging from DEM 32.4 million to DEM 51.2 million, but the IFC reversed course and decided against the investment given the uncertainties with the legal title over the Occupied Properties.125\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00a7 II.D.7.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00a7 II.D.7(a).\n\nLetter from Mr Vikas Thapar, Chief of Mission of the Regional Mission in Central Europe, IFC, to Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 dated 20 May 1996 (C-0135); Fax from Mr Graeme Rothwell, IFC, to Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 dated 11 June 1996 (C-0134).\n\nIFC 1996 Report (C-0061), Annex 3, Table 2; Smith Statement, \u00b6 6; \"The Austrian Chancellor Klima Does Not Want to Come to Croatia as Long as the Gavrilovi\u0107 Dispute is Not Resolved\", *Vecernji list,* 21-22 June 1999 (C-0080) at p 1 (\"Duro Gavrilovi\u0107 has DEM 15 million of the World Bank frozen due to the lawsuit [\u2026] his arrangement with the World Bank from which he should draw credit tranches in two stages of DEM 15 million, that he would invest into further production development, has been put on ice.\").\n\n141.\n\nOther efforts by the Claimants to secure financing to expand Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. or even to secure favourable commercial terms with suppliers and vendors were similarly unsuccessful due to a lack of a \"specific, recoverable, security registered in the land register.\"126\n\nLetter to Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 from Mr Bruno Ettenauer and Mr Helmut Pitterling, Bank der Osterreichischen Postsparkasse Aktiengesellschaft dated July 5, 1996 (C-0139), p 1; *see also* Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 209-214 (listing lost financing opportunities due to lack of title).\n\n142.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the consequence of the loss of financing was a reduction in projected growth whereby Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. grew only a fraction of the projections of potential investors such as the IFC.127\n\n*See* Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6\u00b6 28 *et seq.;* Fax to Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 from Mr G\u00fcnter LiBner of LiBner Engineering Service dated 28 June 2006 (C-0145); LiBner 2006 Business Plan (C-0144); IFC 2002 Report (C-0142).\n\n143.\n\nDespite the Claimants\u2019 assertions that the Respondent prohibited Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. from obtaining financing, the Respondent contends that it provided State aid and subsidies to the company.128\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 II.E.2.\n\n**F. The Claimants Allege That the Respondent Expropriated Their Purchase of the Gavrilovic Enterprise**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nSince the Purchase Agreement on 11 November 1991, the Claimants entered into negotiations on several occasions in an attempt to settle ownership of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s assets.129 The Respondent characterises its negotiation efforts with the Claimants as a \"constructive discussion\" lasting more than 10 years.130 During negotiation efforts beginning in 1996, the Respondent claims it went so far as to \"recognise the validity of the Purchase Agreement, notwithstanding the numerous violations of the Bankruptcy Act and would, in addition, recognise the Second Claimant\u2019s title to the new and old factories as assets essential to its meat producing activities.\"131 A settlement agreement was drawn up, but never signed.132\n\nGavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 162.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 163; *see also* Memorandum by the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Croatia, 9 January 1998 (R-0052), p 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 163.\n\n145.\n\nFurther negotiations frequently stalled due to what the Respondent claims were the \"First Claimant\u2019s exaggerated demands\", and from 2003 until 2008, the Respondent sought to assert ownership at the land registry over the properties seeking to record title in its favour.133 However, in 2008, a new government and the Claimants agreed to engage a consultant to perform a valuation of the properties at issue.134 The report contained for the first time \"the precise land registry and cadastral designations of\" the properties in dispute.135\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 165.\n\nZeljko Baranovic, Report addressed to Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 30 November 2009 (C-0133).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 237; Barisic Statement, \u00b6 11.\n\n146.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, despite assurances that the Respondent would not assert ownership over the properties in dispute during settlement talks, at least 3,060 of the land plots identified in the report were recorded in the land registry as property of Croatia from 2008 to 2013.136 During the same time period, Croatia assigned the rights to 400 apartments whose ownership was in dispute to third partie s.137 The Respondent paid no compensation to the Claimants for any of these properties.138 What is more, according to the Claimants, they were never notified of these sales until they requested excerpts from the land registry wherein they discovered that plots of land had been registered in Croatia\u2019s name or were removed from the sheet altogether.139\n\nBarisic Statement, \u00b6 82 and Annex 1.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial \u00b6 241, *referring to* Gulam Statement.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial \u00b6 241.\n\nGulam Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 32-37 and Annex III.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent ginned up a face-saving legal basis for the alleged expropriation of the land. To substantiate the transfer of the properties to Croatia, an agency known as the Croatian Privatisation Fund (**Croatian Fund**) issued an opinion, which ultimately served as a legal guideline for the land registry courts to execute the alleged expropriation (**Croatian Fund opinion**).140\n\nCroatian Fund Opinion (C-0550), regarding the application of the Agricultural Land Act (RL-0043) and Ownership Act (CL-0010 / RL-0044).\n\n148.\n\nAccording to the Croatian Fund Opinion, the final division of real property to the Nine Companies never took place due to the war, and as a result, it was not possible to determine which assets belonged to which of the Nine Companies.141 Consequently, the position of the Croatian Fund was that it was also not possible to determine which assets the First Claimant purchased in the bankruptcy sale of the Five Companies.142\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 246.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 246.\n\n149.\n\nThe Croatian Fund concluded that, given the alleged impossibility of determining the assets purchased by the First Claimant, Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act gave Croatia ownership of property by default:143 \"It is deemed that the Republic of Croatia has the right of ownership of all things under social ownership in the territory of the Republic of Croatia regarding which their ownership is not determined.\"144 On this basis, the Croatian Fund concluded that Croatia would be the owner of all of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s properties.145\n\nOwnership Act (CL-0010 / RL-0044), Art 362(3).\n\nOwnership Act (CL-0010 / RL-0044), Art 362(3).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 242-250.\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimants object to the findings of the Croatian Fund, as it granted to Croatia an unprecedented right against Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. only and not against any other privatised company.146 Further, the application of Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act served as a basis to absolve Croatia from having to pay compensation to the Claimants for any sale of any property over which the Claimants claimed an interest.147\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 248.\n\nOwnership Act (CL-0010 / RL-0044), Art 362(3).\n\n151.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent alleges that Croatia\u2019s practice of invoking the default provision enshrined in Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act was widespread.148\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 207.\n\n152.\n\nIn closing, the Claimants note that the Respondent allowed the purchaser\u2014a Croatian national\u2014of a property belonging to Holding d.o.o. (and ultimately one of the Nine Companies not purchased by the First Claimant) to record his ownership of real property in the land registry just two months after the purchase.149 In so doing, the Respondent granted to the purchaser of the property in just 2 months what the Claimants have not been able to achieve in 20 years, namely ownership of the properties purchased through bankruptcy.150\n\nDecision of the Municipal Court in Sisak pertaining to File No 12-P-1171/2011 dated 7 March 2012 (C-0166), p 3; Out-ofCourt Settlement Agreement concluded between the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak and Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging d.o.o. dated 10 May 2011 (C-0168).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 260.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to consider the relevant issues raised by this proceeding. As is apparent from the above factual overview, this proceeding is one of considerable complexity. In that regard, the Tribunal considered that an appropriate means of resolving the myriad issues was for each Party to provide a list of issues to be determined. Each Party did so in advance of the First Hearing in March 2016, and the Tribunal amalgamated those lists so as to prepare a list of issues upon which the Parties were then invited to prepare their post-Hearing submissions.\n\n154.\n\nFurther, at the Second Hearing in September 2016, and by way of further assistance from the Parties, the Tribunal asked the Parties to provide a list of the references to relevant paragraphs of each of their pleadings, post-Hearing and other submissions which dealt with each of the issues to be determined by this Tribunal. The Tribunal expresses its gratitude to the Parties for their assistance in this regard.\n\n155.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal has had regard to all of the submissions of the Parties, as set out below, and to any other submissions of the Parties considered relevant to those issues.\n\n156.\n\nAs will be seen, when it comes to the merits, the Tribunal has considered it expedient to address the matters in dispute in a different order to that provided in the list of issues. Most notably, the first substantive issue to be dealt with is expropriation, which is then followed by an analysis of the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.\n\nIV. **the parties\u2019 requests for relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A.

The Tribunal sent to the Parties a consolidated list on 9 March 2016, and a revised version on 14 March 2016, and invited the Parties\u2019 comments. On 16 March 2016\u2014the final day of the First Hearing\u2014the Parties made further comments on the draft list of issues, and the Tribunal settled the list, save that it reserved its final decision in respect of Issues 5.2, 9.1 and 9.2.158 On 20 April 2016, the Tribunal issued PO 5, which conveyed the decision of the Tribunal on the outstanding issues and annexed the List of Issues.\n\nTr Day 8, 1965:4-15.\n\n165.\n\nAccordingly, the issues to be determined in this case, as agreed by the Parties, are as follows:\n\n**issue 1: Jurisdiction**\n\n1.1 Is each of the Claimants an \"investor\" who has made an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention and the [BIT]? In particular:\n\n1.1(a) Does the ICSID Convention and/or the BIT require that an investment include a contribution of money or assets to an economic venture in the host State?\n\n1.1(b) Did the Claimants satisfy the contribution requirement?\n\n1.1(c) Did the Claimants assume an investment risk?\n\n1.1(d) Are there any other reasons why the Claimants are not properly characterised as \"investors\" who made an \"investment\"?\n\n1.2 Was the alleged investment made in accordance with host State law, so that the Tribunal would have jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 claims? In particular:\n\n1.2(a) Who bears the burden of proof and what is the standard of proof?\n\n1.2(b) Were there any illegalities in relation to the alleged investment (collectively, the Alleged Illegalities), because of:\n\n1.2(b)(i) the decision to place the [Five Companies] into bankruptcy;\n\n1.2(b)(ii) the sale of the [Five Companies] as legal entities;\n\n1.2(b)(iii) the designation of the Swiss account of Inacomm as the destination of the purchase price;\n\n1.2(b)(iv) the payment of sums into the account of Inacomm;\n\n1.2(b)(v) the transfer of monies from the bankruptcy estates to the Second Claimant and third parties during the pending bankruptcy;\n\n1.2(b)(vi) the alleged transfer of monies from the Second Claimant to the [Liquidator] during the pending bankruptcy;\n\n1.2(b)(vii) funds used by the First Claimant to purchase the [Five Companies] were obtained by:\n\n1.2(b)(vii)(A) allegedly inducing the then-Minister of Finance of Croatia to direct Mr Ivica Pape\u0161 to transfer DEM 2 million to the First Claimant;\n\n1.2(b)(vii)(B) the alleged appropriation by the First Claimant of funds from the [Five Companies] before the bankruptcy;\n\n1.2(b)(vii)(C) the alleged appropriation of the daily proceeds of the store of the [Five Companies];\n\n1.2(b)(viii) the alleged investment was made in violation of Croatian criminal law and international law and public policy prohibiting corruption, including due to a misuse of public funds to obtain private material gain;\n\n1.2(b)(ix) the alleged investment was made in the context of arms trafficking and in circumstances violating a UN embargo;\n\n1.2(b)(x) the alleged investment was otherwise made in circumstances of corruption and illegality for another reason?\n\n1.2(c) To the extent that there were any illegalities:\n\n1.2(c)(i) what is the meaning of the term \"in accordance with\" the law of Croatia under Article 11(1) of the BIT?

After determining the applicable law (Issue 3), the Tribunal turns to the merits. It is at this juncture that the Award deviates from the List of Issues, mostly as to sequence.\n\n168.\n\nThe first step is to examine whether the Claimants could establish title to the Properties and Apartments (Issue 4.1, Issue 4.2). This involves four key steps:\n\n(i) determining whether there was a universal succession from Holding d.o.o to the Nine Companies;\n\n(ii) determining, on the evidence, which of the Properties and Apartments have passed to one of the Five Companies through the universal succession;\n\n(iii) determining which of the plots were incapable of being owned by the Claimants at the time of the sale to Gavrilovi\u0107 by force of a pre-sale transfer to the State by way of the Agricultural Land Act, Water Act 1990 or Roads Acts; and\n\n(iv) finally, determining whether on the evidence the Claimants have established that Holding d.o.o in fact held the relevant right of use over the plots at the time of the sale to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal then determines several general matters: the operation of the principles of attribution (Issue 4.7); whether the Respondent is a party to, or otherwise bound by, the Purchase Agreement (Issue 4.8); whether an erroneous application of law gives rise to a treaty violation (Issue 4.9); and the effect of an alleged failure by the Claimants to make use of available domestic remedies (Issue 4.6).\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal then determines whether the Respondent directly or indirectly expropriated the plots to which the Claimants established title to the satisfaction of the Tribunal (Issue 6). On the basis that a breach of the FET standard would result in the same quantum of damages as for a finding of expropriation, the Tribunal then considered whether the Respondent violated a legitimate expectation of the Claimants in respect of the plots to which the Claimants established title to the satisfaction of the Tribunal but were not the subject of an expropriation finding (Issue 5).\n\n171.\n\nReturning to the sequence of the List of Issues, the Tribunal considers whether the Respondent breached Article 8(2), commonly referred to as an \"umbrella clause\" in the BIT (Issue 7), and whether the Respondent accorded the Claimants less favourable treatment than that accorded to a Croatian investor (Issue 8).\n\n172.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers the Claimants\u2019 entitlement to direct and indirect damages (Issue 9), and the appropriate allocation of costs (Issue 10).\n\n**VI. ISSUE 1: JURISDICTION**\n-----------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent objects that the Claimants\u2019 claims are not within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction principally on the grounds that the alleged investment was not made in accordance with Croatian legislation.160 The Respondent argues that the Claimants are not \"investors\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT because they invested illegally and that there is no \"investment\" because the investment itself was illegal. The Respondent raises numerous specific jurisdictional objections, considered in Issues 1.1 and 1.2 *infra*, all of which relate to various instances of alleged illegality. The Tribunal will address some of the objections individually and others as a group because of the substantial overlap of certain objections.\n\nBIT (CL-0025), Art 11 reads:  \n*Application of the Agreement*  \n*The present Agreement shall apply to investments, made in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its legislation, by investors of the other Contracting Party prior to as well as after the entry into force of the present Agreement* [...].\n\n174.\n\nThe scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is defined by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and by Article 9 of the BIT. The provisions of both treaties must be satisfied for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention delineates the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as follows:\n\n*The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State* [...] *and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally*.161\n\nICSID Convention (CL-0099), Art 25(1).\n\n175.\n\nIn order to satisfy the terms of Article 9(1) of the BIT, the Tribunal must determine whether there is a \"dispute arising out of an investment, between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party.\" In this context, the Tribunal will address the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections below.\n\n**ISSUE 1.1: is EACH OF THE CLAIMANTS AN \"INVESTOR\" WHO HAS MADE AN \"INVESTMENT\" UNDER THE ICSID CONVENTION AND THE BIT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nIn order for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this dispute, the Claimants must establish that they are \"investors\" who have made an \"investment\" that is protected by the BIT and within the ambit of the ICSID Convention. First, the Claimants must show that they have made an investment under both treaties. If their interests fall within the scope of an \"investment\" under one of the agreements but not the other, the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction. Article 1(1) of the BIT defines the term \"investment\", and provides relevantly:\n\n*(1) the term \"investment\" comprises all assets linked to business activities and in particular, though not exclusively:*\n\n*(a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem such as mortgages, liens, pledges, usufructs and similar rights;*\n\n*(b) shares and other types of participations in legal entities;*\n\n*(c) claims to money that has been given in order to create an economic value or claims to any performance having an economic value* [...].162\n\nBIT (CL-0025), Art 1(1).\n\n177.\n\nThe use of the phrase \"in particular, though not exclusively\" in the introduction, which precedes the examples of investments listed in the subparagraphs that follow, indicates that the list is not exhaustive and is merely illustrative of the types of \"assets\" that constitute investments.\n\n178.\n\nSecond, the Claimants must demonstrate that they are investors under the BIT. Article 1(2) of the BIT provides relevantly:\n\n*(2) the term \"investor\" means in respect of either Contracting Party:*\n\n(a) nationals of a Contracting Party who make an investment in the other Contracting Party\u2019s territory;\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*(c) any legal entity, or partnership, constituted in accordance with the legislation of a Contracting Party or of a third Party in which the investor referred to in a or b exercises a dominant influence*.163\n\nBIT (CL-0025), Art 1(2).\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground that the Claimants have not satisfied these threshold criteria. That is, the Claimants have not shown that they are \"investors\" who have made an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention and the BIT. According to the Respondent, an investment must be found to exist under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT. This is a \"dual test.\"164 The Respondent notes that tribunals interpreting Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention have identified the characteristics of an \"investment\" as including, *inter alia*, a contribution of money or assets (i.e. a commitment of resources) and an assumption of risk.165 In the Respondent\u2019s view, Article 9 of the BIT, which provides for the settlement of investment disputes, denotes the same requirements.166 It is the Respondent\u2019s position that these characteristics are not present here. The Respondent further alleges that the Claimants cannot be investors under the terms of the Article 1(2) of the BIT because, by definition, being an investor requires the making of an investment, and the Claimants have not properly made an investment.167\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 229.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 233-234.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 240.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 11; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 353.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. are both \"investors\" who have made an \"investment\" pursuant to the ICSID Convention and the BIT.168 Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, an Austrian citizen holding no other citizenship, made an investment in Croatia through his purchase of the Five Companies as well as through non-financial investments and re-investments in Croatia.169 Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. also satisfies the BIT definition of \"investor\" because it is a Croatian legal entity of which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, an Austrian national, is the sole owner and shareholder who \"exercises a dominant influence.\"170\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 143; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 19.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 144; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 20.\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. made an \"investment\" in Croatia. The Claimants point out that the ICSID Convention does not define what constitutes an \"investment.\" According to the Claimants, tribunals therefore generally look to the mutually agreed definition of \"investment\" that is contained in the relevant BIT.171 Article 1(1) of the Austria-Croatia BIT defines \"investment\" as \"all assets linked to business activities\" and offers a non-exclusive list of examples of investments, including movable and immovable property, shares and other forms of participation in legal entities, and claims to money or performance with economic value.172 In line with this definition, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 acquired shares in the Five Companies, which were \"inarguably linked to business activities\", through a bankruptcy sale.173 This investment included movable and immovable property belonging to the Five Companies as well as rights to intellectual property and other rights.174 Thus, according to the Claimants, the requirements of the BIT and the ICSID Convention are satisfied.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00b6 145; Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 265-272; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 23.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 24.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 24.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimants are \"investors\" and that they have made an \"investment\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT. It is undisputed that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is a national of Austria and that he holds no other citizenship.175 There is also no question that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 owns an asset in Croatia, namely, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. This asset is the shareholding of a Croatian company, which in turn owns movable and immovable property, and it plainly falls within the definition of an \"investment\" under Article 1(1) of the BIT. Accordingly, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is an investor under Article 1(2)(a) of the BIT. Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., a legal entity over which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 \"exercises a dominant influence\" as the sole owner, is also an \"investor\" under Article 1(2)(c) of the BIT.176\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00b6 143; Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 271; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 10 (\"It is not doubted that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is an Austrian citizen\n\nIt is not disputed that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 \"exercises a dominant influence over his wholly-owned company, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., which is incorporated under the law of Croatia\": Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 10. *See also* Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 272.\n\n183.\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention allows a juridical person having the nationality of one Contracting State to be treated as a national of the other Contracting State where, because of foreign control, the parties have so agreed. In Article 1(2)(c) of the BIT, Croatia and Austria agreed that an entity constituted in accordance with the laws of Croatia over which a foreign investor exercises a dominant influence shall be treated as an \"investor.\" It is the combination of these two provisions that allows Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. to be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and an \"investor\" within the meaning of the BIT. That Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. is also an \"investment\" under the BIT does not affect this conclusion. In fact, in most cases, where a company formed under the law of the host State is considered to be an investor by reason of its foreign control, that same company will also be an investment for the purposes of the ICSID Convention and the relevant BIT.\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the fact that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is an Austrian national and that he exercises a dominant influence over Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for both Claimants to be considered to be \"investors.\" Rather, the Claimants must also have made an \"investment\" in accordance with the BIT and the ICSID Convention. According to the Respondent, the Claimants have failed to meet the \"investment\" condition because they did not make a contribution and did not assume an investment risk, elements which are required under what has come to be known as the *Salini* test.177 The Tribunal considers that the Respondent\u2019s arguments in this regard raise four distinct issues, which the Tribunal will address in turn: (Issue 1.1(a)) whether the ICSID Convention and/or the BIT require that an investment include a contribution of money or assets; (Issue 1.1(b)) whether the Claimants satisfied that contribution requirement; (Issue 1.1(c)) whether the Claimants assumed an investment risk; and (Issue 1.1(d)) whether there are any other reasons why the Claimants are not properly characterised as \"investors\" who made an \"investment.\" These issues are discussed below.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 253-296.\n\n***Issue 1.1(a): Does the ICSID Convention and/or the BIT require that an investment include a contribution of money or assets to an economic venture in the host State?***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent contends that both the ICSID Convention and the BIT require that an investment include a contribution of money or assets to an economic venture in the host State.178 The Respondent cites ICSID case law for the proposition that a contribution is \"one of at least three necessary elements of an 'investment' for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\"179 Such contribution entails \"a basic cross-border *quid pro quo*.\"180\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 17-23.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 19.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 355.\n\n186.\n\nThe term \"investment\" has an ordinary meaning in both the ICSID Convention and the BIT which \"denotes a commitment of capital in a specific venture with the expectation of future return.\"181 The Respondent maintains that Article 1(1) of the BIT does not alter the ordinary meaning of \"investment.\" Rather, it \"provides that no category of assets is by definition excluded, but not that an asset is an 'investment.'\"182\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 22.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 22. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 237-247.\n\n187.\n\nFinally, the contribution of money or assets must be to an economic venture in the host State. In other words, the investment must have a territorial nexus to Croatia.183\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 23.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Claimants counter that neither the BIT nor the Convention requires that an investment include a contribution. They view the relationship between the definition of \"investment\" under the BIT and the ICSID Convention differently from the Respondent. According to the Claimants, \"unless the BIT definition falls squarely outside the objective meaning of investment, an investment that meets the test under the BIT will also meet the test under the Convention.\"184\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 422. *See also* Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 410-416.\n\n189.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT contains no explicit obligation that an investor contributes money or assets to an economic venture in the host State185 and no such condition should be read into the BIT after the fact.186 It is the Claimants\u2019 position that had Austria and Croatia considered a contribution requirement necessary for an investment to qualify for protection under the BIT and thus to trigger the respondent State\u2019s consent to arbitral jurisdiction, they would have included one.187\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 25.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 33.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 33.\n\n190.\n\nFurther, the Claimants assert that the *Salini* test propounded by the Respondent\u2014which includes a contribution element\u2014does not enumerate rigid jurisdictional requirements but merely identifies \"typical characteristics of investments\" under the ICSID Convention.188\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 269; Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 418; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 28.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe ICSID Convention does not define the term \"investment.\" Given the absence of a definition, the Respondent refers to the illustrative criteria for determining the existence of an \"investment\" laid out in various arbitral awards, most notably in *Salini v Morocco*.189 Some tribunals have adopted some or all of the characteristics of this so-called \"*Salini* test\" in an effort to identify a universal definition of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention.190 In so doing, some have applied the criteria mandatorily and cumulatively, such that if one element is missing, jurisdiction fails.\n\n*See* *Salini Costruttori S.p.A and Italstrade S.p.A. v Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001 (CL-0029).\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/11, Award on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004, \u00b6 53 (RL-0063); *See also* *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No ARB/98/2, Award, 8 May 2008, \u00b6 232 and *Patrick Mitchell v Democratic Republic of the Congo*, ICSID Case No ARB/99/7, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award, 1 November 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 29, 33.\n\n192.\n\nThis Tribunal takes a different view, and considers it appropriate to defer to the State parties\u2019 articulation of the meaning of \"investment\" in their instrument of consent to arbitration, namely, the BIT. In entering into such a treaty, State parties agree to protect certain kinds of economic activity, and in providing that disputes between investors and States relating to that activity may be resolved through arbitration, they evince their belief that such activity constitutes an \"investment\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention. This judgment as to which economic activities constitute investments should be given considerable weight and deference. A tribunal would need compelling reasons to disregard such a mutually agreed definition of investment. The Tribunal will not impose additional requirements beyond those expressed on the face of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n193.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal recognises that the *Salini* test may be useful in certain circumstances; for instance, where a tribunal is concerned that a BIT or contract definition of investment is so broad and overreaching as to capture transactions that manifestly are not investments under any acceptable conception. Indeed, a number of tribunals and *ad hoc* committees have viewed the *Salini* elements as non-binding, nonexclusive means of identifying (rather than defining) investments that are consistent with the ICSID Convention.191 However, in most cases, including this one, it is appropriate to defer to the State parties\u2019 definition of investment as supplied in the BIT.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008 (***Biwater v Tanzania***) (RL-0117), \u00b6\u00b6 312-318; *Malaysian Historical Salvors SDN BHD v Government of Malaysia*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/10, Decision on the Application for Annulment, 16 April 2009 (RL-0058), \u00b6\u00b6 75-79; *see also* *M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/6, Award, 31 July 2007, \u00b6 165; *RSM Production Corp. v Grenada*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/14, Award, 13 March 2009 (RL-0240), \u00b6\u00b6 236-238. The first tribunals to directly address an objection that the claimant lacked an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention did not search for or apply definitions. For example, in *Fedax v Venezuela*, the tribunal simply surveyed prior cases concerning investments under the Convention before concluding that the promissory notes before it also qualified as investments: *Fedax N.V. v Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case. No ARB/96/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997 (***Fedax v Venezuela***) (CL-0118), \u00b6\u00b6 25-29. In *CSOB v Slovakia*, the tribunal declined respondent\u2019s request to apply a definition, stating that while the \"elements of the suggested definition [\u2026] tend as a rule to be present in most investments, [they] are not a formal prerequisite for the finding that a transaction constitutes an investment as that concept is understood under the Convention\": *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999 (CL-0187), \u00b6 90.\n\n194.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal need not rule on the applicability of the *Salini* test because it finds, as discussed in its analysis of Issues 1.1(b) and 1.1(c) below, that the Claimants have met the relevant requirements. To the extent that showing a \"contribution of money or assets to an economic venture in the host State\" is required, the Tribunal is satisfied that the requirement is met here, as discussed below.\n\n***Issue 1.1(b): Did the Claimants satisfy the contribution requirement?***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimants failed to satisfy the contribution requirement as they did not make a substantial commitment of economic resources in Croatia.192 In this regard, the Respondent makes four principal arguments.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 216.\n\n196.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 never actually paid for the Five Companies.193 The supposed contribution did not go into the separate estates of the Five Companies, which were bankrupt, as should have occurred under Croatian law. Instead, the contribution went into \"entirely different pockets\"194\u2014namely, the Swiss bank account of Inacomm, an \"unconnected\" Panamanian subsidiary of INA (Croatia\u2019s national oil company)195\u2014and was used for purposes other than paying off bankruptcy creditors.196 The payment did not amount to a contribution of capital in the territory of Croatia because it was made to the account of a Panamanian company in Switzerland.197 According to the Respondent, the fact that the Claimants allege that the payment was later forwarded to the bankruptcy estates \"inherently accepts that payments to [the Panamanian company] are not a suitable commitment of resources in Croatia but instead require repatriation in a further transaction.\"198\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 257.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 257; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 378-425.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 258; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 26.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 26.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 27 (emphasis omitted).\n\n197.\n\nSecond, according to the Respondent, the source of capital for the investment was improper because Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 did not commit his own financial resources.199 Instead, DEM 2 million of the total purchase price was made up of funds originating from, and belonging to, the budget of Croatia and the remaining funds were \"fleeced\" from the Five Companies.200\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 426-434. Respondent asserts that \"the Claimants [have not] been able to produce the (completely unsecured) alleged loan over DEM 1 million with Bankhaus Feichtner or any proof of the supposed commitment of family savings\": Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 31.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 265-267.\n\n198.\n\nThird, the Respondent contends that the Five Companies were sold at a price far below their value.201 The Respondent cites the book value of the companies as the relevant comparator.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 272-279; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 435-454.\n\n199.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asserts that any \"re-investment\" or subsequent re-integration of profits, alleged by the Claimants to have taken place, \"cannot cure the lack of an actual contribution of resources in the first place\"202 and any alleged non-monetary contributions are without substance and lacking evidentiary support.203\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 280; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 464-474; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 358.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 455-463.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Claimants take issue with each of the Respondent\u2019s objections. First, the Claimants assert that they contributed to an economic venture in Croatia by transferring the purchase price for the Five Companies in the amount and to the account specified by the seller, the Bankruptcy Court.204 The Claimants emphasise that the destination of the purchase price payment was set by the seller205 and that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was simply following the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s instructions. According to the Claimants, \"it was neither [Mr Gavrilovi\u0107's] duty, nor within his power to ensure that those payments as ordered were later forwarded [\u2026] to the bankruptcy estates.\"206 Further, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 sought express representations from the Bankruptcy Court that the payment would have complete \"debt-discharging effect\", an assurance which the Court gave in writing on three separate occasions.207\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 39.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 41.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 42.\n\n201.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that the ownership and origin of the invested funds is irrelevant since neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT requires a foreign investor to finance an investment using his own resources or to use funds originating from a particular location.208 Citing *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine*, the Claimants assert that \"[w]hat is relevant under the applicable BIT (Article 1(2)) is that an Austrian investor makes an investment in the territory of Croatia. [...] Gavrilovi\u0107 'caused' an investment to be made [...] when he decided to dedicate financial resources under his 'control' to the Gavrilovi\u0107 companies.\"209 In the Claimants\u2019 view, this is sufficient for an investment.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 433.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 434 (emphasis in original).\n\n202.\n\nThird, the Claimants argue that the amount of the purchase price has no bearing on jurisdiction because there is no requirement that an investment be made for a specific value.210 The Claimants cite the decisions of numerous tribunals that have refused to look into the adequacy of consideration and have rejected jurisdictional objections on the basis that the amount invested was insufficient.211 The Claimants further assert that the Respondent\u2019s contention that a competitive public auction does not determine the market value of an asset makes no economic sense.212 Similarly, the Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding estimated book value do not account for the exceptional circumstances of war and occupation which created uncertainty in relation to the Five Companies and their assets.213\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 46.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 47. For example, the Claimants cite *Investmart v Czech Republic* for the proposition that looking into the adequacy of consideration is improper as it would imply an additional requirement of \"a qualitatively adequate investment\" and *Phoenix v Czech Republic* for the notion that the \"existence of a nominal price is not a bar to finding\" an investment:   \n*Investmart, B.V. v Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award, 26 June 2009 (***Investmart v Czech Republic***) (CL-0182), \u00b6\u00b6 188-189; *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009 (***Phoenix Action v Czech****Republic***) (RL-0046), \u00b6 119.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 52.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 54.\n\n203.\n\nFinally, the Claimants counter that in any case their subsequent investments and re-investments, including non-monetary contributions, are sufficient to satisfy any contribution requirement read into the BIT or the ICSID Convention.214\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 58.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nConsidering this objection in isolation of the other objections going to illegality, which are addressed below, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants made a contribution for the reasons set forth below. First, in purchasing the Five Companies, the Claimants made a contribution in Croatia. The Claimants paid the purchase price in the amount and to the account confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court.215\n\n*See* September 1991 Bankruptcy Ruling (C-0035); and Ruling of Zagreb County Commercial Court confirming payment to Inacomm International S.A. dated 3 March 1992 (R-0032), Confirmation of the Bankruptcy Court dated 3 March 1992 (C-0266) and Letter from Dr Bruno Ettanauer to Dr Zdravko Tuk\u0161a dated 17 March 1992 (C-0263) (Bankruptcy Court confirmations that payment of the purchase price to Inacomm will have debt-discharging effect). As the *Fedax v Venezuela* tribunal recognised, \"[i]t is a standard feature of many international financial transactions that the funds involved are not physically transferred to the territory of the beneficiary, but put at its disposal elsewhere\": *Fedax v Venezuela* (CL-0118), \u00b6 41.\n\n205.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there was no contribution in Croatia because the purchase price was directed to a Swiss bank account and not to the bankruptcy accounts of each of the Five Companies. Putting the question of illegality to one side, and focusing simply on the fact that the Bankruptcy Court designated an account in Switzerland for the purposes of paying for the Five Companies, however unconventional from the perspective of a bankruptcy proceeding that might be, that does not in the Tribunal\u2019s view change the operative fact that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, in purchasing the Five Companies, obtained an asset in Croatia.216 It is not relevant that the Court directed the payment to be made to a bank account outside of Croatia. Indeed, in general a seller is free to designate payment in the manner and to the destination it deems appropriate. The modern reality is that payments for assets are not always made to accounts located in the same place as the assets underlying the transaction.217 The fact that the funds used to purchase the investment were sent to a Swiss bank account does not serve to situate the investment outside of Croatia. As the *SGS v Philippines* tribunal concluded, it is the location of the asset in question that constitutes the \"centre of gravity\" and the \"focal point\" as far as the territorial aspect of an \"investment\" is concerned.218 In other words, what matters is the location of the asset, not the bank account into which payment for the asset is made. In this case, the \"centre of gravity\" of the Five Companies, now Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., is Croatia.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Claimants have characterized the \"seller\" as the Croatian Bankruptcy Court. This is not correct. The seller was the Liquidator (also referred to as the Bankruptcy Trustee).\n\n*Fedax v Venezuela* (CL-0118), \u00b6 41.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No ARB/02/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004 (CL-0072), \u00b6\u00b6 62 and 101-112 (holding that the \"focal point of SGS\u2019s services was the provision, in the Philippines\", of certain services, and the fact that other services and payments were made outside the Philippines did not change the tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the investment was made \"in the territory\" of the Philippines).\n\n206.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, it would be elevating form over substance to accept that for Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s payments to qualify as an investment in Croatia under the BIT, he had to insist that he transfer the payment to a Croatian bank account\u2014or, more specifically, into the bankruptcy accounts of the Five Companies\u2014and to ensure after the transfer was completed that the funds in question were used to satisfy the creditors.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal sees fit to note, again separately from its consideration of the alleged illegality of the loan below, that it does not believe that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 acted improperly in making the payments in the manner he did. While it is to be expected that in the ordinary course of conducting bankruptcy proceedings, a supervisory court would require that the proceeds of sale be paid directly into the account(s) of the bankruptcy estate(s)\u2014a universal feature of all national bankruptcy laws with which the Tribunal is familiar\u2014this is not what the Bankruptcy Court did in the instant case, and the fact is that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s bank transferred the sum in accordance with that direction. Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s bank repeatedly requested confirmation and the Bankruptcy Court repeatedly confirmed that the instructed action would have full \"debt-discharging effect.\"219\n\n*See* Ruling of Zagreb County Commercial Court confirming payment to Inacomm International S.A. dated 3 March 1992 (R-0032); Confirmation of the Bankruptcy Court dated 3 March 1992 (C-0266); Letter from Dr Bruno Ettanauer to Dr Zdravko Tuk\u0161a dated 17 March 1992 (C-0263).\n\n208.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s arguments that the payments were improper as a matter of Croatian law because they were not made directly to the bankruptcy accounts are misplaced. Whether the payment was contrary to Croatian law is not relevant for the present narrow question of whether Claimants were \"investors\" who made an \"investment.\"220 It is, however, relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of whether the investment was made in accordance with Croatian law, as discussed in Issue 1.2 *infra*.\n\n*See* *Fedax v Venezuela* (CL00118), \u00b6 40 (finding that \"[w]hile specific issues relating to the promissory notes and their endorsements might be discussed in connection with the merits of the case, the argument made by the Republic of Venezuela that the notes were not purchased on the Venezuelan stock exchanges does not take them out of the category of foreign investment because these instruments were intended for international circulation.\").\n\n209.\n\nSecond, the source of the funds is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether there was an \"investment\" under the BIT. The BIT contains no requirement that funds used to purchase an investment come from the personal assets or accounts of an investor, and the Tribunal sees no reason to impose one. The Respondent\u2019s arguments concerning the legality of the funds in question are more appropriately considered in Issue 1.2 *infra*, and are not relevant to the narrow question of whether an \"investment\" has been made.\n\n210.\n\nThird, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the amount of the purchase price is similarly immaterial. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT requires that the purchase price of a particular asset reach a certain threshold in order to constitute an \"investment\" and the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to read such a requirement into them. Other arbitral tribunals have agreed, finding it unnecessary to inquire into the adequacy of consideration absent a directive to do so from the operative legal instruments.221 Even if the amount of the contribution were relevant, under the circumstances there is nothing objectionable about the price Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 paid. The Respondent\u2019s contention that the book value of the companies is more reflective of their market value than their public tender sale price fails to take account of the fact that the principal asset, the main factory, was in a war zone at the time of the bid\u2019s making.\n\nThe tribunal in *Investmart v Czech Republic* refused to look into the adequacy of consideration because it would imply an additional requirement of \"a qualitatively adequate investment\": *Investmart v Czech Republic* (CL-0182), \u00b6\u00b6 188-189. In *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic*, the tribunal held that the \"existence of a nominal price is not a bar to finding that there exists an investment\": *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic* (RL-0046), \u00b6 119. Further, in *Vannessa Ventures*, the tribunal found that a \"nominal purchase price does not of itself necessarily indicate that there was no real investment by Claimant\": *Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/04/6, Award, 16 January 2013 (CL-0191), \u00b6\u00b6 122-123.\n\n211.\n\nIn light of this finding, the Tribunal need not consider whether the Claimants\u2019 subsequent investments, re-investments, and non-monetary contributions would be sufficient to satisfy a \"contribution\" requirement.\n\n212.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal finds that the locus of the relevant economic activity was in Croatia and that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s payments in relation to the purchase of the Five Companies amounted to a \"contribution.\"\n\n***Issue 1.1(c): Did the Claimants assume an investment risk?***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal should decline to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that the Claimants did not assume an investment risk, as required by the *Salini* test. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the concept of \"risk\" should be \"understood in the context of an allocation of resources.\"222 In order to assume \"risk\", according to the Respondent, one must allocate one\u2019s own resources.223 The Respondent maintains that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 did not allocate any of his \"own\" capital to an economic venture in Croatia.224 Rather, the funds he used to pay Inacomm belonged to the Croatian State and the bankruptcy estates.225 As Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 made no contribution, he could have no risk of loss (i.e. no investment risk).226 Similarly, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. could not have assumed an investment risk \"[b]eing at most the object of the purchase.\"227\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 293.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 III.B.2(b); Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00a7 III.A.4.; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 37.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 481; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 475; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimants counter that they assumed an investment risk as evidenced by: (i) the unsustainability of the Respondent\u2019s \"no-contribution\" theory228 and the fact that \"[w]henever there is contribution there is an investment risk;\"229 (ii) the Claimants\u2019 commitment of resources under their control to purchase the Five Companies \"with a view toward generating profits and rebuilding a war-torn area of Croatia\" was an action which necessarily involves some risk;230 (iii) the twofold risk inherent in investing in bankrupt companies: that of not being able to revitalise the bankrupt entities into profitable businesses and that of losing the (often small) amount paid;231 (iv) the very fact that there is currently a dispute before this Tribunal;232 and (v) the economic and political climate prevailing in Croatia at the time of the investment, namely, that the country was embroiled in a civil war.233\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 457.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 78.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 80.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 79, *citing* *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic* (RL-0046), \u00b6 127.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 458, *citing* *Fedax v Venezuela* (CL-0118), \u00b6 40.\n\nThe Claimants argue that economic and political risk would satisfy the criteria of investment risk, citing *Kardassopoulos v Georgia* for the proposition that the risk component is satisfied by virtue of the prevailing \"political and economic climate\": Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 459, *citing* *Ioannis Kardassopoulos v Georgia*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 July 2007 (***Kardassopoulos v Georgia***) (CL-0117).\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. The Respondent\u2019s argument that \"no contribution\" was made and therefore the Claimants assumed \"no risk\" is unsupported by the facts. It has already been determined that the Claimants made a contribution.234 In so doing, they assumed the risk that they would lose all or part of that contribution. This is the risk inherent in the purchase of any business, regardless of whether the business is in bankruptcy or whether it is solvent. As the *KT Asia v Kazakhstan* tribunal observed, whenever \"an investor commits resources with a view to generating profits, [this] necessarily implies a risk.\"235\n\n*See* the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of Issue 1.1(b) *supra*.\n\n*KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013 (CL-0032), \u00b6 170.\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondent insists that the Claimants could not have made a contribution because Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 did not use his own personal funds to purchase the Five Companies. However, as the Tribunal has explained, the source of the funds that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 used to purchase the Five Companies is not relevant to whether Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is an investor who made an investment. There is no requirement under the BIT, the ICSID Convention, international law, or otherwise that a prospective investor must use his or her personal funds in order to be found to have made a contribution that qualifies as an investment.236 In the instant case, the Claimants made a contribution when they used funds at their disposal to pay for the Five Companies and made the payment in the amount and to the account specified by the seller. The question whether those funds were legally obtained is a distinct question that the Tribunal addresses separately below.\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine*, ICSID Case No ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2004 (RL-0072), \u00b6\u00b6 75, 78. The word \"make\" does not require that an investment is made with private savings of the investor, as the Respondent continues to imply.\n\n217.\n\nThat the Claimants took a risk in investing in Croatia is further evidenced by the economic and political circumstances in which the Claimants made their investment. At the time, Croatia was in the midst of a war of independence and considerable uncertainty surrounded the fate of the assets belonging to the Five Companies, some of which were in Serbian-occupied territory. Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 assumed a number of risks, including that some of the assets belonging to the Five Companies might be destroyed during the war and that he would be unable to gain access to or claim title to the assets, depending on the war\u2019s outcome. Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 also took on the general commercial risk that his investment would not become a profitable commercial enterprise.\n\n218.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants assumed an investment risk when they purchased the Five Companies.\n\n***Issue 1.1(d): Are there any other reasons why the Claimants are not properly characterised as \"investors\" who made an \"investment\"?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nAfter carefully considering all of the facts on the record and the arguments set forth by the Parties, the Tribunal sees no other reason why the Claimants are not properly characterised as \"investors\" who made an \"investment.\" The Tribunal notes that many of the arguments that the Respondent has advanced regarding the Claimants\u2019 status as \"investors\" and their lack of \"investment\" relate to the Respondent\u2019s illegality objections, an important set of issues to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\n220.\n\nAs the Tribunal notes at paragraph 173 *supra*, certain objections, specifically those relating to the legality, or not, of the making of the investment, are better suited to being treated collectively.\n\n**ISSUE 1.2: WAS THE ALLEGED INVESTMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH HOST STATE LAW, SO THAT THE TRIBUNAL WOULD HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE CLAIMANTS' CLAIMS?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nPursuant to the BIT, Croatia cannot be found to have consented to ICSID arbitration, and consequently to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, unless the investment in question in a particular dispute arising under the BIT was made \"in accordance with\" the law of Croatia, the host State. Article 11(1) of the BIT provides in relevant part, \"[t]he present Agreement shall apply to investments, made in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its legislation, by investors of the other Contracting Party [...]\".237 The Respondent raises a number of objections to jurisdiction on the grounds that the alleged investment was plagued with illegalities such that the Respondent cannot be found to have consented to arbitration.238 The Claimants deny each of the alleged illegalities.\n\nBIT (CL-0025), Art 11(1) (emphasis added).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there has been some shifting in the nature of the illegalities alleged by the Respondent over the course of this arbitration. The Respondent provided more definition to the Alleged Illegalities in its post-Hearing submissions. The Tribunal considers all of the Respondent\u2019s allegations, including in particular those in its post-Hearing submissions.\n\n222.\n\nIn this section of the Award, the Tribunal will follow a somewhat different order than that displayed in the treatment of the previous objections. It does so because the objections based on the alleged illegality of the investment are to a considerable extent interrelated, and for this reason the Tribunal considers it appropriate to treat them holistically. In addition, the Tribunal has found it necessary to review the record as a whole in so far as it pertains to the First Claimant\u2019s acquisition of the Five Companies, his merging them into the Second Claimant, and then the steps taken thereafter to effect payment for the Five Companies. Accordingly, the Tribunal will recount the Parties\u2019 arguments for each of the grounds of illegality, and then deal with them collectively.\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal notes further that in addition to the actors who were indisputably emanations of the State\u2014the Bankruptcy Council (comprising three judges), the Bankruptcy Judge, Mr Zdravko Tuk\u0161a, and the late Minister of Finance, Mr Jozo Martinovi\u0107\u2014for the purposes of this section of its analysis it has also included: (i) the Emergency Board appointed by the Croatian Agency because it assumed the management of Holding d.o.o. in July 1991 and one month later took the decision to initiate bankruptcy proceedings, and (ii) the Liquidator who was responsible for the actual administration of the bankruptcy proceeding. The Tribunal will not deal with the question of whether the acts of the Emergency Board and the Liquidator can be attributed to the State for the purposes of international responsibility at this juncture; rather, that will be addressed in Issue 4.7 *infra*. The rest of the actors all qualify as State organs, and therefore except in so far as the question of illegality might affect the analysis, no question of attribution arises in respect of their acts.\n\n224.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Parties disagree as to who bears the burden of proof with regard to the Respondent\u2019s illegality claims and to what standard these allegations must be proved. The Tribunal considers the burden and standard of proof first, before turning to the Respondent\u2019s substantive illegality objections.\n\n***Issue 1.2(a): Who bears the burden of proof and what is the standard of proof?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants bear the burden of proving jurisdiction, which, under the terms of the relevant instruments, includes \"showing that the supposed investment was made in accordance with Croatian legislation.\"239 According to the Respondent, the Claimants have a duty to prove the factual elements necessary to establish that the investment was made \"lawfully and in good faith.\"240 The Respondent can cast doubt on the Claimants\u2019 factual allegations, but it bears no burden of proof itself.241\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 320. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 319-323; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 2490.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 32.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\n226.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the standard of proof is the preponderance of the evidence, i.e. that an allegation must be shown to be \"more likely than not\" to be true.242 This standard is \"not technical or fixed, but discretionary.\"243 According to the Respondent, there is no heightened or special standard for proving fraud, corruption, or unlawfulness in international investment arbitration, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 contention.244\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 323.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 487. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 323.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 487-511; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 50.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimants counter that the Respondent bears the burden of proof with regard to any alleged illegality defence, asserting that \"[t]he burden to prove illegality and corruption rests with the party making the allegation.\"245 The Respondent alleges illegality and so bears the burden of proving it. The Claimants acknowledge that tribunals have held that this burden may shift once a party presents sufficient evidence to raise a presumption of illegality, but the evidence must be sufficient to prove the fact and not merely a \"red flag.\"246\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 89. *See also* Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 463.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 241.\n\n228.\n\nThe standard of proving illegality, according to the Claimants, is \"clear and convincing evidence.\"247 Corruption and illegality require this heightened standard of proof, and \"mere insinuations or inferences of wrongdoing will not suffice.\"248\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 99-110.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 461. *See also* Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 225, 230.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent bears the burden of proving illegality. As an initial matter, it is worth noting that the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the BIT do not provide guidance for determining which party bears the burden of proof. Rule 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules notes simply that the \"tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced *and of its probative value*.\" In the absence of mandatory rules as to how a tribunal should judge the probative value of evidence put before it, therefore, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to apply the general approach taken in international dispute settlement which is not characterised by formal rules of evidence.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the approach taken by *Asian Agricultural Products v Sri Lanka*, namely that with regard to \"proof of individual allegations advanced by the parties in the course of proceedings, the burden of proof rests upon the party alleging the fact.\"249 That is, the party making an allegation bears the burden of proving it. Numerous other ICSID tribunals have reaffirmed this principle. In the words of the tribunal in *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine*, the \"principle of *onus probandi actori incumbit* [...] is widely recognized in practice before international tribunals.\"250 The tribunal in *Quiborax v Bolivia* explained the rationale behind this standard:\n\n[T]*he party alleging a breach of the legality requirement, i.e. the host State, bears the burden of proof. The contrary proposition would be unrealistic: the investor would have to somehow prove that it has complied with the myriad laws and regulations of the host State. Hence, the burden of proof must naturally rest with the party alleging a breach of the legality requirement. This view is confirmed by the cases, doctrine, and Respondent\u2019s own position*251.\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. (AAPL) v Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No ARB/87/3, Award, 27 June 1990 (***AAPL v Sri Lanka***) (CL-0267), \u00b6 56 (*citing* B. Cheng, *General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals* (Grotius Publications, 1987), p 327).\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine*, ICSID Case No ARB/02/18, Award, 26 July 2007 (***Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine***) (CL-0065), \u00b6 121.\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2012 (RL-0019), \u00b6 259.\n\n231.\n\nSince the Respondent has alleged that the Claimants\u2019 investment was not made in accordance with host State law, the Respondent bears the burden of proving that allegation. Given the passage of time since the events at issue, it would be unreasonable in the present case to expect the Claimants to prove that they have not violated any of the multitude of laws of Croatia since 1992. Rather, the onus must be on the Respondent State to identify which laws it alleges the Claimants have violated and to prove that violations did occur. It is only once the alleging party supplies sufficient evidence to support its allegation that the burden \"shifts\" to the other party to rebut the allegation.252\n\n*AAPL v Sri Lanka* (CL-0267), \u00b6 56.\n\n232.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Respondent has sought to do so primarily in three respects: (i) whether the bankruptcy through which the investment was acquired was carried out in accordance with Croatian legislation; (ii) whether the loan granted by the Minister of Finance to the First Claimant was lawful (a matter which also appears to be at the centre of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s trial for war profiteering); and (iii) the First Claimant\u2019s engagement in alleged illegality by his admitted currency smuggling in aid of Croatia\u2019s attempts to circumvent the UN embargo on arms purchases.\n\n233.\n\nThe second issue dividing the Parties relates to the standard of proof, specifically, what level of evidence would be sufficient to prove an assertion and would result in shifting the burden of proof to the other party. The Respondent argues that the \"more likely than not\" standard should apply, while the Claimants argue for a \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard. The Tribunal will revert to this at the end of its analysis of the illegality claims.\n\n234.\n\nAs noted previously, a number of different strands of argument have been advanced in relation to the illegality objections. The Tribunal will therefore set out each strand and the Parties\u2019 arguments in respect thereof, before dealing with the objections as a whole.\n\n***Issue 1.2(b): Were there any illegalities in relation to the alleged investment (collectively, the Alleged Illegalities), because of the following?***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Issue 1.2(b)(i): Were there any illegalities in relation to the alleged investment (collectively, the **Alleged Illegalities**), because of the decision to place the Five Companies into bankruptcy?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the decision to place the Five Companies into bankruptcy was unlawful because it violated Croatian law, specifically Articles 2 and 72 of the Bankruptcy Act. According to the Respondent, in order to lawfully commence bankruptcy proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act, it is first necessary to show that a company is permanently incapable of making payments, i.e. that the company is insolvent.253 Since there was no credible evidence of the Five Companies\u2019 insolvency provided at the time, the decision to place these companies into bankruptcy was unlawful.254 The Respondent asserts that \"there is no documentation or evidence whatsoever of any permanent inability to pay debtors in (*i*) the bankruptcy propositions, (*ii*) the management board decision to which these refer, (*iii*) the Holding decisions to which the latter in turn refer, or (*iv*) the court decisions.\"255\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 348; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 100.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54, 100, 92-130.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 532.\n\n236.\n\nFurther, it is the Respondent\u2019s position that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 orchestrated a \"fabricated\" bankruptcy.256 At the same time, however, the Respondent also argues that \"the exact extent of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s personal involvement is not material to the fact that the bankruptcy through which he acquired the alleged investment was not commenced in accordance with Croatian bankruptcy law.\"257\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 II.C.2(a); Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 54-55, 65.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 56.\n\n237.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 argument that the Respondent made the decision to place the Five Companies into bankruptcy as \"immaterial and misleading\", on the basis that the individuals sitting on the Emergency Board who made the decision were private persons, even though they were appointed by the Respondent.258\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 55.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimants advance a number of counter arguments. First, they assert that the Respondent made the decision to place the Five Companies into bankruptcy without any influence from Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.259 The Emergency Board, which was appointed by the Respondent, was responsible for the decision in question and its actions are attributable to the Respondent. The Respondent has failed to demonstrate that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was involved in, or in any way influenced, this decision.260\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 121-128.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 125-128.\n\n239.\n\nSecond, according to the Claimants, the evidence shows that the decision to place the Five Companies into bankruptcy was valid.261 The Claimants argue that the Five Companies were insolvent, citing documents that show the Five Companies\u2019 inability to meet their obligations.262 Further, the Respondent has not presented any evidence that the Five Companies were solvent at the time of their bankruptcies.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 129-143.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 133-136.\n\n240.\n\nFinally, it is the Claimants\u2019 position that the record indicates that the opening of bankruptcy proceedings was legally justified.263 The Claimants assert that the Respondent\u2019s argument that there was no evidence of insolvency in violation of Article 2 of the Bankruptcy Act \"cannot be credited\" as \"[c]ontemporaneous documents establish the insolvency of the Five Companies.\"264 Similarly, there was no violation of Article 72, as legal experts on the relevant law have opined that an application for bankruptcy by the debtor (as was the case here) is sufficient to support a presumption that a reason for bankruptcy exists.265\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 144-152.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 145.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 146-152.\n\n*Issue 1.2(b)(ii): Were there any illegalities in relation to the alleged investment (collectively, the **Alleged Illegalities**), because of the sale of the Five Companies as legal entities?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the sale of the Five Companies as legal entities violated Article 129 of the Bankruptcy Act and was therefore illegal.266 According to the Respondent, by default, bankruptcy assets should be sold off piecemeal, in a regular break-up sale. In order for a bankruptcy debtor to be sold instead as a legal person, all three conditions contained in Article 129 of the Bankruptcy Act must first be met. First, the Bankruptcy Council must conduct an assessment (or valuation) of the assets of the bankruptcy debtor. Second, the Bankruptcy Council must obtain the opinion of creditors and the bankruptcy trustee. Finally, the Bankruptcy Council must determine that the sale of the bankruptcy debtor as a legal person is more favourable to creditors, i.e. that it \"would raise more money for the creditors than the piecemeal sale of the debtor\u2019s assets.\"267\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 82; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 66; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 131; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 65.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 82; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 65.\n\n242.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, these preconditions were not met. The assets of the debtor were not established (and thus could not be valued),268 creditors were not consulted,269 and on the date the Emergency Board decided to sell the Five Companies, neither the sale price for the whole nor that for the parts was known, making it impossible to determine which would be better for creditors.270 The Respondent alleges that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 orchestrated this illegal sale of the Five Companies as legal entities.271\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 549; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 133.\n\n\"The bankruptcy file [\u2026] shows by its absence that the council did not consult with the creditors of the Five [Companies] before deciding to sell the companies as legal entities\": Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 72.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 80; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 67-70.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nIn response, the Claimants assert that Article 129 of the Bankruptcy Act permits the sale of a debtor as a legal entity when doing so would be in the best interests of the creditors.272 According to the Claimants, the Bankruptcy Council determined that given the situation in Petrinja, it was not practicable to sell off the debtor\u2019s assets piecemeal, and for this reason, the Bankruptcy Council authorised the Liquidator to sell the Five Companies in their entirety via public tender.273\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 153.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00b6 31; Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n244.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, \"a fair reading of the Ruling of the Bankruptcy Council deciding to proceed with the sale shows that requirements 1 and 3 were met: the [Liquidator] reported on the state of the assets of the bankruptcy debtor, namely that many such assets had been destroyed, or were in the hands of Serbian forces\", leading to the conclusion that sale as a legal entity provided the best chance to settle creditor claims.274\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 92.\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimants make a number of arguments with regard to the second requirement, creditor consultation. First, the Claimants note that the language of Article 129 is permissive (\"may\") and does not *require* the Bankruptcy Court to obtain the opinion of the creditors.275 Rather, the Court has discretion. Second, the Claimants point out that there is no evidence that creditors were not consulted.276 Third, the Claimants cite a Croatian court decision finding that \"[n]otification of the hearing of 9 June 1991 for examination of the filed claims was published in the Official Gazette. This can be deemed proper notification of creditors.\"277 Finally, the Claimants argue that Croatia\u2019s own courts have made clear that failure to ask for creditors\u2019 opinions regarding a sale as a legal entity has no effect on a purchase contract and does not render it null and void.278\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 156-157.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 93.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 94.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 158.\n\n*Issue 1.2(b)(iii): Were there any illegalities in relation to the alleged investment (collectively, the **Alleged Illegalities**), because of the designation of the Swiss account of Inacomm as the destination of the purchase price?*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the designation and payment of the purchase price into the Swiss bank account of a Panamanian company, Inacomm, violated Articles 97 and 130 of the Bankruptcy Act. In the Respondent\u2019s view, this payment should have been directed into the five specially designated \"in bankruptcy\" accounts.279 The Respondent explains that once bankruptcy proceedings commence, the Bankruptcy Act requires that a debtor\u2019s accounts be closed, a new account be opened at the request of the trustee, any funds from closed accounts be transferred to the new account, and \"all payments in connection with a bankruptcy debtor [\u2026] be made [only] into the new account opened specifically for that purpose, and only the trustee [be able to] dispose of that account.\"280 The Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 failure to accord with this procedure resulted in an illegal payment.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 362; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 146.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 359-360. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 556.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimants respond that a plain reading of Articles 97 and 130 of the Bankruptcy Act yields no requirement that a party purchasing a bankruptcy debtor or its assets pay the purchase price into the bankruptcy accounts.281 In the Claimants\u2019 words, \"[t]here is simply no law regulating where a bankruptcy court must direct a party purchasing a bankruptcy debtor or its assets to make the relevant payment.\"282 There is also no prohibition on where such payment may be made: \"none of the provisions of the [Bankruptcy Act] expressly prohibit[ ] the payment of the purchase price to an account abroad.\"283\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 128; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 8.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 167.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 165, *citing* Uzelac and Miletic Report, \u00b6 34.\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimants also note that the Bankruptcy Judge designated the destination of the purchase price payment, and it is neither alleged nor evidenced that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 influenced this decision\u2014and the Claimants affirm that he did not.284 Prof Alan Uzelac, the Claimants\u2019 Croatian law expert, suggests that, given the rampant inflation and political situation in Croatia at the time, the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s designation of Inacomm, the subsidiary of a Croatian State-owned entity, may well have been prudent.285\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 129; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 164.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 166, *citing* Uzelac and Erakovic Report, \u00b6 35.\n\n249.\n\nMore importantly, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 did everything in his power to ensure that the payment of the purchase price to the designated account would have debt-discharging effect and received express confirmation in this regard from the Bankruptcy Court on three separate occasions.286 According to the Claimants:\n\n*Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 has done everything a diligent investor would do with respect to payment of a purchase price; namely, require an express and unambiguous representation from the seller, here the court, that by paying to the account specified by the seller it has fulfilled all his obligations.

These purported transactions are discussed in greater detail in Issue 1.2(b)(v) *supra*. The Claimants note that the Respondent identifies a number of transfers, \"none of which appear to implicate [the] Claimants in any illegal activity\" and all of which have a legitimate explanation.359 Indeed, the transfers to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. were ordered by the Respondent\u2019s courts, effected by the Liquidator, and subsequently affirmed in the 2003 State Audit Report, which identified no illegalities in relation to any of the transfers.360 As for alleged transfers to third parties, the Respondent has failed to establish a connection between the third parties and the Claimants. Thus, the Respondent\u2019s allegations of \"siphoning\" and \"profiteering\" are unsupported by underlying evidence.361\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 358.\n\nThe 2003 State Audit identified no illegalities in relation to any of these transfers, even though the purpose of the audit was to examine the transformation and privatisation of the Five Companies and establish whether any provisions of law were violated in the course of the transformation and privatisation: Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 193, 359.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 495.\n\n281.\n\nFurther, according to the Claimants, \"[e]ven if [the] Respondent were able to prove its allegations, the origin and history of the capital used to make an investment should not affect the question whether a specific transaction qualifies as an investment.\"362 That is, only actions taken in the *making* of an investment are to be considered at the jurisdictional phase.363 In the Claimants\u2019 view, the source of funds and other preinvestment activities are irrelevant.364\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 438.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 363.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 363.\n\nIssue 1.2(b)(vii)(C): Were there any illegalities in relation to the alleged investment (collectively, the **Alleged Illegalities**), because funds used by the First Claimant to purchase the Five Companies were obtained by the alleged appropriation of the daily proceeds of the store of the Five Companies?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1)The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, directly or through intermediaries, illicitly abstracted funds from retail stores belonging to the Five Companies and illegally used those funds to make up part of the purchase price for the Five Companies. According to the Respondent, in the summer of 1991, interim management, which had been installed by the Liquidator, directed that the daily cash proceeds of retail stores be taken to various collection centres set up by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and his associates.365 Previously these proceeds had been deposited with the State payment processor, Social Accounting Service (**SDK**); now the proceeds were to be left at Gavrilovi\u0107 premises. This change in procedure was ordered \"without any explanation or legal basis.\"366 Through it, the Respondent contends that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was able to siphon off cash from the Gavrilovi\u0107 shops and raise part of the purchase price for the Five Companies.367\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 110, 342.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 100.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 110.\n\n283.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"[s]udden and questionable changes in corporate policy are a cause for suspicion\",368 and \"it is dubious, to say the least, why a new arrangement was put in place that was informal, unprofessional and less secure.\"369 In the Respondent\u2019s view, this was a siphoning and profiteering operation that violated Croatian law\u2014specifically provisions prohibiting abuse of authority and providing for accessory liability\u2014as well as international public policy and general principles of law.370\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 640.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 112.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 344.\n\n**(2)The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s allegations as baseless.

However, in support of its allegations, the Respondent cites the witness statement of Mr Stejpan Bogovic, which does not mention Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, the Liquidator or Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s associates.371 Rather, Mr Bogovic merely provides that the procedure for handling daily cash proceeds was changed. In the Claimants\u2019 view, \"changing a procedure does not amount to wrongdoing, and Mr Bogovic\u2019s attempts to characterize the change as 'informal and unprofessional' do[] not meet the evidentiary standard necessary for any allegation of wrongdoing.\"372 Further, Mr Bogovic\u2019s statement indicates that the new system replaced a system which itself had been put in place only two years previously.373 According to the Claimants, the Respondent has not provided any factual foundation for its claims or cited any law which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 allegedly violated.374\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 202, *citing* Bogovic Statement.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 493.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 504.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 203.\n\n*Issue 1.2(b)(viii): Were there any illegalities in relation to the alleged investment (collectively, the **Alleged Illegalities**), because the alleged investment was made in violation of Croatian criminal law and international law and public policy prohibiting corruption, including due to a misuse of public funds to obtain private material gain?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the question of whether there were any illegalities related to misuse of public funds for private material gain is a rehashing of Issue 1.2(b)(vii)(a) regarding whether there were any illegalities related to the alleged inducement of then-Minister of Finance Martinovi\u0107 to order the transfer of DEM 2 million to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.

First, \"Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s March 1992 payment of arms money to Inacomm, a company engaging in the procurement of arms, was illicit arms brokering by acting as an intermediary or facilitator of an arms transaction in breach of the UN embargo in return for a personal benefit.\"376 The Respondent alleges that the Villach Account, from which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was given a DEM 2 million loan to purchase the Five Companies, was used for military purchases.377 In turn, the account of Inacomm into which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 deposited the purchase price for the Five Companies was also used for the procurement of arms.378 Second, the Respondent claims that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 made a dozen or more financial transactions in connection with the war effort between the summer of 1991 and December 1992.379 Third, the Respondent claims that \"the three purported 'repayments\u2019 of the supposed loan to Mr [Joshua] Waldhorn on 27 October 1992 [\u2026] were also arms brokering in violation of the UN embargo\"380 as Mr Waldhorn was a notorious arms trafficker.381 In addition, the Respondent asserts that through these activities the Claimants circumvented currency controls. In the Respondent\u2019s words, \"Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 confirmed that he *knowingly and illegally* transported millions of German marks into foreign accounts at the time, including in violation of applicable currency controls.\"382\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 221 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 222-223.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 153, 206, 219. *See also* Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 61, *citing* \u0160tuli\u0107-0001; USKOK Report pertaining to File No KR-DO-689/11 dated 11 November 2014 (C-0245); Pape\u0161-0003; Pape\u0161-0004; Letter from Mr Ivica Pape\u0161 to Deutsche Bank requesting transfer of DEM 2 million to Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 at Bankhaus Feichtner dated 2 March 1992 (R-0338), Pape\u0161-0006; Statement of Mr Branko \u0160tuli\u0107 made in the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File No KR-DO-689/11, 17 October 2014 (C-0612).\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 220. *See also* Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 61 *citing* Interview with Mr Boras (R-0351), p 2; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 397, *citing* Interview with Mr Boras (R-0351).\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 222-223. *See also* Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 61, *citing* Tr Day 2, 367:15-373:11 and 377:7-378:8; Second Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 225.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 327, *citing* USKOK Investigation Order pertaining to File Nos K-US-196/14, IS-US-64/14 dated 25 November 2014 (C-0200), pp 2, 6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 105 (emphasis in original).\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimants take issue with the Respondent\u2019s allegations on two grounds. First, the Respondent raised these claims for the first time at the Hearing, in violation of procedural fairness. Second, the assertions lack factual and legal support.383 The Claimants object that neither party has established:\n\n*(i) the identi*[t]*y of the alleged embargo; (ii) the legality of said embargo in light of, inter alia, the Republic of Croatia\u2019s right to individual and collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter; (iii) the exact restrictions imposed by said UN embargo; (iv) to whom the restrictions applied (i.e., whether such restrictions could even bind individuals); or (v) whether the actions of* [the] *Claimants or* [the] *Respondent violated said embargo*.384\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 239.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 241.\n\n288.\n\nFurther, the Respondent fails to state which provision of the embargo the Claimants allegedly violated.

In order for an investment to be excluded from BIT protection on illegality grounds, the Respondent must show that the Claimants breached a fundamental principle of host State law.408 According to the Claimants, who quote the tribunal in *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine*, minor breaches of domestic laws and regulations \"may not deprive an otherwise lawful investment of protection under a BIT.\"409 Additionally, the illegality requirement of the BIT is not triggered if the illegality is unrelated to the nature of the investment, as explained by the Tribunal in *Saba Fakes v Turkey*.410\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 527; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 260.

Rather, \"the legality requirement of Article 11(1) is not restricted to the specific entity bringing a claim.\"415 The plain wording of the provision aligns with its purpose to ensure respect for host State legal systems, \"no matter by whom.\"416 Thus, the extent of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis in this regard should be \"no narrower or wider\" than the question of whether the alleged investment was made legally.417 The Claimants\u2019 proposed interpretation of the provision would \"do violence\" to the categorical language of Article 11(1) by reading-in extra requirements, i.e. that the Claimants must have committed the illegality.418 The Respondent further criticises the Claimants\u2019 analysis for referring to other investment arbitration cases concerning different treaty texts instead of considering the plain language and purpose of Article 11(1) of the present BIT, as mandated by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (**VCLT**).419\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 286.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 289.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 285.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 288.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 292-293.\n\n**(2)The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants assert that in order for an illegal act to fall within the BIT\u2019s Article 11(1) legality requirement, the Respondent must prove that the illegality in question is attributable to the investor seeking BIT protection.420 According to the Claimants, illegal acts in relation to the investment committed by the State or third parties are beyond the scope of the legality requirement.421 The Claimants cite a number of arbitral awards in support of this position.422 In particular, the Claimants emphasise the finding of the *Kardassopoulos v Georgia* tribunal that \"a host State cannot avoid jurisdiction under the BIT by invoking its own failure to comply with its domestic law.\"423 The Claimants conclude that if the Alleged Illegalities, including \"the actions undertaken by [the] Respondent\u2019s judiciary (the Bankruptcy Judge and three-person Bankruptcy Council), the [Liquidator], and the state-run entity (Gavrilovi\u0107 Holding d.o.o.) are not acts that can be attributed to the Claimants, then [the] Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional challenge must fail.\"424\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 507;

(ii) to the extent there were any illegalities, the record is clear that the Respondent\u2019s organs and agents are the only alleged illegal actors in each circumstance; and (iii) the Respondent\u2019s request that the Tribunal infer that the Claimants were somehow behind all of the Respondent\u2019s alleged illegal actions is unsupported by the evidence.432 The Claimants emphasise that the allegedly illegal acts the Respondent cites \"were entirely the product of (i) actions by [the] Respondent or third parties, or (ii) court orders by [the] Respondent mandating such actions.\"433 In particular, acts of the Respondent\u2019s judiciary, the Liquidator, Bankruptcy Council and Holding d.o.o. are all attributable to the Respondent.434 Finally, the Respondent\u2019s reference to the existence of a criminal investigation into Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s activities is not evidence of involvement in the Respondent\u2019s allegedly illegal acts.435\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 279-280.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 514.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 374-401.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 283.\n\nIssue 1.2(c)(i)(D): What is the relevant point in time at which conformity with host State law is to be assessed for the purpose of jurisdiction?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nThe Parties agree that the relevant time at which legality is to be assessed for jurisdictional purposes is the time at which the alleged investment was made.436 The Tribunal concurs.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 305;

According to the Respondent, the existence of serious violations of domestic bankruptcy law render the making of the investment illegal and consequently deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.437 The Respondent maintains that (i) the illegalities in question relate to the making of the investment; (ii) they are fundamental, though they need not be; and (iii) they are attributable to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, though they need not be.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 366.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent has not met its burden of proving that the Claimants\u2019 investment was not made \"in accordance with\" Croatian law.438 According to the Claimants, Article 11(1) of the BIT requires the Respondent to establish: (i) the existence of the Alleged Illegalities, and (ii) a clear connection between the Alleged Illegalities and the Claimants.439 The Respondent has failed on both of these counts, as explained by the Claimants in the preceding discussion. Any alleged illegality or wrongdoing \"(i) cannot be attributed to Claimants, (ii) did not relate to a fundamental breach of Croatian law, and/or (iii) regarded events beyond the making of Claimants\u2019 investment.\"440 Accordingly, the Claimants state that their investment was made \"in accordance with\" Croatian law, and they are entitled to protection under the BIT.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 294.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 498.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 296.\n\nIssue 1.2(c)(ii)(B): Are one or more of the Alleged Illegalities such as to result in the Tribunal not having jurisdiction because there are other applicable legal requirements other than Article 11(1) of the BIT, the effect of which is to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction in the circumstances?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe Respondent takes the position that legality is a prerequisite for jurisdiction not only pursuant to Article 11(1) of the BIT, but also under the ICSID Convention. According to the Respondent, the legality requirement exists independently of the BIT as an implied condition on access to ICSID arbitration.441 It \"therefore transcends any textual limitation that might be read into the BIT\"442 such that the Claimants\u2019 attempts to unduly narrow the scope of Article 11(1) are of no consequence, as the Claimants must also, separately meet the requirements of the ICSID Convention.443 The Respondent cites a number of arbitral awards affirming this view and explaining that an investment will not be protected where it violates national or international law or principles of good faith.444 In the Respondent\u2019s view, therefore, the Alleged Illegalities strip the Tribunal of jurisdiction pursuant to the implied requirements of the ICSID Convention.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 259.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 112.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 259-260.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 312-317, citing *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic* (RL-0046), \u00b6\u00b6 100-101, 106; *Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010 (***Hamester v Ghana***) (CL-0038), \u00b6\u00b6 123-124; *SAUR International v Argentina Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/04/4, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 6 June 2012 (RL-0077), \u00b6 308.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nThe Claimants counter that \"[t]here are no such provisions in the BIT.\"445 Moreover, the Respondent has failed to establish a single illegal act by the Claimants that would impugn the Respondent\u2019s consent to jurisdiction.

The Claimants have failed to show that \"knowing the full extent of the Claimants\u2019 illegal and corrupt activities, the Respondent voluntarily and unconditionally authorised [them].\"449 The Claimants confuse the fact that the illegalities were not challenged before they became known to the Respondent with a positive assertion that the bankruptcy illegalities and criminal corruption amounted to lawful conduct.450\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 329.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 658-659.\n\n311.\n\nThird, estoppel requires detrimental reliance in good faith.451 The Claimants could not have relied in good faith because \"it is preposterous to claim that a reasonable businessman could have legitimately assumed that it was perfectly normal to send money meant to meet bankruptcy claims in Croatian proceedings abroad to an unrelated Panamanian entity.\"452\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 661.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 334.\n\n312.\n\nFinally, estoppel serves to prevent inequity.453 The Respondent notes that there is no injustice in preventing the Claimants, who illegally secured a company for absolutely nothing, from abusing the arbitral process.454\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, at \u00b6 662.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 662.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, even if the Respondent could attribute the Alleged Illegalities to the Claimants and show fundamental breaches of Croatian law\u2014which the Claimants maintain it cannot\u2014the Respondent should still be prevented from immunising itself under the BIT because of its actions affirming the legality of the Claimants\u2019 investment over the course of almost 25 years.455 The Claimants make four principal arguments in support of their claim that principles of fairness should prevent the Respondent from raising allegations of wrongdoing at this late time.456\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 533.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 533 *et seq*.\n\n314.\n\nFirst, the Respondent has repeatedly confirmed the legality of the Claimants\u2019 investment.457 In the nearly 25 years of the Alleged Illegalities, the Respondent has:\n\n*(i) confirmed the purchase price;

Thus, any alleged technical violations of bankruptcy procedure stem from the Respondent\u2019s own actions.473 In the Claimants\u2019 view, \"Croatia cannot point to *its* own violations of its laws\u2014particularly the actions of its own Bankruptcy courts and officials\u2014in seeking to disqualify [the] Claimants\u2019 investment from protection under the BIT.\"474 The Respondent has failed to produce evidence that the Claimants were involved in or in any way induced the actions of the Respondent\u2019s agents.475 Therefore, the Respondent should be prevented from invoking these actions as a shield against liability.476\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 501.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 329 (emphasis in original).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 331.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 332.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nAs the Tribunal notes above, although a number of different strands of argument have been advanced in relation to the illegality objections, the Tribunal will deal with the objections as a whole. The Respondent has employed a strategy of raising numerous, often overlapping, claims of illegality arising in the context of the bankruptcy proceeding through which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 acquired the investment. In the case of some of those claims, the Respondent has advanced much of the same arguments, albeit under different rubrics. The Tribunal will consider the illegality claims in light of the totality of the evidence.\n\n323.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the evidence, the Tribunal has concluded that the bankruptcy proceeding exhibited some irregularities. The central question is whether in and of themselves those are sufficient to disentitle the Claimants from invoking the protection of the BIT. While the Respondent has asserted that they are, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent\u2019s repeated assertion that the bankruptcy was \"orchestrated\" by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and its various allegations that he corrupted others amounts to a recognition by the Respondent that an irregular bankruptcy in and of itself is not determinative of the issue of illegality.477 The obvious reason is that the principal irregularities were either committed by or authorised by the Bankruptcy Court, an organ of the State, or by other organs or agencies of Croatia. In such circumstances, even if the acts of the court or the other organs of the State were irregular, the question arises whether the State can now employ such acts, essentially its own acts, to oppose the BIT claim on grounds of illegality. The Tribunal considers that if the Respondent can establish that the Bankruptcy Court (or other State organs) had been corrupted or otherwise improperly influenced by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, there would be a basis for a successful illegality objection, but if the Respondent is unable to demonstrate such acts, the Respondent cannot oppose the claim on the basis of illegality.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 22, 59, 68, 162, 346, 369; Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 79, 123; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 45, 53-54, 68, 319, 381; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 16, 24, 26, 41, 64, 83; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 52. The Respondent did not use the word \"orchestrate\" in its Post-Hearing Briefs, choosing instead to refer to the bankruptcy as \"corrupt.\"\n\n325.\n\nIn brief, the Tribunal\u2019s view of the evidence can be summarised as follows: Croatia was fighting a war and needed money, specifically foreign currency, to purchase weaponry. Croatia employed Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 to assist it in that scheme by smuggling money out of the country and depositing it in foreign bank accounts that Croatia controlled. Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was a willing participant in this scheme. He wanted to get back his family\u2019s meat-processing business and he asked the Government for help in return for his contribution to the war effort. The Government obliged. There was thus a *quid pro quo* that the Tribunal will discuss in greater detail below. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the problem for the Respondent in advancing the illegality objections against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is that the State used Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 in furtherance of its war effort, and when Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 asked for a favour in exchange for rendering services to the State, it was the State that orchestrated a scheme to return his father\u2019s business to him, including by loaning him the funds he needed to purchase the Five Companies. In the absence of evidence that the scheme was initiated or orchestrated by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and, moreover, in light of the evidence pointing to the State\u2019s extensive involvement in the scheme, as detailed below, the Tribunal has difficulty accepting that the illegality is opposable to the First Claimant under international law.\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by observing that the events in question took place more than 25 years ago, the documentary evidence is necessarily more fragmentary than would have been the case had this dispute arisen a few years after the First Claimant\u2019s acquisition of the Five Companies, and some of the key participants in the events at issue are now deceased. The former Minister of Finance, Mr Jozo Martinovi\u0107, who assumes a pivotal role in certain events, is one such individual; he died in 1994. The then-Assistant Finance Minister, Mr Jo\u0161ko Zavoreo, was also a key participant and figures prominently in both Mr \u0160tuli\u0107\u2019s and Mr Pape\u0161' accounts of events in 1991-1992. He too is deceased. Thus, their alleged actions and statements can only be evaluated having regard to the contemporaneous documents and with cautious reliance on the recollections of witnesses who dealt with them at the time. Given that some of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s accounts of key events evolved, in some cases substantially, and his understandable self-interest in his claim\u2019s succeeding, the Tribunal must also exercise caution about relying upon his assertions as to what, for example, Mr Martinovi\u0107 said at the time. It is impossible to test the credibility of such assertions when the other party to the alleged conversation is deceased.\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that its determination as to the Claimants\u2019 right, or not, to invoke the BIT has been restricted to the evidence which has been put before it by the disputing Parties. It cannot be ruled out that there might be evidence which could shed additional light on certain of the issues under analysis, but in the end the Tribunal is restricted to the evidence which is in the record of this proceeding.\n\n328.\n\nWith these points in mind, the Tribunal turns to its analysis of this part of the Respondent\u2019s defence. On 25 June 1991, the Republic of Croatia declared independence, a declaration that was resisted by Serbia. In the months leading up to this declaration, political and economic reform was discussed and, of particular relevance to the present discussion, Government officials spoke of the desirability of restituting businesses that had been expropriated by the Communist regime in the aftermath of World War II.478 The Gavrilovi\u0107 sausage-making business was one such business.479\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 44, *citing* Speech by Mr Franjo Tudman, first President of Croatia, given during the constituting session of the Croatian Parliament on 30 May 1991 (C-0022); Second Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 17, *citing* United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT), *Housing and Property Rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro*, Status Report No 12 dated 3 July 2003 (C-0004).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 63: On 30 May 1991, in a speech before the Croatian Parliament, President Tudjman specifically noted that \"one of the oldest factories in Croatia will soon be returned to the private ownership of the family Gavrilovi\u0107\" (*see* Memorandum, *Gavrilovi\u0107,* Internal Information, No 7, Year V, 7 June 1991 (C-0023)); Second Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 17, *citing* Interview, \"Gavrilovi\u0107 is coming to 'Gavrilovi\u0107'\", published in *Privredni Vjesnik* and internal newspapers of the Nine Companies on 6 May 1991 (C-0007), p 1.\n\n329.\n\nDuring the course of this arbitration, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 acknowledged that starting in June or July 1991, around the time of the declaration of independence and the deepening of hostilities in the region, he began to assist the Croatian war effort by smuggling hard currency out of Croatia to Austria. It will be recalled that although he was born in Croatia, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 holds Austrian nationality and in the years leading up to the events in question he worked for the Austrian consulate in Zagreb.480 His Austrian nationality and official position likely facilitated this activity.481 There was no mention of this assistance being rendered to Croatia in Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s first witness statement.\n\nGavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 15.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 61; Pape\u0161 Statement, \u00b6 4.\n\n330.\n\nAfter the Respondent adduced the testimony and contemporaneous documents of Mr Pape\u0161 showing the origins of roughly two-thirds of the funds that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 used to pay for the Five Companies, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 supplemented his earlier written testimony to admit that he had engaged in smuggling currency out of Croatia.482 It is self-evident that the purpose of this activity was to assist Croatia in circumventing the EU and UN embargos that were imposed in June and September 1991, respectively, to stop the acquisition of arms for use in the Balkan war. Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 acknowledged that monies smuggled across the border were deposited in various bank accounts and were then used by Croatia in connection with the war.483 He professed to have no knowledge of what Croatia was actually purchasing, testifying that he only came to know later that the monies were being used to buy weapons.484 The Tribunal is sceptical of this claim.\n\nMr Pape\u0161' documents traced the funds\u2019 movement from the Deutsche Bank account which Mr Pape\u0161 opened in Germany, after recovering them from Mr Mohamad Salem, to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s account at Bankhaus Feichtner. This led to a significant change in Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s initial account as to how he paid for the assets in the bankruptcy proceeding. That account was his testimony that: \"[...] nothing could deter me from the chance to finally regain the family business. With the help of friends and family members, I managed to raise the funds to make an offer to purchase the Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Companies for DEM 3,305,000. I took a loan for DEM 1 million from the Austrian bank Bankhaus Feichtner, used all the savings my wife and I had, and borrowed the rest from my wife\u2019s family.\" *See* Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 25. The Pape\u0161 documents filed with the Counter-Memorial left Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 with no choice but to admit that he obtained roughly two-thirds of the funds used to pay for the Five Companies from a loan arranged by Mr Martinovi\u0107. *See* Second Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 83-85; Loan Agreement (C-0216); Amendment Agreement (C-0217).\n\nTr Day 2, 367:15-373:8, 376:6-8, 448:4-9 (Testimony of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 admitting both the embargo and the payment of money into various accounts to pay to Mr Waldhorn for arms); Second Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. This is a central part of the State prosecutor\u2019s war profiteering prosecution of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107. *See* USKOK Investigation Order pertaining to File Nos K-US-196/14, IS-US-64/14 dated 25 November 2014 (C-0200). Prof Novoselec pointed out in his latest report that:  \n*The indictment against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 lists 83 exhibits. Prof Derencinovic does not challenge any of these exhibits and the ruling of the County Court in Zagreb confirming the indictment is expressly based on those exhibits. Specifically, the decision of the County Court in Zagreb states that its ruling on reasonable suspicion 'follows from' its review of the 83 exhibits. Accordingly, there is no doubt that the ruling that confirms the indictment against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is in accordance with the provision of Art. 355 para 1, point 4 of the Criminal Procedure Code and that, as expressly stated by the County Court, this ruling is based on 83 exhibits which confirm that there is reasonable suspicion that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 committed the offence.*  \n Third Novoselec Report, pp 3-4 (internal citations omitted). On 12 October 2016, the County Court in Zagreb unanimously upheld the indictment and sent Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s case to trial: Decision No 11 (R-0374). Most of the relevant documents to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s admitted unlawful acts with respect to the UN embargo and transfer of funds are found in the Special Report of the Ministry of Finance of the financial transactions and relations between Messrs Salem, Gavrilovi\u0107, Pape\u0161, Tomi\u0107 and Idrizi dated 19 September 2014, with Exhibits 000275-000297 (C-0234) and USKOK Report pertaining to File No KR-DO-689/11 dated 11 November 2014 (C-0245) (same, but dated 11 November 2014, with many of the same exhibits, marked 000428000498, which are attached to the witness statements of Messrs \u0160tuli\u0107 or Pape\u0161).\n\nTr Day 2, 448:4-9, Testimony of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107:  \n*Q.

Yes. The payments were going through Belgrade. Foreign.*\n\n*Q. Okay. So, what did that entail? Because you use a very dignifying word \"to create foreign currency reserves abroad\" but you also said you helped him circumvent controls from foreign exchange by transferring money into foreign accounts.*\n\n*Can you explain what you did?*\n\n*A. I received suitcases full of money that I transferred to Austria.*\n\n*I had it counted in a bank, and I was sending that money to the account that he told me.*\n\n*Q.

Yes.*\n\n*Q. And you have not kept any documents on the accounts; right?*\n\n*A.

The Tribunal pauses here to note that in making the objections, the Respondent has strongly argued that this activity nonsuits the Claimants because it was unlawful, but it has, for obvious reasons, not emphasised as strongly that the State itself was benefiting from the First Claimant\u2019s assistance in circumventing the UN embargos. Yet, as the County Court in Zagreb commented when upholding Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s war profiteering prosecution in relation to the loan made available to him by the then-Minister of Finance:\n\n*Above all it is important to note here that at the incriminated time, that the defendant Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 is charged for, is precisely the time of war in the Republic of Croatia and the perpetration of criminal offences of war profiteering are reflected in the notorious fact that a large part of the Croatian territory was occupied, that the country was undergoing an extremely difficult economic situation and the fact that* [an] *embargo was placed on the procurement of weapons in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution dated 25 September 1991. The securing of funds for the defence purposes of the Republic of Croatia and spending these funds for the stated purposes presented a public interest with the objective of protecting the state sovereignty*.487\n\nDecision No 11 (R-0374), p 5.\n\n333.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, therefore, in the domestic criminal proceedings, far from resiling from any suggestion that Croatia was seeking to circumvent the UN embargos, there is an acknowledgement from the State\u2019s judiciary that such circumvention was in the Croatian public interest.\n\n334.\n\nThe period during which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 performed services to the State (June/July 1991 to December 1992) coincides with the initiation of the bankruptcy proceeding and the steps taken by him to pay for the Five Companies. But for the transactions which the prosecution in the domestic criminal proceeding contends amount to war profiteering, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 would not have been able to purchase the Five Companies.\n\n335.\n\nOn 21 June 1991, around the time that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 began to assist Croatia\u2019s war effort, a meeting of Holding d.o.o.\u2019s Management Committee was held. In addition to the Committee\u2019s members, the meeting was attended by two individuals who would soon become central actors in the bankruptcy proceeding: Mr Slavko Boras, who would be appointed as the Liquidator, and Mr Zdravko Tuk\u0161a, who would become the Bankruptcy Judge responsible for supervising the proceeding.488\n\nNotes from Meeting with Gavrilovi\u0107 Holding d.o.o. that took place in Petrinja on 21 July 1991 (R-0016).\n\n336.\n\nThe June 1991 meeting concluded that there was no basis at that time for putting Holding d.o.o. into bankruptcy.489 Nevertheless, the evidence of Holding d.o.o.\u2019s financial condition at the time is reflected by a determination of the Croatian Agency, which oversaw formerly socially-owned companies, that Holding d.o.o. was at risk of financial failure and that an emergency board should be installed; in fact this was done on 12 July 1991.490 Shortly thereafter, on 19 August 1991, the Emergency Board decided to initiate bankruptcy proceedings, and two days later the Bankruptcy Court commenced the proceedings.491\n\nNotes from Meeting with Gavrilovi\u0107 Holding d.o.o. that took place in Petrinja on 21 July 1991 (R-0016).\n\n1991 Decision (C-0028). *See also* 2003 State Report (C-0005), p 10.\n\n*See* Ruling of the Bankruptcy Court on the Institution of Bankruptcy Proceedings over the Company \"Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry d.o.o.\" dated 21 August 1991, File No St-102/91 (C-0029); Ruling of the Bankruptcy Court on the Institution of Bankruptcy Proceedings over the Company \"Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce d.o.o.\" dated 21 August 1991, File St-103/91 (C-0030).\n\n337.\n\nThe fact that the view expressed in the June 1991 meeting was that there was no basis for initiating a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of Holding d.o.o. raises questions about the decision taken two months later to commence bankruptcy proceedings, but ultimately it does not support the Respondent\u2019s contention that there was no basis whatsoever for doing so in August 1991, because it appears to the Tribunal that over the course of the summer of 1991 events on the ground deteriorated.492 Holding d.o.o.\u2019s main factory, located in Petrinja, was occupied by Serbian forces and there were serious questions as to whether the factory would remain in Croatian territory, be destroyed, or otherwise not form part of the company\u2019s assets. There is also evidence of the deterioration in the company\u2019s financial performance.493\n\nThe Croatian Agency, which oversaw formerly socially-owned companies, determined that Gavrilovi\u0107 Holding Company was at risk of financial failure and installed an emergency board.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49, *citing* August 1991 Report (C-0024), pp 3, 5-6; Rospaher Statement, \u00b6 40.\n\n338.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has correctly identified a series of irregularities in the bankruptcy proceeding. For example, while the Tribunal does not find that the decision to seek bankruptcy was irregular in and of itself, it does not accept the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Bankruptcy Act did not require the Bankruptcy Court to first consult the creditors as to whether the assets of the bankrupt company could be sold as legal entities. As the Tribunal reads Article 129 of the Bankruptcy Act, while the Bankruptcy Court is permitted to sell assets as legal entities, it must first conduct an assessment (or valuation) of the assets of the bankruptcy debtor; second, it must obtain the opinion of creditors and the Liquidator on the question of selling the assets as a legal person; and finally, it must determine that the sale of the bankruptcy debtor as a legal person is more favourable to the creditors, i.e. that it \"would raise more money for the creditors than the piecemeal sale of the debtor\u2019s assets.\"494 On the basis of the evidence before the Tribunal, the Bankruptcy Court did not comply with the requirements of Article 129 of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 82; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 65.\n\n339.\n\nIn addition, having decided to permit the Five Companies to be sold as legal entities, without consulting the creditors, the Bankruptcy Court then prescribed a rather short window during which bids could be made (eight days including two weekends).495 Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, who had a keen interest in acquiring the assets, turned out to be the sole bidder.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 62: Further to the Bankruptcy Council\u2019s decision dated 23 September 1991, the Liquidator published the announcement of the sale of the Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Companies on 28 September 1991 in the daily newspaper *Vecernji list.* The deadline for submitting bids was set for eight days from the announcement: September 1991 Bankruptcy Ruling (C-0035), pp 1 *et seq*. A copy of the announcement of sale was also included in the Confirmation issued by the Chairman of the Bankruptcy Council, Mr Branimir Majanovic, on 3 December 1992 (C-0039). The Claimants contend that \"not one, but two opportunities were provided to the public to bid on the company\": Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 470, *citing* Minutes of Bankruptcy Proceedings in File Nos St-102/91, St-103/91, St-104/91, St-105/91, St-106/91, Zagreb Commercial District Court, 10 October 1991 (C-0037), p 3. However, the Respondent points out \"whether or not the court may have decided to wait a month after receiving Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s bid, as alleged by the Claimants, is irrelevant because this was not public and only suggested in internal minutes\": Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 448.\n\n340.\n\nThe Purchase Agreement was signed by the Liquidator, Mr Boras, as seller, and Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, as purchaser, on 11 November 1991. A surprising feature of the agreement was the fact that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was able to defer paying for the Five Companies at the time that he acquired them.496 That is, without even having to put down a deposit, he immediately proceeded to merge the Five Companies into his new company (the Second Claimant) and began operating them.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 105-106. Article 5 of the Purchase Agreement specified that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 would make payment within 90 days, thus by 11 February 1992. This did not occur. On this date, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 met with the Bankruptcy Council, the Bankruptcy Judge, the Liquidator and the Bankruptcy Council decided to extend the date for payment (\"The situation regarding stock taking [...] shall be established at the latest within 3-4 weeks, when the payment of the sales price for the bankruptcy debtors will be executed\", Minutes (R-0028), p 2).\n\n341.\n\nThe transfer of the assets occurred on 30 November 1991 with an anticipated date of payment therefore of 11 February 1992.497 Even with this grace period, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 could not raise the necessary funds to effect payment. This led the Liquidator and the Bankruptcy Court to extend the date for payment on 11 February 1992.498 It was during the latter part of February/early March 1992 that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was able to secure the loan of DEM 2 million from the then-Finance Minister (whom, it will be recalled, according to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, had requested him to assist the war effort sometime in June/July 1991). Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s dealings with the Finance Minister have been established not only through contemporaneous documents, and the evidence of various witnesses with direct knowledge of the late Minister\u2019s activities, but also ultimately through the testimony of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 himself. Like the currency smuggling, there was no mention in his first witness statement of his borrowing money with the assistance of the Minister of Finance in order to pay for the Five Companies.499\n\nThe Respondent points out in its Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 105: \"On 11 February 1992, the 90 day time limit fixed by Article 5 of the Purchase Agreement for payment of the Five New LLCs expired. At this time, the First Claimant had still not paid a single Dinar towards the [...] purchase price.\"\n\nMinutes (R-0028).\n\nWhen cross-examined on this point, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 testified that he did not want to have to explain why he was moving suitcases of money across the border: Tr Day 2, 384:17-21.\n\n342.\n\nWith this loan, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was able to raise sufficient funds to pay the debt owing. Payment was effected through three wire transfers effected by Bankhaus Feichtner to the Swiss bank account of INA\u2019s Panamanian subsidiary, Inacomm, pursuant to an order entered by the Bankruptcy Court.500 This is the second alleged illegality and the Tribunal will address it in detail below.\n\nRuling of Zagreb County Commercial Court confirming payment to Inacomm International S.A. dated 3 March 1992 (R-0032).\n\n343.\n\nThe evidence is mixed as to whether those funds, DEM 2 million of which had been previously destined for the war effort, were ever transferred on to the bankruptcy estates.501 The Respondent has pointed out that there is nothing in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s file to show that any monies were paid into the bankruptcy estates.502 Statements were made by various Croatian politicians that they were paid.503 As discussed below, there is some evidence that INA and its subsidiary, Inacomm, were employed in the prosecution of the war effort and this helps to explain why Inacomm\u2019s Swiss bank account was designated in the wire transfer instructions given to Bankhaus Feichtner. More importantly, interviews held by Croatian investigators with the former Liquidator and the Bankruptcy Judge in 2014 raise questions about whether the monies ever did get paid to the bankruptcy estates.504 The Tribunal will revert to this below.\n\nFinal Bankruptcy Report (C-0036). The Bankruptcy Council\u2019s Report is somewhat unclear as to what occurred. It states that some money was received and these funds paid for the bankruptcy proceeding. The remainder of the monies did not satisfy the government\u2019s claims and none was left for creditors: \"The guaranteed wages were paid with the money received from the sale of the companies and by placing those funds on time deposit, the expenses of the bankruptcy proceedings had been reimbursed, following which it was established that the remainder of the financial assets is not even sufficient to completely reimburse the claims of the republic Reserves Fund and the Croatian Development Fund stemming from the loan for guaranteed wages and due to that fact no available assets were left for the payment to the creditors through the main division\": Final Bankruptcy Report (C-0036), p 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 122-123; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 154; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 77-79.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 171. A Government representative (one of the Ministers listed on the Villach account) informed the Croatian Parliament in December 1992 that \"[t]he contract purchase and sale price amounted to DEM 3,305,000.

(the Claimants provided different explanations on this; Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s initial position was that he could not rule out that Mr Boras might have had Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s bookkeeper transfer the money to him,505 but at the First Hearing the reason given was that it was payment for the purchase of beer and other goods506). The Tribunal has had difficulty crediting this latter explanation, particularly when it is recalled that during the time that this large sum was being paid to the Liquidator, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 still had to repay the DEM 2 million that he obtained from Mr Martinovi\u0107. Moreover, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s financial condition in 1992 was, on Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s own evidence, perilous and by the end of that year, he recalled, there was a possibility that it would become bankrupt.507 It makes little sense that in the difficult financial straits in which he and his new company found themselves in carrying on business, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 would have spent such a large sum of money on beer and other goods when that money could have gone to paying down his debt, particularly when he knew from his own currency smuggling activities that Croatia needed funds to prosecute the war of independence and that the debt had to be repaid.\n\nSecond Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 58. *See also* Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 144: \"Because Mr Boras continued to administer the Gavrilovi\u0107 bankruptcy from the same office used by Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. during this period, it is possible that Mr Boras asked an employee of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. to pass the payment through that company\u2019s accounts.\"\n\nTr Day 2, 459:16-461:12, 463:4-15; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 239: \"There are no invoices or purchase orders for any supposed sale of beer or other foodstuffs. The timing of the payments during and at the end of the bankruptcy to the trustee is also telling. The fact that the Claimants first aired this new theory at the hearing, i.e. more than 16 months after the kickbacks had been pointed out and after several rounds of submissions, further illustrates that it cannot be trusted.\" *See also* Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 54, 56, 236-237, 906\n\nGavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.\n\n345.\n\nHowever, to the extent that the Respondent has raised a separate claim of illegality, i.e. that the First Claimant bribed the Liquidator in the process of the acquisition of the investment, the Tribunal finds it difficult to accept such claim. First, the Tribunal has seen no evidence that Croatia has prosecuted the Liquidator for any alleged impropriety specifically regarding those payments (although the actions of Mr Boras in the context of the bankruptcy have been investigated and the money transferred to him by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was flagged by the State Auditor in 2002,508 but not raised again in either the Country Public Prosecution or State Attorney\u2019s interviews with Mr Boras in 2014509). Indeed, there is evidence that the Zagreb court found in 2000, on the basis of the information before it, that the Liquidator did *not* abuse his position as a bankruptcy trustee or overstep his authority.510 Second, in light of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the bankruptcy was orchestrated by the State, and in light of the Liquidator\u2019s own testimony in the investigation in Croatia that the orders to transfer the payment to Inacomm\u2019s Swiss bank account came from higher-up (about which more is discussed below), it is unclear why the First Claimant would need to bribe the Liquidator. At the same time, given the financial circumstances in which the two Claimants found themselves in 1992, the attempt to explain away the payment of such a large sum of money to the Liquidator is wholly unsatisfactory and has tainted the dealings between the First Claimant and Mr Boras.\n\nState Audit Office, Request regarding business relations dated 21 November 2002 (R-0038), \u00b6 4: \"In the period from 2 June 1992 to 23 July 1992 total of 85,332,990 HRD (ca 632,022 DEM) was paid by Gavrilovi\u0107 - Prva hrvatska tvornica salame to the giro account of company Dr Boras & co d.o.o., Zagreb, Maksimirska 11.\" Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 93: \"Moreover, the preliminary investigation of Mr Boras predated evidence of those payments.\"\n\nInterview with Mr Boras (R-0351); Statement of Mr Slavo Boras made in the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File No KR-DO-689/11, 3 September 2014 (C-0257).\n\nRuling of the County Court in Zagreb pertaining to File No IX-II-Kv-503/00-2 dated 16 November 2000 (C-0046), p 2:  \n*Herein, according to the situation represented in the file, nothing indicates that the defendant, through his activities related to the sale of the bankruptcy debtor, overstepped his power and authority from Article 60 of the Act on Forced Agreement, Bankruptcy and Liquidation, or the possibility that there was any individual activity beyond the control, evaluation or decision of the bankruptcy judge or bankruptcy council in order to help Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 acquire unlawful material gain through the purchase of bankruptcy debtors by the price significantly below the real value.*\n\n346.\n\nIn short, even accounting for the exigencies of the time, a point on which the Claimants\u2019 legal expert, Judge Erkovic, placed much emphasis, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the bankruptcy was not properly conducted. However, as noted above, in and of themselves, the irregularities are insufficient to disentitle the Claimants from gaining access to international jurisdiction under the BIT.\n\n347.\n\nThe problem for the Respondent\u2019s illegality objection is that a careful review of the evidence does not permit the Tribunal to conclude that the Respondent has made out its claim that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 orchestrated the bankruptcy or engaged in corruption in order to have the bankruptcy culminate in his obtention of the Five Companies. There is no doubt that he benefited from the bankruptcy\u2019s irregularities and there is no doubt that he campaigned assiduously to gain control of the sausage-making business. It cannot, therefore, be ruled out that he sought to orchestrate the return of a commercial venture which he believed belonged to his family. But there is no persuasive evidence before the Tribunal which allows it to conclude that he orchestrated the events in question.\n\n348.\n\nIndeed, a review of the evidence leads the Tribunal in a rather different direction. As discussed below, the best evidence of extensive State involvement in facilitating the purchase of the Five Companies is the well-documented circumstances surrounding the obtention of the loan, which then led to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order designating Inacomm\u2019s Swiss bank account as the destination for the payment of the assets\u2019 purchase price.\n\n349.\n\nThis extraordinary transaction, considered together with other circumstantial evidence, suggests that to the extent that there was orchestration, it was orchestration by the government of the day. The record evidence suggests that the bankruptcy proceeding\u2019s irregularities reflected a decision at the senior levels of the State to convey the sausagemaking business to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 (whatever that might have entailed in a time of war and a difficult legal transition from social ownership to private ownership) in the hopes of raising money for the war effort and as a \"favour\" (to use the word that Mr \u0160tuli\u0107 recalls Minister Martinovi\u0107 using at the time when he explained why he was assisting Mr Gavrilovi\u0107) for his assisting Croatia in the war of independence.\n\n350.\n\nThe manifold irregularities of the procedure, in particular, allowing the Five Companies to be sold as legal entities without consulting the creditors, conducting a very short time for acceptance of bids, allowing the Five Companies to be merged into a new company owned and controlled by the purchaser without even requiring a down payment, the designation of Inacomm as the recipient of the purchase price, taken together with: (i) statements given to Croatian investigators by the former Liquidator and the Bankruptcy Judge; (ii) the fact that Minister Martinovi\u0107 granted Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 the loan that enabled him to make a purchase that the evidence shows he otherwise could not complete; and (iii) the evidence of the Minister\u2019s former Chief of Staff, Mr Branko \u0160tuli\u0107 (who gave a witness statement in the present arbitration and two statements to Croatian prosecutors), have led the Tribunal to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the bankruptcy was orchestrated by the government of the day as a *quid pro quo* for the currency smuggling services rendered by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 to Croatia. The State\u2019s fingerprints, which are to be found at various stages of the bankruptcy proceeding, point in this direction.511\n\nTo be clear, the Tribunal does not rule out the possibility that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 orchestrated the proceeding, but the evidential record before it does not satisfy the Tribunal that this has been proved.\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with the timing. As noted above, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is no coincidence that shortly after Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 began to assist Croatia, the business which had been expropriated from his family and for which he had sought restitution, was put into bankruptcy and the Five Companies were permitted to be sold as legal entities.\n\n352.\n\nIn one of Mr \u0160tuli\u0107\u2019s two statements given to the investigators (made on 17 October 2014512 and 11 November 2015513), Mr \u0160tuli\u0107 recalled Minister Martinovi\u0107\u2019s stating that the business should be given back to the Gavrilovi\u0107 family:\n\n*I know that during that period Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 visited Finance Minister Jozo Martinovi\u0107 on several occasions, but I was not present during their talks. I do not know what they were discussing. I remember that Jozo Martinovi\u0107 was only mentioning something in the context that Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 should be given back the assets that were seized from his family earlier during the communism* [...].514\n\nStatement of Mr Branko \u0160tuli\u0107 made in the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File No KR-DO-689/11, 17 October 2014 (C-0612).\n\nQuestioning of Mr Branko \u0160tuli\u0107 at the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File Nos K-US-196/14; IS-US-64/14, 11 November 2015 (C-0613).\n\nStatement of Mr Branko \u0160tuli\u0107 made in the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File No KR-DO-689/11, 17 October 2014 (C-0612), pp 1-2 (emphasis added). In particular, at p 2, Mr \u0160tuli\u0107 also informed investigators that \"Regarding financing of weapons during the Homeland War, I can say that I have knowledge about the existence of an account in Villach [\u2026] The purpose of that account was collecting of money for the defense of the Republic of Croatia [\u2026].\"\n\n353.\n\nMr \u0160tuli\u0107 also recalled another statement made by the Minister at the time which also bears on the bankruptcy proceeding, this time in relation to the loan that he provided to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107. Mr \u0160tuli\u0107 recalled advising the Minister not to lend money to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, to which the Minister responded that he was acting in his \"personal capacity\" and had been asked to do it as a \"favour.\"515 There is no record evidence as to *who* asked him to do this, but the Tribunal considers that the implication of Mr \u0160tuli\u0107\u2019s testimony was that someone else in the Government of Croatia asked the Minister to assist (and it was not just Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s importuning). This inference is bolstered by another statement made by Mr \u0160tuli\u0107 to Croatian investigators:\n\n[\u2026] *Jozo Martinovi\u0107 commented to me something in the sense that what he was doing with Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 was actually not his job, that Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 was imposed upon him, and that someone has asked him to do it. But he did not tell me who had asked him, nor have I asked him any questions. My motto at the time was \"the less I know the better\"*.516\n\n\u0160tuli\u0107 Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 7 *et seq*.: \"When Mr Martinovi\u0107 told me that he had been asked to assist Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, I was very frank with him. I suggested to him that he should refuse. He told me that he couldn't and that this was something he was not doing in his role as Minister of Finance but in his personal capacity. Mr Martinovi\u0107 never told me exactly what he had been asked to do to help Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 acquire ownership of the 'Gavrilovi\u0107' companies.\" *See also* Tr Day 5, 938:22-939:16 (Testimony of Mr \u0160tuli\u0107 that Mr Martinovi\u0107 gave Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 the State money \"in his personal capacity and not in his capacity as Minister of Finance.\").\n\nQuestioning of Mr Branko \u0160tuli\u0107 at the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File Nos K-US-196/14; IS-US-64/14, 11 November 2015 (C-0613), p 3 (emphasis added).\n\n354.\n\nThese statements support the inference that there was support at high levels of the Government towards restituting (either *de jure* or *de facto*) the Gavrilovi\u0107 sausagemaking business back to the Gavrilovi\u0107 family, and further, that the Minister of Finance was under some pressure to assist Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 in completing his purchase.\n\n355.\n\nThis takes the Tribunal to the loan. It pauses here to set out a brief chronology of what transpired during the February-March 1992 period.\n\n356.\n\nAs noted above, the Purchase Agreement specified that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 would make payment by 11 February 1992. This did not occur.517 On that same date, the Bankruptcy Council, the Bankruptcy Judge, and the Liquidator, met and extended the date for payment.518\n\nAs the Respondent pointed out in its Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 105: \"On 11 February 1992, the 90 day time limit fixed by Article 5 of the Purchase Agreement for payment of the Five New LLCs expired. At this time, the First Claimant had still not paid a single Dinar towards the [\u2026] purchase price.\"\n\nMinutes (R-0028).\n\n357.\n\nThe evidence is that right around this time, on or about 10-11 February 1992, Mr Ivica Pape\u0161, who had been dispatched to Germany by the Assistant Minister of Finance of Croatia, Mr Jo\u0161ko Zavoreo, to track down Mr Mohamed Salem and retrieve monies that had been transferred to him a month before, was able to locate Mr Salem in Bonn and recovered most of those funds. Mr Pape\u0161 had Mr Salem transfer approximately DEM 2 million to a Deutsche Bank account that Mr Pape\u0161 opened.519 He also had Mr Salem appear before a Notary in Bonn to record his agreement to provide the remaining DEM 450,000.00 by 25 February 1992. Mr Pape\u0161 stated that after this occurred, he returned to Zagreb and reported to the Assistant Minister of Finance that he had recovered most of the money.520 It can reasonably be inferred that the Assistant Minister would have in turn informed the Minister that the monies which Mr Martinovi\u0107 himself had originally instructed be transferred to Salem in furtherance of the war effort had largely been recovered. This inference is justified because it is common ground that the Minister knew that Mr Pape\u0161 had the funds and that he ordered Mr Pape\u0161 to transfer them to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s bank.\n\nPape\u0161 Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15. USKOK Report pertaining to File No KR-DO-689/11 dated 11 November 2014 (C-0245), which includes: Payment slip for DEM 100 paid into new Deutsche Bank account, 10 February 1992 (Pape\u0161-0001); Deutsche Bank confirmation slip of DEM 100 paid into new Deutsche Bank account, 11 February 1992 (Pape\u0161-0002); Payment order for transfer of DEM 1,450,000, 10 February 1992 (Pape\u0161-0003); Payment order for transfer of DEM 600,000, 10 February 1992 (Pape\u0161-0004); Notarised statement of Mr Mohamed Salem, 11 February 1992 (Pape\u0161-0005). Mr Pape\u0161 stated that he gave the banking information to Mr Zavareo and did not know whether Croatia was able to collect that money as he had no further dealings on that matter.\n\nPape\u0161 Statement, \u00b6 14.\n\n358.\n\nIn mid-February 1992, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 still needed to raise roughly two-thirds of the purchase price to complete the transaction.521 Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s second witness statement asserted that:\n\n*I had previously told Mr Martinovi\u0107 about my efforts to raise funds for the purchase price. Knowing of the situation, Mr Martinovi\u0107 offered to arrange for a short-term loan by the Ministry of Finance. He told me that the Ministry could lend me DEM 2 million to pay the purchase price, which I would pay back when needed. I never had any doubts that Mr Martinovi\u0107 had the authority to dispose of this money; he was after all the Finance Minister.*522\n\n*Given the promises I had from my wife\u2019s family and friends, I believed that it would not be a problem to return the money whenever requested by the Finance Ministry. We agreed that I would return the money to the Croatian Ministry of Finance by depositing it into an account abroad upon Mr Martinovi\u0107\u2019s instruction. He told me that I should have the full amount readily available in six months* [at] *the latest. I agreed.*\n\n*Mr Martinovi\u0107 told me that the money was held by Ivica Pape\u0161. At the same time, this was also an opportunity to move the money from Mr Pape\u0161, whom Mr Martinovi\u0107 did not trust, and to keep the foreign currency abroad. I did not know, until I learned in this arbitration, how the money came to Mr Pape\u0161.*\n\n*The next morning we drove to Mr Pape\u0161 and told him that he should transfer the money to my account at Feichtner Bank, to which he agreed. I had never asked Mr Pape\u0161 to help me find money to pay the purchase price of the companies*.523\n\nTr Day 2, 363:6-9 (Testimony of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107: \"At that time, I managed to borrow from Martinovi\u0107, the amount that I needed which I then returned using the money from my father-in-law, sister, and friends\" (emphasis added)).\n\nIt is of course not possible for the Tribunal to check the veracity of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s account of a private conversation with the now-deceased Minister.\n\nSecond Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 80-82 (emphasis added). *See also*, \u00b6 84 (\"in his capacity as the Minister of Finance\") and \u00a7 IV.B (\"[...] the Loan from the Ministry of Finance\" (emphasis added)).\n\n359.\n\nMr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s testimony was the basis for the Claimants\u2019 characterisation of this transaction (of which there was no mention at all in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial and witness statements) as being a \"short-term loan\" from the Croatian Ministry of Finance (in their Reply, and to some extent at the Hearing).524\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00a7 II.D.3(c) (\"Repayment of the Ministry of Finance Loan\") and \u00a7 II.D.3(d) (\"Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 never engaged in illegal activity with respect to the Ministry of Finance loan\" (emphasis added)). *See also* Tr Day 2, 389:2-4 (Testimony of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107: \"I had thought that this was a loan of the Ministry of Finance, I concluded this, because he was a Minister of Finance.\").\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal has not attached weight to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s claim that the Minister \"offered to arrange a short-term loan\", because Mr \u0160tuli\u0107\u2019s evidence suggests that the Minister was not enthusiastic about assisting Mr Gavrilovi\u0107. It appears that he was prevailed upon to make monies available to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, that the funds recovered by Mr Pape\u0161 were sitting in a bank account in Germany, and that they could be used to assist Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 in paying for the Five Companies.\n\n361.\n\nThe Tribunal does not believe that this loan was in any way a \"normal\" one in the sense rather hopefully suggested by the Claimants\u2019 Reply, given that the evidence shows that the Ministry of Finance is not in the business of granting loans to private parties. Moreover, as will be discussed below, there are serious questions as to the loan\u2019s documentation which suggest an intent to mislead anyone who read it.\n\n362.\n\nOnce the DEM 2 million loan was obtained, matters moved very quickly. On 2 March 1992, the funds were transferred from Mr Pape\u0161' Deutsche Bank account to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s account at Bankhaus Feichtner.525 On the same date, Bankhaus Feichtner issued a loan proposal to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 for DEM 1 million.526\n\nLetter from Mr Ivica Pape\u0161 to Deutsche Bank requesting transfer of DEM 2 million to Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 at Bankhaus Feichtner dated 2 March 1992 (R-0338). Pape\u0161 Statement, \u00b6 18, with handwritten transfer document annexed as Pape\u0161-0006.\n\nLetter from Bankhaus Feichtner to Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 regarding Loan Account No 6758-010, 2 March 1992 (C-0614). Since the Loan Agreement was not filed in evidence, the Respondent does not accept that it has been proven that Bankhaus Feichtner actually made a loan.\n\n363.\n\n*The very next day*, on 3 March 1992, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed \"that the debt of Mr Geor[g] Gavrilovi\u0107 for the purchase of [assets] amounts to 3,305,000 DEM\" and further that the court and bankruptcy management \"accept the fulfilment of this obligation of Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 in the way that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 or creditor bank transfer the referenced amount to [Inacomm\u2019s account in Zug].\"527\n\nRuling of Zagreb County Commercial Court confirming payment to Inacomm International S.A. dated 3 March 1992 (R-0032) (emphasis added).\n\n364.\n\nThe Court\u2019s designation of Inacomm\u2019s Swiss bank account as the destination for the payment of the purchase price within 24 hours of Mr Pape\u0161' having transferred the funds to Bankhaus Feichtner strongly suggests significant \"behind the scenes\" coordination within the Government. The very fact that the Court, an organ of the State, instructed Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 to transfer the funds to an account of a company that was indirectly owned by Croatia points strongly in the direction of significant Government involvement.\n\n365.\n\nAnother piece of record evidence assists in explaining why Inacomm was selected. In a 2014 interview with Croatian investigators, the former Bankruptcy Judge, stated that he had learned (he claimed only recently) that INA and Inacomm had been used in furtherance of the war effort:\n\n*I must also mention that only recently, while working on a civil case in the capacity of the attorney at law, I learned what was this company Inacomm International S.A. Panama* [was] *actually dealing with, and what it was used for. Thus, within this litigation, I learned that during the Homeland war numerous payments were made to this company, i.e. money was deposited to this company and later used for the purchase of weapons needed for the defence of the* [Republic of Croatia].528\n\nInterview Mr Tuk\u0161a (C-0207), p 2 (emphasis added).\n\n366.\n\nThis statement provides an important clue as to the State\u2019s interest in having the monies flow to a legal entity which it ultimately controlled.\n\n367.\n\nIt is wholly implausible that any of Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107, Boras, Tuk\u0161a or the Bankruptcy Council could have divined the details of an otherwise secret Swiss bank account of a Panamanian company. Thus, any suggestion that one of them, particularly the First Claimant, came up with this payment destination is simply not credible. Logically, only someone associated with Inacomm itself or its ultimate owner, the Croatian State, would be privy to that information.\n\n368.\n\nWhen questioned in 2014 on this direction by the Court, the Bankruptcy Judge and the Liquidator both disclaimed any knowledge of how the Inacomm account details came to be specified in the Court\u2019s order (although both tied the transaction in one way or another to the State).\n\n369.\n\nWhen interviewed by investigators, they did not even attempt to defend the payment to that account as being in accordance with the Bankruptcy Act. Rather, each sought to pin the blame on the other (or, in Mr Boras\u2019 case, on Judge Tuk\u0161a and other unnamed officials).\n\n370.\n\nIn his interview with investigators held on 25 August 2014, Judge Tuk\u0161a disclaimed any role in specifying Inacomm as the payee, stating that he merely signed what was put before him by the Liquidator. He added:\n\n*In any case, if the money for buying the companies \"Gavrilovi\u0107 in bankruptcy\" was paid to the account of the company Inacomm International S.A. Panama, I believe than* [sic] *that that money really eventually ended up in the state budget. The bankruptcy liquidator has never told me, or informed me that the money for purchase of the companies \"Gavrilovi\u0107 in bankruptcy\" was never paid.529*\n\nInterview with Mr Tuk\u0161a (C-0207), p 2 (emphasis added).\n\n371.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot fail to observe that more than 20 years after the bankruptcy proceeding, the Bankruptcy Judge was professing to have no knowledge about why the Swiss bank account was specified in the order that he signed or indeed whether the funds were ultimately transferred into the bankruptcy estates in the proceeding for which he was responsible.\n\n372.\n\nOne week later, on 1 September 2014, the former Liquidator, Mr Boras, pointed the finger in the other direction, namely, at the Bankruptcy Court and perhaps at higher officials:\n\n*In relation to payment of the purchase price in the amount of 3,305,000.00 DEM, whereby the entire amount was to be paid to the entity Inacom*[m] *International S.A., Panama, into the account with the Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft, Bahnhofstrasse 26, 6300 ZUG, account No 218,746.60T, the subject stated that on 03 03 1992 the Zagreb District Commercial Court issued a Certificate, signed by the bankruptcy judge, Zdravko Tusek* [sic] *, by which this was ordered. He does not know who issued this order; he assumes that the decision was rendered by the state President, the Prime Minister or some other services.*530\n\nInterview Mr Boras (R-0351), p 2 (emphasis added).\n\n373.\n\nOnce again, the Tribunal cannot fail to observe that more than 20 years after the bankruptcy proceeding, the Liquidator was likewise professing to have no knowledge about why the Inacomm account was specified in the order; yet he points the finger to the highest levels of the then-Croatian government.\n\n374.\n\nNeither explanation is satisfactory, and both point to a serious irregularity in the conduct of the bankruptcy proceeding\u2014made worse by the fact that the two persons concerned were involved in the commission of this very act, but the Tribunal need not resolve whose account is correct, or indeed whether either individual told the truth. The key point is that a Swiss bank account owned by an entity ultimately controlled by the Croatian State was designated as the recipient of the agreed consideration for the purchase of the Five Companies, and further that this was specified by an order of the Zagreb District Commercial Court. This could not have been orchestrated by the First Claimant alone; it had to have been the Government\u2019s doing.\n\n375.\n\nThe designation of a State-owned entity as the recipient of the payment for the bankrupt assets assumes even greater significance when the provenance of the DEM 2 million is considered. These were of course the monies that were recovered by Mr Pape\u0161 after Mr Salem failed to buy the arms that had been ordered by Minister Martinovi\u0107 on 21 January 1992.531\n\nUSKOK Report pertaining to File No KR-DO-689/11 dated 11 November 2014 (C-0245), also annexed to \u0160tuli\u0107 Statement as \u0160tuli\u0107-0001, is the 21 January 1992 letter by which Minister Martinovi\u0107 instructed the funds to be transferred to Mr Salem. The USKOK Report pertaining to File No KR-DO-689/11 dated 11 November 2014 (C-0245), which contains a series of documents pertaining to the operation of the Villach account, has correspondence referring to the funds as \"Support Funds Croatia A\" and \"Support Funds Croatia B\", at pages 5-10 *;* \u0160tuli\u0107 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 7-9; Tr Day 5, 948:4-8 (Testimony of Mr \u0160tuli\u0107: \"the [Villach] account [\u2026] was not HDZ account. It was the account of Croatia to support and procure armament.\"); Statement of Mr Branko \u0160tuli\u0107 made in the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File No KR-DO-689/11, 17 October 2014 (C-0612), p 2, confirming that the Croatian Ministry of Finance used the Villach account to purchase weapons for the defence of Croatia; Tr Day 3, 586:9-586:16 (Testimony of Mr Degoricija: \"Q. [...] But are you familiar with a Villach account? A. The account in Villach was not the account of the State. It was a Party account. Our party, Croatian Democratic Union, had its giro accounts in Villach. And this is where Croatian citizens living around the world could pay money into because Croatia was aggressed by Serbia and the Yugoslavia Army and part of the Croatia territory was under occupation\" (emphasis added). *See also* Tr Day 3, 612:18-615:14).\n\n376.\n\nThese monies were without doubt intended for the war effort. When this fact is considered together with Mr Tuk\u0161a\u2019s statement that INA and Inacomm had been used to purchase arms, the reason for the Court\u2019s instruction to transfer the purchase price to Inacomm becomes clearer.\n\n377.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, specifying Inacomm as the recipient of the funds meant that the monies transferred to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 were only \"at risk\" for the period of time that Bankhaus Feichtner held them before they were transferred onwards to Inacomm\u2019s account, a period of only 4 or 5 days.532 Given the funds\u2019 provenance, it made sense that the Minister (and/or someone else in the Government) would want to ensure that they would be used to quickly pay for the Five Companies and then be transferred on to another entity controlled by the Government of Croatia (It need hardly be added that, when viewed in this manner, the evidence points further in the direction of a finding that the funds were not intended to be transferred to the bankruptcy estates to satisfy creditors\u2019 claims, but rather to be used in connection with the war effort.). Of course, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 still had to repay the loan, but the assets of the Five Companies would be susceptible to execution if he failed to do so.\n\nMr Pape\u0161 transferred the funds on 2 March 1992; *see* Letter from Mr Ivica Pape\u0161 to Deutsche Bank requesting transfer of DEM 2 million to Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 at Bankhaus Feichtner dated 2 March 1992 (R-0338), also annexed to Pape\u0161 Statement as Pape\u0161-0006. The Zagreb District Commercial Court issued the ruling confirming payment to Inacomm International the following day (*see* Ruling of Zagreb County Commercial Court confirming payment to Inacomm International S.A. dated 3 March 1992 (R-0032)), and on 6 March 1992, Bankhaus Feichtner transferred the DEM 2 million to Inacomm \u2019s bank account in Zug (*see* Receipt of Wire Transfer from Bankhaus Feichtner to Inacomm International S.A., Panama, 6 March 1992 (R-0350)).\n\n378.\n\nThe evidence of a State interest does not end there. Even at the end of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s dealings with Mr Martinovi\u0107, there is further evidence of a State interest. The evidence adduced by the Respondent itself is that the monies deposited by Mr Idrizi and Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 in the Graz bank accounts in November 1992 were to the credit of yet another arms dealer, Mr Joshua Waldhorn.533 One of the individuals interviewed by State prosecutors, Mr Snjezana Siprak, who worked at the Office of the President of the Republic of Croatia and the Ministry of Defence in the early 1990s, stated that Mr Waldhorn had worked with Mr Martinovi\u0107.534\n\nThe Respondent freely acknowledged this.\n\nStatement of Mr Snjezana Siprak made in the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File No KR-DO-689/11, 14 October 2014 (C-0238), p 2:  \n*On a specific question I can state that I do know Joshua Waldhorn, and it was a person who was involved in weapons procurement, while I stress that I have never cooperated with him. According to my knowledge, based on the access to documentation that was at general Zagorec\u2019s disposal, I know that Joshua Waldhorn, being a person who was taking part in arms procurement, was cooperating with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Croatia regarding such procurement, more concretely with Minister Jozo Martinovi\u0107. As far as I can remember Joshua Waldhorn was included in business deals of weapons procurement for the Republic of Croatia at the start of the Homeland war.* [The] *[secretary of Jozo Martinovi\u0107, for whom I know that her name was Andrea but I do not remember her other personal data, could know something more about concrete business deals between Joshua Waldhorn and Jozo Martinovi\u0107.*\n\n379.\n\nTo summarise, with Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s admission that he had begun smuggling currency to Austria sometime around June or July 1991, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the evidence points to a State interest in facilitating this transaction. To be specific: (i) the Five Companies were conveyed to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 by means of the bankruptcy proceeding; (ii) the Minister made funds available to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 either on his own initiative or, as Mr \u0160tuli\u0107 surmised from the Minister\u2019s statements at the time, at the request of someone else, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, likely higher up in the Government; and (iii) a Swiss bank account of a company owned indirectly by Croatia was designated. All of this points to heavy State involvement.\n\n380.\n\nIt is bizarre that funds ostensibly aimed at recovering monies owed by the bankrupt company to its creditors could be paid into a Swiss bank account of a wholly unrelated person and that this would be deemed by the Bankruptcy Court to be an acceptable means of satisfying the creditors. The Tribunal cannot accept that in the ordinary course of justice in Croatia a court would deem that this would satisfy the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act, and in that respect, the Tribunal shares counsel for the Respondent\u2019s scepticism as to the Court\u2019s independence in this instance.535\n\nTr Day 2, 452:3-454:11.\n\n381.\n\nHowever, when considered in light of the wartime conditions in which the State found itself, the speed with which the Bankruptcy Court gave a precise instruction of confidential Swiss bank account information to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 specifying where the purchase price should be paid, the fact that monies devoted to the war effort that were already located outside of the territory of Croatia could temporarily be made available to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 to effect payment, and the fact that the recipient of those funds (and the balance of the purchase price that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 had raised) was a State-owned enterprise also located outside of Croatian territory, the evidence suggests that the Court was \"given the nod\" to effect the transaction. On the evidence before the Tribunal, there is no other logical explanation for its directing that the purchaser price be paid to Inacomm.\n\n382.\n\nAll of this is highly irregular, but the obvious problem for the Respondent is that different parts of the proceeding bear the fingerprints of the Zagreb District Commercial Court, the Bankruptcy Judge, the Minister of Finance (and possibly higher-up State officials), and a State-owned enterprise. None of this could have occurred without the active and decisive involvement of the organs of the State.\n\n383.\n\nHad the Respondent satisfied the Tribunal that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 orchestrated this situation, it would have had no compunction in agreeing that his investment was not made in conformity with Croatian legislation. But the evidence points more strongly in the direction of the State\u2019s orchestrating the bankruptcy and thus the transfer of the Five Companies to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 as a *quid pro quo* for his currency smuggling, as discussed above. In short, while this was plainly to the benefit of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and the Tribunal has no doubt that he understood exactly what was going on (particularly when his dealings with the Minister in early March 1992 and the visit to Mr Pape\u0161 are considered), the central plank of the Respondent\u2019s attack, namely, that *he* orchestrated it has not been proven and, for the reasons discussed above, seems to the Tribunal to be implausible.\n\n384.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is not open to the State to plead the patent irregularities of a bankruptcy proceeding overseen and authorised at critical junctures by its own court or the making of an extraordinary loan approved by a senior government minister, which might or might not have been unlawful under Croatian law, in opposition to the BIT claim. Put another way, if this investment was not made in conformity with the legislation of Croatia, on the evidence before this Tribunal, this is due to the acts of organs of the State. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that under Article 7 of the ILC Articles, the conduct of an organ of a State shall be considered an act of the State under international law if the organ exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.536\n\nILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), Art 7 (\"*Excess of authority or contravention of instructions*\"). This approach has been reflected in such cases as *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No ARB/84/3, Award, 20 May 1992 (***Southern Pacific v Egypt***) (CL-0068), \u00b6 81; *Kardassopoulos v Georgia* (CL-0117), \u00b6 190; and *Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v Government of Mongolia*, UNCITRAL, Award, 28 April 2011 (***Paushok v Mongolia***) (CL-0218), \u00b6 606.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot complete its discussion of the loan transaction without recording its view that the dealings between Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and Minister Martinovi\u0107, like the bankruptcy proceeding, also bear the markings of irregularity.\n\n386.\n\nFirst, against the advice of his Chief of Staff, Minister Martinovi\u0107 authorised the transfer of funds clearly intended to be used in the defence of Croatia.537 Notwithstanding the Claimants\u2019 attempt to characterise this as a run-of-the-mill loan from the Ministry, this is simply implausible. The Tribunal is unaware of any State where Government ministers grant loans to private persons except in prescribed financing programmes that are overseen by the ministry\u2019s bureaucracy. As discussed below, this loan bears no marks of bureaucratic regularity.\n\nMr \u0160tuli\u0107 testified that he saw a document pertaining to the origin of the funds that Mr Pape\u0161 recovered (namely, the instruction on Ministry of Finance letterhead to the Ministry of Emigration instructing a transfer of funds from the Villach account to Salem): \u0160tuli\u0107-0001.\n\n387.\n\nThe evidence of both Mr Pape\u0161 and Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 moreover is that the monies were transferred by Mr Pape\u0161 to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s bank account on the Minister\u2019s oral instruction.538\n\nSecond Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 82: \"The next morning we drove to Mr Pape\u0161 and told him that he should transfer the money to my account at Feichtner Bank, to which he agreed\"; Pape\u0161 Statement, \u00b6 16: \"Mr Martinovi\u0107 asked me to transfer the money to the account of Georg Gavrilovi\u0107.\" *See also* Mr Questioning of Mr Branko \u0160tuli\u0107 at the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File Nos K-US-196/14; IS-US-64/14, 11 November 2015 (C-0613), p 3: \"Regarding Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 I can say that later, i.e. around 1994, Terezija Barbaric made a comment in the sense that Jozo Martinovi\u0107 issued an order to pay to Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 2,000,000,00 DEM. However, I am not familiar with any detail about that. I have not seen any documentation regarding that payment.\"\n\n388.\n\nFurther, the transaction was not documented until some weeks *after* it occurred. A document on Ministry of Finance letterhead dated 23 March 1992, bears the signatures of Messrs Martinovi\u0107 and Gavrilovi\u0107, as well as those of Mr Pape\u0161, and a Mr \u017darko Tomi\u0107,539 according to which Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107, Pape\u0161, and Tomi\u0107 agreed to return DEM 2.5 million within six months, at an 8% interest rate.540\n\nMr Tomi\u0107 was interviewed by investigators on 6 October 2014 and denied having any knowledge of this transaction. *See* Interview with Mr \u017darko Tomi\u0107 by the County Public Prosecution Service, File No 511-01-77-OGR-162, 6 October 2014 (**Interview with Mr Tomi\u0107**) (C-0237), pp 12-13 (emphasis added):  \n*On a specific question whether he knows Duro Gavrilovi\u0107, Ivica Pape\u0161 and Jozo Martinovi\u0107, he replies that he never saw or met Duro Gavrilovi\u0107, he says that he does not know who is Jozo Martinovi\u0107, and for Ivica Pape\u0161 he says that he met him through Rudo Markovic from Zagreb [...] On a specific question whether he ever took par [sic] in any agreements with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Croatia, whether some documents were made regarding those agreements, who was taking part in agreements and what they have been referring to, whether he was called and by whom to sign any documents relating to payment or return of some money, the questioned answers that he does not understand questions as he was never taking part in agreements with anyone from the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Croatia nor f from any other ministry of the Republic of Croatia nor he was being called by anyone to sign something like that.*\n\nLoan Agreement (C-0216). Note that Messrs Pape\u0161 and Tomi\u0107 claim to have no knowledge of the document. *See* Interview with Mr Tomi\u0107 (C-0237). *See also* Statement of Mr Ivica Pape\u0161 made in the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File No KR-DO-689/11, 7 October 2014 (C-0236), pp 1-2 (emphasis added):  \n*I hereby state that I never took part in any dealings or agreements with Jozo Martinovi\u0107 and Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 regarding the manner and times in which the money in the amount of DEM 2,000,000,00, which I have previously transferred to Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 upon such order from Jozo Martinovi\u0107, was to be repaid. On a specific question, when I was also presented a copy of the document \"Agreement\" of March 23, 1992, signed by Jozo Martinovi\u0107, Gjuro Gavrilovi\u0107 and myself, I state that I do not recall signing such document. I am even not aware of the content of this document. I can not explain how come that my signature appears on this document, i.e. I am clarifying that it is very likely that this is my signature. I simply do not remember circumstances of signing such an \"Agreement.\" Also, I do not know a person named in this document, named \u017darko Tomi\u0107* [...] *I cannot explain why is this \u017darko Tomi\u0107 mentioned in the document presented to me, nor can I explain why does the document state that Gjuro Gavrilovi\u0107 and I are undertaking an obligation to \"return - repay the transferred amount* [...].\n\n389.\n\nThe wording of the Loan Agreement, which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 testified was prepared by Mr Martinovi\u0107, did not reflect the reality of what had in fact occurred because it implied that the money had not yet been recovered.541 This can reasonably be viewed as being calculated to obscure the reality of what had actually occurred in that: (i) incontrovertibly, most of the money had already been recovered by Mr Pape\u0161; (ii) incontrovertibly, at Mr Martinovi\u0107\u2019s instruction, Mr Pape\u0161 had then transferred the DEM 2 million to Bankhaus Feichtner; and (iii) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 knew where the money had come from and knew where the money had gone.542 The Loan Agreement\u2019s statement that \"Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107, Pape\u0161 and Tomi\u0107 shall continue with their work on the return of the total amount, and shall inform Jozo Martinovi\u0107 on every action taken\" was, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, completely misleading.543\n\nLoan Agreement (C-0216).\n\nMr Gavrilovi\u0107 acknowledged this to be the case during cross-examination: Tr Day 2, 404:17-19.\n\nTr Day 2, 404:17-19. In his second interview with the investigators, on 7 October 2014, Mr Pape\u0161 stated  \n*I simply do not remember circumstances of signing such an \"Agreement\". Also, I do not know a person named in this document, named \u017darko Tomi\u0107. The name \u017darko Tomi\u0107 is not familiar to me. Maybe I have met this person, but can't remember. Maybe if I could see this \u017darko Tomi\u0107 I would recognize him. However, I can not explain why is this \u017darko Tomi\u0107 mentioned in the document presented to me, nor can I explain why does the document state that Gjuro Gavrilovi\u0107 and I are undertaking an obligation to \"return - repay the transferred amount, together with the bank interest, requesting at least 8% per annum, and transfer the money back to the account. from which it was transferred.\" I must say that it seems illogical to me why would I, together with Gjuro Gavrilovi\u0107, undertake an obligation to repay the money, for which I am aware that I have previously transferred it to him upon such order of the minister? Even more so since I knew that this money was used for purchase of the. five companies \"Gavrilovi\u0107 \" under bankruptcy, which eventually became his ownership. I would also like to accent that in such a case I would certainly - having in mind that the presented document states that money must be repaid as early as possible, but not later than within six months - during that period be checking and requesting Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 to repay the money, all because this document binds me as well, in a way. Therefore due to the time elapsed since then, I am completely unable to explain how did it happen that I would possibly sign this document, provided that this is my signature at all.*  \n Statement of Mr Ivica Pape\u0161 made in the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File No KR-DO-689/11, 7 October 2014 (C-0236), p 2 (emphasis added).\n\n390.\n\nEven Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 had difficulty explaining the transaction. Given that it did not reflect the reality of what had transpired, the best that he could do at the Hearing was to disavow the document because it did not have an official Ministry of Finance stamp and claim that he did not understand what it meant and signed it only because it was Mr Martinovi\u0107\u2019s document.544\n\nTr Day 2, 392:21-393:7 (Testimony of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107: \"The document was not entered and it is not stamped by the Ministry of Finance. It was written on the letterhead of the Ministry of Finance. I remember exactly how this all happened. I was at the Ministry, and he gave me this piece of paper, and he said, 'You should sign this, and this is just a formality.' And so I signed. The date and the signature of Mr Pape\u0161 made me conclude later, now, that he was with me then and there, although he claims he wasn't.\").\n\n391.\n\nThe Loan Agreement exhibited other oddities. Two of its signatories, Messrs Pape\u0161 and Tomi\u0107, told investigators either that he could not recall signing the document (in Mr Pape\u0161' case) and believed that it made no sense for the reason just noted above, or (in Mr Tomi\u0107\u2019s case) told investigators that he had never even met the Minister or Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, never visited the Ministry of Finance\u2019s premises, and had not signed the document.545 There is thus no doubt in the Tribunal\u2019s mind that the circumstances surrounding the Loan Agreement were highly irregular.\n\nInterview with Mr Tomi\u0107 (C-0237), pp 12-13: \"On a specific question whether he knows Duro Gavrilovi\u0107, Ivica Pape\u0161 and Jozo Martinovi\u0107, he replies that he never saw or met Duro Gavrilovi\u0107, he says that he does not know who is Jozo Martinovi\u0107, [\u2026] he does not understand questions as he was never taking part in agreements with anyone from the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Croatia nor from any other ministry of the Republic of Croatia nor he was being called by anyone to sign something like that.\"\n\n392.\n\nOnce again, the problem for the Respondent\u2019s case is that the document was evidently prepared by, and clearly signed by, the Minister, and was on Ministry of Finance letterhead. It is difficult in such circumstances for the Respondent to disavow the document where, on the evidence before the Tribunal, it has not been proven that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 obtained the loan through corruption or other improper means.\n\n393.\n\nIn any event, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 (not Messrs Pape\u0161 and Tomi\u0107) then faced the prospect of having to repay the loan by 23 August 1992. He was not able to do so. Thus, on that date, Mr Martinovi\u0107 signed what the Claimants called an \"extension of the [L]oan [A]greement\" setting a new deadline of 90 days: \"The return of the amount of around DEM 2,050,000.- was secured, and the same amount shall be transferred to a bank account determined by the Ministry of Finance within the subsequent period of no longer than 90 days.\"546 This \"extension\" document is perhaps even odder than the 23 March 1992 document because it is not disputed that the government changed in early August 1992 and Mr \u0160tuli\u0107\u2019s witness statement had Mr Martinovi\u0107 leaving the Ministry on 12 August 1992,547 11 days *before* he signed the so-called \"extension of the [L]oan [A]greement\" on Ministry of Finance letterhead.\n\nAmendment Agreement (C-0217).\n\n\u0160tuli\u0107 Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 10.\n\n394.\n\nAt the First Hearing, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 disclaimed any knowledge of this document, saying that he had never seen it until recently548 (even though it was characterised by the Claimants\u2019 pleadings as an extension of the Loan Agreement549).\n\nTr Day 2 420-421.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 175.\n\n395.\n\nFinally, in this regard, the State\u2019s involvement is evident in Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s repayment of the DEM 2 million (or at least that amount for which there is record evidence). In November 1992, after the Zagreb shop was sold, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 made payment into the bank accounts of Mr Joshua Waldhorn, who, on the Respondent\u2019s own case, was an arms dealer.550 This account designation was evidently given to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 by Mr Martinovi\u0107, who by this time was back in the private sector with Privredna Banka Zagreb.551 According to evidence given to investigators, President Tudjman requested Mr Martinovi\u0107 to continue to oversee the funding of the war effort even after the government changed and he left the Ministry.552\n\nSecond Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 88 (emphasis added):  \n*[...] In October 1992, when Mr Martinovi\u0107 asked me to transfer an amount of DEM 1,131,300 to the account of 'Waldhorn' in repayment of the loan, I needed to recoup the DEM 400,000 of my wife\u2019s sisters (sic) money and other funds that we had put in the business in the meantime. At that time, I was negotiating with the Idrizi family a sale of one of the best pieces of real estate Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. owed in the center of Zagreb. Mr Idrizi planned to open a shoe store there, which he operates until today. Of this repayment, 240 million Croatian Dinar (HRD) - around DEM 531,000 - was transferred by Mr Gajur Idrizi, to whom we had sold the store in the center of Zagreb. The remainder of around DEM 600,000 was transferred from my money to the Waldhorn account. Mr Idrizi had a business and money in Italy. He traveled with the money to Graz, where we met and I asked him to deposit his and our money to the 'Waldhorn' account.*\n\nMr Martinovi\u0107 left the Ministry of Finance on 12 August 1992: Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 97.\n\nStatement of Mr Branko \u0160tuli\u0107 made in the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb, File No KR-DO-689/11, 17 October 2014 (C-0612), p 2:  \n*Since the beginning of 1992 Jozo Martinovi\u0107 was strongly involved in helping the defense of Herceg-Bosnia. Croatia was providing logistic assistance in money and weapons for the defense of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and I can say that it was the same source of money for the purchase of weapons for the defense of both Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina during 1992 [...] On a specific question what were the authorities of Jozo Martinovi\u0107 regarding disposal of money intended for the defense of the Republic of Croatia I state that according to my knowledge Jozo Martinovi\u0107 could independently ordered any disposal with money intended for purchase of arMs He was completely independent regarding that issue, he had completely free hands.*  \n*He enjoyed a strong confidence of Gojko Susak, and only Prime Minister Franjo Greguric and Jurica Pavelic as a deputy prime minister were above him in the hierarchy in those days.*  \n*See also* \u0160tuli\u0107 Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12:  \n*Before leaving the Ministry of Finance, the Croatian President at the time, Mr Franjo Tudman, asked Mr Martinovi\u0107 to continue dealing with the raising of funds and payments for the procurement of military equipment. I know this because Mr Martinovi\u0107 told me.*  \n*Accordingly, Mr Martinovi\u0107 took with him to Privredna Bank not only all of his personal papers, but also documents relating to the procurement of military equipment. The division of Mr Martinovi\u0107\u2019s documents was carried out principally by his assistant, though I helped her at times. The division took a couple of days to complete as there were many documents to sort through.*  \n*See further* the Testimony of Mr \u0160tuli\u0107: Tr Day 5, 948:13-949:14 (emphasis added):  \n*Q. Now, when Mr Martinovi\u0107 left the Ministry on August 12, 1992, you assisted him in removing from the Ministry the documents that he had worked with respect to the Villach account and other related matters; is that correct?*  \n*A. That is correct.*  \n*Q. Because these documents, such as these documents that we've seen here, these are not Ministry documents. That\u2019s why they were allowed to leave the Ministry; correct?*  \n*A: For the most part* [\u2026] *On the basis of the authority given by President Tudjman in agreement with the new Minister Jasic authorizing him to continue to conduct the tasks related to the defense of Croatia.* [\u2026]  \n Mr *Q. This was in Mr Martinovi\u0107\u2019s personal capacity, though, as he was no longer a member of the Government or Government Ministry; correct?*  \n*A. That\u2019s right.*\n\n396.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the loan was highly irregular but, on the basis of the evidence before it, that irregularity cannot be imputed to the First Claimant. It was authorised by the Minister, it appears, on his own initiative or on instructions of someone higher up in the Government. The Tribunal considers that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 knew how irregular it was for the Ministry of Finance to be financing the acquisition of assets in bankruptcy by a private party, but this fits within the larger picture of the Government\u2019s returning a favour during a period of wartime exigency. Given this, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is not open to Croatia to oppose the claim on the basis of an illegality that the State itself not only countenanced but likely orchestrated. This finding applies equally to the Respondent\u2019s claims in relation to the transfer of monies from the Five Companies to the Claimants during the pending bankruptcy.553\n\nAs set out in Issues 1.2(b)(v), 1.2(b)(vii)(B) and 1.2(b)(vii)(C) *supra*.\n\n397.\n\nFor all those reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s illegality objections.\n\n398.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its decision has been based on the evidence before it and on the legal conclusion that under international law the State cannot oppose a claim on grounds of illegality where the evidence shows that the State was involved with such illegality (including where, as here, it is likely on a balance of probabilities that the State orchestrated the potentially illegal scheme).554\n\nWhile the facts of this case are unique in that both parties knew or ought to have known their conduct was illegal, this approach has been reflected in such cases as *Southern Pacific v Egypt* (CL-0068), \u00b6 81; *Kardassopoulos v Georgia* (CL-0117), \u00b6 190; and *Paushok v Mongolia* (CL-0218), \u00b6 606. For example, in *Southern Pacific*, the tribunal stated that \"The principle of international law which the Tribunal is bound to apply is that which establishes the international responsibility of States when unauthorized or *ultra vire* s acts of officials have been performed by State agents under cover of their official character. If such unauthorized or *ultra vires* acts could not be ascribed to the State, all State responsibility would be rendered illusory\": *Southern Pacific v Egypt* (CL-0068), \u00b6 85. *See also* ILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), Art 7.\n\n399.\n\nThe Tribunal is of course aware that certain aspects of the bankruptcy, in particular the dealings between Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and the late Minister, form a central part of the war profiteering prosecution which is currently underway in Croatia. It is, however, not within the mandate of this Tribunal to judge whether or not the Minister engaged in an abuse of office or whether Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 committed an offense in seeking an abuse of office. As the Tribunal observed in its Decision on Provisional Measures, the \"Croatian State was empowered to investigate crimes which form part of that State\u2019s law.\"555 Therefore, the Tribunal does not think it appropriate, in the circumstances of the present case, to attempt to decide the Croatian criminal law issue based upon duelling expert reports, when the matter is *sub judice* in the Croatian courts.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 198.\n\n400.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the illegality case is not opposable to the Claimants and the objections are accordingly dismissed.\n\n401.\n\nIn conclusion, for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 claims: both Claimants are investors who made an investment under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n402.\n\nHaving ratified the ICSID Convention on 22 September 1998, Croatia has been an ICSID Contracting State since 22 October 1998, and is also a Contracting Party to the BIT. Based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal concludes that a legal dispute arising from the Claimants\u2019 investment exists between the Claimants and Croatia for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 9 of the BIT.\n\n403.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied that the pre-requisites of Article 9(2) of the BIT, namely providing sufficiently detailed notice and the amicable settlement period, have been complied with by the Claimants.556 By accepting Croatia\u2019s advance consent to ICSID arbitration contained in Article 9 of the BIT in the Request for Arbitration, the Parties have consented in writing to ICSID arbitration for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 273-275; *see also* Claimants\u2019 Request \u00b6\u00b6 149-150 and C-0048 and C-0049.\n\n**VIl. ISSUE 2: ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nHaving determined that it has jurisdiction to hear this dispute, the Tribunal turns to the question of admissibility. The Respondent has raised two admissibility objections. The first objection turns on the Respondent\u2019s contention that \"the Claimants and the alleged investment were steeped in unlawfulness and corruption.\"557 Therefore, the Respondent argues, the Tribunal should dismiss the Claimants\u2019 claims as inadmissible, because the international investment system does not protect illegal investments.558 The Respondent\u2019s second admissibility objection is that the Tribunal must dismiss all claims premised on non-performance of the Purchase Agreement, because the exclusive jurisdiction clause in that contract renders those claims inadmissible in this arbitration.559\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 374.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 384-385.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 387; *see also* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 381-389; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 677-687.\n\n405.\n\nThe Claimants cast the Respondent\u2019s admissibility objections as nothing more than an \"attempt to repackage its unfounded jurisdictional arguments as admissibility objections.\"560 The Claimants state that the \"Respondent has failed to demonstrate any reason why this Tribunal, having jurisdiction to decide this dispute, may not look to the merits.\"561\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 474.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 475.\n\n406.\n\nAs set out in Issue 1 *supra*, the Tribunal has indeed rejected all of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. Having determined that jurisdiction exists, the Tribunal would need strong cause to decline to exercise it. As explained below, the Tribunal finds no such cause in the Respondent\u2019s admissibility objections.\n\n407.\n\nThe Tribunal divides its admissibility analysis according to four distinct questions: (Issue 2.1) does the ICSID Convention include the concept of \"admissibility\" as a type of preliminary objection?; (Issue 2.2) which party has the burden of proof regarding of the Alleged Illegalities as they relate to the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims?; (Issue 2.3) do any of the Alleged Illegalities render the Claimants\u2019 claims inadmissible?; and (Issue 2.4) are any of the Claimants\u2019 claims inadmissible due to the jurisdiction clause contained in the Purchase Agreement?\n\n**ISSUE 2.1: DOES THE ICSID CONVENTION INCLUDE THE CONCEPT OF \"ADMISSIBILITY\" AS A TYPE OF PRELIMINARY OBJECTION? IF NOT, ARE CHARACTERISATIONS OF ADMISSIBILITY OTHERWISE RELEVANT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"there is a cogent distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility\",562 and refers to *a long line of cases - many of those ICSID arbitrations -manifesting the general principle that, regardless of (express or implied) restrictions on a tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional title, an investment must have been obtained lawfully, in good faith and free from corruption for a tribunal to reach the merits stage and apply the substantive protections of an investment treaty*.563\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 382. *See also* Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 375.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 375.\n\n409.\n\nThe Respondent refers specifically to *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic*, *Hamester v Ghana*, *Inceysa v El Salvador*, *Plama v Bulgaria*, *World Duty Free v Kenya*, *Minnotte v Poland* and *Hulley Enterprises v Russia*, as examples of ICSID tribunals affirming that \"an investment tribunal cannot give effect to improperly acquired rights\" because claims based on those rights are inadmissible.564\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 376, *citing* *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic* (RL-0046), \u00b6\u00b6 100-105; *Hamester v Ghana* (CL-0038), \u00b6 123; *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No ARb/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006 (RL-0071), \u00b6\u00b6 248-249; *Plama Consortium Limited v Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008 *(**Plama v Bulgaria***) (RL-0090), \u00b6\u00b6 144, 146; *World Duty Free Company Limited v Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No ARB/00/7, Award, 4 October 2006 (RL-0079), \u00b6\u00b6 157, 179; *David Minnotte and Robert Lewis v Republic of Poland,* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/10/1, Award, 16 May 2014 (CL-0115), \u00b6 131; *Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v Russian Federation*, PCA Case No AA 226, Award, 18 July 2014 (RL-0092), \u00b6\u00b6 1350-1353.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nThe Claimants disagree. The Claimants argue that the ICSID Convention does not provide a basis for admissibility objections, asserting that \"[u]nlike the ICJ, the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules do not include a preliminary objection for 'admissibility,' as noted by many tribunals that rejected [the] Respondent\u2019s admissibility arguments.\"565 The Claimants specifically cite *Vivendi v Argentina*, a case where they say the tribunal \"dismissed outright respondent\u2019s admissibility objections as merely an attempt to re-litigate issues of jurisdiction.\"566\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 337, *citing* *Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Biskaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/26, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 December 2012 (CL-0222), \u00b6 126; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003 (***CMS v Argentina***) (RL-0108), \u00b6 41; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case. No ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 January 2004 (CL-0121), \u00b6 33; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Republic of Paraguay,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 12 February 2010 (***SGS v Paraguay***) (CL-0083), \u00b6 176.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 338.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent. Although the ICSID Convention includes no specific reference to admissibility, investor-State jurisprudence confirms that preliminary objections based on jurisdiction and on admissibility are permissible in the ICSID context.567 The facts and arguments underlying these two types of objections often overlap\u2014and they certainly do here\u2014but admissibility is nonetheless its own species of preliminary objection, separate and apart from jurisdiction.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/31, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 October 2011 (***Hochtief v Argentina***) (RL-0217), \u00b6 90; *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v Romania*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008 (***Micula v Romania***) (RL-0212), \u00b6 63.\n\n412.\n\nThe *Hochtief v Argentina* tribunal clearly and succinctly described the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility: \"[j]urisdiction is an attribute of a tribunal and not of a claim, whereas admissibility is an attribute of a claim but not of a tribunal.\"568 This Tribunal agrees. Questions of jurisdiction relate to the tribunal, e.g., whether the tribunal is empowered to resolve the dispute. Questions of admissibility relate to the claim itself, e.g., whether the claim is timely filed, whether it is ripe for adjudication, whether the procedural requirements have been met. Tribunals have asked, in the context of admissibility, questions such as: Did the claimant provide proper notification of its claims?569 Did the claimant fulfil domestic litigation requirements?570 Are the claims based on genuine, non-fraudulent documents?571 These types of questions\u2014 which relate to the claim, not the tribunal\u2014are questions of admissibility. On this point, the Tribunal also adopts the reasoning of the *Micula v Romania* tribunal, which similarly held that \"an objection to jurisdiction goes to the ability of a tribunal to hear a case while an objection to admissibility aims at the claim itself and presupposes that the tribunal has jurisdiction.\"572\n\n*Hochtief v Argentina* (RL-0217), \u00b6 90.\n\n*See Supervisi\u00f3n y Control, S.A. v Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No ARB/12/4, Award, 18 January 2017, \u00b6 346.\n\n*See Ickale Insaal Limited Sirketi v Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No ARB/10/24, Award, 8 March 2016, \u00b6 246.\n\n*See* *Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case Nos ARB/12/14 and ARB/12/40, Award, 6 December 2016, \u00b6 528.\n\n*Micula v Romania* (RL-0212), \u00b6 63.\n\n413.\n\nIn light of the jurisprudence cited above, with which the Tribunal agrees, the Tribunal finds that jurisdiction and admissibility are separate bases for preliminary objections. Thus, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to assess the Respondent\u2019s admissibility objections separately from the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction. The Tribunal turns to that admissibility analysis below.\n\n**ISSUE 2.2: WHICH PARTY HAS THE BURDEN OF PROOF REGARDING THE ALLEGED ILLEGALITIES AS THEY RELATE TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIMANTS' CLAIMS?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nAs the Parties have acknowledged,573 the burden of proof analysis for admissibility objections and for jurisdictional objections is essentially the same. Thus, the Tribunal refers to Issue 1.2(a) *supra*, which addresses burden of proof in the context of jurisdiction. As it did with respect to the jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent bears the burden of proving the factual predicates of its admissibility objections. It follows that if the Respondent cannot prove that the Alleged Illegalities occurred, the Respondent\u2019s first admissibility objection cannot stand.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 347: \"As set forth in [the Jurisdiction Section], the burden of proof regarding allegations of illegality [in the context of admissibility] rests with [the] Respondent, as the party making the allegations.\" *See also* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 371 *et seq.* (referring, in its discussion of admissibility, to the discussion of burden of proof with respect to jurisdiction).\n\n**ISSUE 2.3: DO ANY OF THE ALLEGED ILLEGALITIES RENDER THE CLAIMANTS' CLAIMS INADMISSIBLE?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nAs noted above, the burden of proof with respect to the Alleged Illegalities rests with the Respondent. However, as explained in Issue 1.2(b) *supra*, the Respondent has failed to discharge that burden. As such, the Respondent\u2019s first admissibility objection\u2014 which is based entirely on the Alleged Illegalities\u2014is dismissed.\n\n**ISSUE 2.4: ARE ANY OF THE CLAIMANTS' CLAIMS INADMISSIBLE DUE TO THE JURISDICTION CLAUSE CONTAINED IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimants\u2019 claims under the BIT\u2019s umbrella clause and other claims based on alleged contractual non-performance are inadmissible.574 The Respondent bases this objection not on the Alleged Illegalities, but instead on the choice of forum clause in Article 11 of the Purchase Agreement.575 According to the Respondent, \"[t]he effect of Article 11 of the Purchase Agreement is quite simply that any other decision-making body is by its terms precluded from resolving 'any dispute' relating to the contract.\"576\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 381 *et seq.*\n\nArticle 11 of the Purchase Agreement reads: \"The Regional Commercial Court in Zagreb will have jurisdiction over any dispute from this Agreement\": Purchase Agreement (C-0047), Art 11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 385.\n\n417.\n\nThe Respondent argues further that \"there is no support for the suggestion that the BIT automatically overrides or re-writes a binding forum selection to determine contractual claims. Where, as here, the essential basis of a claim is breach of contract (i.e. an alleged failure to perform a supposed contractual obligation), the Tribunal must give effect to the valid choice of forum clause in the contract.\"577\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 389 (internal citations omitted).\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimants disagree, arguing that the Respondent\u2019s position is \"based on a gross misconception of the difference between treaty claims and contract claims. Through its misconception, [the] Respondent fabricates a conflict between the dispute resolution clause in the BIT and the contract, where there is none.\"578 The Claimants cite *Vivendi v Argentina*, which states that\n\n*whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law\u2014in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract, by the proper law of the contract* [...].579\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 358\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 359, *citing Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002 (***Vivendi v Argentina*****, Annulment**) (RL-0101), \u00b6 96.\n\n419.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, their umbrella clause claims are treaty claims, because the umbrella clause \"provides an independent substantive protection for the Claimants under international law.\"580\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 361.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. The distinction between treaty claims and contract claims is well established, and it disposes of the Respondent\u2019s second admissibility objection. The Tribunal adopts the analysis of the *SGS v Paraguay* tribunal, which held that a claimant may invoke an umbrella clause when \"the alleged breach of the treaty obligation depends upon a showing that a contract or other qualifying commitment has been breached, [because] the source of the obligation cited by the claimant, and hence the source of the claim, remains the treaty itself.\"581\n\n*SGS v Paraguay* (CL-0083), \u00b6 142. The Tribunal recognises that in *BIVAC v Paraguay*, a parallel arbitration that addressed essentially the same issue, the tribunal held that the umbrella clause claims at issue were inadmissible. *See* *Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B. V. v Republic of Paraguay,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/9, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 May 2009 (RL-0093), \u00b6 159. However, the Tribunal notes that several subsequent tribunals followed the holding in *SGS v Paraguay*, rather than adopt the *BIVAC* tribunal\u2019s approach. *See*, *e.g.*, *Tenaris S.A. and Talta-Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal LDA v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB/11/26, Award, 29 January 2016, fn 239; *Garanti Koza LLP v Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No ARB/11/20, Award, 19 December 2016, \u00b6 245.\n\n421.\n\nIf, in order to assess whether there was a treaty breach, the Tribunal must first determine whether or not the relevant contractual obligations have been observed, then the Tribunal may hear evidence and make that determination. That some of the facts underlying the umbrella clause claim could also be the basis for a separate breach of contract claim\u2014in another forum, on another day\u2014is immaterial. The Claimants\u2019 umbrella clause claim requires a determination of whether the Respondent breached the BIT. Because that inquiry, in turn, requires a determination of whether or not the Respondent observed its contractual obligations, the Tribunal should and will proceed to make that determination.\n\n422.\n\nWhile a contractual forum selection clause may refer contract disputes to another forum that will decide whether a breach of contract occurred, with the consequences that may follow under the applicable law, this Tribunal must decide whether or not contractual obligations have been observed and, as a consequence, whether or not there has been a violation of the umbrella clause. The Tribunal would not fulfil its mandate if it refused to do so.\n\n423.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s second admissibility objection. Given that the Tribunal has rejected both admissibility objections and determined that jurisdiction exists to hear this dispute, the Tribunal will proceed to assess the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n**VIII. ISSUE 3: APPLICABLE LAW**\n---------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nBefore turning to the merits, the Tribunal will address three questions regarding applicable law: (Issue 3.1) having regard to Article 42 of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, what is the law applicable to the issues in dispute?; (Issue 3.2) in particular, what law determines the Claimants\u2019 alleged property rights?; and (Issue 3.3) should the Tribunal apply one law to the whole of the dispute or does the applicable law vary on an issue by issue basis?\n\n**ISSUE 3.1: HAVING REGARD TO ARTICLE 42 OF THE ICSID CONVENTION AND THE BIT, WHAT IS THE LAW APPLICABLE TO THE ISSUES IN DISPUTE?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n425.\n\nThe Parties agree that Article 42 of the ICSID Convention requires the Tribunal to consider both Croatian law and international law. According to the Claimants:\n\n[T]*he wording of Article 42(1) requires the Tribunal to take account of both \"the law of the Contracting State\" and \"rules of international law.\" The usage of the conjugation \"and\" indicates that a dispute has to be resolved through considerations of both systems of law*.582\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 384.\n\n426.\n\nThe Respondent concurs, noting:\n\n*It is uncontroversial that international law, including the ICSID Convention and the BIT, governs the questions* [of] *whether the Respondent has waived its sovereign immunity from jurisdiction and whether adjudicative power has been conferred on the Tribunal, being an international ad hoc tribunal.*\n\n*The Tribunal must further refer to domestic law where its constitutive instruments require* [ *.* ].583\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 390-391 (emphasis added).\n\n427.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties. Article 42 of the ICSID Convention is clear: the Tribunal must consider both international and Croatian law in its analysis.\n\n**ISSUE 3.2: IN PARTICULAR, WHAT LAW DETERMINES THE CLAIMANTS' ALLEGED PROPERTY RIGHTS?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal must assess their alleged property rights under both Croatian and international law.584 More specifically, the Claimants state that \"[w]hile the existence of property rights under Croatian law, is in the first instance a question of Croatian law, international law makes clear that a state cannot rely on domestic laws to avoid its international obligations.\"585 The Claimants go on to specify how international law might apply to the question of property rights:\n\n[T]*o the degree that an application of Croatian law would result in the direct or indirect taking of a property right without due process or compensation; would be discriminatory; would result in an unfair or inequitable treatment of a foreign investor; or would give rise to the breach of a contractual obligation of* [the] *Respondent; such law does not shield* [the] *Respondent from liability*.586\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 387.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 387.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 388.\n\n429.\n\nIn other words, the Claimants argue that the Respondent cannot use domestic laws regarding property ownership to justify breaches of its international obligations.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nThe Respondent counters that Croatian law alone should determine the existence or non-existence of the Claimants\u2019 property rights. According to the Respondent:\n\n*Croatian law determines the existence and extent, if any, of the Claimants\u2019 vested interests in Croatia. It is clear that, given the lack of international rights in rem, Croatian law as the lex situs governs the purported ownership of the property that is the subject of this dispute*.587\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 393.\n\n431.\n\nThe Respondent argues further that international law does not impact the property rights analysis, because \"[i]nternational law protects private property, but it does not create private property.\"588\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 394.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n432.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that it does not seem to be in dispute between the Parties that Croatian law\u2014at least in the first instance\u2014determines whether the Claimants acquired and enjoyed property rights in Croatia.589 The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that Croatian law controls the establishment of property rights in Croatia. The analysis does not end there, however. If the Tribunal recognises property rights (established pursuant to national law), then the analysis shifts to whether the Respondent adequately protected those property rights. The Tribunal must analyse that question, which goes to the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claims, under international law.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 387: \"While the existence of property rights under Croatian law, is in the first instance a question of Croatian law Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 393.\n\n**ISSUE 3.3: SHOULD THE TRIBUNAL APPLY ONE LAW TO THE WHOLE OF THE DISPUTE OR DOES THE APPLICABLE LAW VARY ON AN ISSUE BY ISSUE BASIS?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n433.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Tribunal must address each issue in dispute through the lens of both Croatian law and international law. The Claimants clarify, however, that the \"primary\" law applicable to any particular issue will vary.590 For example, the Claimants note that they\n\n*are seeking damages for violations of specific guarantees provided under the BIT, such as the fair and equitable treatment standard. For such standards, domestic law has a very limited role to play because by their very nature, the standards involve a critical examination of state action. Therefore, for such standards, international law would be the primary applicable law*.591\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 394.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 395.\n\n434.\n\nIn short, the Claimants argue that both domestic and international law *always* apply, but that the dominant source of law changes from issue to issue.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n435.\n\nThe Respondent takes a slightly different view. According to the Respondent, some of the issues in dispute concern Croatian law *or* international law\u2014not both. For instance, the Respondent asserts that \"Croatian law determines the existence and extent, if any, of the Claimants\u2019 vested interests in Croatia.\"592 Then, if the Claimants can establish a vested property interest under Croatian law, \"[i]nternational law then determines if the Respondent\u2019s treatment of the Claimants with respect to any vested rights was a violation of the Respondent\u2019s international obligations under the BIT.\"593\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 393.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 394.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nAlthough their arguments diverge somewhat, the Parties agree on the key point: the principal source of law will vary from issue to issue. The Tribunal concurs. The Tribunal notes the flexible approach to the choice of law applied in *Quiborax v Bolivia*, where the tribunal held that it would\n\n*apply* [domestic] *law and international law when appropriate. The Tribunal is of the view that the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allocate matters to either law. It is thus for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law*.594\n\n*Quiborax S.A. and Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/2, Award, 16 September 2015, \u00b6 91.\n\n437.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore identify and apply the proper source of law on an issue-byissue basis. The Tribunal notes that if a conflict arises between international and domestic law, international law will take precedence.\n\n**IX. ISSUE 4: MERITS - GENERAL MATTERS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n438.\n\nPrior to turning to the specific claims by the Claimants in this arbitration, there are several issues which require determination, as they have implications to multiple bases on which the Claimants put their claims. The Tribunal addresses these issues below.\n\n**ISSUE 4.1: IS THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT UNENFORCEABLE BY REASON OF ONE, OR MORE, OF THE ALLEGED ILLEGALITIES?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s findings in relation to the Alleged Illegalities as set out in Issue 2 *supra*, the Tribunal finds that the Purchase Agreement is not unenforceable by reason of one, or more, of the Alleged Illegalities.\n\n**(1) The Purchase Agreement, Record and Asset List**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nBy their submissions, the Parties have proposed differing interpretations of the Purchase Agreement and its legal effect. In summary, the two competing interpretations are:\n\n(a) On the part of the Claimants that:\n\n(i) the subject matter of the Purchase Agreement consisted not only of the Five Companies, but also specific property;595 and\n\n(ii) the Purchase Agreement contained an implied obligation on the part of the seller to cooperate with the buyer in facilitating the registration of property.596\n\n(b) On the part of the Respondent that the Purchase Agreement simply entitled the First Claimant to the Five Companies, and registration thereof.597\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 951.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 968.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 555.\n\n441.\n\nGiven the fundamental difference between these interpretations, the Tribunal sets out its findings in relation to the interpretation of the Purchase Agreement as a preliminary point below.\n\n442.\n\nThe counterparties to the Purchase Agreement are specified as the Five Companies, represented by Mr Boras in bankruptcy, and the First Claimant. For the reasons set out in Issue 4.8 *infra*, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent was not a party to the Purchase Agreement. As stated by Judge Andrija Erakovic, quoting the work of Prof Dr Jaksa Barbie, the sellers in bankruptcy of socially-owned enterprises, as the Five Companies were, are the enterprises themselves.598 The only parties to the Purchase Agreement were the Five Companies on the one hand, and the First Claimant on the other.\n\nTr Day 6, 1189:8-11.\n\n443.\n\nThe Purchase Agreement contains the following relevant provisions:599\n\n(a) Article 2: \"The Subject matter of this Agreement is the purchase of the companies Gavrilovi\u0107 in bankruptcy\" followed by a list of the Five Companies.\n\n(b) Article 3: \"The Buyer purchases all companies from Article 2 of this Agreement as legal entities together with the entire assets which belong to these companies as legal entities.\"\n\n(c) Article 4 sets out the price payable for each of the Five Companies, including an amount \"for the real estate.\"\n\n(d) Article 6: \"The Buyer will take over the companies from Article 2 of this Agreement after the conclusion of the Agreement when it will be objectively possible considering the existing circumstances, and the contractual parties will make a separate record on that.\"\n\n(e) Article 7: \"Pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer acquires all founding rights to which he is entitled as the owner of the purchased companies, and the Seller authorizes him to register in the court register of the Regional Commercial Court in Zagreb as the founder (owner).\"\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047).\n\n444.\n\nIt is clear from the plain wording of the Purchase Agreement that the intent of the Purchase Agreement was to convey ownership of the Five Companies as legal entities, and not to convey any particular assets to the First Claimant.\n\n445.\n\nArticle 2 makes clear that the subject matter of the Purchase Agreement is the Five Companies. The reference in Article 3 to \"the entire assets which belong to these companies as legal entities\" does not affect this conclusion, as it is self-evident that when a company is purchased, its assets remain with that company.\n\n446.\n\nFurther, the allocation of a price payable for \"*real estate*\" in Article 4 also has no effect. Given the First Claimant purchased the Five Companies in their entirety, and that the Five Companies were not in a position to sell anything that they did not own, an allocation of an amount for \"*real estate*\" cannot be seen as creating an independent obligation.\n\n447.\n\nApproximately three months after the signing of the Purchase Agreement, on 11 February 1992, a further document was created, namely, the Minutes. The Minutes record a meeting attended by the First Claimant, the Liquidator and the Bankruptcy Judge. The Minutes relevantly set out the following:\n\n*The subject of today\u2019s meeting is the handing over of the company \"Gavrilovi\u0107 \" under bankruptcy pursuant to Article 6 of the* [Purchase Agreement].\n\n*It is hereby established that the handing over of* [the Five Companies] *is not possible in its entirety. Therefore, pursuant to Article 6 of the sales contract, the representative of the bankruptcy debtors- receiver and the purchaser* [the First Claimant] *draft these minutes and establish the following facts and circumstances:*\n\n[...]\n\n*The contracting parties stipulate that the determined sales price of the companies under bankruptcy will not be changed, provided that the following actions are taken:*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*2. that a list of company assets is established, which will serve as basis for further autonomous activities of the buyer aimed at taking over the company and the company\u2019s assets - when the circumstances so allow;*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The buyer* [the First Claimant] *, hereby declares that he shall take upon himself the risk of the further taking over of the assets which are the matter of the sales contract, and which are owned by the sold companies* [\u2026] *and he agrees that the seller in this manner meets his obligations from the* [Purchase Agreement].600\n\nMinutes (R-0028).\n\n448.\n\nFollowing the Minutes, the Liquidator delivered the Record. The Record relevantly provides:\n\n*Composed on 05/03/1992 as the confirmation of the delivery of the possession and ownership over the part of the property which* [the First Claimant] *bought from* [the Five Companies] *pursuant to the Purchase Agreement* [\u2026] *Slavo Boras, PhD, as the Liquidator and representative of the Seller confirms with this Record that he delivered to* [the First Claimant] *the possession and ownership over the following objects and rights:* [\u2026].601\n\nRecord (C-0049), p 1.\n\n449.\n\nThe Record then goes on to describe various putative assets of the Five Companies.\n\n450.\n\nAccompanying the Record was the Asset List, the Asset List being five documents dated 30 June 1991, which purport to set out various assets of five of the Six Socialist Companies. The Asset List relates to R.J. Foreign Trade (assumed by the Tribunal to be a reference to Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade spo), Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce (assumed by the Tribunal to be a reference to Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce spo), Company Agriculture (assumed by the Tribunal to be a reference to Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture spo), Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry (assumed by the Tribunal to be a reference to Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo), and \"Transport\" (it is unclear which of the Six Socialist Companies these assets relate to). On each of these lists comprising the Asset List, the Liquidator has signed the document, and affixed the stamp of one the Five Companies.\n\n451.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Record as set out above has contractual force. According to the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s failure to make efforts to transfer the property enumerated in the Record constituted a contractual breach.602 The Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 argument, stating that the Record contains no contractual rights, and does nothing other than record a state of affairs.603\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 946-949.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 187.\n\n452.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Record, and for the avoidance of doubt the Minutes and the Asset List, do not alter the contractual obligations of the Purchase Agreement as set out above. While the Minutes, the Record and the Asset List may constitute a representation, a matter which is discussed below in relation to FET, they contain no contractual obligations which are independent of the Purchase Agreement. The Record represents an attempt by the Liquidator to set out the assets of the Five Companies. If such an attempt is found to be factually incorrect, it cannot transmute that attempt into a contractual requirement to deliver those particular assets.\n\n453.\n\nThe Purchase Agreement, the Minutes and the Record make Mr Boras\u2019 role in executing the contract clear. He is the Liquidator and the representative of the Five Companies. Leaving aside technical arguments as to attribution, which are addressed below, a reading of the Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, Minutes, Record and Asset List, does not convey the meaning that what was agreed was a sale of the Five Companies, and an enumerated list of assets. What was clearly agreed was a sale of the Five Companies, which would necessarily include their assets; a record of those assets, according to Mr Boras, was provided. The Claimants have not addressed the Tribunal on any Croatian-specific aspects of contractual theory which would disrupt that interpretation.\n\n454.\n\nIf the Record is inaccurate, that may give rise to some form of relief against the Liquidator under Croatian law (a claim against the Five Companies would be impossible given that upon their selling themselves to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. they were promptly merged into Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.). The Tribunal has heard no submissions on that point, and would be unable to rule on it in any event given its functions are limited to questions of treaty violations. However, the Tribunal does decide that as a matter of contractual interpretation, the subject matter was limited to a purchase of the Five Companies.\n\n455.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the above is in accord with the Claimants\u2019 own expert Dr Hano Ernst\u2019s understanding of the contract. As stated by Dr Ernst:\n\n*The investment by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was in the purchase of the bankrupt companies, not their assets. This, of course, does not mean the companies had no assets, but simply that the purchase agreement did not purport to transfer any assets owned by the companies to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, because the assets remained the assets of the purchased companies.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*A bankruptcy sale of a debtor is a sale of a company, i.e., a sale of shareholder rights, and not the sale of real property* [\u2026].604\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6\u00b6 147-148.\n\n456.\n\nThis also appears to correlate with the First Claimant\u2019s understanding of the Purchase Agreement, given his statement that: \"I understood that, according to the Purchase Agreement, I was purchasing the [Five Companies] as a whole, including all of their assets.\"605\n\nGavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 30.\n\n457.\n\nIn relation to the Claimants\u2019 contended implied obligation to cooperate in facilitating the registration of property, such an implied obligation simply has no content given the parties to the Purchase Agreement. While the Five Companies may have had such an obligation had they sold their assets to the First Claimant, in circumstances where the First Claimant acquired his contractual counterparties, as occurred here, any ongoing obligations would become his. This would be an absurd result.\n\n**ISSUE 4.2: DO THE CLAIMANTS HAVE A PROPERTY INTEREST IN THE CLAIMED PROPERTIES AS A MATTER OF CROATIAN LAW?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n458.\n\nCentral to the Claimants\u2019 claim in this arbitration is that the Purchase Agreement either did, or should have, conferred ownership over certain land, buildings or part thereof, and apartments, as identified by the Claimants in List 1 (in the case of land, buildings or part thereof, being the Properties) and List 2 (in the case of the Apartments).\n\n459.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal must determine what, if any, property the Second Claimant has an interest in, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, as determined by reference to Croatian law.\n\n460.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent has argued that the Tribunal is not in a position to determine this issue. The Respondent has contended that a Croatian court is the competent body to do so, as a Croatian court would have the entirety of the evidence before it, would be equipped to determine the issue in accordance with Croatian law, and could also account for any potential impact of the claims upon third parties.606\n\nTr Day 10, 2407:1-12.\n\n461.\n\nWhile it is clear that the Tribunal cannot determine title to property in a manner that is binding on Croatian courts or relevant third parties, the Tribunal is tasked with determining the Claimants\u2019 claims. In relation to the Claimants\u2019 claim for expropriation, a required component of that claim is that the Claimants establish that they were the holder of a right or property that is claimed to have been expropriated. This is common to all cases of this type. In such circumstances, the Tribunal must determine, on the basis of the evidence and submissions before it, whether such ownership existed.\n\n462.\n\nThe starting point for such a determination is the Purchase Agreement itself. By the Purchase Agreement, the First Claimant acquired the Five Companies. The true dispute between the Parties lies in determining what, if any, assets the Five Companies owned at the time of that acquisition.\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Case on Ownership**\n----------------------------------------\n\n463.\n\nAs set out above in the factual background to this dispute, the various entities trading under the Gavrilovi\u0107 banner have undergone significant changes to both structure, having regard to their underlying ownership philosophies, and the applicable legal systems under which they have operated.\n\n464.\n\nFor the purposes of this Award, it is not necessary to set out the full detail of these changes, however, the relevant changes in structure can be summarised as below:\n\n(a) Until the late 1970s, various structures, both State-owned, and later socially-owned607 operated the Gavrilovi\u0107 business.\n\n(b) In the late 1970s, the Gavrilovi\u0107 business was reorganised as a socially-owned unit referred to as a \"complex organisation of associated work\", or SOUR. Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR was the resulting entity, which was further divided in subsidiary type entities known as \"workers\u2019 organisations\", two of which were further divided into \"basic organisations of associated labour\", or OOURs.608\n\n(c) In 1989, Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR was transformed into a socially-owned holding company, and five socially-owned subsidiary companies, together the Six Socialist Companies. These entities were:\n\n(i) Complex Company Gavrilovi\u0107 Petrinja, as the holding company;\n\n(ii) Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo;609\n\n(iii) Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture spo;610\n\n(iv) Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce spo;\n\n(v) Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade spo; and\n\n(vi) Gavrilovi\u0107 Small Economy spo611\n\n(collectively, the Six Socialist Companies).\n\n(d) On 15 April 1991, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Six Socialist Companies merged into a single socially owned company, Food Industry. This entity later changed its name to Holding d.o.o pursuant to the Resolution.\n\n(e) By the Resolution, Holding d.o.o resolved to form nine subsidiary companies, being:\n\n(i) Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry;\n\n(ii) Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture;\n\n(iii) Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce;\n\n(iv) Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport; and\n\n(v) Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade;\n\n(collectively, the Five Companies);\n\n(vi) Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging;\n\n(vii) Gavrilovi\u0107 Motel Biograd;\n\n(viii) Gavrilovi\u0107 Shoe Factory; and (ix) Gavrilovi\u0107 Small Economy\n\n(collectively, with the Five Companies, the Nine Companies).\n\n(f) The Five Companies were purchased by the First Claimant in bankruptcy through the Purchase Agreement. Subsequent to that purchase, the Five Companies were merged to form the Second Claimant.\n\n(g) Holding d.o.o. was placed into bankruptcy.\n\n(h) Gavrilovi\u0107 Shoe Factory was placed into bankruptcy.\n\n(i) Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging was placed into bankruptcy.\n\n(j) Gavrilovi\u0107 Motel Biograd appears to have continued to trade.\n\n(k) Gavrilovi\u0107 Small Economy appears to have continued to trade.\n\nSocial ownership being a form of ownership where society as a whole, rather than the State, owned real property, as well as the means of production and its results. *See* United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT), *Housing and Property Rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro*, Status Report No 12 dated 3 July 2003 (C-0004), pp 17-18.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 26.\n\nTranslated as \"Company for production and processing of meat and meat products Meat Industry Gavrilovi\u0107.\"\n\nTranslated as \"Company for agricultural production Agriculture Gavrilovi\u0107.\"\n\nTranslated as \"Company for production and trade of leather, leather goods, plastic, clay products, eyeglasses, objects of home artisanship and secondary materials, Small economy Gavrilovi\u0107.\"\n\n465.\n\nApart from the Respondent\u2019s allegations regarding the Alleged Illegalities, the above summary is not in dispute between the Parties; however, the legal effects of the above events are in dispute.\n\n466.\n\nThe catalyst for the transition from the Six Socialist Companies, through to the Nine Companies, was a fundamental change in both the philosophy and legal framework of ownership in the former Yugoslavia.\n\n467.\n\nPrior to 1991, the ownership of enterprises such as the Six Socialist Companies, and their real assets, was said to be in social ownership. Social ownership was a peculiar Yugoslavian form of ownership whereby these assets were not owned by any particular individual, or by the State, but were instead owned by society as a whole.612\n\nBoric Report, \u00b6 12; Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 20; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 27.\n\n468.\n\nFrom 1991 onwards, there was a transition away from social ownership, toward private ownership whereby entities and assets would be owned by the State or private individuals. This transition, it is evident, was complex and generated difficult legal questions. The long-standing disputes between the Claimants, Holding d.o.o., and Croatia itself exemplifies the point.\n\n469.\n\nThe process of transition started for the Six Socialist Companies by the Survey.613 This was a document prepared by the Director of Legal Affairs of the Complex Company Gavrilovi\u0107 Petrinja, Mr Drljaca Vlado.\n\nSurvey (C-0013).\n\n470.\n\nThe Survey envisaged two steps: the consolidation of the Six Socialist Companies into Holding d.o.o., as achieved by the Merger Agreement referred to above, and the subsequent re-division of Holding d.o.o., as was the subject of the Resolution.\n\n471.\n\nThe Claimants contend that by the operation of the Resolution, Holding d.o.o.\u2019s assets were divided as between the Nine Companies, with Five Companies receiving the bulk thereof, which have now become the property of the Second Claimant due to the merger of the Five Companies.\n\n472.\n\nThrough the work of the Claimants\u2019 witness, Mr Ilija Barisic, the Claimants have purported to identify the real estate assets of the Five Companies. Mr Barisic is a geodetic engineer. His work forms the basis of Annex II to the Claimants\u2019 Reply wherein the Claimants list the Properties to which they say they are entitled. The Claimants have further claimed the Apartments, which were accommodation formerly occupied by employees of the Six Socialist Companies.\n\n473.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the Claimants\u2019 case on the following bases:\n\n(a) that there was no transmission of property from Holding d.o.o. through the operation of the Resolution;614 and\n\n(b) that even if there was a transmission of property from Holding d.o.o. through the Resolution:\n\n(i) the vast majority of the Properties claimed by the Claimants were not owned by Holding d.o.o. at the time of the Resolution, either through operation of law, or as a matter of fact;615 and\n\n(ii) the Apartments were never transferred to the Five Companies, and would have remained the property of Holding d.o.o.616\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 458 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 421 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 536 *et seq*.\n\n474.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed in their evidentiary burden in identifying:\n\n(a) how the assets of Holding d.o.o. were divided amongst the Nine Companies; and\n\n(b) what the assets of Holding d.o.o. in fact were at the relevant time.617\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 505. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent has articulated a third category, relating to whether the asset was available to be transferred at the relevant time, or whether it was public property, or previously transferred *ex lege* to the State. The Tribunal considers this to be a sub-category of the question as to what the assets of Holding d.o.o. were at the relevant time.\n\n475.\n\nUnder Croatian Law, the question of registration of land is not dealt with on the basis of functionally independent properties, but is instead dealt with on the basis of units of land known as plots.618 A single property can consist of multiple plots. A single plot can have multiple owners.\n\nRespondents PHB, \u00b6 405, including the reference to the evidence of Mr Ilija Barisic at fn 348.\n\n476.\n\nWhile Annex II to the Claimants\u2019 Reply lists 78 Properties as being claimed by the Claimants, these Properties in fact consist of 3,247 plots.\n\n477.\n\nPursuant to PO 5, the Parties have prepared lists relating to the Properties and Apartments in question. List 1 contains a list of the plots constituting the Properties subject to the Claimants\u2019 claim, while List 2 contains the Apartments.\n\n478.\n\nAttached at Annexure 1 to this Award is a list of the Properties which form the subject matter of the Claimants\u2019 claim. Annexure 1 does not contain a list of the Apartments. The list has been compiled by reference to List 1 as provided by the Parties in accordance with PO 5.\n\n**(2) Universal Succession**\n----------------------------\n\n479.\n\nThe first key dispute between the Parties in relation to the Claimants\u2019 claim as to title over the Properties and Apartments revolves around the concept of universal succession.\n\n480.\n\nA universal succession involves the mass transfer of assets *en bloc* from one entity to another by operation of law, rather than through an itemised list of assets to be transferred.\n\n481.\n\nThis issue is key to any examination of the Claimants\u2019 proprietary rights. As stated by the Claimants, if it is found that there was no universal succession, the only possible result is that none of the Nine Companies ever had any assets.619 Such a result would inevitably lead to the conclusion that the Claimants had no property rights in relation to the Properties or the Apartments.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 459.\n\n482.\n\nProf Dr Tomislav Boric, the Claimants\u2019 expert, and Prof Petar Klaric and Judge Lilijana Matusko, the Respondent\u2019s experts on this issue, agree that by operation of the Merger Agreement, Holding d.o.o became the universal successor of the Six Socialist Companies.620 The practical effect of this universal succession is that Holding d.o.o. obtained all of the rights of the Six Socialist Companies.\n\nKlaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6 11; Boric Report, \u00b6 42. This agreement is subject to differing views as to the requirement for registration.\n\n483.\n\nIn fact, the only alleged universal succession which is in dispute as between the Parties is the alleged universal succession between Holding d.o.o. and the Nine Companies.\n\n484.\n\nThe key event which is central to this aspect of the dispute is the passing by Holding d.o.o of the Resolution on 23 April 1991. The intended effect of the Resolution was as set out in that document:\n\n[Holding d.o.o.] [\u2026] *is hereby organised* [\u2026] *as socially-owned* [Holding d.o.o.] *by division of a part of its assets among several companies.*\n\n[...]\n\n*The process of organising* [Holding d.o.o.] *by division of a part of its assets will be carried out by organizing as companies the existing parts of the Company performing certain activities, as follows:* [\u2026].621\n\nResolution (C-0015), Art 1.\n\n485.\n\nThe Resolution goes on to refer to each of the Nine Companies, and the activities that each of the Nine Companies will undertake.\n\n486.\n\nThe Resolution contains the following salient provisions:\n\n(a) Article 8 states that \"[b]y way of dividing its assets, the Company provides the principal, assets for founding and work of the companies which are being founded.\"\n\n(b) Articles 9 to 17 follow the same pattern, with each Article stating that \"[f]or the purpose of founding and functioning of\" each of the Nine Companies, Food Industry provides \"objects, means of production and other means of work.\" Articles 9 to 17 then go on to specify the value of those objects, means of production and other means of work in relation to each of the Nine Companies. Finally, Articles 9 to 17 state that:\n\n*The integral part of this Resolution is the list of objects and means of production according to the final statement of accounts from 31/12/1990, established on the basis of their book value. The final division of the assets which will be allocated to* [each of the Nine Companies] *will be determined pursuant to the final statement of accounts*.\n\n(c) Article 18 states:\n\n[Holding d.o.o.] *performing division of its assets among several companies as the socially-owned* [Holding d.o.o.] s *hall confer to all companies which it founded the right of use, managing and disposing with assets used for their founding, pursuant to this Resolution and the Law.*\n\n[Holding d.o.o.'s] *socially-owned limited liability companies which are founded are responsible for the obligations of the part of the socially-owned enterprise - company from which they were formed. The actual obligations of each founded company will be established upon the final settlement of accounts after completing the balance sheet*.\n\n(d) Following the operative provisions of the Resolution, a summary of the value of the intended assets for each of the Nine Companies is provided (**Value Summary**).\n\n487.\n\nSubsequent to the Resolution, on 26 April 1991, each of the Five Companies was incorporated in the District Commercial Court Zagreb.622 Each of the Court\u2019s decisions:\n\n(a) refer to Holding d.o.o. as the founder of the respective Nine Companies;\n\n(b) refer to the Resolution as the Articles of Association;\n\n(c) give an amount of \"founder\u2019s capital\" corresponding to the amount set out in the Value Summary, stated as being \"in things\"; and\n\n(d) set out the activities of the new company.623\n\nIt is assumed by the Tribunal that the other four of the Nine Companies were likewise incorporated. This can be inferred from the incorporation of the Five Companies.\n\n*See* Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0016); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0017); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0018); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0019); and Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0020).\n\n488.\n\nAt a general meeting of Holding d.o.o. held on 2 July 1991, it was resolved that a task group be formed to compile a division balance sheet as between the Nine Companies (**Division Balance Sheet**).624 The Division Balance Sheet is referable to the \"list of objects and means of production according to the final statement of accounts\" as referred to in Articles 9 to 17 of the Resolution.\n\nDivision Balance Sheet (C-0021).\n\n489.\n\nIt is undisputed as between the Parties that the compilation of the Division Balance Sheet never occurred.\n\n490.\n\nThe Resolution provides that it was adopted pursuant to Article 145(b) of the Enterprises Act625 which states:\n\n*An enterprise may, by the division of part of its assets into two enterprises or several enterprises, by acquiring capital in another enterprise or investing its capital in a new enterprise, also perform the work of founding, financing and managing (a holding enterprise).*\n\n*An enterprise may without payment transfer its capital or part of its capital to another enterprise without the right to manage those enterprises.*\n\n*If an enterprise divides part of its assets between two new enterprises or several new enterprises, which it founds, it is obliged to provide shares in the newly founded enterprises for the invested assets, on the basis of which it participates in the management of those enterprises.*\n\n*If an enterprise invests its own capital in new enterprises, it shall manage those enterprises on the basis of possession of capital* [\u2026].626\n\nResolution (C-0015), p 1.\n\nEnterprises Act (CL-0008 / RL-0168), Art 145(b).\n\n491.\n\nThe reference to Article 145(b) is in contrast to the Merger Agreement, which provides that it was entered into pursuant to Article 187(a) of the Enterprises Act which states:\n\n*A decision on a change in the status of an enterprise (division, merger or take-over) shall be rendered by the management body.*\n\n*Enterprises created by division or merger with or to other enterprises shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the enterprises which have ceased to exist.*\n\n*The mutual relationships of the enterprises formed by the status changes shall be regulated by an agreement*.627\n\nEnterprises Act (CL-0008 / RL-0168), Art 187(a).\n\n**(3)The Experts**\n------------------\n\n492.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 case on this point is supported by the opinion of Prof Dr Boric, while the Respondent is supported by the opinion of Prof Klaric and Judge Matusko.\n\n493.\n\nBoth experts agree that where an enterprise changes status in accordance with Article 187(a) of the Enterprises Act, a universal succession occurs.628 Where the experts diverge is in their interpretation of Article 145(b).\n\nSecond Klaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6 10; Boric Report, \u00b6 20.\n\n494.\n\nProf Dr Boric advocates for a \"functional unity\" between Articles 145(b) and 187(a). He opines that the common usage of the term \"division\" in Articles 145(b) and 187(a) indicates a commonality of function between the two provisions, with Article 187(a) regulating the area generally, and Article 145(b) being a more specific provision.\n\n495.\n\nProf Dr Boric recognises that Article 187(a) refers, in the case of division, to the initial enterprise having \"ceased to exist.\" Prof Dr Boric states that rather than this being fatal to applying Article 187(a) to the case here, being one when the holding company, Holding d.o.o. continued to exist, that Article 187(a) must be interpreted in a teleological rather than grammatical manner.629\n\nBoric Report, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n496.\n\nProf Dr Boric opines that such an interpretation is in keeping with modern comparative law, including that of Croatia.630\n\nBoric Report, \u00b6 28.\n\n497.\n\nProf Klaric and Judge Matusko disagree with Prof Dr Boric\u2019s opinion. Prof Klaric and Judge Matusko opine that there is a difference between a status change of an enterprise, where a merger, division or transfer of assets results in an entity ceasing to exist; and the conversion of an enterprise, such as a conversion into a holding company. According to Prof Klaric and Judge Matusko, the two cases are separately accounted for in Croatian Law.631\n\nSecond Klaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.\n\n498.\n\nFurther, Prof Klaric and Judge Matusko advocate for a literal interpretation of Articles 145(b) and 187(a), which would leave no room for an application of Article 187(a) in the case where the enterprise dividing its assets does not cease to exist.632\n\nSecond Klaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6 21.\n\n**(4) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n499.\n\nIn addition to relying on the opinion of Prof Dr Boric, the Claimants further, relevantly, contend that:\n\n(a) Given the extremely short time frame for the corporate change envisaged in the Survey, 30 days, universal succession was the only way to achieve that change.633\n\n(b) Universal succession must have occurred, given that the Nine Companies were registered with the Court with nominal capital in \"things.\" On the Claimants\u2019 case, none of the Nine Companies would have had such \"things\" if no transmission of property had occurred.634\n\n(c) The Nine Companies operated with the assets in question following their formation, and such operation was done without any leases being entered into between Holding d.o.o. and the Nine Companies. On the Claimants\u2019 case, this evinces an intention on the part of those parties that the assets be conveyed.635\n\n(d) Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o has \"inexplicably\" been allowed to occupy multiple properties, something that would not have been allowed if it did not have title.636\n\n(e) The State, throughout the bankruptcy and in subsequent court proceedings, represented that property had passed to the Nine Companies, and operated on that assumption.637\n\n(f) Universal succession must have occurred given the fate of the various Nine Companies, with Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging selling its assets in bankruptcy, including real property, and Gavrilovi\u0107 Shoe Factory selling its factory in bankruptcy. Further, Holding d.o.o. was placed into bankruptcy with no assets. On the Claimants\u2019 case, such events run entirely counter to a situation whereby assets remained with Holding d.o.o, and the Nine Companies were transferred nothing.638\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 464-465.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 470.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 475.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 460.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 478-488.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 492-497.\n\n500.\n\nThe Claimants made further submissions relating to the *bona fides* of the Respondent in raising the issue of universal succession, which in the Tribunal\u2019s view are irrelevant. The Respondent\u2019s motivations in raising the issue of universal succession does not affect their case at law, which is the only relevant issue.\n\n501.\n\nBefore turning to the Respondent\u2019s arguments, the Tribunal makes the following observations and findings.\n\n502.\n\nThe intentions of Holding d.o.o. in this matter, as shown in the Survey and Resolution, are in the Tribunal\u2019s view irrelevant. Holding d.o.o. was not in a position, by the passing of the Resolution, to affect the operation of Article 145(b).\n\n503.\n\nLikewise, the alleged acceptance of the passing of assets by universal succession, by the Respondent, not including the Respondent\u2019s courts, is equally irrelevant. Short of retrospective legislative change, the Respondent was likewise not in a position to alter the operation of Article 145(b).\n\n504.\n\nThe only true question before the Tribunal on this issue is whether, as a matter of law, the creation of a holding company and subsidiaries, in accordance with Article 145(b), involves a universal succession of assets or not. The Tribunal was greatly assisted by the Parties\u2019 respective experts on this issue.\n\n**(5) The Respondent\u2019s Argument**\n---------------------------------\n\n505.\n\nPrior to turning to the Respondent\u2019s case on this issue, it is helpful to specify what kind of right the Respondent contends the Nine Companies did have following the passing of the Resolution.\n\n506.\n\nThe Respondent states that rather than the Nine Companies having title to specific assets of Holding d.o.o. they instead had some form of right over a \"pool of assets which was unsorted.\"639\n\nTr Day 2, 291:3-9.\n\n507.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Five Companies did have some form of rights to the assets of Holding d.o.o., however, the only way to vindicate those rights was by agreement between the parties involved, or alternatively through Court action.640\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 521.\n\n508.\n\nIn addition to relying on the opinion of Prof Klaric and Judge Matusko, the Respondent further, relevantly, contends that:\n\n(a) There is no reason to attempt to interpret Articles 145(b) and 187(a) in the manner contended for by the Claimants, as the meaning is clear. Article 187(a) simply has no application to the case at hand.641\n\n(b) A precondition for universal succession is joint and several liability. In this case, Article 18 of the Resolution explicitly states that the Nine Companies were to be \"responsible for the obligations of the part of the socially-owned enterprise-company from which they were formed.\"642\n\n(c) The factual circumstances referred to by the Claimants, even if correct, cannot overcome the operation of Croatian law.643\n\n(d) Operating and possessing property does not equate to title.644\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 478.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 475, 484, *citing* Resolution (C-0015), Art 18 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 147.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 148, 151.\n\n**(6) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n509.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s finding, there is a grave conceptual difficulty with the Respondent\u2019s arguments.\n\n510.\n\nParties to a failed attempted universal succession are clearly free to subsequently decide between themselves through a settlement procedure which assets should pass to whom. However, in the case of subsequent Court proceedings, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants\u2019 proposition that a Court in this case would not be creating a property right, but merely on the basis of evidence determining who in fact held that right.\n\n511.\n\nIf there was no universal succession, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants\u2019 proposition that, given there was clearly no singular succession, no assets would have passed from Holding d.o.o. to the Nine Companies. However, this clearly did not occur, with the First Claimant being able to register its ownership over certain properties, including its factory through the Croatian Courts, which the Respondent described as \"his\" and saying that there \"is no question about it.\"645 Further, Mr Davor Impri\u0107, as discussed below, was able to acquire property from Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging, one of the Nine Companies, and Gavrilovi\u0107 Shoe Factory was able to sell its factory. All of the above clearly point to a conveyance of property from Holding d.o.o to the Nine Companies.\n\nTr Day 2, 293:4-5\n\n512.\n\nWhile it may be necessary to initiate court proceedings to *vindicate* a legal right, the Tribunal finds that it is not the case that the court proceeding would *create* that right. As highlighted by the Respondent, if this issue was being determined domestically in Croatia, a Croatian Court would apply the criteria of:\n\n(a) determining for each land plot whether Holding d.o.o had title to it; and\n\n(b) determining, on the basis of the land plot\u2019s economic use, which company should now have title to it, based solely on the criteria of the Resolution.646\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 511.\n\n513.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the criteria as set out by the Respondent are indeed the correct criteria. However, they are questions of evidence and do not involve the creation of a property right.\n\n514.\n\nFurther, given the fate of the property of Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging, it appears that it is possible to resolve the \"unsorted\" property relationship without engaging in an out-ofcourt settlement between all of the relevant parties, given that Mr Impri\u0107\u2019s property was conveyed by agreement solely between the Respondent and Mr Impri\u0107, without reference to the Nine Companies.647\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 771 and documents referred to therein.\n\n515.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Article 145(b) of the Enterprises Act operates in the manner contended for by Prof Dr Boric and that a universal succession did indeed occur.\n\n516.\n\nThe true dispute between the Parties relates to evidence, which the Tribunal evaluates below.\n\n**(7) Examination of Evidence**\n-------------------------------\n\n517.\n\nAs set out above, the Tribunal finds that there was a universal succession of assets from Holding d.o.o to the Nine Companies; however, this is not the end of the matter. The task of the Tribunal is now to determine, in the light of that universal succession, what property was in fact owned by the Five Companies at the time of the Purchase Agreement.\n\n518.\n\nThis analysis involves three discrete factual enquiries:\n\n(i) What were the relevant assets of Holding d.o.o. at the time of the Resolution?\n\n(ii) Which of the Nine Companies became the universal successor of the particular assets?\n\n(iii) Were any relevant assets transferred to the Respondent by operation of legislation enacted prior to the Purchase Agreement?\n\n519.\n\nA failure by the Claimants in relation to any of the above questions is necessarily fatal to their claim of ownership.\n\n520.\n\nIn the interests of efficiency, the Tribunal has analysed the evidence of a universal succession of the Properties and Apartments as its first question on the assumption that Holding d.o.o. had the requisite rights in relation to the underlying plots at the relevant time. The Tribunal has done so due to the fact that if the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Claimants have established a particular Property or Apartment passed to the Five Companies by virtue of the Resolution, there is no need for the Tribunal to address the Parties\u2019 arguments in relation to the ownership of those Properties and Apartments further.\n\n521.\n\nFor those Properties where the Tribunal is satisfied that the underlying plots would have passed to the Five Companies by operation of the Resolution, the Tribunal then addresses the question as to whether those plots were in fact owned by the Five Companies at the time of the Purchase Agreement, or whether they had been previously transferred *ex lege* to the Respondent through operation of law. Again, this analysis assumes that the Claimants are otherwise able to establish title to the relevant plots. Where the plots have passed *ex lege* to the Respondent prior to the Purchase Agreement, there is no further need for the Tribunal to analyse the evidence presented by the Claimants as to title.\n\n522.\n\nFinally, for the remaining plots, the Tribunal analyses the Claimants\u2019 evidence of title.\n\n**(8) Universal Succession of Specific Properties**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n523.\n\nAs set out above, the Tribunal finds that there was a universal succession of assets from Holding d.o.o to the Nine Companies; however, this is not the end of the matter.\n\n524.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 claims in this arbitration relate to particular pieces of real property, not to fungible assets. In such circumstances there must be a level of specificity as to which of the Nine Companies each Property and Apartment was transferred to.\n\n525.\n\nThe Claimants, throughout their written and oral submissions,648 have consistently argued that the Five Companies represented the bulk of the value in the Nine Companies, and were allocated 90% of the real property of Holding d.o.o. by value; however, this raises a clear question: which 90%?\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 468, 547; *see*, *e.g.*, Claimants\u2019 Opening Presentation dated 7 March 2016 (C-0632), slide 164.\n\n526.\n\nThe Claimants recognise this difficulty. In their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants state that\n\n[\u2026] *all of the assets of Six Socialist Companies were eventually succeeded by the Nine Companies and Holding d.o.o.* [\u2026]\n\n[\u2026] *it is important to determine whether the assets of a particular socialist company (e.g., Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo) corresponded to the assets of one of the Nine Companies bearing a similar or same name (e.g., Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry)*.649\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 550-551.\n\n527.\n\nBy his evidence, Mr Miljenko Rospaher described that the intention behind the restructure of the Gavrilovi\u0107 business was as follows:\n\n*The Nine Companies continued the business of the previous socialist Company in the following way:*\n\n- *Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo\u2019s business continued in its entirety through Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry;*\n\n- [Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture spo's] *business continued in its entirety through* [Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture] *;*\n\n- *Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade spo\u2019s business continued in its entirety through Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade;*\n\n- *Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce spo\u2019s business continued through four LLC comp* anies: *Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce took over the retail business, Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport took over the transport business, Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging took over the accommodation, catering and tourism business, and Gavrilovi\u0107 Motel Biograd took over the management of a hotel in Biograd; and*\n\n- *Gavrilovi\u0107 Small Economy spo\u2019s business continued through two LLC companies: Gavrilovi\u0107 Shoe Factory took over the leather shoes and goods production business, and* [Gavrilovi\u0107 Handcrafts] *took over the home artisanship business.*\n\n*The assets of* [Holding d.o.o.] *were divided among the Nine Companies to assure the continuation of their specific businesses*.650\n\nRospaher Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n528.\n\nMr Rospaher described the relationship between the Six Socialist Companies on the one hand, and Holding d.o.o. with the Nine Companies on the other hand as being a \"mirror image.\"651\n\nTr Day 3, 673:6-16.\n\n529.\n\nProf Dr Boric, when discussing determination of which assets were transferred to which company opined that\n\n*the relevant facts of the case show that division of assets was to be done along the operational units of the Six Socialist Companies*.652\n\n[...]\n\n*particular assets (such as real estate) were intended to follow the specific operation units according to their function*.653\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*the task force, had it been able to complete its task, would visit the existing operational units and list which assets were used in which business activity*.654\n\nBoric Report, \u00b6 71.\n\nBoric Report, \u00b6 75.\n\nBoric Report, \u00b6 79.\n\n530.\n\nBoth Mr Rospaher and Prof Dr Boric essentially state that the division of assets of Holding d.o.o. was to be done according to the function of each of the Nine Companies. The Tribunal agrees with that proposition, as it accords with the clear language of the Resolution and associated documents as described above. However, on analysis of the evidence presented by the Claimants, it becomes clear that in many cases the Tribunal simply has insufficient evidence in relation to various properties so as to make any determination as to whether the property is related to the function of one of the specific Nine Companies to the exclusion of the others.\n\n531.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 approach to identifying the Properties and Apartments which are the subject of this arbitration is informative. The approach of Mr Ilija Barisic, on behalf of the Claimants, can be summarised as follows. Using his expertise, Mr Barisic:\n\n(a) identified properties in the Asset List;\n\n(b) identified properties in the Record;\n\n(c) identified properties being used by the Second Claimant;\n\n(d) identified other properties on the basis of the records accessible at the premises of Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s business; and\n\n(e) searched the Land Registry and the Cadastral Records for properties registered to predecessors of Holding d.o.o.\n\n532.\n\nIn effect, using the various information sources available to him, Mr Barisic compiled a list of the real property which, on his view, formed part of the property of the Six Socialist Companies.655 What is not in evidence in its entirety is the next step\u2014namely, how that property relates to the functional operations of each of the Nine Companies.\n\nNo evidence is given as to how the property associated with Gavrilovi\u0107 Small Economy spo was excluded from this process, however, for the purposes of this Award, it is immaterial.\n\n533.\n\nThe above is not intended as a criticism of Mr Barisic, who the Tribunal found to be a truthful and knowledgeable witness. The Claimants face a difficult evidentiary burden in bringing their claim, and the Tribunal must address whether they have satisfied it on the evidence before it. As recognised by Prof Dr Boric during the First Hearing, the Claimants bear this evidentiary burden.656\n\nTr Day 7, 1533:3-6.\n\n534.\n\nThe business activities of each of the Nine Companies, as set out in the Resolution, can serve to guide the Tribunal in its analysis of the evidence.657 However, the only evidence before the Tribunal in relation to the function of the vast majority of the Properties consists of the Ing Ekspert reports in relation to each of them. The reports, being concerned with valuation, give an extremely limited description of the properties in question. In many cases, the Properties as reviewed by Ing Ekspert, consisted of devastated, or unused buildings.658\n\nResolution (C-0015), Art 2.\n\n*See* Ing Ekspert Report and Second Ing Ekspert Report for the various properties.\n\n535.\n\nA clear example of the problem faced by the Claimants is the New Hotel Gavrilovi\u0107, along with its associated facilities and land, which consists of Properties 65 and 66 (**Hotel Gavrilovi\u0107**).\n\n536.\n\nAlthough the Claimants have not specified property by property, or plot by plot, which assets are alleged to have been owned by which of the Five Companies at the time of the Purchase Agreement, or indeed which of the assets are alleged to have been owned by which of the Six Socialist Companies, the following in relation to Hotel Gavrilovi\u0107 can be observed:\n\n(a) Hotel Gavrilovi\u0107 does not appear in the Record;659\n\n(b) the Asset List lists Hotel Gavrilovi\u0107 as an asset of Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce spo;660\n\n(c) the land registry records the right of use of the plots as being held by \"Meat Industry 'Gavrilovi\u0107' Petrinja\", which may be a reference to Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo, or some other, older Gavrilovi\u0107 entity;\n\n(d) Mr Rospaher by his evidence stated that:\n\n*Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce spo\u2019s business continued through four LLC companies* [...] *Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging took over the accommodation, catering and tourism business* [\u2026];661\n\n(e) Hotel Gavrilovi\u0107 would appear to be part of any such accommodation, catering or tourism business; and\n\n(f) the plot was ultimately sold by the bankruptcy trustee of Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging, one of the Nine Companies not purchased by the First Claimant, to Mr Davor Impri\u0107 in 2011.662\n\n*See* notation \"N/A\" in Annex II to the Claimants\u2019 Reply in relation to Properties 65 and 66.\n\n*See* Asset List (C-0050), entries for cost centres 854 and 870.\n\nRospaher Statement, \u00b6 28.\n\n*See* Proposal for Registration of the Right of Ownership by Mr Davor Impri\u0107 dated 10 June 2011 (C-0274) and Decision No Z-1298/11 of the Municipal Court in Sisak dated 13 June 2011 (C-0275).\n\n537.\n\nThe above is a clear example of a property where there is no clarity, on the evidence as currently before the Tribunal, as to which of the Nine Companies was transferred the right of use as part of a universal succession of assets from Holding d.o.o.\n\n538.\n\nThis is by no means the only example. The Properties include various properties such as a bowling alley, a post office, empty land, and warehouses where, on the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not in a position to associate the property in question with a function of one of the Nine Companies.\n\n539.\n\nThe Claimants attempt to address this evidentiary lacuna by relying on the Survey to make the submission that where a certain property cannot be \"directly connected to the economic activity of any of the Nine Companies or Holding d.o.o.\"663 the answer is simply to allocate that asset to the member of the Nine Companies whose activity corresponds to the member of the Six Socialist Companies which owned the asset prior to the Merger Agreement.664 The Claimants describe this as an \"indirect universal succession.\"665\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 567.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 567-570.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 550.\n\n540.\n\nOn the Claimants\u2019 case, the Tribunal can simply attempt to find that a property was necessary for the business of one of the Nine Companies, and where it is unable to do that, can fall back to determining which of the Six Socialist Companies owned the asset, and then finding that it has been, in the words of the Claimants, indirectly universally succeeded by one of the Nine Companies.\n\n541.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 theory of \"indirect universal succession\", whereby, it is assumed, for example, that the asset position of Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo passed unchanged to Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry, is ill-founded. It cannot be assumed that the property of Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo related entirely to the functions of Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry, as enumerated in the Resolution. Therefore, there can be no assumption, on a factual basis, that the assets merely moved unchanged through the intermediary of Holding d.o.o. through the Merger Agreement and the Resolution six companies became ten (Holding d.o.o. in addition to the Nine Companies), even amongst companies with similar names and functions there can be no assumption that no redistribution of assets between those companies was required.\n\n542.\n\nThe problem is particularly apparent in the alleged indirect transformation of Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce spo into Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce, Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport, Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging, and Gavrilovi\u0107 Motel Biograd.\n\n543.\n\nEach of Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce, Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging and Gavrilovi\u0107 Motel Biograd are specified as having had a business activity of:\n\n[\u2026] *wholesale and retail trade in:*\n\n*a) foodstuffs,*\n\n*b) non-foodstuffs, with exception of finished medications, arms, ammunition, armament items, products, equipment and utensils intended for national defence and protection* [\u2026]666\n\nwith Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport having a similar activity, with the exception of foodstuffs.\n\nResolution (C-0015), pp 4-7.\n\n544.\n\nGavrilovi\u0107 Lodging and Gavrilovi\u0107 Motel Biograd are both recorded in the Resolution as having been transferred real property.667\n\nResolution (C-0015), pp 4-7.\n\n545.\n\nIn such circumstances, without specific evidence in relation to each individual property, the Tribunal is simply not in a position to determine whether any particular retail property was transferred to one of the Five Companies, or alternatively to Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging or Gavrilovi\u0107 Motel Biograd.\n\n546.\n\nIt does not assist the Claimants to argue that none of the Nine Companies, other than the Second Claimant (as successor to the Five Companies) has ever claimed the Properties.668\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 96.\n\n547.\n\nFirst, none of those entities are before the Tribunal, and could not be, given the Tribunal\u2019s inability to adjudicate their rights, as set out above. Further, in the Tribunal\u2019s view it is not sufficient to claim ownership of property by simply stating that no other person has claimed to be the owner, and the Claimants have not relied on any authority contrary to this view.\n\n548.\n\nSecond, the submission does not appear to be factually accurate, given that in regard to the Hotel Gavrilovi\u0107, as discussed above, Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging treated that asset as its own, and sold it in bankruptcy to Mr Impri\u0107.\n\n549.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where the Claimants have failed in establishing their ownership of an asset due to a lack of evidence, the Tribunal simply finds that they have not met their evidentiary burden in this proceeding and makes no finding in relation to the ownership of the asset.\n\n550.\n\nGiven the above observations, the Tribunal now turns to the specific assets in question. In assessing this threshold issue, the Tribunal has analysed the assets at the level of each functional asset, i.e. a complete Property or Apartment, rather than on a plot by plot basis. The following analysis is limited solely to the question of whether, if the Claimants are able to establish title to the asset on the part of Holding d.o.o., it would have been transferred to the Five Companies by virtue of the Resolution.\n\n**(9)The Apartments**\n---------------------\n\n551.\n\nOn the Claimants\u2019 submission, the programme of construction and maintenance of the Apartments was a function of the Gavrilovi\u0107 Housing Association.669 The Gavrilovi\u0107 Housing Association was established in 1980, or prior thereto.670\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6103.\n\nNotification of Deletion of OSIZ, County Commercial Court in Zagreb dated 5 March 1991, attached to Decision of the County Commercial Court in Zagreb No Iz-23/79 dated 18 February 1980 (C-0012).\n\n552.\n\nThe Apartments were used by workers of the Six Socialist Companies.671 During the Socialist period, organisations such as the Gavrilovi\u0107 business would establish funds to which their workers would contribute a percentage of their salary. The workers\u2019 accommodation would then be constructed using those funds.672\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 104.\n\nKlaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6 37.\n\n553.\n\nA right of disposition of the Apartments was transferred to Holding d.o.o. through the operation of the Merger Agreement.673\n\nKlaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6 40.\n\n554.\n\nThe Claimants contend that due to the fact that Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo financed the construction of the Apartments, they formed part of that company\u2019s assets.674 Presumably, they were then subject to an \"indirect universal succession\" to Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry, one of the Five Companies.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 105.\n\n555.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Apartments were not means of production for any of the Nine Companies, and would therefore have remained as an asset of Holding d.o.o.675 The Respondent further contends that even if that were not the case, the Claimants have failed in their burden of showing that the Apartments were necessary for the work performed by the Five Companies.676\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 543.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 553.\n\n556.\n\nThe Claimants describe as arguable the proposition that the Apartments were not required for the operation of the Nine Companies.677\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 567.\n\n557.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimants have failed in their burden of establishing that the Apartments were transferred to the Five Companies by universal succession. Having rejected the Claimants\u2019 formulation of an \"indirect universal succession\" as above, there is simply no evidence that the Apartments relate to a function of one of the Five Companies as enumerated in the Resolution. None of the Five Companies, or for that matter the Nine Companies, or Holding d.o.o., is described by the Resolution as having the function of holding and maintaining workers\u2019 accommodation on behalf of the Gavrilovi\u0107 business as a whole. Further, it is noted by the Tribunal that the Apartments related to the employees of all of the Six Socialist Companies; given this fact, on the evidence available to the Tribunal, it is simply not possible to disaggregate them among the Nine Companies.\n\n558.\n\nThe above analysis is not altered by the fact that in various court proceedings brought by the tenants of the properties similar to the Apartments,678 the Second Claimant was found by the Court to be the owner. As opined by Judge Matusko, and accepted by the Tribunal, in such cases, which involved a compulsory sale of the apartment in question to its tenant, the Court did not examine the issue of ownership in circumstances where a respondent does not object to standing to be sued.679 In the only case where a Court examined the issue, the reasoning as set out in the judgment is cursory, and based solely on the purchase of Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry. The judgment does not explain how Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry became the owner of the apartment in question, and the Tribunal cannot derive any guidance from the decision.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 591.\n\nTr Day 8, 1731:11-20.\n\n559.\n\nGiven the Claimants\u2019 failure, it becomes unnecessary to consider the Claimants\u2019 ownership in relation to the Apartments further.\n\n**(10) Unoccupied Retail Properties (Properties 12, 17, 22, 25-31, 34, 38-45, 4750, 52-53, 57, 80)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nAs stated at paragraphs 545 to 549 *supra*, the Tribunal is, without more, simply unable to make any finding in relation to which of the Nine Companies has become a universal successor to retail properties, given the interlapping functions of those Nine Companies as set out in the Resolution.\n\n561.\n\nFor the following Properties, the situation is acute:\n\n(a) Properties 12, 22, 25, 27, 29-30, 34, 42 and 52 constitute a range of former retail premises, ranging from a devastated shopping centre, in the case of Property 12, an empty piece of land on which only the foundations of the previous building remain in the case of Property 30, and various other buildings in a state of disrepair.680\n\n(b) Properties 17, 26, 28, 31, 38-39, 40-41, 43-45, 47-50, 53, 57 and 80 constitute retail premises which appear from the Ing Ekspert Reports to be in good repair, but which have never been occupied by the Second Claimant.681\n\n*See* Ing Ekspert Report and Second Ing Ekspert Report for the various properties.\n\nSecond Gulam Statement, Annex IV.\n\n562.\n\nHaving reviewed the evidentiary record, including the documents referred to in Annex II to the Claimants\u2019 Reply, the Tribunal is simply unable to establish how each of these Properties is related to the function of one of the Five Companies, to the exclusion of the others, as explained above.\n\n563.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Claimants have failed in their burden of establishing that these Properties were conveyed by the Resolution from Holding d.o.o. to the Five Companies. Given this finding, it is unnecessary to consider the Claimants\u2019 ownership over these Properties further. In Annexure 1 to this Award, these Properties are marked as red so as to indicate the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Claimants have failed to establish ownership rights in relation to them.\n\n**(11) Miscellaneous Properties (Properties 11, 51, 56, 58, 60-61, 63-66, 71)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n564.\n\nThe Claimants have claimed numerous miscellaneous Properties with no apparent link to any of the Five Companies, to the exclusion of the remainder of the Nine Companies:\n\n(a) Property 11 is empty land;\n\n(b) Property 51 is a storage facility;\n\n(c) Property 56 is a commercial building;\n\n(d) Property 58 is a warehouse complex;\n\n(e) Property 60 is a post office building;\n\n(f) Property 61 is a series of commercial spaces;\n\n(g) Property 63 is a bowling alley;\n\n(h) Property 64 is a warehouse;\n\n(i) Properties 65 and 66 are the New Hotel Gavrilovi\u0107 as discussed above; and\n\n(j) Property 71 is a two-storey building, the purpose of which is unclear.682\n\n*See* Ing Ekspert Report and Second Ing Ekspert Report for these Properties.\n\n565.\n\nWhat is immediately apparent from the above is that without further evidence as to the purpose to which the above Properties were put by the Six Socialist Companies, the Tribunal is not in a position to determine that such Properties are related to the functions of any of the Nine Companies.\n\n566.\n\nAny of the Nine Companies could have utilised warehouse space, commercial space, or empty land. The Tribunal\u2019s concerns in relation to the Hotel Gavrilovi\u0107 have been set out above. Further, Properties such as a bowling alley and a post office do not appear, *prima facie*, to be related to the functions of any of the Nine Companies as enumerated in the Resolution.\n\n567.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Claimants have failed in their burden of establishing that these Properties were conveyed by the Resolution from Holding d.o.o. to the Five Companies. Given this finding, it is unnecessary to consider the Claimants\u2019 claim to ownership over these Properties further. In Annexure 1 to this Award, these Properties are marked as red so as to indicate the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Claimants have failed to establish ownership rights in relation to them.\n\n**(12)Property 68**\n-------------------\n\n568.\n\nAs opposed to the other Properties claimed by the Claimants, Property 68 is not in truth a contiguous delineated property in the normal sense.\n\n569.\n\nThe origins of Property 68 are explained by Mr Barisic. According to Mr Barisic, following his search of Land Registry records and Cadastral records, certain plots identified by him could not be arranged in a contiguous or logical manner. Those plots constitute Property 68.\n\n570.\n\nAn examination of the Ing Ekspert report for Property 68 shows the extent of this lack of congruity. The map identifying Property 68, as set out on page 4 of that report, shows a disparate assortment of land holdings spread over a large geographic area.\n\n571.\n\nIn such circumstances, it is impossible to derive a function for the \"property\", and therefore impossible to determine that Property 68 is related to the functions of the Five Companies, to the exclusion of the remainder of the Nine Companies.\n\n572.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Claimants have failed in their burden of establishing that Property 68 was conveyed by the Resolution from Holding d.o.o. to the Five Companies. Given this finding, it is unnecessary to consider the Claimants\u2019 claim to ownership over this Property further. In Annexure 1 to this Award, Property 68 is marked as red so as to indicate the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Claimants have failed to establish ownership rights in relation to it.\n\n**(13) Agricultural Properties (Properties 10, 63, 67, 69-70, 72-75, 77-79)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n573.\n\nMany of the Properties, namely Properties 10, 63, 67, 69-70, 72-75 and 77-79 constitute farm land, as is apparent from the Ing Ekspert reports for those Properties.\n\n574.\n\nIn relation to these Properties, the Tribunal\u2019s role is easier. The Resolution only indicates one of the Nine Companies, Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture, as having an agricultural function.683 In such circumstances, where the Claimants are able to establish Holding d.o.o.\u2019s ownership of the plots underlying such agricultural Properties, the Tribunal is satisfied that Holding d.o.o.\u2019s rights in relation to those plots transferred to Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture by operation of the Resolution.\n\nResolution (C-0015), p 4.\n\n**(14) Facilities (Properties 18, 59, 62, 76)**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n575.\n\nSeveral Properties constitute facilities where it is possible for the Tribunal to allocate those facilities to the Five Companies, to the exclusion of the remaining four of the Nine Companies:\n\n(a) Property 18 is a parking area near the Gavrilovi\u0107 factory. Given that the Second Claimant has been able to establish its title to the Gavrilovi\u0107 factory and that the parking area has been occupied from 1995,684 there is a clear link between the function of the parking area, the function of the factory, and therefore the transmission of the property from Holding d.o.o. to one of the Five Companies, in this case Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry.\n\n(b) Property 59 consists of administration and warehouse buildings in Smiljan. Although much of the property is devastated,685 the Property has been used for the storage of agricultural machinery, timber and hay.686 The property has been occupied by the Second Claimant since 1992.687 Given the continual occupation of the Property by the Second Claimant, and its use for agricultural purposes, there is a clear link between the agricultural function of the Property, and the function of Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture and therefore the transmission of the Property from Holding d.o.o. to one of the Five Companies, in this case Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture.\n\n(c) Property 62 is a transport depot as is apparent from the Ing Ekspert report.688 Given its specialised nature, it is clearly required for the functions of Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport. There is a clear transmission of this Property from Holding d.o.o. to Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport.\n\n(d) Property 76 is the old Gavrilovi\u0107 factory, and is currently not operational.689 Although the factory is not operational (and was not as far back as 2002), its use as an asset as of the Resolution is clearly functionally linked to the business of Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry, being an asset used for meat processing. There is a clear transmission of this Property from Holding d.o.o. to Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry.\n\nSecond Gulam Statement, Annex IV.\n\nIng Ekspert Report, Property 59.\n\nIng Ekspert Report, Property 59, p 12.\n\nSecond Gulam Statement Annex, IV.\n\nIng Ekspert Report, Property 62.\n\nIng Ekspert Report, Property 76.\n\n576.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s findings above, in circumstances where the Claimants are able to establish Holding d.o.o.\u2019s ownership of the plots underlying these Properties, the Tribunal is satisfied that Holding d.o.o.\u2019s rights in relation to those plots transferred to the Five Companies by operation of the Resolution.\n\n**(15) Occupied Retail Properties (Properties 2-7, 9, 13-16, 19-21, 23-24, 32-33, 35-37, 46, 54-55**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n577.\n\nProperties 2-7, 9, 13-16, 19-21, 23-24, 32-33, 35-37, 46 and 54-55 consist of retail premises.\n\n578.\n\nWhile the Tribunal was unable to allocate the previous retail premises discussed, as set out above, these Properties are distinct in that they have been occupied by the Second Claimant.\n\n579.\n\nProperties 2-7 and 9 have been used by the Claimants continuously since the Purchase Agreement.690 The remainder of these Properties were later occupied by the Claimants as per the evidence of Ms Gulam.691 While Property 14 appears not to be currently operational,692 on the evidence of Ms Gulam it has remained in the Second Claimant\u2019s possession.\n\nBarisic Statement, \u00b6 59.\n\nSecond Gulam Statement, Annex IV.\n\n*See* Ing Ekspert Report for Property 14.\n\n580.\n\nGiven the use of these retail assets by the Second Claimant, and the lack of use of these assets by any of the Nine Companies not purchased by the First Claimant, the Tribunal concludes that these retail premises relate to the retail functions of the Five Companies, and not to the retail functions of the remaining Nine Companies.\n\n581.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s findings above, in circumstances, where the Claimants are able to establish Holding d.o.o.\u2019s ownership of the plots underlying these Properties, the Tribunal is satisfied that Holding d.o.o.\u2019s rights in relation to those plots transferred to the Five Companies by operation of the Resolution.\n\n**(16) Were the Plots Underlying the Properties Capable of being Owned by Holding d.o.o.?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n582.\n\nHaving decided above which of the Properties the Tribunal is satisfied would have passed to the Five Companies by operation of the Resolution, the Tribunal now descends to the level of individual plots to ascertain whether those plots were the property of Holding d.o.o. at the relevant time. The Tribunal does not address the Parties\u2019 arguments in relation to Properties where the Tribunal has found above that the Claimants have failed in discharging their burden of proof.693\n\nFor instance, given the Tribunal\u2019s finding in relation to Property 68, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider the operation of the Act on Forest Land.\n\n583.\n\nThe Respondent contends that by operation of various pieces of legislation, certain Properties were transferred *ex lege* to Croatia, or alternatively were never capable of being owned. These legislative acts predated the Purchase Agreement, and on that basis, those Properties which were subject to those acts simply could not have formed part of the assets of the Five Companies prior to the Purchase Agreement. There is some level of agreement as between the Parties as to the operation of those laws, and some level of agreement as to identification of Properties which are subject to those laws.\n\n584.\n\nIt is self-evident that if a property was never an asset of the Five Companies, it cannot on any analysis have passed to the Second Claimant. The Claimants do not contend otherwise.\n\n**(17) Water Act 1990**\n-----------------------\n\n585.\n\nBy List 1, the Parties have identified 6 plots which were transferred to the Respondent by operation of Article 3 of the Water Act 1990, a law which predates the Purchase Agreement (**Water Plots**).694\n\nAnnexure 1, rows 913-918.\n\n586.\n\nA review of the decisions themselves, namely Decision Nos Z-994/09-3 (Exhibit R-0188), Z-1011/08-3 (Exhibit R-0201), and Z-1030/10 (Exhibit R-0260), clearly indicates that these decisions were not made subject to the Water Act 1990, but instead by reference to the Water Act 1995 in the case of Decision Nos Z-994/09-3 and Z-1011/08-3, and the Water Act 2009 in the case of Decision No Z-1030/10.\n\n587.\n\nAs explained by Dr Ernst in his opinion,695 the Water Act 1990 has been updated on several occasions since 1990.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6\u00b6 70-75.\n\n588.\n\nThe key question for the Tribunal at this stage is to ascertain whether the Water Act 1990, as it was at the time of the Purchase Agreement, allowed for the holding of rights over the Water Plots so that they could have formed part of the assets of the Five Companies.\n\n589.\n\nArticle 3 of the Water Act 1990 provides:\n\n*Waters, water courses, the sea and the sea shore were established to be assets of general interest under special social protection, and they could be used under the conditions and in the manner prescribed by that or another Act*.696\n\nWater Act (RL-0106 / RL-0233), Art 3.\n\n590.\n\nThe plots in question form Property 74 as claimed by the Claimants. Property 74, and by extension the relevant plots, consists of a lake, canals, and surrounding land. A view of the aerial photo with overlaid cadastral data clearly shows that the majority of the claimed plots consists of a lake.697\n\n*See* Ing Ekspert Report for Property 74.\n\n591.\n\nThe Respondent contends that at all relevant times, including during the socialist era predating the Purchase Agreement, such plots were common assets.698\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 140. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent attempts to find support in its position in the opinion of Dr Ernst citing Ernst Report, \u00b6 237. On a reading of Dr Ernst\u2019s opinion, it is apparent that his reference to the Water Good Act is a reference to the Act on Maritime Good, Water Good, Ports, and Harbours, which concerns itself with navigable waterways.\n\n592.\n\nThe Claimants state that the Water Act 1990 does nothing to affect ownership of land, and that the Water Act 1990 could not serve as a basis of state ownership of the Water Plots.699\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 443-444.\n\n593.\n\nProfessor Klaric and Judge Matusko deal with the issue of the Water Act 1990 in summary manner, stating:\n\n*Pursuant to the Water Act water, water courses, the sea and the sea shore were declared to be assets of common interest.*\n\n*Pursuant to the* [Ownership Act] *, water in rivers and the sea cannot be the subject of ownership rights of either a physical or a legal person individually. This provision is also applied to other things that are classified as common assets*.700\n\nKlaric and Matusko Report, p 14.\n\n594.\n\nDr Ernst by his report gives a detailed history of the various Water Acts in Croatia, stating in relation to the Water Act 1990 that it did not contain elaborate provisions on the property aspects of land surrounding or holding water.701 Dr Ernst also opined that in accordance with the Water Act 1995 Article 66, at the time of that Act, water goods could be privately owned.702\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 70.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 71.\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Respondent\u2019s argument fails. While the Respondent may have been entitled to take ownership of the Water Plots under subsequent legislation (an issue which is addressed under expropriation), the Water Act 1990 does nothing to prevent private ownership of the Water Plots.\n\n596.\n\nIndeed, the fact that the Water Act 1995, allowed for private ownership of a \"water good\", as opined to by Dr Ernst,703 is completely contrary to an argument that such plots were in all cases common assets.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 74, including fn 154.\n\n597.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Water Act 1990 has no effect on the potential holdings of the Five Companies at the time of the Purchase Agreement, and that the Water Plots were capable of being subject to rights by Holding d.o.o.\n\n**(18)Roads Acts**\n------------------\n\n598.\n\nThe Respondent contends that 17 of the plots claimed by the Claimants were roads, and therefore, under Croatian law, unable to be owned as they were common assets (**Road****Plots**). The Respondent relies on the opinion of Prof Klaric and Judge Matusko, wherein they state:\n\n*Pursuant to Article 3 of the* [Roads Act 1984] *all roads were common assets. Later the* [Roads Act 1990] *which also designated roads as common assets. According to the* [Roads Act 2011] *the owner of roads is the Republic of Croatia, or of uncategorized roads, the unit of local self-government*.704\n\nKlaric and Matusko Report, p 14; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 428.\n\n599.\n\nThe roads in question here are uncategorised roads.705\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 430.\n\n600.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the English translation of Prof Klaric and Judge Matusko\u2019s opinion omits the key phrase that \"[o]nly the law from 2011 prescribed the ownership status on roads and sets forth that the owner of roads is the Republic of Croatia.\"706 The Tribunal agrees with that contention.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 74.\n\n601.\n\nOn a review of the applicable legislation as extracted by the Parties, the Tribunal has found no reference in the pre-2011 Roads Acts to bar private ownership of a road, as contended by the Respondent.\n\n602.\n\nApart from the lack of reference to particular legislation, the Tribunal notes that in this proceeding, there are at least two occurrences of Croatian courts registering private ownership over a road prior to the Roads Act 2011. The first being the registration of the Second Claimant as owner over the plot listed at line 2668 of Annexure 1 as evidenced by Land Registry Extract dated 13 December 2006,707 despite the plot having the description \"road\", and the second being the registration of Mr Impri\u0107 over the plot listed at lines 209-210 of Annexure 1 as evidenced by Decision No. Z-1298/11 of the Municipal Court in Si sak,708 a registration supported by the Respondent.709 In the case of Mr Impri\u0107\u2019s plot, the plot contained \"roads\" extending to 1698m\u00b2.710\n\nLand Registry Excerpts Associated with Property No 78 (C-0485), p 5.\n\nDecision No Z-1298/11 of the Municipal Court in Sisak dated 13 June 2011 (C-0275).\n\nProposal for Registration of the Right of Ownership by Mr Davor Impri\u0107 dated 10 June 2011 (C-0274).\n\nProposal for Registration of the Right of Ownership by Mr Davor Impri\u0107 dated 10 June 2011 (C-0274)\n\n603.\n\nGiven Croatian courts\u2019 treatment of roads, the Tribunal does not accept that it is \"part of the elementary knowledge of the law of the Republic of Croatia of any lawyer\"711 that roads were incapable of being owned prior to the Roads Act 2011, and instead considers it more likely that such a restriction came into effect with the Roads Act 2011.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 429.\n\n604.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Road Plots, which were unclassified roads, were capable of being subject to rights by Holding d.o.o. at the relevant time.\n\n**(19) Agricultural Land Act**\n------------------------------\n\n605.\n\nOn 24 July 1991, the Agricultural Land Act came into effect in Croatia. The Agricultural Land Act relevantly provides:\n\n*Article 3*\n\n*The holder of the title to socially-owned agricultural land on the territory of the Republic of Croatia shall be the Republic of Croatia* [...].712\n\nAgricultural Land Act (RL-0043), Art 3.\n\n606.\n\nAgricultural land is defined by the Agricultural Land Act in Article 2:\n\n*Agricultural land in terms of this law shall include ploughfields, gardens, orchards, vineyards, meadows, pastures, fish ponds, reed areas and marshes that are not specially valued biotopes, as well as other land used or unused that can be employed for agricultural production.*\n\n*Agricultural land in terms of this Law shall also include undeveloped building land, except adapted building land in ancient city centres to be determined by the municipal assembly.*\n\n*Arable agricultural land in terms of this Law shall include ploughfields, gardens, orchards, vineyards and meadows*.713\n\nAgricultural Land Act (RL-0043), Art 2.\n\n607.\n\nThe Agricultural Land Act was passed prior to the Purchase Agreement. On the Respondent\u2019s submission, the legislation had the effect of transferring *ex lege* the majority of the plots claimed by the Claimants to Croatia. The logical corollary of this is that it was not possible for any land transferred in such way to form the assets of the Five Companies as sold.714\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 442.\n\n608.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that 2,696 plots were transferred in the above manner. For convenience, these plots have been extracted at Annexure 2 to this Award.715\n\nAnnexure 2 contains a list of 2,555 plots rather than the total 2,696. The reason for this discrepancy is that Annexure 2 only analyses plots which relate to Properties which the Tribunal has found above can be allocated to one of the Five Companies.\n\n609.\n\nThe Claimants have made a series of concessions in relation to agricultural land:\n\n(a) First, the Claimants conceded that three plots satisfied the test for agricultural land.716\n\n(b) Second, Dr Ernst, as part of his review of several court decisions where plots were transferred to Croatia by operation of the Agricultural Land stated that those decisions were properly made.717\n\n(c) Third, the Claimants conceded that in cases where a court decision registering the Respondent as owner referred to Article 3(1) of the Agricultural Land Act (without also referring to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act), where the decision \"covers agricultural plots\" and where a Spatial Certificate718 is referenced in the decision, such plots were properly registered by the Respondent.719\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 419.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6\u00b6 231-234.\n\nAs defined in paragraph 610(c) *infra*.\n\nTr Day 9, 2022:3-6.\n\n610.\n\nThe Claimants rely on the evidence of Dr Ernst in interpreting the Agricultural Land Act. According to Dr Ernst:\n\n(a) Land must be cultivable in order to be considered agricultural.720\n\n(b) Land which is construction land, namely \"land located within cities, and urban settlements, as well as other developed land or land designated for the construction of buildings, or for public space\" was excluded from the definition of agricultural land by operation of the Construction Land Act.721\n\n(c) In order to register its ownership, Croatia required a certificate from the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Spatial Planning, and Construction stating that the land in question was outside the area for construction (**Spatial Certificate**).722\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 62.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 64.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 63.\n\n611.\n\nThe Claimants submit that for a plot to have become the property of the Respondent, all of the following conditions must be met:\n\n(a) the land must have been designated as agricultural land in the land registry (the description must match the definition of agricultural land in the Agricultural Land Act);\n\n(b) the land must not be developed; and\n\n(c) there must be a Spatial Certificate stating that the plot lay outside the area zoned for construction on 24 July 1991.723\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 413.\n\n***a. Requirement for a Certificate***\n--------------------------------------\n\n612.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept that in order for land to pass into the ownership of Croatia, a Spatial Certificate was required. The Claimants themselves, by their submissions state that:\n\n*By its terms, Article 3 of the Act on Agricultural Land transferred all socially owned agricultural land to* [the] *Respondent as of its entry into force on July 24, 1991*.724\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 408 (emphasis added).\n\n613.\n\nThis position is further elaborated on in the Ernst Report, where Dr Ernst extracts a memorandum issued by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Spatial Planning, and Construction, which stated in relation to the Spatial Certificates:\n\n[The Agricultural Land Act] *which came into force on July 24, 1991, effected a transformation of ownership such that all land that was located on that date outside the area zoned for construction, and was entered into the land register as socially owned, was transferred into the (unregistered) ownership of the Republic of Croatia by operation of law, irrespective of who was entered as the user of said land.*\n\n[...]\n\n*It is necessary to enclose with the application for registration of said right, among other things, a certificate that certain land is outside the area zoned for construction* [\u2026].725\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 63 (emphasis added).\n\n614.\n\nWhile a Spatial Certificate was required in the registration process by the Respondent for agricultural land, the land passed into the Respondent\u2019s ownership by the operation of the Agricultural Land Act *ex lege* at the time of that act.726\n\nThe timing of this transfer was confirmed by Dr Ernst: Tr Day 7, 1576:6-12.\n\n615.\n\nThe Respondent did not \"agree with the necessity of having a certificate\"727 as alleged by the Claimants. The Respondent has consistently maintained that agricultural land, as defined by the Agricultural Land Act, passed to the Respondent by operation of that act *ex lege* at the time of the Act.728\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 106\n\nThe Respondent confirmed the same with Dr Ernst: Tr Day 7, 1576:6-12.\n\n***b. What is Agricultural Land?***\n-----------------------------------\n\n616.\n\nThe Respondent submits that in cases where it has claimed land as agricultural land, it has done so on the basis of a Spatial Certificate certifying the land as agricultural land. The Respondent\u2019s note in List 1 on this issue (provided pursuant to PO 5) states:\n\n[T]*he land plots registered by* [the] *Respondent pursuant to the Agricultural Land Act were those where the Administrative Office for Spatial Planning and Construction issued a certificate certifying that the plot was outside the construction area on 24 July 1991* [\u2026].\n\n617.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that in order for land to be agricultural it must only have been permitted by law to be used for agricultural activities, irrespective of its actual use.729\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 441.\n\n618.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 competing note in List 1(provided pursuant to PO 5) states:\n\n[The] *Respondent\u2019s unsupported statement that only by law make the determination of whether a plot is construction or agricultural land is false. Construction and agricultural land are both defined terms. Construction land is defined to include all developed land* [...] *Agricultural land is expressly defined as including fields, gardens, orchards, vineyards, meadows, pastures, fisheries, sedgelands, and swamplands that are not particularly valuable biotopes, as well as other land that is used, or is not used, but can be cultivated for agricultural production* [\u2026] *A certificate neither attempts nor can override the application of the Acts and its definitions. It only certifies the location of the plot in terms of zoning regulation, and supplements the facts in the land register. The description in the land registry must match the definition from Article 2(1) Agricultural Land Act*.730\n\n*See also* Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 426.\n\n619.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that a Spatial Certificate cannot change the fact that a plot has been developed, and cannot change the fact that the land registry records a building as existing on the plot. Both would be fatal to the classification of land as agricultural land.731\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 426.\n\n620.\n\nIt is noted by the Tribunal that the Respondent attempted to find support for its position in the Ernst Report and quoted sections thereof.732 On reading Dr Ernst\u2019s report in its entirety, the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s characterisation.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 441.\n\n621.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that land cannot simultaneously be agricultural land and construction land. The Tribunal further accepts that land which has been developed cannot constitute agricultural land.\n\n622.\n\nA Spatial Certificate is a certificate which simply indicates that the relevant plot is zoned outside of the area of construction. This is apparent from the memorandum extracted above wherein it states:\n\n*It is necessary to enclose with the application for registration of said right, among other things, a certificate that certain land is outside the area zoned for construction* [\u2026].733\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 63 (emphasis added).\n\n623.\n\nLand which has been developed, irrespective of its zoning status, cannot constitute a \"field, garden or orchards\" or the other land types expressly referred to in Article 2 of the Agricultural Land Act. To say that land which has been subject to development could potentially be used for agricultural purposes and is therefore agricultural land would cause any building in an agricultural area of Croatia liable to the operation of the Agricultural Land Act. This is an intention which is not apparent in the wording of the Agricultural Land Act itself.\n\n624.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that in order for land to be agricultural land for the purposes of the Agricultural Land Act it must be:\n\n(a) cultivable;\n\n(b) zoned outside of an area zoned for construction; and\n\n(c) undeveloped.\n\n***c. Which of the Properties are Agricultural Land?***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n625.\n\nIn relation to the Claimants\u2019 first concession, those plots are easily identifiable; the only remaining plot this concession is relevant to is located in Annexure 2 at row 2. This plot has also been shaded green in Annexure 1 so as to indicate the Tribunal\u2019s finding that it was not owned by Holding d.o.o. at the relevant time, and was therefore not transferred to the Five Companies.\n\n626.\n\nIn relation to the Claimants\u2019 second concession, those plots are also identifiable by reference to the decisions reviewed by Dr Ernst. Those plots are located at rows 3-31 of Annexure 2. Those plots have also been marked in green in Annexure 1 so as to indicate the Tribunal\u2019s finding that they were not owned by Holding d.o.o. at the relevant time, and were therefore not transferred to the Five Companies.\n\n627.\n\nIn relation to the Claimants\u2019 third concession, the Claimants have not identified specifically which plots that concession relates to. The Tribunal has reviewed the decisions granting registration of plots to Croatia through the operation of the Agricultural Land Act and has determined that the concession applies to the 1,861 plots listed at rows 32-1892 of Annexure 2. Those plots have also been marked in green in Annexure 1 so as to indicate the Tribunal\u2019s finding that they were not owned by Holding d.o.o. at the relevant time, and were therefore not transferred to the Five Companies. For each of those plots, the relevant decisions:734\n\n(a) refer to Article 3(1) of the Agricultural Land Act with no reference to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act;\n\n(b) are not subject to a claim by the Claimants that the plots are not agricultural plots; and\n\n(c) refer to a Spatial Certificate.\n\nDecision No Z-7/03, Municipal Court Gvozd, 14 June 2004 (R-0115), Decision No Z-1917/04, Municipal Court Petrinja, 30 November 2004 (R-0117), Decision No Z-294/05, Municipal Court Glina, 14 September 2005 (R-0124), Decision No Z-229/06, Municipal Court Gvozd, 18 May 2006 (R-0133(*bis*)), Decision No Z-1987/06, Municipal Court Petrinja, 8 November 2006 (R-0135), Decision No Z-1076/06, Municipal Court Glina, 13 December 2006 (R-0136), Decision No Z-1129/07, Municipal Court Petrinja, 10 September 2007 (R-0148), Decision No Z-1783/06-2, Municipal Court Petrinja, 7 January 2008 (R-0151), Decision No Z-1994/06, Municipal Court Petrinja, 18 February 2008 (R-0165), Decision No Z-595/08, Municipal Court Glina, 18 June 2008 (R-0181), Decision No Zp-132/09, Municipal Court Gospic, 7 October 2009 (R-0204), Decision No Gz-482/10, County Court Sisak, 19 May 2010 (R-0249), Decision No Z-902/10, Municipal Court Glina, 24 June 2010 (R-0252) and Decision No Z-1131/10, Municipal Court Glina, 22 September 2010 (R-0255).\n\n***d. Disputed Agricultural Plots***\n------------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nIn relation to the remaining alleged agricultural plots, the Parties are in dispute. Their arguments in relation to the plots are spread as between their submissions, and the Lists provided pursuant to PO 5 (referred to in paragraph 477 *supra*). However, the Claimants\u2019 contentions can be summarised as follows in relation to various plots:\n\n(a) the decisions in relation to certain plots have not been provided by the Respondent in this proceeding;\n\n(b) certain decisions do not refer to the plots which the Respondent claims are agricultural plots;\n\n(c) the decision does not refer to a Spatial Certificate;\n\n(d) the decision does not refer to the Agricultural Land Act;\n\n(e) the decision refers to a provision of the Agricultural Land Act other than Article 3(1);\n\n(f) the decision refers to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act, making it impossible to differentiate between plots awarded subject to that Act, and those subject to the Act on Agricultural Land;\n\n(g) the plot has been valued as construction land by the respective valuation experts;\n\n(h) the plot is not described as agricultural in nature in the Land Registry;\n\n(i) construction was carried out on the plot prior to the commencement of the Agricultural Land Act;\n\n(j) that Decision No Z-1367/12735 does not appear to be applying the Agricultural Land Act; and\n\n(k) that certain plots subject to Decision No Z-229/06736 were not included in the original decision, and there is suspicion that the decision was rendered \"by order.\"\n\nDecision No Z-1367/12, Municipal Court Gospic, 29 August 2012 (R-0273).\n\nDecision No Z-229/06, Municipal Court Gvozd, 18 May 2006 (R-0133(*bis*)).\n\n629.\n\nThe Tribunal has summarised which plots are subject to which arguments in Annexure 2.\n\n630.\n\nBefore turning to the specific arguments, the Tribunal observes that the decisions to which the Parties referred on this matter, and the accompanying documentation, were provided in Croatian, with an English translation. In many cases, the English translation was not a translation of the full Croatian document. This proceeding was conducted in English, with a requirement that the Parties translate relevant documentation.737 The Tribunal has relied on the English translations, incomplete as they are, to the exclusion of the original Croatian material.\n\nPO 1, \u00b6 12.3.\n\n***e. Burden***\n---------------\n\n631.\n\nThe Claimants have by their submissions attempted to put the Respondent to proof the issue of whether a plot constitutes an agricultural plot.\n\n632.\n\nThe Claimants state that they\n\n*have discharged their burden to show that they had a property interest in the Agricultural Properties, by showing that according to the Record, Asset List or other contemporaneous documents these Agricultural Properties belonged to its predecessor Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture spo. It is the burden of* [the] *Respondent to show that it has satisfied the requirements of the* [ *Agricultural Land* Act] *to justify the July 1991 expropriation of the Agricultural Properties*.738\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 418.\n\n633.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Claimants\u2019 proposition. In cases where a plot of land was transferred *ex lege* to the Respondent by operation of the Agricultural Land Act, that land never formed part of the property of the Five Companies as set out above. It is the Claimants\u2019 burden to establish the property over which they have a right.\n\n634.\n\nThat is not to say that the Claimants must positively establish that every plot of land that is the subject of this dispute is *not* agricultural. However, in cases where the Respondent has registered its ownership pursuant to the Agricultural Land Act, it is for the Claimants, as the party carrying the burden of establishing its right to the property, and as the party also impugning the Respondent\u2019s registration, to prove that the land was not agricultural. Further, it is not sufficient for the Respondent to simply assert that land is agricultural without providing proof that the land was registered on that basis. Once the Respondent has proven its registration, the burden shifts to the Claimants to prove that the plot in question was not agricultural.\n\n***f. Decision Not Provided and Decision Does Not Refer to the Plots***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n635.\n\nFor those plots in Properties 18, 78 and 79 (at rows 1893-1908) of Annexure 2 the Respondent has either not provided the decision that registered the plots pursuant to the Agricultural Land Act, or alternatively, the decision referred to does not in fact mention the plot in question. The Respondent\u2019s allegation, on the evidence before the Tribunal, therefore simply stands as assertion.\n\n636.\n\nFor those plots the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not proved registration in accordance with the Agricultural Land Act, and therefore finds that there was no impediment to ownership of those plots at the time of the Purchase Agreement.\n\n***g. Decision Does Not Refer to the Agricultural Land Act, Does Not Refer to a Spatial Certificate or Refers to a Provision of the Agricultural Land Act other than 3(1).***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n637.\n\nThe Claimants contend that where a decision registering a plot to the Respondent does not refer to a Spatial Certificate, or where a decision does not refer to the Agricultural Land Act by name, such a decision cannot establish that the plots in question were agricultural.739\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 420.\n\n638.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the Claimants\u2019 contention. Where a decision refers to *either* a Spatial Certificate or the Agricultural Land Act, that is sufficient to establish that the plots subject to the decision were found by the court in question to be agricultural.\n\n639.\n\nAs set out above, a Spatial Certificate is not required to transfer ownership. A Spatial Certificate was an administrative requirement for the registration of ownership. Given that the Claimants have not impugned the conduct of the Croatian courts in registering plots to the Respondent under the Agricultural Land Act, the Tribunal finds that those courts likely complied with the requirement set out in the Memorandum requiring such a certificate to which Dr Ernst referred.\n\n640.\n\nIn relation to plots where a Spatial Certificate is referred to in a decision, but the Agricultural Land Act itself is not, the Tribunal finds that the reference to the Spatial Certificate is sufficient to establish that the registration took place in accordance with the Agricultural Land Act. The Claimants have proffered no reason that a decision would refer to a Spatial Certificate in other circumstances.\n\n641.\n\nIn relation to plots where the decision refers to a provision of the Agricultural Land Act other than Article 3(1), the Tribunal finds that an error in reference does not render the decision somehow unreliable as proof that the registration took place due to the fact that the plots in question were agricultural. A reference to the Agricultural Land Act, particularly coupled with a reference to a Spatial Certificate, is sufficient to establish that the registration took place due to the plots in question being agricultural. This finding relates to the plots set out at rows 1909-2093 of Annexure 2.\n\n642.\n\nIn cases where a decision refers to neither the Agricultural Land Act, or a Spatial Certificate, the Respondent\u2019s contention that such plots constitute agricultural land simply stands as assertion. In those cases the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence that such plots constitute agricultural land. This finding relates to the plots set out at rows 2348-2349 of Annexure 2.\n\n***h. Decision Refers to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n643.\n\nIn various decisions provided by the Respondent, the decision states that the plots subject to the decision have been registered to the Respondent in accordance with the Agricultural Land Act, but also on the basis of Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act. The Claimants contend that without the actual Spatial Certificate being available in evidence, it is not possible to discern from the decision which of the plots were registered pursuant to the Agricultural Land Act and which were registered pursuant to the Ownership Act, and therefore, the Respondent has failed to establish that the plots were in fact registered in accordance with the Agricultural Land Act.740\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 420.\n\n644.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has sympathy for the Claimants\u2019 position, the evidentiary lacuna here is the Claimants'. The Respondent has provided the decision registering the plots, purportedly due to the operation of the Agricultural Land Act. In such circumstances it is for the Claimants to establish that the plots are not agricultural. This finding relates to the plots set out at rows 2094-2296 of Annexure 2.\n\n***i. Plot was Valued as Construction Land by the Parties\u2019 Experts***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n645.\n\nThe Claimants contend that where a plot has been valued by the Parties\u2019 respective valuation experts as construction land, it should not be considered agricultural.741\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 416.\n\n646.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Claimants\u2019 argument. The material prepared by the valuation experts was prepared, in the case of Ing Ekspert\u2019s earlier valuations, in 2002, and in the case of PWC\u2019s valuations in 2014. The relevant question here is the status of the plots in question in 1991 at the time of the enactment of the Agricultural Land Act.\n\n647.\n\nIn any event, the evidence prepared by the valuation experts was prepared for a very different purpose, namely to quantify loss, not to establish whether in 1991 a plot fell within the definition of agricultural land found in the Agricultural Land Act. The Claimants recognise this limitation, albeit in a partisan way, where they state that\n\n*the fact that Ing ekspert* [\u2026] [has] *labelled a plot as \"Agricultural Plot\" does not automatically mean that this plot is an agricultural plot as defined in Article 2(1)* [of the] *Act on Agricultural Land. While Ing ekspert has assessed the de facto situation relevant for the valuation of the Properties, the test under Article 2(1) Act on Agricultural Land is* [a] *legal and more narrow one*.742\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 417.\n\n648.\n\nThe unreliability of using the valuation experts\u2019 evidence for this purpose is further highlighted by the fact that in relation to the plots set out in rows 15-29 of Annexure 2, those plots have been referred to as \"construction land\" by the valuation experts, whilst also being conceded by Dr Ernst as \"agricultural land.\"\n\n649.\n\nThis finding relates to the plots set out at rows 2297-2339 of Annexure 2.\n\n***j. Plot Description Not Agricultural or the Claimants Have Established Construction on the Plot Prior to 24 July 1991***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n650.\n\nThe Claimants contend that in circumstances where the plot in question is described in the Land Registry as not agricultural in nature, or where the Claimants have provided evidence of construction on a plot prior to the enactment of the Agricultural Land Act, such a plot is not agricultural within the meaning of that Act.743\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 420 and notes in List 1.\n\n651.\n\nIn keeping with the Tribunal\u2019s finding in relation to the interpretation of the Agricultural Land Act as set above, the Tribunal accepts this argument. As found above, a plot cannot be agricultural where there is pre-existing construction on the plot. In cases where the Land Registry describes a plot as being a \"House with yard\", this description on the Tribunal\u2019s finding excludes such a plot from the operation of Article 3(1) of the Agricultural Land Act. Equally, where the Claimants have established that pre-existing construction exists on a certain plot, such a plot cannot constitute agricultural land. On review of the evidence, the Tribunal is satisfied that in cases where the Claimants have alleged that a property description in the Land Registry, or actual construction on the plots in question excludes those plots from the operation of the Agricultural Land Act, they are correct with the exception of the plot listed at row 2517 of Annexure 2. This finding relates to the plots listed at rows 2514-2516, and 2555 of Annexure 2. In relation to the plot listed at row 2517, while the Claimants have, by List 1, asserted that this plot had pre-existing construction, the evidence relied on, being a construction permit makes no reference to this plot.744 This plot is further addressed at paragraphs 656-659 below.\n\nSupplement to construction permit dated 13 April 1982 (C-0474).\n\n***k. Decision No Z-1367/12***\n------------------------------\n\n652.\n\nThe plots, which form part of Property 59, set out at rows 2519-2554 of Annexure 2 were registered by the Respondent pursuant Decision No Z-1367/12 of the Gospic Municipal Court.745\n\nDecision No Z-1367/12, Municipal Court Gospic, 29 August 2012 (R-0273).\n\n653.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Decision does not appear to be a decision registering the applicable plots in accordance with the Agricultural Land Act as asserted by the Respondent, but instead on some other basis. The Claimants identify that the Decision does not refer to the Agricultural Land Act, and instead of referring to a Spatial Certificate, refers to a Certificate by the Agency for Management of State Property, which the Claimants contend is only relevant to an application under Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act.746\n\n*See* the Claimants\u2019 notes in List 1.\n\n654.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 submission. A review of the Decision reveals no reference to the Agricultural Land Act, and no reference to a Spatial Certificate. In such circumstances the Tribunal is unable to discern the basis for the registration granted in accordance with the Decision, and the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Decision was made in accordance with the Agricultural Land Act simply stands as assertion.\n\n655.\n\nFor these plots the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not proved registration in accordance with the Agricultural Land Act, and therefore finds that there was no impediment to ownership of those plots at the time of the Purchase Agreement.\n\n***l. Decision No Z-229/06***\n-----------------------------\n\n656.\n\nThe plots, which form part of Properties 72 and 73, listed at rows 2517 and 2518 of Annexure 2 were registered to the Respondent in Decision No Z-229/06 of the Gvozd Municipal Court.747\n\nDecision No Z-229/06, Municipal Court Gvozd, 18 May 2006 (R-0133(*bis*)).\n\n657.\n\nThe initial Decision was made in 2006; in 2016 a Supplemental Decision was made adding the two plots in question to the original Decision stating as a reason that \"these were inadvertently omitted in the writing of this court\u2019s Ruling [. ].\"748\n\nDecision No Z-229/06, Municipal Court Gvozd, 18 May 2006 (R-0133(*bis*)), p 8.\n\n658.\n\nThe Claimants contend that this raises a suspicion that the supplemental decision was \"rendered 'by order' to provide a justification in this arbitration for entry of state ownership over those plots - ten years after the event.\"749\n\n*See* the Claimants\u2019 notes in List 1.\n\n659.\n\nIt is unclear what the Claimants are in fact alleging by this submission. The Claimants have throughout this proceeding specifically disclaimed any allegation of *male fides* on the part of Croatian courts; in such circumstances, the Tribunal finds that there is no basis to impeach the Court\u2019s decision to amend its judgment, notwithstanding the passing of time. Given there is no other basis proffered by the Claimants as to why these plots do not constitute agricultural land, the Tribunal finds that they do. These plots have been marked green in Annexure 1 to reflect this decision.\n\n***m. Combination of factors***\n-------------------------------\n\n660.\n\nThe remaining plots as set out in Annexure 2 are subject to the arguments put forth above in various combinations. The Tribunal finds that these remaining plots constitute agricultural land for the reasons as set out above.\n\n**(20) Were the Plots Underlying the Properties Subject to a Right of Use by Holding d.o.o.?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n661.\n\nHaving determined which Properties the Claimants have established would pass to the Five Companies by operation of the Resolution, and having established which of the plots underlying those Properties were incapable of being owned by Holding d.o.o. at the time of the Resolution, the Tribunal now turns to the final question: Have the Claimants established that Holding d.o.o. was in fact the holder of the relevant rights at the time of the Resolution?\n\n662.\n\nPrior to analysing the evidence, there are several preliminary issues which must be addressed.\n\n***a. Ownership in Croatia***\n-----------------------------\n\n663.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that during the socialist era in Yugoslavia, private ownership over real assets was not possible. All real property belonged to society as a whole.\n\n664.\n\nWhat did exist were quasi-ownership rights, which in the case of real property, were rights of use, administration and disposition.\n\n665.\n\nThese quasi-ownership rights were able to be dealt with as between socialist era companies, and were recorded in the Land Registry and Cadastre.\n\n666.\n\nDuring the transformation from socialism to private ownership, the rights of use, administration and disposition were converted into rights of ownership.\n\n667.\n\nIn relation to the Five Companies, there are two possible times at which this could have occurred.\n\n668.\n\nAccording to Dr Ernst, the transformation of socially-owned companies, such as the Six Socialist Companies, into private ownership involved the transformation of both the entity into a company with a known owner, and the transformation of its quasiproperty rights into ownership.750 In this case, the transformation of the Five Companies occurred through their bankruptcy and sale to the Second Claimant.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 31.\n\n669.\n\nIn 1997, the Ownership Act commenced, which relevantly states at Article 360:\n\n*(1) The right of management i.e. use and disposition of items in social ownership became with the transformation of the holder of that right - the right of ownership of the person who through the transformation became a general legal successor of the former holder of the management right i.e. of the use and disposal of the item, if the item is capable to be the object of the property right; except if stipulated otherwise by a special law.*\n\n[...]\n\n*(3) The provisions of paragraph* [ ] *1* [...] [is] *appropriately applied to all the real rights.*\n\n*(4) The entries of the right to management i.e. use and disposal in the land books and in other public registers carried out by the day this Law went into effect, will be regarded as entries of ownership rights*.751\n\nOwnership Act (CL-0010 / RL-0044), Art 360.\n\n670.\n\nAccording to Dr Ernst, there is debate amongst legal scholars as to whether it was this provision of the Ownership Act which converted rights of use into ownership, or whether it was the act of transformation itself.752 For the purposes of this Award, the distinction is immaterial. Quasi-ownership rights either became ownership rights at the time of transformation, or were deemed to have done so by the operation of the Ownership Act.\n\nErnst Report, fn 83.\n\n***b. Titulus and Modus***\n--------------------------\n\n671.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Tribunal will address the issue of *titulus* and *modus* as raised by the Respondent.\n\n672.\n\nBy its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent made the submission that in order to transfer the right of administration, use and disposition of property as between various entities, two steps were required.753 As opined by Prof Klaric and Judge Matusko:\n\n*When an enterprise acquired the right of administration, use, and disposition of property on the basis of a legal transaction, that legal transaction was the legal ground for acquiring those rights (titulus), and the registration of those rights in the land register (modus) was the means by which the right of administration, use and disposition was acquired*.754\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 35.\n\nKlaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6 7; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 465.\n\n673.\n\nOn the Respondent\u2019s submission, a failure to register with the land register resulted in an \"imperfect form of social ownership.\"755\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 36.\n\n674.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimants contend that in the case of universal succession, these two steps are not required, and instead, the assets of one entity are transferred *en bloc* at a single moment in time *ex lege*.756 This submission is supported by the opinion of Prof Dr Boric.757\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 457.\n\nBoric Report, \u00b6 30.\n\n675.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position on this apparent dispute is unclear. As submitted by the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s submissions during the Hearing seemed to contradict the views of Prof Klaric and Judge Matusko.758 The Respondent does not appear to address this contradiction, as raised by the Claimants, in its Reply Post-Hearing Brief.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 538.\n\n676.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal prefers the evidence of Prof Dr Boric on this matter, and finds that in the case of a universal succession, there is no further requirement for registration so as to \"perfect\" title. As discussed above, a universal succession involves a mass transfer of assets from one entity to another, a further requirement that those assets require registration so as to establish ownership runs counter to the efficiency created by a universal succession. If registration is a requisite component of the transfer of property through a universal succession, there is little to distinguish it from a singular succession.\n\n677.\n\nA failure to register may have other repercussions, particularly *vis-a-vis* third parties relying on the Land Register. Further, a failure to register may prove problematic for a party asserting ownership on an evidentiary level; however, in the finding of the Tribunal, ownership is transferred at the time of succession.\n\n678.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal notes, although not referred to by either Party, that in Decision No 514-03-06/10-06-2,759 an appeal decision of the Ministry of Justice, the Civil Law Department, states:\n\n*It should also be noted that according to the court case law of the time for validity of a contract on the purchase of real estate or a contract on the transfer of the right to use, it was not required that a concluded contract be perfect for registering such a transfer in land registry. For such a contract to be valid it sufficed that the subject of sale and price were defined as essential contract elements.

The Work of Mr Barisic***\n-------------------------------\n\n679.\n\nAs stated above, it was the work of Mr Barisic, a geodetic engineer, which formed the basis of identifying the Properties and plots which are the subject matter of the Claimants\u2019 claim.\n\n680.\n\nMr Barisic was engaged by the Second Claimant in 2006 to catalogue and organise the Second Claimant\u2019s properties.761 He does not claim to have any legal training, and based his work on instructions from employees of the Second Claimant, who informed him that the First Claimant had bought the Five Companies, and that they were indirect successors to Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo, Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture spo, Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce spo, and Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade spo.762\n\nBarisic Statement, \u00b6 6.\n\nBarisic Statement, \u00b6 8.\n\n681.\n\nMr Barisic created a database of the putative properties of the Second Claimant for use in its negotiations with the Respondent.763\n\nBarisic Statement, \u00b6 11.\n\n682.\n\nThe sources of information which Mr Barisic used to construct this database were:\n\n(a) the Record;\n\n(b) the Asset List;\n\n(c) various archived documents held by the Second Claimant (**Archived Documents**);\n\n(d) information from employees from the Second Claimant;\n\n(e) the Land Registry; and\n\n(f) cadastral data (**Cadastre**).764\n\nBarisic Statement, \u00b6 15.\n\n683.\n\nUsing his expertise, Mr Barisic collated the data he gathered, associated the information with physical addresses, and then entered that information in a database. The fruits of that work are attached at Annex II to the Claimants\u2019 Reply, and also as List 1 (provided pursuant to PO 5).\n\n684.\n\nThe Land Registry records ownership and rights of use, while the Cadastre records possession.765 According to Mr Barisic, the two registers, both maintained by the State, should be consistent, but in many cases are not.\n\nBarisic Statement, \u00b6 30.\n\n685.\n\nAccording to Mr Barisic, the Land Registry is frequently inaccurate and out of date.766 This accords with the evidence of Mr Rospaher who indicated that had the Division Balance Sheet activity gone ahead, they would not even have used the Land Registry as the basis.\n\nBarisic Statement, \u00b6 33.\n\n686.\n\nMr Barisic concedes that the Land Registry takes precedence over the Cadastre, but gives evidence that the Cadastre is often more reliable. Mr Barisic gave specific examples of situations where the Land Registry is clearly inaccurate, such as in the case of the boundaries of the Gavrilovi\u0107 factory.767\n\nBarisic Statement, \u00b6 44.\n\n687.\n\nThe Archived Documents used by Mr Barisic range from internal telephone directories of the former Gavrilovi\u0107 entities, lists of shops, and various internal documents relating to former Gavrilovi\u0107 entities\u2019 activities purportedly occurring at the Properties.768\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Reply, Annex II for the types of documents used by Mr Barisic.\n\n688.\n\nWhat is immediately clear is that the task of Mr Barisic in collating the information provided to him, and the role of the Tribunal in determining ownership are entirely different. While Mr Barisic\u2019s task was to identify the Second Claimant\u2019s property, the role of the Tribunal is to evaluate the evidence provided by the Claimants as to ownership.\n\n689.\n\nIt is clear that while documents such as the Record, the Asset List and various other internal lists of the Gavrilovi\u0107 entities769 were legitimate starting points for Mr Barisic\u2019s task, they cannot constitute proof of the asset situation of Holding d.o.o. at the time of the Resolution.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Reply, Annex II, in particular the Shops List and Land Plot List, referred to as \"Source of Location.\"\n\n690.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s findings above in relation to universal succession, the lack of a requirement for registration, and the Respondent\u2019s concession in relation to universal succession terminating with Holding d.o.o., the Tribunal is satisfied that where a corporate predecessor to Holding d.o.o. has appeared in the Land Registry, the plot in question ultimately became the property of Holding d.o.o. and passed by universal succession by the Resolution.\n\n691.\n\nWhere the Claimants have not provided Land Registry information, but have instead provided cadastral records, the Tribunal finds that such records serve as good evidence of Holding d.o.o.\u2019s right of use in the absence of any countervailing evidence from the Respondent.\n\n692.\n\nIn all other cases the Tribunal has examined the evidence referred to by the Claimants in Annex II to their Reply and has come to a determination on a case by case basis.\n\n693.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s findings at paragraphs 458 to 584 *supra*, there are 333 plots remaining. These plots have been extracted by the Tribunal as Annexure 3 to this Award.\n\n***d. Land Registry***\n----------------------\n\n694.\n\nIn Annexure 3, the plots highlighted in yellow have been registered in the Land Registry in the name of a predecessor of Holding d.o.o. The Tribunal finds that these plots formed part of the property of Holding d.o.o. at the time of the Resolution, and were conveyed to the Five Companies. These plots are also highlighted in blue in Annexure 1 so as to signify that the Tribunal has found that in relation to these plots, the Claimants have established title.\n\n695.\n\nIn analysing the Land Registry entries, the Tribunal notes that there is often variation in the way in which predecessors to Holding d.o.o. are described. As explained by Ms Gulam, the Land Registry does not contain full names of Gavrilovi\u0107 entities.770 In most cases, the link to a predecessor is obvious, such as where Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry or some variation thereof is listed. In analysing the Land Registry entries, the Tribunal further notes that in some cases there are transcription errors as between the handwritten version of documents, the typed version, and the Lists. In the case of obvious errors, the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the documents relied on by the Claimants establish ownership by a predecessor of Holding d.o.o.\n\nSecond Gulam Statement, \u00b6 21.\n\n696.\n\nMs Gulam confirms that Zvijezda is also a predecessor of Holding d.o.o., which is evidenced by Zagreb Commercial Court Confirmation No R3-5130/03.771 The Tribunal accepts that evidence.\n\nConfirmation of the Commercial Court in Zagreb, File No R3-5130/03, 3 July 2003 (C-0267).\n\n697.\n\nIn some cases the Land Registry entry is generic, and excludes \"Gavrilovi\u0107\" entirely, for instance, listing \"Trading Company 'Promet' Petrinja\" as the registered user. In such cases the Tribunal cannot rely on the Land Registry alone to establish ownership. Those cases are analysed below.\n\n***e. Cadastre***\n-----------------\n\n698.\n\nIn Annexure 3, the plots highlighted in green have been registered in the Cadastre with possession being attributed to a predecessor of Holding d.o.o. As set out above, the Tribunal finds that the Cadastre constitutes good evidence of ownership in the absence of any countervailing evidence. These plots are also highlighted blue in Annexure 1 so as to signify that the Tribunal has found that in relation to these plots, the Claimants have established title.\n\n***f. Others***\n---------------\n\n\u2022 Property 2 - Annexure 3, Line 2\n---------------------------------\n\n699.\n\nThe Claimants have presented the following pieces of evidence to establish their right to part ownership of the single plot772 associated with Property 2, and the shop itself:\n\n(a) a decision by City of Zagreb, Secretariat for Economy, Agricultural, Veterinary and Forestry Inspections (**Property 2 Decision**);773 and\n\n(b) a contract for waste collection entered into by RO Gavrilovi\u0107 Retail in relation to Property 2 (**Property 2 Contract**).774\n\nAnnexure 3, row 2.\n\nDecision, City of Zagreb, Secretariat for Economy, Agricultural, Veterinary and Forestry Inspections dated 27 April 1977 (C-0306).\n\nContract 150/83 on Bulky and Industrial Waste Collection between KRO \"Cistoca\" Zagreb and RO \"Gavrilovi\u0107\" Retail dated 1 July 1983 (C-0307).\n\n700.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that on the evidence presented, the Claimants have established that a predecessor of Holding d.o.o did have a right to the use Property 2.\n\n701.\n\nThe Property 2 Decision, made in 1977 by the City of Zagreb, obligates \"Meat Industry Gavrilovi\u0107\" to make repairs to \"in its store No 21 Zagreb, Ilica 231.\"775 This is an obligation which a predecessor of Holding d.o.o would clearly not have had if it was not entitled to use the property. This is further reinforced by the Property 2 Contract where \"Gavrilovi\u0107 Retail\" engaged KRO \"Cistoca\" Zagreb to perform waste collection for the same premises in 1983.

In such circumstances, the Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence that the Claimants have established the right of use of Property 13 by a predecessor of Holding d.o.o.\n\n731.\n\nThe relevant plots have been highlighted blue in Annexure 3 and Annexure 1 so as to indicate the Tribunal\u2019s finding.\n\n\u2022 Property 16 - Annexure 3, Line 24\n-----------------------------------\n\n732.\n\nThe Land Registry entry for the plots underlying Property 16 lists the holder of the right of use as being \"Trading company 'Promet' Petrinja.\" Property 16 is a retail property.

There is no clear link in the evidence provided to a right of use by a Gavrilovi\u0107 predecessor in relation to these plots.

The relevant plot has been highlighted in blue in Annexure 3 and Annexure 1 so as to indicate the Tribunal\u2019s finding.\n\n(**21)Conclusion on Title**\n---------------------------\n\n757.\n\nOn the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s findings above, the Tribunal concludes that the Second Claimant is the owner of those plots marked blue in Annexure 1.\n\n758.\n\nDuring the course of the proceeding, an issue was raised as to whether there are any third parties who may have an interest in the plots claimed by the Claimants (Issue 4.3). As set out by the Claimants, the Respondent has raised this issue in two respects:\n\n(a) potential ownership by Holding d.o.o. due to a lack of universal succession; and\n\n(b) third parties registered as co-owners on plots.803\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 596-601.\n\n759.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s findings on universal succession are as set out at paragraphs 479 *et seq. supra*. Where there are third party co-owners of plots, which arises particularly in relation to shared buildings situated on a single plot, the Claimants specifically state that they make no claim to ownership of the plot in excess of the particular part of the plot\u2014for instance, an individual shop within a building, which corresponds to the Property in question.804 In such circumstances there are no relevant third party interests in the assets which the Tribunal have determined are owned by the Second Claimant.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 600.\n\n**ISSUE 4.7: ARE THE ACTIONS OF THE FOLLOWING PERSONS OR ENTITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RESPONDENT?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n760.\n\nThe Claimants seek to attribute to the Respondent the actions of the Liquidator, the Bankruptcy Council, the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy Judge, the Croatian Privatisation Fund, Holding d.o.o. and the Five Companies.\n\n761.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it is impermissible for the Claimants to point to a State organ and contend that the State is responsible for its conduct \"no matter what.\"805 That is, the rules of attribution are not for the purpose of establishing any type of conduct and representations. Rather, the rules of attribution are for the purposes of establishing conduct that is wrongful.806\n\nTr Day 10, 2414:8-13.\n\nTr Day 10, 2413:19-2414:16.\n\n762.\n\nIn this vein, at the Second Hearing Arbitrator Alexandrov queried why attribution is relevant where the Claimants are not complaining of the actions of the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy Council, the Liquidator or the Croatian Fund.807 The Claimants explained that attribution is important \"for certain jurisdictional reasons\" and for breach of the FET standard through violation of a legitimate expectation.808 That is, their point with respect to attribution is not necessarily for the purposes of international responsibility, but who can make representations on behalf of the State.809 The Respondent contends that this is not what the rules of attribution allow.810\n\nTr Day 10, 2411:13-2412:9.\n\nTr Day 10, 2412:10-2413:5.\n\nTr Day 10, 2413:2-17.\n\nTr Day 10, 2414:17-22.\n\n763.\n\nAttribution is concerned with the responsibility of a State for the wrongful acts of its organs and officers. The principles of attribution operate in the context of a complaint made against the State by a third party. This section is not concerned with broader questions of what constitutes the State. For example, Croatia argues that the decision to place the Five Companies into bankruptcy, the sale of the Five Companies as legal entities, and other aspects of the bankruptcy process were in violation of the host State\u2019s bankruptcy law. The involvement of the host State in this process\u2014for example, through the Bankruptcy Court\u2014is not a matter of attribution because there is no third party seeking to hold the State liable. Rather, it is the State itself seeking to challenge the validity of a transaction approved of or ordered by its own court.\n\n764.\n\nThe analysis that follows is concerned with whether the conduct of each of the relevant actors may *prima facie* be attributable to the Respondent, in the above-mentioned strict sense of attribution. The observations below are qualified by the conclusions in subsequent sections as to whether the conduct of each actor is attributable on the facts.

The Claimants contend that to determine whether the actions of a bankruptcy trustee (in this case, the Liquidator) can be attributed to the State, tribunals look to the role of the trustee under domestic law and consider: (i) the degree of independence of the trustee; (ii) the involvement of the courts in the process; and (iii) the rules on liability for damages.818\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 683, *citing* *Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award, 23 April 2012 (***Oostergetel v Slovakia***) (RL-0081), \u00b6\u00b6 157-158.\n\n768.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, under the Bankruptcy Act, \"virtually every decision\" in bankruptcy made by a bankruptcy judge is binding on a liquidator (which the Act refers to as the trustee), and every action or decision of a liquidator is under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge.819 Further, the bankruptcy council, comprised of three additional judges, is mandated to approve the decisions of a bankruptcy liquidator and a bankruptcy judge.820 In this case, the Bankruptcy Judge or the Bankruptcy Council made nearly every decision regarding the sale to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, including: the decision to sell the Five Companies as legal entities;821 the decision to wait for another month to see if another bidder would appear;822 the decision to accept Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s bid;823 instructing the Liquidator to conclude the Purchase Agreement on the basis of the Bankruptcy Judge\u2019s and the Bankruptcy Council\u2019s decisions;824 the approval of the Purchase Agreement;825 the decision that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 should make payment to Inacomm;826 confirmation to Bankhaus Feichtner in relation to the payment to Inacomm;827 and instructing the Liquidator to draft a list of the assets of the Five Companies.828 Approval of the Purchase Agreement and sale also came from the Croatian Foreign Ministry.829 The Claimants also say that the Croatian Government confirmed that the Liquidator acted under clear instruction and with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court.830\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 684; Bankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 56(2)-56(3). *See also* N.

In *Plama v Bulgaria*, the tribunal concluded that \"syndics in bankruptcy proceedings [...] are not instruments or organs of the State for whose acts the State is responsibl e.\"840 In *Oostergetel v Slovakia*, the tribunal was \"satisfied that under Slovak law [\u2026] bankruptcy trustees are not State organs for whose acts the State is responsible according to Article 4 of the ILC Articles.\"841 The tribunal articulated its view about the nature of bankruptcy trustees as follows:\n\n[T]*he Tribunal is persuaded that the acts of* [\u2026] *bankruptcy trustees cannot be said to be carried out in the exercise of governmental authority, nor on the instructions, or under the direction or control of the State. It is clear from* [the Bankruptcy Act] *that* [\u2026] *trustees are independent from the State in the performance of their functions. The involvement of the competent court is essentially limited to matters of appointment, determination of fees, and removal in exceptional circumstances. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the role of the competent court vis-a-vis the* [bankruptcy trustees] *does not constitute a sufficient basis for the attribution of the trustees\u2019 own acts to the State under international law*.842\n\n*Plama v Bulgaria* (RL-0090), \u00b6 253.\n\n*Oostergetel v Slovakia* (RL-0081), \u00b6 155.\n\n*Oostergetel v Slovakia* (RL-0081), \u00b6 157.\n\n774.\n\nThe Respondent also cites *Kotov v Russia*, in which the European Court of Human Rights held that bankruptcy trustees in Russia do not exercise elements of governmental authority and do not act under the direction or control of the State.843 This was because: (i) bankruptcy trustees are private individuals who work for a fee;844 (ii) the court confirms the appointment of trustees;845 (iii) the control of the judiciary over the acts of trustees is limited: it is mostly limited to compliance with the bankruptcy legislation, and does not extend to giving trustees instructions on how to manage the bankrupt company;846 and (iv) trustees are empowered to manage the property of the bankrupt company, but have no coercive power in respect of third parties.847 The Grand Chamber concluded:\n\n*It would appear that the liquidator, at the relevant time, enjoyed a considerable amount of operational and institutional independence, as State authorities did not have the power to give instructions to him and therefore could not directly interfere with the liquidation process as such. The State\u2019s involvement in the liquidation procedure resulted only from its role in establishing the legislative framework for such procedures, in defining the functions and the powers of the creditors\u2019 body and of the liquidator, and in overseeing observance of the rules. It follows that the liquidator did not act as a State agent. Consequently, the respondent State cannot be held directly responsible for his wrongful acts in the present case. The fact that a court was entitled to review the lawfulness of the liquidator\u2019s actions does not alter this analysis*.848\n\n*Kotov v Russia*, ECHR [GC], Appl No 54522/00, Judgment, 3 April 2012 (***Kotov v Russia***) (RL-0220).\n\n*Kotov v Russia* (RL-0220), \u00b6 100.\n\n*Kotov v Russia* (RL-0220), \u00b6 101.\n\n*Kotov v Russia* (RL-0220), \u00b6 102.\n\n*Kotov v Russia* (RL-0220), \u00b6 105.\n\n*Kotov v Russia* (RL-0220), \u00b6 107.\n\n775.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the role of bankruptcy trustees in Croatia is no different, proffering four reasons in support.849 First, bankruptcy trustees are private individuals who work for a fee.850 Second, the role of the Bankruptcy Council is to appoint and replace trustees.851 Third, the Croatian judiciary\u2019s control over the acts of trustees is primarily limited to compliance with bankruptcy legislation.852 Except for this, the trustee has the power to manage the bankruptcy company.853 Fourth, trustees manage the property of the bankrupt company but have no coercive powers in respect of third parties.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 868.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 868, *citing* Bankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 64 (\"The bankruptcy trustee has the right to remuneration for his work.\") and Art 55(6).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 868, *citing* Bankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 55(7).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 868, *citing* Bankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 55 *in fine* (the Bankruptcy Council \"may [\u2026] amend decisions by [\u2026] the bankruptcy trustee, if it establishes that they are unlawful or not purposeful.\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 868, *citing* Bankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 60 (\"The bankruptcy trustee manages the work of the debtor and represents the debtor.\").\n\n776.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Act also provides that the bankruptcy judge \"oversees the work of the bankruptcy trustee\" and can issue \"binding\" instructions to the trustee.854 But the very next provision shows that these instructions are only *prima facie* binding: the trustee has the power to file an objection with the bankruptcy council against a decision by the bankruptcy judge.855 According to the Respondent, a bankruptcy trustee has the power to take all decisions to manage the bankrupt company and even to override any instructions from the bankruptcy judge. In turn, the bankruptcy council will only control the legality of the acts of the trustee, not their merits.856\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 869, *citing* Bankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 56.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 868, *citing* Bankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 57.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 869.\n\n777.\n\nThe Respondent argues that bankruptcy trustees in Croatia enjoy ample discretion in managing the affairs and operations of bankruptcy debtors.857 In practice, it was the Liquidator \"who took every relevant decision after the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings\", including: the crucial decision to sell the Five Companies together as legal entities; organisation of the logistics of the sale, including the decision to publish the notice of sale in a daily newspaper; and setting the specific terms of the Purchase Agreement, together with Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.858 In these decisions, the Liquidator was exercising his power under the Bankruptcy Act to \"discharge\" all the \"rights and duties of the management body of the debtor in line with the needs of the bankruptcy proceedings.\"859 The Bankruptcy Council and the Bankruptcy Judge \"at best passively approved these decisions.\"860\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 651.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 870.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 870, *citing* Bankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 60.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 870.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n778.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the actions of Mr Boras, the Liquidator, are attributable to the Respondent on the basis that (i) he was under the direction or control of the State, within the meaning of ILC Article 8, and (ii) he was a public official.\n\n779.\n\nThe ILC Articles are the relevant rules on attribution that are widely considered to reflect international law.861 They concern the responsibility of States for their internationally wrongful acts, given the existence of a primary rule establishing an obligation.862 These principles of attribution do not operate to attach responsibility for \"non-wrongful acts\" for which the State is assumed to have knowledge.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Jan de Nul N.V., Dredging International N.V. v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008 *(**Jan de Nul v Egypt**)* (CL-0033), \u00b6 156; *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.\u00a7. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009 (***Bayindir v Pakistan***) (CL-0034), fn 19.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, ILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), General Commentary, p 1.\n\n780.\n\nFor reasons that follow, the Tribunal has found that:\n\n(a) The Respondent is not a party to, or otherwise bound by, the Purchase Agreement.\n\n(b) There were no relevant contractual rights capable of expropriation as set out in the Purchase Agreement, the Asset List or the Record.\n\n(c) There was no violation of a legitimate expectation by the Respondent.\n\n(d) The Respondent did not breach the FET standard.\n\n781.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal has found that there was no act or omission, including of the Liquidator, that triggers the responsibility of Croatia under international law. Accordingly, the principles of attribution do not operate, and it is therefore not necessary to decide whether the Liquidator\u2019s conduct could be attributable to Croatia.\n\n***Issues 4.7(b), 4.7(c), 4.7(d): Are the actions of the Bankruptcy Council, the Bankruptcy Court, and the Bankruptcy Judge attributable to the Respondent?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n782.\n\nWith good reason, the Parties\u2019 submissions as to attribution do not distinguish between the Bankruptcy Council, the Bankruptcy Court and the Bankruptcy Judge. The Tribunal also considers it appropriate to consider the attribution of these three actors together.\n\n783.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Court is the District (or Regional) Court of Zagreb that presided over the bankruptcy proceedings. The Bankruptcy Council was composed of judges of the Bankruptcy Court, and the Bankruptcy Council issued decisions as the Bankruptcy Court.\n\n784.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Council consists of three judges: Judge Branimir Majanovic, the Chairman, Judge Tomo Glozinic and Judge Lidija Tomljenovic.\n\n785.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Judge, Judge Tuk\u0161a, is another judge of the Bankruptcy Court, whom also issued decisions under the auspices of the Bankruptcy Court.863\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Ruling of Zagreb County Commercial Court confirming payment to Inacomm International S.A. dated 3 March 1992 (R-0032); Confirmation of the Bankruptcy Court dated 3 March 1992 (C-0266).\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n786.\n\nThe Claimants submit that it is widely accepted that the acts of a State\u2019s judiciary are attributable to that State.864 International law, in particular Article 4 of the ILC Articles, further supports this principle. This is true, even if a judicial organ exceeds its competence under internal law or acts contrary to internal law.865\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 697, *citing* *Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, and Ellen Baca v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999 (***Azinian v Mexico***) (CL-0077), \u00b6 98: \"Although independent of the Government, the judiciary is not independent of the State: the judgment given by a judicial authority emanates from an organ of the State in just the same way as a law promulgated by the legislature or a decision taken by the executive\" (emphasis added by the Claimants); *Waguih Eli George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/15, Award, 1 June 2009) (***Siag v Egypt***) (CL-0060), \u00b6 195: \"the non-wrongful acts of Egypt\u2019s judiciary are the acts of the Egyptian State\"; *Sistem M\u00fchendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.\u00a7. v Kyrgyz Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/06/1, Award, 9 September 2009 (CL-0174), \u00b6\u00b6 117-118 (finding that the district court\u2019s decision to abrogate the claimant\u2019s property rights was tantamount to expropriation of property by the State); *RosInvestCo v Russia* (CL-0175), \u00b6 603: \"The courts are also organs of the Russian state\"; *Swisslion DOO Skopje v Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia*, ICSID Case No ARB/09/16, Award, 6 July 2012 (***Swisslion v Macedonia***) (CL-0039), \u00b6 261: \"under customary international law, every wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State.

It must have acted in its official capacity as an organ, however* [\u2026] *Acts which an organ commits in a purely private capacity, even if it has used the means placed at its disposal by the State for the exercise of its function, are not attributable to the State*.875\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 349.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 653, *citing Kenneth P.

Given the \"overwhelming facts on the record illustrating corruption\", and absent proof to the contrary by the Claimants, the bankruptcy illegalities are not an *ultra vires* act for which the State is responsible, but private conduct carried out for personal gain for which the Respondent\u2019s responsibility does not attach.876 The Respondent says of Judge Tuk\u0161a that he became the lawyer of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and his family after acting as the bankruptcy judge.877\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 653.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 131, *citing* Decision No P-11/94-19 of the Petrinja Municipal Court, 12 April 1995 (R-0037).\n\n793.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondent, it is uncontroversial that acts committed by a State official or organ in a private capacity, even if misusing State means, are not attributable to the State.878\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 350, *citing Yeager v Iran* (RL-0172), \u00b6 65; ILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), Commentary on Article 4(13), p 42 (with further references).\n\n794.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the rules of attribution under international law cannot be applied to create obligations for a State under a contract to which it is not party.

The Act confers a range of functions on the Bankruptcy Council, including: deciding on the initiation of a procedure, and carrying out the procedure, for the establishment of conditions for bankruptcy; deciding on the opening of the bankruptcy procedure; defining the tasks that need to be completed in the course of the bankruptcy procedure; and deciding on the appointment of the receiver (referred to in this case as the bankruptcy trustee or the liquidator).881 The Bankruptcy Council is also mandated to approve the decisions of the bankruptcy trustee and the bankruptcy judge.882 Here, the Bankruptcy Council issued decisions as the Bankruptcy Court; for example, the decision to sell the Five Companies as legal entities,883 and the decision to accept Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s bid.\n\nBankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 55.\n\nBankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 55.\n\n*See* September 1991 Bankruptcy Ruling (C-0035). *See also* November 1991 Bankruptcy Ruling (C-0042).\n\n797.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Act also provides for the appointment of a bankruptcy judge\u2014another member of the Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy judge is competent for all questions related to the conduct of the bankruptcy proceedings, if the Bankruptcy Act does not prescribe the competence of the bankruptcy council. The judge oversees the work of the trustee, and issues instructions to the trustee.884 The Bankruptcy Judge also issued decisions under the auspices of the Bankruptcy Court.885\n\nBankruptcy Act (CL-0017 / RL-0039), Art 56.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Ruling of Zagreb County Commercial Court confirming payment to Inacomm International S.A. dated 3 March 1992 (R-0032); Confirmation of the Bankruptcy Court dated 3 March 1992 (C-0266).\n\n798.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the ILC Articles provides, in relevant part:\n\n*The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions* [. ].886\n\nILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), Art 4(1).\n\n799.\n\nFurther, the Commentary to the ILC Articles explicates the breadth of the reference to a \"State organ\":\n\n*The reference to a \"State organ\" covers all the individual or collective entities which make up the organization of the State and act on its behalf. It includes an organ of any territorial governmental entity within the State on the same basis as the central governmental organs of that State* [\u2026] *It is not limited to the organs of the central government, to officials at a high level or to persons with responsibility for the external relations of the State. It extends to organs of government of whatever kind or classification, exercising whatever functions, and at whatever level in the hierarchy, including those at provincial or even local level. No distinction is made for this purpose between legislative, executive or judicial organs*.887\n\nJ. Crawford, *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), pp 94-95 (CL-0035).\n\n800.\n\nAgain, the Bankruptcy Council and the Bankruptcy Judge are members of a court of the State. Both issued decisions as the Bankruptcy Court.888 The judicial functions of both are prescribed by the Bankruptcy Act.\n\n*See* Issue 4.7(c) *supra*.\n\n801.\n\nThe conduct of an organ of the State in an apparently official capacity may be attributable to the State, even if the organ exceeded its competence under internal law or in breach of the rules governing its operations.889 The corollary of this is that acts that an organ commits in its purely private capacity are not attributable to the State, even if it has used the means placed at its disposal by the State for the exercise of its function.890\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, ILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), Commentary on Article 4, p 42, \u00b6 13.\n\n*See Yeager v Iran* (RL-0172).\n\n802.\n\nIn this case, there is no compelling evidence to support the proposition that the Bankruptcy Council or any member thereof was acting in a purely private capacity, nor for personal gain. This conclusion is unaffected by the Respondent\u2019s contention that the conduct of the Bankruptcy Judge is not attributable to the Respondent because of his corrupt behaviour, in particular his later work as the lawyer of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and his family. This contention, without more, does not suffice to reach a finding that the actions of the Bankruptcy Judge were corrupt. Moreover, the Respondent does not establish a link between the actions of the Bankruptcy Judge during the period in question, and the brief period that he subsequently worked for Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s sister. The Respondent does not point to any actions of the Bankruptcy Council that were undertaken or issued outside its official capacity as an organ of the State.\n\n803.\n\nIt follows from Article 4 of the ILC Articles that the actions of the Bankruptcy Judge and the Bankruptcy Council are, at first sight, attributable to the Respondent.\n\n804.\n\nThe ILC Articles concern the responsibility of States for their internationally wrongful acts, given the existence of a primary rule establishing an obligation.891 While the Claimants cite *Azinian v Mexico* in support of their broad proposition that acts of a State\u2019s judiciary are attributable to that State, it was there explained that responsibility of the State for acts of judicial authorities may result from three different types of judicial decision: (i) a decision clearly incompatible with a rule of international law; (ii) denial of justice; and (iii) in certain exceptional and well-defined circumstances, a judicial decision contrary to municipal law where it is shown that the court decision itself constitutes a violation of the treaty.892 The principles of attribution codified in the ILC Articles are secondary rules of international law that operate to attach responsibility for internationally wrongful acts, that is, breaches of primary rules of law, not for \"non-wrongful acts\" for which the State is assumed to have knowledge. As with the Liquidator, the Claimants do not establish any act or omission on the part of the Croatian judiciary that triggers the Respondent\u2019s international responsibility. It follows that the principles of attribution are not relevant.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, ILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), General Commentary, p 1.\n\n*Azinian v Mexico* (CL-0077), \u00b6 98.\n\n***Issue 4.7(e): Are the actions of the Croatian Fund (formerly the Croatian Agency) attributable to the Respondent?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n805.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the acts of the Croatian Fund are attributable to the Respondent pursuant to international law, citing Article 5 of the ILC Articles and *Noble Ventures v Romania.*\n\n806.\n\nIn *Noble Ventures v Romania*, the tribunal considered whether the acts of Romanian entities entrusted by domestic law to implement a privatisation program could be attributable to the State.893 The entities in *Noble Ventures* exercised the government\u2019s rights in State-owned companies, prepared the companies for privatisation and eventually sold shares in the companies.894 The government also appointed the companies\u2019 board members.895 Citing ILC Article 5, the tribunal found that the relevant privatisation law empowered the Romanian entities to exercise governmental authority and concluded:\n\n[The Romanian entities] *were entitled by law to represent the Respondent and did so in all of their actions as well as omissions. The acts allegedly in violation of the BIT are therefore attributable to the Respondent for the purposes of assessment under the BIT*.896\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 708.\n\n*Noble Ventures, Inc. v Romania*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/11, Award, 12 October 2005 (***Noble Ventures v Romania***) (CL-0082), \u00b6\u00b6 68 *et seq*.\n\n*Noble Ventures v Romania* (CL-0082), \u00b6 77.\n\n*Noble Ventures v Romania* (CL-0082), \u00b6 80.\n\n807.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, similar to the entities in *Noble Ventures*, the Respondent empowered the Croatian Fund to exercise governmental authority with regard to privatising Croatian public companies.897 In result, the Croatian Fund\u2019s actions in furthering its mandate, which include its control over Holding d.o.o., are attributable to the Respondent.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 712.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n808.\n\nThe Respondent does not directly address the attribution of the actions of the Croatian Fund. Less directly, the Respondent says that the Claimants resort to blaming others, including the board members of Holding d.o.o. appointed by the Croatian Fund, but that cannot undo any illegalities.898 The Respondent points out that the persons appointed by the Croatian Fund to the management board of Holding d.o.o. in 1991 were not State officials, and the Respondent asserts that the acts of private individuals do not implicate the Respondent.899 The Respondent also reiterates its submission that the Respondent is not a party to the Purchase Agreement.900\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 129.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 129, *citing* Tr Day 4, 696:16-22 (Testimony of Mr Miljenko Rospaher).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 510-512, 585.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n809.\n\nThe Respondent created the Croatian Agency in May 1990 to organise, supervise and assist in the privatisation process.901 The Croatian Agency was a \"specialised organisation of the Republic\" that was responsible to the Government, and its entire management was appointed by the Government.902 The rights, obligations and responsibilities of the Croatian Agency were prescribed by the Croatian Agency Act,903 and included issuing mandatory approvals for the transformation of social companies, organising and supervising the transformation of social companies, providing instructions for the implementation of the Law on the Transformation of Social Companies, and coordinating interests of all entities in Croatia related to foreign investment.904 The Croatian Fund took over the funds, rights and obligations of the Croatian Agency in December 1992.905 While the entity was variously known as the \"Croatian Agency\" and the \"Croatian Fund\" at the relevant times, there is no suggestion or indication that the functions of the entity varied so as to warrant separate consideration under the question of attribution. For consistency, the Tribunal will refer to both as the Croatian Fund.\n\nCroatian Agency Act (CL-0014), Art 3 (\"The activity of the Agency is the performance of professional and other work with regard to the transformation of social companies, privatisation of companies, as well as promotion of foreign investment and development of the economy of the Republic of Croatia.\").\n\nCroatian Agency Act (CL-0014), Arts 4, 7; *see also* Tr Day 5, 1025:4-17 (Testimony of Mr Jurica Pavelic, who confirmed that (i) the Croatian Government appointed him as President of the Croatian Fund, (ii) he was a Government official, and (iii) he was paid for his services by the Government).\n\nCroatian Agency Act (CL-0014), Arts 1 and 2.\n\nCroatian Agency Act (CL-0014), Arts 3 and 8.\n\nCroatian Fund Act (CL-0015), Art 15.\n\n810.\n\nILC Article 5 provides:\n\n*The conduct of a person or entity* [\u2026] *which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance*.906\n\nILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), Art 5.\n\n811.\n\nThe Croatian Fund is an entity empowered by Croatian law to exercise elements of governmental authority, as exemplified above, and there is no suggestion that the Fund acted other than in its professional capacity. The Croatian Fund may thus be considered an entity within the ambit of Article 5.\n\n812.\n\nAs the role of the Croatian Fund is more limited, it is expedient to make several brief observations at this juncture.\n\n813.\n\nThe question of attribution of the actions of the Croatian Fund is relevant in three respects. First, the Respondent may be considered responsible for any illegalities in relation to the decision to place the Five Companies into bankruptcy, as the Respondent can be seen to have controlled the decision through the Croatian Fund which appointed the Emergency Board of Holding d.o.o. that issued the decision. Secondly, by extension, the Respondent may be considered bound by the Purchase Agreement, if the Respondent is considered to have used the Croatian Fund to control Holding d.o.o., which was the sole shareholder of the Five Companies and made the decision to put them into bankruptcy. Thirdly, the issuance of the Croatian Fund Opinion907 may be relevant to whether the Claimants were accorded due process if their investments are considered to have been expropriated.\n\nCroatian Fund Opinion (C-0550).\n\n814.\n\nAside from the issuance of the Croatian Fund Opinion, the Claimants do not identify any other actions of the Croatian Fund that are said to constitute wrongful conduct in violation of the BIT. There are no alleged violations of the BIT by this entity, and as noted the ILC Articles do not operate in respect of non-wrongful conduct. As to the Croatian Fund Opinion, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Fund was entitled to issue the Opinion. The weight and probative value to be ascribed to the Croatian Fund Opinion was a matter for the courts when the Opinion was tendered.\n\n815.\n\nThere are two key points of distinction between *Noble Ventures* and the present case. First, the purported violations of the treaty were committed by the entities the conduct of which the claimant sought to attribute to the State. That is, the claimant sought to attribute to the respondent the conduct of the entities in violation of the treaty, as opposed to attribution of non-wrongful conduct. Secondly, in relation to the question of capacity to conclude contracts on behalf of the State and the associated umbrella clause claim that arises in both cases, the statutorily prescribed role of the entities in *Noble Ventures* was more expansive than that of the Croatian Fund. For example, the \"State Ownership Fund\" considered in *Noble Ventures* was empowered by statute as \"an institution of public interest, a legal person, subordinated to Government, acting for a diminished involvement of the State and the local public administration authorities in the economy, by selling their shares [...].\" Whereas, here, the tasks of the Croatian Fund included organisation, supervision and professional assistance in the privatisation and transformation of social companies, but did not have an express power to sell interests in companies on behalf of the State.\n\n816.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have not made out any wrongful conduct in violation of the BIT on the part of the Croatian Fund that is to be attributed to the Respondent. The principles of attribution, as codified in the ILC Articles, do not otherwise operate in respect of the Croatian Fund.\n\n***Issue 4.7(f): Are the actions of the Holding d.o.o. attributable to the Respondent?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n817.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, through the Croatian Fund, the Respondent both (i) generally controlled the actions of Holding d.o.o. and the Five Companies prior to, during, and (with regard to Holding d.o.o.) subsequent to the sale of the Five Companies to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107;908 and (ii) directed the initiation of bankruptcy over the Five Companies, being subsidiaries wholly owned by Holding d.o.o,909 including the decision of the Emergency Board, represented by the Liquidator, to enter into the Purchase Agreement.910\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 713.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 715, *citing* Croatian Fund Act (CL-0015), Art 4: \"The Fund carries out professional and administrative work referring to the transformation of social companies; privatisation, state asset management when this is stipulated by law or a decision of the Government of the Republic of Croatia; management of companies in which the Fund has ownership shares, restructuring of companies, purchase, sale and establishing of companies, and other jobs established by the Statute of the Fund and special regulations\" (emphasis added by the Claimants). Note: In the Claimants\u2019 Reply, the latter is articulated as \"direct[ing] the sale of the Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Companies from Holding d.o.o. to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\" (Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 373).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 376.\n\n818.\n\nIn 2002, the Respondent\u2019s judiciary noted that the Croatian Fund was \"the only Founder and owner of 100% of [the] shares\" of Holding d.o.o.911 This is consistent with the Croatian Fund Act, which provides that the Croatian Fund controlled the restructuring of social companies, such as Holding d.o.o.912\n\nDecision No I-St-42/2001 of the Zagreb Commercial Court dated 23 April 2002 (C-0163).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 715, *citing* Croatian Fund Act (CL-0015), Art 4.\n\n819.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s assertion that Holding d.o.o. is \"a private company with independent legal personality\" is incorrect. The Croatian Agency replaced Holding d.o.o.\u2019s management board with an \"emergency board\" to ensure the swift transition of the Gavrilovi\u0107 companies to private ownership, with six of the seven members of the Emergency Board appointed by the Croatian Agency.913 The Croatian Agency\u2019s decision to establish the Emergency Board provided the management with a clear mandate to \"undertake decisions, measures and actions in managing the social capital in a way to protect the interest of the Republic of Croatia.\"914 The Emergency Board took over \"all powers of the management body\", including the specific acts relating to the initiation of bankruptcy ultimately leading to the sale of the Five Companies to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.915\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 716.\n\n1991 Decision (C-0028), \u00b6 3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 717, *citing* 1991 Decision (C-0028), \u00b6 2.\n\n820.\n\nThe Claimants contend that if the alleged lack of final determination of properties among the Nine Companies has any importance, it was Holding d.o.o. that should have made this final determination prior to privatisation, but the Emergency Board proposed the initiation of bankruptcy.916\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 718.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n821.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the mere fact that the State establishes or owns a corporate entity is not a sufficient basis for attribution under international law.917 Holding d.o.o. is a private company with an independent legal personality and a commercial, not governmental purpose, such that the starting point is that its conduct is not attributable.918 The Claimants\u2019 general conjectures fail to establish any specific State control or instruction in respect of any of the alleged actions of Holding d.o.o.919\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 573, *citing Schering Corporation v Islamic Republic of Iran*, IUSTC Case No 38, Award, 16 April 1984 (RL-0129), pp 6-7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial \u00b6 573; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 652.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 652.\n\n822.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, neither in the instances mentioned in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, nor otherwise, did Holding d.o.o. exercise public powers or act under the direction or control of the Respondent.920\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 573.\n\n823.\n\nThe Respondent argues by reference to the ILC Articles that the Claimants have not shown that Holding d.o.o. is a part of the State\u2019s organic structure (Article 4), nor that Holding d.o.o. was using the State\u2019s governmental power to bring the court action to register the relevant land plots (Article 5), nor that Holding d.o.o. was acting under the effective control of the State in bringing the court action (Article 8).921 Accordingly, the Respondent says that the single court action in which Holding d.o.o. applied to register title,922 and the statements made by the director,923 are not attributable to the State.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 653, 746.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 653.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 573; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 746.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n824.\n\nHolding d.o.o. is the holding company that resulted after Food Industry passed the Resolution in April 1991 transforming itself into a holding company, and which on 23 April 1991 established the Nine Companies.\n\n825.\n\nIn July 1991, the Croatian Agency (subsequently the Croatian Fund) appointed the Emergency Board to take over all powers of the management body of Holding d.o.o.924 The Emergency Board was comprised of seven individuals, with six members appointed by the Croatian Agency and one member appointed by the company itself. The members appointed by the Croatian Agency were not State officials.925\n\n1991 Decision (C-0028).\n\nTr Day 4, 696:16-22 (Testimony of Mr Miljenko Rospaher).\n\n826.\n\nThe Emergency Board was obliged to \"undertake decisions, measures and actions in managing the social capital in a way to protect the interests of the Republic of Croatia\" and \"without delay issue a decision on transformation of the socially owned company in line with the law.\"926\n\n1991 Decision (C-0028) \u00b6 3.\n\n827.\n\nThe question of attribution of the actions of Holding d.o.o. is relevant in three respects. First, if the alleged lack of final determination of properties among the Nine Companies has any importance, according to the Claimants, it was Holding d.o.o. that should have made this final determination prior to privatisation. Secondly, the alleged involvement of the State in creating, executing and breaching the Purchase Agreement through Holding d.o.o. Thirdly, in the expropriation context, the alleged actions of Holding d.o.o. in renewing its application, which had been made before the sale of the Five Companies to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, to register the properties in its own name.\n\n828.\n\nILC Article 8 provides that acts undertaken by a person or group of persons will be considered an act of the State \"if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"927 An \"effective control\" test has emerged in international jurisprudence, which requires both a general control of the State over the person or entity and a specific control of the State over the act of attribution which is at stake.928\n\nILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), Art 8.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Jan de Nul v Egypt* (CL-0033), \u00b6 173.\n\n829.\n\nHere, due to the change in the control of Holding d.o.o. when the Emergency Board was appointed on 12 July 1991, it is necessary to consider whether the Respondent exercised \"effective control\" before and/or after this date. Prior to the appointment of the Emergency Board, Holding d.o.o. was owned by the Croatian Agency, which exercised governmental authority under the governing legislation.929 Assuming *arguendo* that the governmental authority exercised by the Croatian Agency was sufficient to constitute general control of Holding d.o.o., there is insufficient evidence that the Respondent exercised specific control over the relevant acts at that time. That is, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent exercised specific control over the decisions of Holding d.o.o. in relation to the determination of properties among the Nine Companies. Moreover, it lies ill in the mouth of the Claimants to complain that the Properties should have been assiduously allocated between the Nine Companies when the record shows that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 performed no due diligence as to the extent of the Five Companies\u2019 assets when making his bid.\n\nCroatian Agency Act (CL-0014). *See further* at Issue 4.7(e) *supra*.\n\n830.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is a greater separation from State involvement and control from the time of appointment of the Emergency Board, which is apparent from the selection and composition of the Board. Following the appointment of the Emergency Board to take over all powers of the management body of Holding d.o.o., there is no evidence that the State (through the Croatian Agency, the Croatian Fund or otherwise) issued instructions or controlled the independent members of the Emergency Board generally or in the making of the specific, relevant decisions. In particular, there is no evidence that Holding d.o.o. directed the initiation of bankruptcy over the Five Companies, which was a decision taken by the Emergency Board. Nor is there evidence that Holding d.o.o. controlled the decision or actions around entry into the Purchase Agreement.\n\n831.\n\nIn result, Holding d.o.o. does not fall within Article 8 of the ILC Articles. The Claimants do not maintain that its actions are attributable under another provision of the ILC Articles. Accordingly, the acts of Holding d.o.o. are not attributable to the Respondent.\n\n**(4) Are the Actions of the Five Companies Attributable to the Respondent?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n832.\n\nThe attribution of actions of the Five Companies was not stipulated as an issue to be determined by the Tribunal.930 It was raised for the first time in the Claimants\u2019 Post Hearing-Brief. That said, given the Tribunal\u2019s finding in relation to Holding d.o.o., the position is starker in relation to the Five Companies. Once again, the Claimants have not established that the Respondent controlled the Five Companies. The Liquidator\u2019s management of the Five Companies does not equate to State control. It is not apparent from the record that the Croatian Fund, the judiciary or any other entity exercised control over the Five Companies once the bankruptcy proceedings commenced. It is on this basis that the Tribunal concludes that the actions of the Five Companies are not attributable to the Respondent.\n\n*See* PO 5, Annexure A.\n\n**ISSUE 4.8: IS THE RESPONDENT A PARTY TO, OR OTHERWISE BOUND BY, THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n833.\n\nThe Claimants point to the fact that the Purchase Agreement was concluded between the Five Companies, \"represented in bankruptcy by the Liquidator Slavo Boras, PhD, on one side as the Seller.\"931 Further, Mr Boras signed the Agreement as liquidator and stamped the document with the seals of the Five Companies that the Respondent had appointed him to represent.932\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047), p 1.\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047), p 4.\n\n834.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the actions of the Five Companies and the Liquidator are attributable to the Respondent, as set out and determined in Issue 4.7 *supra*. As such, even if the Tribunal were to find that privity of contract exists only between the Liquidator and Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, the Respondent was a party to the Purchase Agreement because the Liquidator would still bind the Respondent to the obligations in the Purchase Agreement.933\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 723-724, 726.\n\n835.\n\nArticle 7 of the Purchase Agreement provides that the \"Buyer acquires all founding rights to which he is entitled as the owner of the purchased companies\", and, thus, Croatia was obliged to recognise, transfer and register the ownership of the assets of the Five Companies to the Claimants.934 According to the Claimants, these contractual obligations are due directly from Croatia\u2014both as the bankruptcy administrator, and as seller of the Five Companies\u2014to the Claimants.935\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047), p 3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 375-376.\n\n836.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent\u2019s contention that Mr Boras, as the Liquidator, is fully responsible and the person against whom claims for non-performance should be brought has no basis in fact or in Croatian law. First, the Respondent\u2019s statement that Mr Boras signed the Purchase Agreement \"in his private capacity as a bankruptcy trustee\" is contradictory: in signing the Agreement, Mr Boras acted either as the bankruptcy liquidator or in his private capacity. The latter has no support in the Purchase Agreement or in the record.936 Second, Mr Boras offered no consideration in relation to the Purchase Agreement, as he was not the owner of the Five Companies.937 Third, the Liquidator received no consideration from the sale. Rather, the Respondent\u2019s Joint Reserve Fund received all the proceeds of the sale.938 Fourth, the Respondent has not offered any legal authority to support a claim that under Croatian law, the act of signing a contract of sale on behalf of the liquidating entity results in the signatory acting \"in his personal capacity\" as the seller. This is because there exists no support for such a claim\u2014the Bankruptcy Act does not define who is considered a seller in bankruptcy purchase agreements.939\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 725.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 725.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 725, *citing* Uzelac and Erakovic Report, \u00b6 5.2.4.2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 725.\n\n837.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, even if the Respondent is not a party to the Purchase Agreement, the Respondent is in any case bound by its terms, given the central role it played in the purchase of the Five Companies. First, Holding d.o.o., which was then owned by the State, was the sole shareholder of the Five Companies and made the decision to put them into bankruptcy.940 The Respondent also played an active role in overseeing the Five Companies, and the Emergency Board directly appointed by the Respondent made the decision to commence the bankruptcy proceedings.941 Second, the Respondent, through its judiciary and also its executive organs, exercised all the typical functions of a seller and assumed all the rights and obligations that a seller usually has.942 By way of example: the Bankruptcy Court decided to offer the Five Companies in an open tender procedure; the Bankruptcy Court initially decided not to accept Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s offer, but later decided to accept the offer when no additional bids were received; the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approved the Purchase Agreement; the Bankruptcy Court decided that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 should make payment to Inacomm, noting that \"by executing the payment into the referenced account, the court shall consider the obligation of Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 entirely fulfilled in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and the Respondent attempted to negotiate a solution with the buyer, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.943 Third, the Respondent consistently indicated that it had the sole authority to fulfil the obligations under the Purchase Agreement.944 For example, in 2000, a letter from the Minister of Regional Development stated \"the aforementioned were unsolved ownership and legal relationships between the subject Company and the Republic of Croatia\" and that \"finding solutions for the subject problems should be coordinated with the competent State Attorney\u2019s Office.\"945 Indeed, the Claimants contend that the Respondent is the only entity which is able to discharge specific obligations arising under the Purchase Agreement.946 Finally, the Respondent was the sole beneficiary under the Purchase Agreement: the entire proceeds from the sale went to the State-managed Joint Reserves Fund.947\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 728, *citing* Resolution (C-0015); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0016); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0017); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0018); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0019); and Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0020). *See also* Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 371-380.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 728-729.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 730.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 730 and references cited therein.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 731.\n\nLetter from Mr Bozidar Pankretic, Minister of Regional Development, to Mr Zeljka Nenadic, Mayor of Petrinja dated 24 March 2010 (C-0160), p 2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 732.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 734.\n\n838.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants submit that the Liquidator merely \"represented\" the Five Companies in bankruptcy, as reflected in his signature to the Purchase Agreement.948 In this submission, the real authority behind the sale was the Respondent, which controlled Holding d.o.o. through the Croatian Agency and both orchestrated and affirmed the sale through its judiciary and its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.949\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 768.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 769.\n\n839.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, the Respondent further qualifies as a \"party\" under Article 8(2) of the BIT.950 The Claimants cite *Bosh v Ukraine* where the tribunal said:\n\n[T]*he term 'Party' in the umbrella clause refers to any situation where the Party is acting qua State. This means that where the conduct of entities can be attributed to the Parties (under, for instance, Articles 4, 5 or 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility), such entities are considered to be 'the Party' for the purposes of* [the umbrella clause].951\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 771-777.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 774, *Bosh International, Inc and B & P Ltd Foreign Investments Enterprise v Ukraine*, ICSID Case No ARB/08/11, Award, 25 October 2012 (***Bosh v Ukraine***) (RL-0121), \u00b6 246.\n\n840.\n\nSimilarly, in *Noble Ventures v Romania*, the tribunal concluded that \"where the acts of a governmental agency are to be attributed to the State for the purposes of applying an umbrella clause [\u2026] breaches of a contract into which the State has entered are capable of constituting a breach of international law *by virtue of the breach of the umbrella clause*.\"952 Further support for this proposition is said to be found in *Amoco v Iran*, where the tribunal noted that \"in certain circumstances, the separate legal personality of an entity fully controlled by the State can be discarded and the State considered as bound by the terms of a contract entered into by such an entity.

However, the Claimants contend that the circumstances in *Hamester v Ghana* are distinguishable because the tribunal there found that there was no compelling evidence that the Ghanaian company acted on the instructions of or under the direction or the control of the State, and therefore the Ghanaian company\u2019s acts were purely commercial and not attributable to Ghana.954 Whereas, here, each action of Croatia\u2019s judiciary, Holding d.o.o. and the Liquidator\u2014 in creating, executing and breaching the Purchase Agreement\u2014can be attributed to the Respondent.955 The Claimants also appear to seek to distinguish *EDF v Romania*, where the tribunal found that the state was not a contractual party and \"[a]ttribution does not change the extent of the obligations arising under the [contracts].\"956 The Claimants simply recite that the Claimants\u2019 investment was made in the privatisation of a public company, in the context of a bankruptcy sale, with the active participation of the Bankruptcy Council, the Bankruptcy Judge, the Bankruptcy Court and the Liquidator.957\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 772-773.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 773-774.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 56, citing *EDF (Services) Limited v Romania,* ICSID Case No ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009 (***EDF v Romania***) (CL-0048), \u00b6 319.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 56.\n\n842.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimants argue that, given the central involvement of the Respondent in every step of the sale of the Five Companies to the Claimants, and the subsequent dispute regarding registration of the Properties, the Respondent is bound by the obligations therein, even if it is considered not to be a party, in a strict sense, to the Purchase Agreement.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n843.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that it is not bound by the Purchase Agreement. Croatia is not a party to the Purchase Agreement and the obligations contained therein cannot be attributed to it.958\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 757.\n\n844.\n\nThe Respondent argues that as a matter of basic privity, the Respondent is not a party to the Purchase Agreement, meaning it could not have assumed, let alone breached, any obligations.959 The Purchase Agreement is signed and concluded by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and Mr Boras as the Liquidator and representative of the Five Companies in bankruptcy. These are the two contractual parties who accepted all rights and obligations.960 Any claim for a breach would have to be raised against the proper contractual counterparty, Mr Boras.961\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 510.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 510.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 583.\n\n845.\n\nThe \"umbrella clause\" in Article 8(2) of the BIT cannot create privity of contract where there is none. The Respondent cites *Hamester v Ghana* as authority for the proposition that there is no basis to extend the ambit of an umbrella clause to contractual obligations assumed by entities that are separate and distinct from the State.962\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 584, *citing Hamester v Ghana* (CL-0038), \u00b6 347(i). *See also* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 874-875.\n\n846.\n\nNor can the rules of attribution under international law transform a signature by a bankruptcy trustee into a signature by the State, even assuming a trustee can somehow bind the State.963 Moreover, the rules of attribution cannot be applied to create or reallocate obligations for a State under a contract to which it is not party.964 The Respondent says that it is a basic principle that these rules, as codified in the ILC Articles, do not attempt to define the content of primary obligations, the breach of which gives rise to responsibility.965 Rather, they constitute secondary rules establishing the conditions under which a State can be held responsible for wrongful conduct.966\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 511.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 511; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 759, *citing EDF v Romania* (CL-0048), \u00b6 319; *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/8, Decision on Annulment, 25 September 2007 (***CMS v Argentina***, **Annulment**) (CL-0028), \u00b6 95 (\"[...] the *parties* to the obligation (*i.e.*, the persons bound by it and entitled to rely on it) are [\u2026] not changed by reason of the umbrella clause.\" (emphasis in original)).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 511, *citing* ILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), p 31, General Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2 and 4(a): \"[\u2026] it is not the function of the articles to specify the content of the obligations laid down by particular primary rules, or their interpretation.\"\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 511, 585.\n\n847.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent states that the Claimants\u2019 attempt to create obligations for the Respondent under the Purchase Agreement is flawed. The Respondent did not assume any obligations therein.967\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 582.\n\n848.\n\nAs submitted in connection with Issue 4.7(a) *supra*, the Respondent contends that the bankruptcy trustee is not a *de jure* State organ or a para-Statal entity, nor does the role wield delegated governmental authority. The Liquidator did not act \"on behalf of\" the State or under its direction, but signed in his own name. The Liquidator was never instructed or directed by the Respondent to act as he did; the sale of the legal entities was his proposal.968 Moreover, the Final Bankruptcy Report speaks of the bankruptcy management fulfilling \"its contractual obligations to the Buyer.\"969 Therefore, The Liquidator was not a State organ within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles.970\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 512, *citing* September 1991 Bankruptcy Ruling (C-0035).\n\nFinal Bankruptcy Report (C-0036), \u00b6 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 863.\n\n849.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 bankruptcy expert suggested at the Hearing that the Five Companies are the \"seller.\"971 Either way, the Respondent states, Croatia is not the seller.972 Further, the Five Companies were not organs of the State and did not enter into the Purchase Agreement wielding governmental power or acting under the effective control of the State.973\n\nTr Day 6, 1189:8-11 (Testimony of Judge Andrija Erakovic: \"If there\u2019s no holder of a title to a company, as is the case of with a socially-owned enterprise [\u2026] the seller can be--the company itself [...].\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 758.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 760.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n850.\n\nThe Purchase Agreement was concluded between Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, as the buyer, and the Five Companies represented in bankruptcy by the Liquidator, Mr Boras, as the seller. Article 12 of the Purchase Agreement provides that \"[t]he contractual parties hereby accept all rights and obligations arising from this Agreement, and as a sign of its acceptance sign this Agreement by their own hand.\"974 This is followed by the signatures of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and The Liquidator.\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047), Art 12.\n\n851.\n\nAn analogous situation was considered in *Hamester v Ghana*. There, the tribunal found that the joint venture agreement was signed by the claimant and the Ghana Cocoa Board, with no implication of the State. The State was not named as a party, and did not sign the contract. There had also been no suggestion that the State was intended to be a party thereto.975\n\n*Hamester v Ghana* (CL-0038), \u00b6 347.\n\n852.\n\nSimilarly, here, the Respondent was not named as a party and did not sign the Purchase Agreement. There was also no representation or suggestion that the Respondent was intended to be a party. As a matter of privity, the Respondent is plainly not a party to the Purchase Agreement.\n\n853.\n\nFor completeness, the Tribunal notes that the Bankruptcy Act does not define who is considered the seller in bankruptcy purchase agreements.976 In reliance on the writings of Prof Dr Barbic, the Claimants assert that where there is no holder of title to a company, as is the case with socially-owned enterprises, the seller may be only the company itself.977 The Tribunal accepts this view. The Five Companies were the seller. Mr Boras signed the Purchase Agreement as the representative of the Five Companies, consistently with his role as the Liquidator.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 725.\n\nUzelac and Erakovic Report, \u00b6 5.2.4.4, *citing* Prof Dr Jaksa Barbie: \"[T]he seller is 'a body entrusted with a mandate over the company, if such body exists.' However 'in case there is no mandatary (title holder) over the company, as is the case with a company in social ownership, the seller may be only the company itself.'\" *See also* Tr Day 6, 1189:8-11.\n\n854.\n\nThe involvement of the judiciary of Croatia was limited to the supervisory role provided by the Bankruptcy Act. It could not be suggested that the State was to be bound by any or all purchase agreements concluded in bankruptcy proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act.\n\n855.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 approval of the Purchase Agreement was required pursuant to the Foreign Investment Act because of the foreign nationality of the buyer. The approval in no way furthers the Claimants\u2019 theory that the Respondent is bound by the Purchase Agreement.\n\n856.\n\nThe Claimants rely on attribution of the actions of the Liquidator, the Five Companies and Holding d.o.o. to Croatia to argue that Mr Boras would still bind the Respondent to the obligations in the Purchase Agreement.978 However, the rules of attribution under international law as codified in the ILC Articles do not operate to define the content of primary obligations, the breach of which gives rise to responsibility.979 Rather, the rules concern the responsibility of States for their internationally wrongful acts.980 It follows that the rules of attribution cannot be applied to create primary obligations for a State under a contract.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 723-724, 726.\n\nILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), p 31, General Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2 and 4(a) (\"[\u2026] it is not the function of the articles to specify the content of the obligations laid down by particular primary rules, or their interpretation.\").\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, ILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), General Commentary, p 1.\n\n857.\n\nThis view is consistent with that of other arbitral tribunals. In *EDF v Romania*, the tribunal held that attribution does not change the extent and content of the obligations arising under the contract, which remain contractual, nor does it make the State party to such contracts.981\n\n*EDF v Romania* (CL-0048), \u00b6 319.\n\n858.\n\nThe Liquidator\u2019s negotiation and execution of the Purchase Agreement, as a representative of the Five Companies, is not a wrongful act for which the Respondent can be responsible through the principles of attribution.\n\n859.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the Respondent qualifies as a \"party\" under the umbrella clause\u2014Article 8(2) of the BIT.982\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 771-777.\n\n860.\n\nAs in *CMS v Argentina*, the Tribunal considers that the effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else. The parties to the obligation (i.e. the persons bound by it and entitled to rely on it) are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella clause.983\n\n*CMS v Argentina*, Annulment (CL-0028), \u00b6\u00b6 95 *et seq*.\n\n861.\n\nIn *Noble Ventures* a question arose as to the attribution of the conduct of an entity acting as an empowered public institution under the privatisation law to conclude agreements with investors, but also acting as a governmental agency to manage the whole legal relationship with them, including all acts concerned with the implementation of a specific investment. The tribunal concluded that the acts allegedly in violation of the BIT were attributable to the respondent, and held that \"where the acts of a governmental agency are to be attributed to the State for the purposes of applying an umbrella clause [\u2026], breaches of a contract into which the State has entered are capable of constituting a breach of international law *by virtue of the breach of the umbrella clause*.\"984 The present case is distinguishable from *Noble Ventures* in that the entities there \"were clearly charged with representing the Respondent in the process of privatizing State-owned companies and, for that purpose, entering into privatization agreements and related contracts on behalf of the [r]espondent.\"985\n\n*Noble Ventures v Romania* (CL-0082), \u00b6 85 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Noble Ventures v Romania* (CL-0082), \u00b6 86.\n\n862.\n\nThe Claimants also rely on *Bosh v Ukraine*, in which the tribunal said that \"where the conduct of entities can be attributed to the Parties (under, for instance, Articles 4, 5 or 8 of the ILC Articles), such entities are considered to be 'the Party' for the purposes of [the umbrella clause].\"986 By reason of the Tribunal\u2019s findings on attribution, it is plain that this case does not advance the Claimants\u2019 proposition.\n\n*Bosh v Ukraine*, (RL-0121), \u00b6 246.\n\n863.\n\n*Amoco v Iran* is also distinguishable on the basis that the entities and persons involved in the negotiation and execution of the Purchase Agreement were not instruments of the State or \"fully controlled by the State\" so as to warrant disregard of the separate legal personality.\n\n864.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that it is not possible to consider the Respondent a party to the Purchase Agreement through Article 8(2) of the BIT, or otherwise impose obligations on the Respondent through this clause.\n\n865.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the Respondent is \"otherwise bound\" by the Purchase Agreement because it was \"intricately involved\" in the sale of the Five Companies and thus required to fulfil obligations therein. The Tribunal considers that the Respondent may only be otherwise bound by the Purchase Agreement if it created a legitimate expectation that it would accept, fulfil or otherwise facilitate obligations therein. The Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations are addressed at Issue 5.3(a) *infra*.\n\n**ISSUE 4.9: DOES AN ERRONEOUS APPLICATION OF LAW, IF ANY, BY THE RESPONDENT GIVE RISE TO A TREATY VIOLATION?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n866.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, while a mere error by a court is not an automatic breach of the BIT or a violation of the FET standard,987 an erroneous application of the law may be the basis of a breach of the BIT when the State\u2019s conduct implicates treaty standards.988\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 737, *referring to Oostergetel v Slovakia* (RL-0081), \u00b6 299.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 744.\n\n867.\n\nThe Claimants refer to a number of investor-state tribunal decisions in which actions that could be termed an \"erroneous application of law\" by a State gave rise to a treaty violation. In *PSEG v Turkey*, the tribunal held that inconsistent administrative acts and court decisions breached the FET standard.989 In *Siag v Egypt*, the tribunal held that pursuing court proceedings that fail to respect prior legal determinations constituted a failure to afford FET.990 Similarly, in *Vivendi v Argentina*, the tribunal found that the pursuit of administrative actions in bad faith, aimed \"either at reversing the privatisation or forcing the concessionaire to renegotiate\", was in breach of the FET standard.991\n\n*PSEG Global Inc. and Konya Ilgin Elektrik \u00dcretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No ARB/02/5, Award \u00b6\u00b6, 19 January 2007 (***PSEG v Turkey***) (CL-0043), \u00b6\u00b6 248-249.\n\n*Siag v Egypt* (CL-0060), \u00b6 483.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No 97/3, Award, 20 August 2007 (***Vivendi v Argentina***) (CL-0064), \u00b6 7.4.19.\n\n868.\n\nFurther, the Claimants note that procedural propriety and due process are subsumed within the FET standard.992 On this basis, the Claimants contend that the FET standard is violated where procedural propriety is denied, such as where state conduct is \"grossly unfair\" or \"lack[s] due process.\"993\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 743. *See*, *e.g.* *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/16, Award, 29 July 2008 (***Rumeli v Kazakhstan***) (RL-0111), \u00b6 609: \"[T]he fair and equitable treatment standard encompasses\" the principle that \"the State must respect procedural propriety and due process.\"\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 743. *See*, *e.g.*, *Jan de Nul N.V. v Egypt* (CL-0033), \u00b6 187: \"It is also common ground that the fair and equitable treatment may be violated when procedural propriety and due process are denied\";

For example, in *Noble Ventures v Romania*, the tribunal declined a breach of the FET standard where bankruptcy proceedings \"were initiated and conducted according to the law and not against it.\"1006 Similarly, in *Bosh v Ukraine*, the tribunal found an investor\u2019s complaint unfounded where nothing indicated that a domestic audit was not in fact carried out in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.1007\n\n*Noble Ventures v Romania* (CL-0082), \u00b6 178.\n\n*Bosh v Ukraine* (RL-0121), \u00b6 213.\n\n875.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent points to submissions made in connection with other issues to be determined in this arbitration. By way of example: the application of the Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act presumption, which the Claimants contend \"is not in accordance with Croatian law\" and constitutes an expropriation;1008 the criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, which the Claimants contend is in breach of a legitimate expectation;1009 the Annulment Action, which the Claimants contend is in breach of a legitimate expectation;1010 and the court decisions that the Claimants contend constitute indirect expropriation.1011\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 580-586, 732; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 174-175.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 736, 739.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 736-738.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 614.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n876.\n\nAn erroneous application of law by the Respondent will not necessarily give rise to a treaty violation; more is required. The Parties rightly appear to agree.1012\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 327, *citing* *Joseph Charles Lemire v Ukraine*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/18, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 14 January 2010 (***Lemire v Ukraine*****, Jurisdiction and Liability**) (CL-0061); Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 555, 557, *citing Lemire v Ukraine* (RL-0123), \u00b6 43.\n\n877.\n\nIt is not necessary for the Tribunal to attempt to articulate the scope or content of an erroneous application of law that will give rise to a treaty violation. In *Mondev v USA*, the tribunal explained:\n\n*In the end the question is whether, at an international level and having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment. This is admittedly a somewhat open-ended standard, but it may be that in practice no more precise formula can be offered to cover the range of possibilities*.1013\n\n*Mondev v USA* (CL-0044), \u00b6 127.\n\n878.\n\nThat said, the examples cited by the Parties are instructive. An erroneous application of the law by a State may be sufficient to implicate treaty standards where it is established that there was a blatant disregard of the applicable law,1014 a clear and malicious misapplication of the law,1015 or a complete lack of candor or good faith in the application of the law.1016 The error of law must be of such a nature as to give rise to justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome and, as the adjectival modifiers used in the cases show, this is not a result that an international arbitral tribunal, which exercises no appeal function in relation to the State\u2019s municipal law, will arrive at in the absence of such circumstances.\n\n*Lemire v Ukraine* (RL-0123), \u00b6 43.\n\n*Azinian v Mexico* (CL-0077), \u00b6 103.\n\n*TECO v Guatemala* (RL-0122), \u00b6\u00b6 458, 465.\n\n879.\n\nTwo further points bear noting. First, whether an erroneous application of law amounts to a violation of the BIT FET standard may depend on the treaty standard in question. Second, any assessment of whether an allegedly erroneous application of law implicates a treaty standard must be made bearing in mind that an investment tribunal is not an appellate body seized of the jurisdiction to review domestic juridical decisions.\n\n880.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s submissions on specific issues to be determined, such as the propriety of the application of the Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act presumption and the Annulment Action, are not relevant at this juncture. The Parties\u2019 submissions as to whether allegedly erroneous applications of law give rise to a violation of certain standards under the BIT fall to be considered *in concreto* in accordance with the settled list of issues.\n\n**ISSUE 4.6: WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THE CLAIMANTS' FAILURE, IF ANY, TO MAKE USE OF AVAILABLE DOMESTIC REMEDIES, INCLUDING THE COMMENCEMENT OF CONTENTIOUS PROCEEDINGS, ON THE MERITS OF THEIR CLAIMS UNDER THE BIT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n881.\n\nThe Claimants submit that both Article 26 of the ICSID Convention and decisions of investor-State tribunals confirm that an investor is not required to exhaust local remedies, save where the BIT expressly requires an investor to exhaust local remedies or for claims relating to denial of justice.1017\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 670-672.\n\n882.\n\nConsistently with other investor-state tribunals, in *Arif v Moldova*, the tribunal noted:\n\n*Article 26 of the ICSID Convention constitutes an express waiver of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies in ICSID arbitrations.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n[T]*here is no general requirement to exhaust local remedies for a treaty claim to exist (unless such a claim is for denial of justice)*.1018\n\n*Franck Charles Arif v Republic of Moldova*, ICSID Case No ARB/11/23, Award, 8 April 8, 2013 (***Arif v Moldova***) (RL-0120), \u00b6\u00b6 333-334. *See also* *Generation Ukraine, Inc. v Ukraine,* ICSID Case No ARB/00/9, Award, 16 September 2003 (CL-0040), \u00b6\u00b6 13.4-13.5; *CMS v Argentina* (RL-0108), \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.\n\n883.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, as the BIT does not require exhaustion of local remedies and there is no claim for denial of justice, the Claimants\u2019 determination not to fully pursue any rights they might have before Croatian Courts has no bearing on this case.1019\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 670, 675-676.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n884.\n\nThe Respondent does not directly address the issue of the effect of the Claimants\u2019 failure to make use of available domestic remedies on the merits of their claims. Instead, the Respondent draws attention to a number of points of marginal relevance, which are noted below for completeness.\n\n885.\n\nAs to FET,1020 the Respondent stresses that the Claimants were throughout afforded due process and the possibility of recourse against any measures concerning registration.1021 It argues that arbitral case law confirms that the existence of remedies and the attitude of an alleged victim is critical to a determination of violations of due process and procedural fairness. The Respondent cites *Loewen v USA*, in which a claim was rejected because the claimant had not pursued all available remedies, notwithstanding that the treatment had been improper.1022\n\n*See* Issue 5.3 *infra*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 559.\n\n*The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v United States of America*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/98/3, Award, 26 June 2003 (RL-0126), \u00b6\u00b6 137, 217.\n\n886.\n\nAs to the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Croatian courts\u2019 application of Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act amounts to an expropriation,1023 the Respondent contends that the court decisions allowing the registrations cannot be expropriatory. An expropriation requires a lasting removal of the ability of the owner to make use of property rights, but the Claimants have never commenced contentious proceedings against the Respondent to displace the rebuttable presumption of ownership under Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act.1024\n\n*See* Issue 6.1 *infra*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 585-591.\n\n887.\n\nAs to the Claimants\u2019 claim that the Respondent indirectly expropriated the Claimants\u2019 property rights through the failure of Croatian courts to recognise Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s ownership over the Properties, the Respondent maintains that, if Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. is to succeed in establishing title, it should bring civil contentious proceedings.1025\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 621-638; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 199-200.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n888.\n\nArticle 26 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention*.1026\n\nICSID Convention (CL-0099), Art 26.\n\n889.\n\nIt follows from Article 26 and decisions of investor-state tribunals such as *Arif v Moldova* that there is no general requirement to exhaust local remedies for a treaty claim to exist, unless a treaty requires the exhaustion of local remedies as a condition for the commencement of an ICSID arbitration or such a claim is for denial of justice.\n\n890.\n\nHere, the BIT does not require the exhaustion of local remedies. Indeed, Article 9(2)(a) of the BIT expressly provides that the consent to ICSID arbitration \"implies the renunciation of the requirement that the internal administrative or juridical remedies should be exhausted.\"1027\n\nBIT (CL-0025), Art 9(2)(a).\n\n891.\n\nFurther, as the Respondent notes, the Claimants do not make a claim for denial of justice.1028\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 613. *See also* Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 638; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 175.\n\n892.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s submissions do not contend with the terms of Article 9(2)(a) of the BIT, which is tantamount to an express renunciation of the requirement to exhaust local remedies. It is appropriate to consider the effect (if any) of the Claimants\u2019 decision not to pursue certain domestic remedies upon specific claims made, such as FET and indirect expropriation, in connection with the specific claims.\n\n893.\n\nBy the express terms of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention and Article 9 of the BIT, the Claimants are not required to exhaust local remedies. The Claimants\u2019 decision not to make full use of available domestic remedies, including the commencement of contentious proceedings, need not have an effect on their claims under the BIT.\n\nX. **ISSUE 6: MERITS - EXPROPRIATION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n894.\n\nThe first of the Claimants\u2019 substantive claims for a violation of the BIT which this Award addresses is the Claimants\u2019 claim for expropriation.\n\n895.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the BIT relevantly provides:\n\n*Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose by due process of law and against compensation*.1029\n\nBIT (CL-0025), Art 4(1).\n\n896.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has violated Article 4(1) of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating the Claimants\u2019 property and/or rights in three ways.\n\n897.\n\nFirst, the Claimants contend that the Respondent directly expropriated the Second Claimant\u2019s real property by registering State ownership over the land plots comprising that property without providing compensation.1030\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 901.\n\n898.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that the Respondent indirectly expropriated the Second Claimant\u2019s real property by preventing the Second Claimant from registering its ownership of that property, resulting in the loss of economic use and control.1031\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 900.\n\n899.\n\nThird, the Claimants contend that the Respondent directly or indirectly expropriated the First Claimant\u2019s contractual rights under the Purchase Agreement.1032\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 948.\n\n900.\n\nThe Respondent denies each of the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n901.\n\nAs an initial point, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal finds that in order to succeed in relation to its first and/or second claims for expropriation, as set out above, the Claimants must first establish that they in fact have a right to the Properties in question. This finding is axiomatic in both cases, as the rights that are claimed to have been expropriated are proprietary in nature. This is recognised by the Claimants in their submissions.1033\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 580; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 607; Claimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 97.\n\n902.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the Claimants have established a proprietary right in 326 plots of land, spread over 35 of the claimed Properties (**Claimants\u2019 Plots**), and have not established a proprietary right in relation to any of the Apartments.\n\n903.\n\nOf the Claimants\u2019 Plots:\n\n(a) 242 have been registered by the Respondent (**Taken Plots**); and\n\n(b) 84 have not been registered by the Respondent (**Remaining Plots**).\n\n904.\n\nAnnexure 4 to this Award sets out the Claimants\u2019 Plots and, in the case of the Taken Plots, sets out the basis of the Respondent\u2019s registration. The Taken Plots are shaded in blue, while the Remaining Plots are shaded in orange.\n\n**ISSUE 6.1: HAS THE RESPONDENT EXPROPRIATED THE CLAIMANTS' PLOTS?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Issue 6.1(a): Has the Respondent directly expropriated the Taken Plots through registration of its ownership of them?***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n905.\n\nAs is apparent from Annexure 4, the Respondent has registered its ownership over the Taken Plots on the following bases:1034\n\n(a) Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act (including registrations stated as being under Article 365(3) of the Ownership Act);\n\n(b) Article 10 of the Prohibition on Disposal Act and Article 3(1) of the Prohibition on Disposal Regulation;\n\n(c) Article 87 of the Local Self-Government Act;\n\n(d) Article 58(4) of the State Property Management Act;\n\n(e) Article 3 of the Act on Municipal Affairs and provisions of the Roads Acts;\n\n(f) Article 3(1) of the Agricultural Land Act;\n\n(g) Article 3 of the Water Act 1990; and\n\n(h) an unknown basis.\n\nThe sources of the bases in Annexure 4 are the lists provided by the Parties in accordance with PO 5.\n\n**(1) Registrations based on Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n906.\n\nAs a preliminary point, Annexure 4 includes 6 plots which were registered by the Respondent in accordance with Decision No Z-1207/09 of the Municipal Court in Sisak.1035 The Court in that decision purports to register the Respondent pursuant to Article 365(3) of the Ownership Act.\n\nDecision No Z-1207/09, Municipal Court Sisak, 26 May 2011 (R-0265).\n\n907.\n\nDr Ernst has opined that the reference to Article 365(3) in the above decision was a typographical error. This opinion is based, in part, on the fact that the application on which the decision was made makes reference to Article 362(3) and not Article 365(3).1036 By its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent accepts Dr Ernst\u2019s opinion.1037 The Claimants did not, by their Reply Post-Hearing Brief, make any submission to the contrary.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 208.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, fn 351.\n\n908.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Tribunal finds that the plots in question were in fact registered on the basis of Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act, rather than Article 365(3). The relevant plots are listed in Annexure 4 as having been registered based on Article 362(3).\n\n909.\n\nArticle 362 of the Ownership Act states:\n\n*(1) It is deemed that the owner of a piece of real property under social ownership is the person who is entered as the holder of the right to administration, use and disposition of the real property in the land register, and any person asserting otherwise has the burden of proof.*\n\n*(2) It is deemed that the person who is entered in the land register as the holder of the right to use undeveloped construction land under social ownership, that is, the holder of the right of priority to use such land is the owner of the land concerned, and any person asserting otherwise has the burden of proof.*\n\n*(3) It is deemed that the Republic of Croatia has the right of ownership of all things under social ownership in the territory of the Republic of Croatia regarding which their ownership is not determined and regarding which the presumptions of ownership referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article do not have effect, and any person asserting otherwise has the burden of proof.*\n\n*(4) The provisions of paragraphs 1 through 3 of this Article regarding things also apply accordingly to rights that were under social ownership*.1038\n\nOwnership Act (CL-0010 / RL-0044), Art 362.\n\n910.\n\nIn each case, on the plain wording of Article 362(3), a registration carries with it a prerequisite that ownership was \"not determined\" and that there was no presumption as to ownership based on rights registered in the land registry.\n\n911.\n\nThe Parties agree that the intent of Article 362 was to alleviate uncertainty during the transition from social ownership of property to private ownership.1039 The agreement, however, ends there.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 627; Presentation of Dr Hano Ernst (C-0619), slide 28; Klaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6\u00b6 44-46.\n\n912.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the correct interpretation of when ownership is not determined, and they further disagree as to whether the application of Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act is expropriatory, given the ability for a person \"to assert otherwise\" in response to a claim of ownership by the Respondent.\n\n**(2) The Parties\u2019 Arguments in Relation to Determinability**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n913.\n\nThe Claimants, supported by the opinion of Dr Ernst, put forward an interpretation of Article 362 of the Ownership Act whereby the only circumstances that entitle the Respondent to register itself under Article 362(3) is where there is an entry of social ownership on the land registry, with no right of use to an entity or individual listed. The Claimants contend that Article 362(3) has no application where there is a potential disagreement between various parties as to ownership.1040\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 627 *et seq*.\n\n914.\n\nThe Respondent, supported by Prof Klaric and Judge Matusko, puts forward an interpretation of Article 362(3) whereby it can be applied in circumstances where there is an indeterminacy in ownership, such as that which they contend exists here between the Nine Companies.1041\n\nSecond Klaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6 102. *See also* Croatian Fund Opinion, p 2 (C-0550).\n\n915.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Claimants\u2019 Plots are determinable as property of the Second Claimant, the difference in interpretation of the applicability of Article 362(3) is somewhat moot. In determining, on the basis of the evidence before it, that the Claimants\u2019 Plots are the property of the Second Claimant, the Tribunal has necessarily also concluded the logical corollary of that, which is that insofar at this Tribunal is concerned, ownership was \"determined\" in relation to those plots and, therefore, Article 362(3) should have had no application in relation to those plots.\n\n916.\n\nIn truth, nothing turns on this point. The real question for determination is whether, in cases where the Claimants are in fact the owner of a given property (as is the case with the Taken Plots), a registration by the Respondent of ownership over property in accordance with Article 362(3) constitutes an expropriation.\n\n***a. Is Article 362(3) expropriatory?***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n917.\n\nThe Respondent argues that registrations based on Article 362(3) do not amount to an expropriation because the Claimants were \"at liberty to vindicate any claimed property rights in the Croatian courts\"1042 and the Respondent\u2019s entries are \"only temporary placeholders until ownership is determined.\"1043 According to the Respondent an expropriation requires \"a lasting removal of the ability of the owner to make use of property rights\",1044 citing decisions of investment law tribunals including *LG&E v Argentina*.1045 The Respondent has further provided evidence of cases where individuals have reclaimed property which had previously been registered under Article 362(3). According to the Respondent, the Claimants are in a position to vindicate their legal rights in a domestic Croatian court, a path which the Claimants have declined to follow.1046\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 469.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 485.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 482; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 587.\n\n*See* *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp., and LG&E International Inc. v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006 (***LG&E v Argentina***) (CL-0081), \u00b6 193.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 589-590.\n\n918.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that \"[t]he Claimants have neither alleged, nor shown that the court decisions applying Article 362(3) shock or surprise, let alone that they lead to justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome\",1047 as the Respondent contends the standard of proof requires.1048\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 586.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 583-586, *referring to* *Mondev v USA* (CL-0044), \u00b6 127; *Azinian v Mexico* (CL-0077), \u00b6\u00b6 99, 103, 105.\n\n919.\n\nThe Claimants say that there is nothing temporary about the Respondent\u2019s registration of land,1049 citing the expert opinion of Prof Ernst that\n\n*An Article 362(3) registration is a registration of ownership. The fact that it is a registration based on Article 362(3) publicizes to all third parties that the Republic is the owner of the property, albeit a presumptive owner. It does not, however, make the registration conditional or temporary* [...].1050\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 908.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 217.\n\n920.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s registration is not displaced by the fact that the Respondent may choose to return the Properties it has registered through an out-of-court settlement with the State Attorney\u2019s Office.1051 They contend that the approach of previous tribunals to determining whether a taking is sufficiently long-lasting to amount to an expropriation is \"flexible.\"1052 For example, in *S.D. Myers v Canada* the tribunal said that \"in some contexts and circumstances, it would be appropriate to view a deprivation as amounting to an expropriation, even if it were partial or temporary.\"1053 Further, the Claimants distinguish the two examples proffered by the Respondent of properties regained by individuals after Croatia had registered itself, as they involve no corporate law elements, no bankruptcy proceedings, no bad faith negotiations and no involvement of public officials.1054 Irrespectively, the Claimants contend, the BIT itself has no requirement that the Claimants must exhaust local remedies.1055\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 909.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 910.\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v Government of Canada*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 November 2000 (RL-0109), \u00b6 283.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 913, *referring to* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 484.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 914.\n\n921.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"[t]he question is whether or not [the] Respondent used Article 362(3) to register its ownership over real property that was, as a matter of Croatian law, property of [the Second Claimant].\"1056 If so, Article 4(1) of the BIT requires that the Second Claimant be compensated, irrespective of whether the taking occurred in accordance with domestic law and/or in good faith.1057\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 100.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 100.\n\n922.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that a registration under Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act is expropriatory. The practical effect of a registration under Article 362(3) is that the Respondent has claimed ownership for itself over the relevant Properties, such ownership not being limited in time or in any other way.\n\n923.\n\nIn most cases where a State takes the assets of a private person, that person may approach a local court to seek redress; the fact that the Respondent\u2019s ownership in accordance with Article 362(3) acts as a presumption is no different. The Respondent\u2019s assertion of ownership is complete and will not be reversed without further action and in that sense, it has the essential requirement of an expropriation. Save for the Respondent determining of its own volition that it will return the property taken in accordance with Article 362(3), the Claimants\u2019 only path to the return of the property is through the domestic courts. As correctly stated by the Claimants, and as set out previously, there is no requirement under the BIT that the Claimants exhaust local remedies.\n\n924.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s arguments based on denial of justice are ill-founded. There is no requirement that the Claimants show that the court decisions registering ownership in accordance with Article 362(3) are such that they constitute a satisfaction of the denial of justice standard. The expropriatory act here was the Respondent *seeking* and then obtaining the registration of ownership of the relevant plots in its name.\n\n925.\n\nThis case is not analogous to that in *Azinian v Mexico*. In that case, the State contended that under its laws a contract was null and void. This decision was then the subject of three separate levels of judicial review and found to be so. The tribunal in that case determined that in such a case there could be no question of expropriation without also impeaching the conduct of the court system.1058 In the instant case, the Respondent transferred the Claimants\u2019 Taken Plots to itself. The mechanism by which it did so involved an *ex parte* application to the Croatian courts.\n\n*Azinian v Mexico* (CL-0077), \u00b6\u00b6 99 *et seq*.\n\n926.\n\nAs stated by the Claimants, as set out above, the question is whether the Respondent used Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act to register its ownership over real property that was, as a matter of Croatian law, property of the Second Claimant. To this question, the Tribunal answers \"yes.\"\n\n***b. The Water Act and the Roads Acts***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n927.\n\nThere is a commonality between the Respondent\u2019s registrations under the Water Act and the Roads Acts, insofar as the Tribunal has found that both pieces of legislation in force at the time of the Purchase Agreement did not act as an impediment to private ownership of the relevant plots.\n\n928.\n\nGiven that finding, the transfer of ownership and subsequent registration of the Respondent\u2019s ownership under these acts had the effect of depriving the Second Claimant of the relevant Taken Plots. The acts are by their very nature expropriatory.\n\n***c. Local Self-Government Act, Prohibition on Disposal Law, State Property Management Act and Agricultural Land Act***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n929.\n\nIn relation to the Local Self-Government Act and Prohibition on Disposal Law, the Respondent contends that those registrations were valid as the Five Companies never had title to the relevant plots.1059 Given the Tribunal\u2019s findings on ownership, that position is incorrect. This position is equally applicable to the State Property Management Act.1060\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 447, 453.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 449-450 and Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 135-136; the Respondent contends that these plots were registered in the name of \"Zvijezda\" Zagreb. As set out at paragraph 696 *supra*, the Tribunal has found that Zvijezda is a predecessor of the Second Claimant.\n\n930.\n\nIn relation to the Taken Plots taken under the Agricultural Land Act, where the Tribunal has found that such plots were not in fact agricultural, as outlined above, the Respondent\u2019s actions were based on an equally incorrect premise.\n\n931.\n\nConsistently with the Tribunal\u2019s decision above in relation to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act, the true question is whether the Respondent registered its ownership over real property that was, as a matter of Croatian law, property of the Second Claimant. Again, the Tribunal answers \"yes.\"\n\n***d. Unknown***\n----------------\n\n932.\n\nFor the Taken Plots for which the basis of the Respondent\u2019s registered ownership is unknown, the Tribunal can only conclude that such registration was expropriatory in circumstances where the Second Claimant was the owner of those plots.\n\n933.\n\nIn conclusion, in each case where the Respondent has registered itself as owner over a plot of land which the Tribunal has found was owned by the Second Claimant, the Tribunal finds that such registration was expropriatory.\n\n***Issue 6.1(b): Has the Respondent indirectly expropriated the Claimants\u2019 property rights by the following?***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n934.\n\nThe Claimants submit that in respect of the plots over which the Respondent has not registered ownership, the Respondent has indirectly expropriated the Claimants\u2019 property rights as it has deprived the Claimants of the ability to register the Second Claimant\u2019s ownership.1061\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 935.\n\n935.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s findings in relation to identifying the relevant property of the Second Claimant, and its finding in relation to direct expropriation above, this argument can only be relevant in relation to the Remaining Plots.\n\n936.\n\nThe Claimants rely on *Alpha Projekholding v Ukraine*, in which the tribunal said that \"in order to establish an indirect expropriation of this sort, it is necessary to demonstrate that the investment has been deprived of a significant part of its value.\"1062 They further rely on *RosInvestCo v Russia* : \"A measure constitutes an expropriation if it has the effect of a substantial deprivation of property forming all or a material part of the investment, and if the measure is attributable to Respondent.\"1063\n\n*Alpha Projekholding GmbH v Ukraine*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/16, Award, 8 November 2010 (***Alpha Projekholding v Ukraine***) (CL-0116), \u00b6 408.\n\n*RosInvestCo v Russia* (CL-0175), \u00b6 623\n\n937.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the relevant standard is met by reason of the Respondent\u2019s measures: without registration of their ownership, the Second Claimant cannot dispose of the Remaining Plots or offer them as collateral for mortgages, which has significantly decreased their value.1064 It is important to note that, according to Dr Ernst:\n\n*Neither the decisions denying the claimant\u2019s registration nor granting registration to the respondent or the* [Croatian Privatisation Fund] *extinguished any ownership to the assets they received via universal succession of the five bankrupt companies. They rendered or maintained the claimant\u2019s ownership unpublicized (invisible in the register) to all third parties, thus making its position difficult both in any dealings with third parties requiring evidence of ownership, and in exercising its (unregistered) ownership*.1065\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 938.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 250(v).\n\n938.\n\nOn review of the evidence of Ms Gulam, it is apparent that in relation to the Remaining Plots, the Claimants have not attempted to register them, either by land registry proceedings or by contentious proceedings. Similarly, the Respondent has made no move to register the Remaining Plots.\n\n939.\n\nIn the above circumstances, the Claimants point to three acts of the Respondent which are said to constitute indirect expropriation, namely:\n\n(a) failing to facilitate the registration of the properties;\n\n(b) interfering with the Claimants\u2019 attempts to register ownership of the properties; and\n\n(c) failing to negotiate in good faith with the Claimants regarding the ownership and registration of the properties.1066\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 939-941.\n\n940.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that even in circumstances where none of the above actions are considered expropriatory, in combination they have that effect.1067\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 942-943.\n\n*Issue 6.1(b)(i): Has the Respondent indirectly expropriated the Claimants\u2019 property rights by failing to facilitate the registration of the properties?*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n941.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s failure to facilitate the registration is expropriatory in circumstances where such facilitation \"is the only means through which such registration would be possible.\"1068 The Claimants seek to rely on Dr Ernst in this position. A review of Dr Ernst\u2019s evidence clearly shows that an alternative to the Respondent\u2019s facilitation would have been \"a declaratory judgment issued by a court in civil litigation.\"1069 As stated by the Respondent, even in circumstances where the Claimants were unsuccessful in land registry proceedings, they were referred by the relevant court to civil contentious proceedings.1070\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 939.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 250(vi).\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 620.\n\n942.\n\nIn such circumstances, a failure to facilitate in this context cannot be seen as an indirect expropriation of the Remaining Plots as it had no effect on the Claimants\u2019 rights or property in the Remaining Plots. There is no principle which the Claimants have identified that requires a State to vindicate or confirm investors\u2019 rights in circumstances where the investors\u2019 themselves do not seek to confirm those rights before the courts of the State.\n\n*Issue 6.1(b)(ii): Has the Respondent indirectly expropriated the Claimants\u2019 property rights by interfering with the Claimants\u2019 attempts to register ownership over the Properties?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n943.\n\nThe Claimants point to actions of Holding d.o.o. and the Croatian Fund which they submit constituted interference with their registration over the Properties.1071 The actions of Holding d.o.o. and the Croatian Fund are analysed in detail below in relation to legitimate expectations. For the purposes of indirect expropriation, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to note that no action complained of had the effect of preventing the Claimants from initiating court proceedings in relation to the Remaining Plots, which was a path which the Claimants did not follow. The Claimants\u2019 contention that in the absence of such interference they would have been able to register the plots1072 has no basis in circumstances where the Claimants did not attempt to do so. There is no relevant conduct which has had an effect on the property of the Claimants consisting of the Remaining Plots.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 940.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 940.\n\n*Issue 6.1(b)(iii): Has the Respondent indirectly expropriated the Claimants\u2019 property rights by failing to negotiate in good faith with the Claimants regarding the ownership and registration of the Properties?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n944.\n\nThe Tribunal discusses below the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Respondent failed to negotiate in relation to legitimate expectations. For the purposes of indirect expropriation, it is sufficient to state, as found below, that the Tribunal does not find that the Respondent failed to negotiate in good faith.\n\n*Issue 6.1(b)(iv): Has the Respondent indirectly expropriated the Claimants\u2019 property rights by a combination of the above actions or omissions of the Respondent?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n945.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s findings that: (i) there has been no relevant failure to facilitate registration; (ii) no relevant interference in the Claimants\u2019 registration attempts; and (iii) no failure to negotiate in good faith, the Claimants\u2019 claim for indirect expropriation must fail.\n\n**ISSUE 6.2: HAS THE RESPONDENT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY EXPROPRIATED THE CLAIMANTS' CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS, IF ANY, UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n946.\n\nAs set at Issue 4.1 *supra*, there are no independent contractual rights to specific property in favour of the Claimants present in the Purchase Agreement. To the extent that the Claimants seek damages relating to property which does not constitute the Claimants\u2019 Plots, such a claim must fail. There are simply no relevant contractual rights capable of expropriation as set out in the Purchase Agreement.\n\n**ISSUE 6.3: IF THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPROPRIATION, IS IT IN BREACH OF ARTICLE 4(1) OF THE BIT?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n947.\n\nIn order to comply with the requirements of Article 4(1) of the BIT, any expropriation must be: (i) for public purpose; (ii) accorded due process of law; and (iii) against compensation.1073 Such requirements are cumulative.1074\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 954.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 955, *citing*, *e.g.*, *Siag v Egypt* (CL-0060), \u00b6 428.\n\n948.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent has failed to comply with any of the conditions in Article 4(1);1075 accordingly, the expropriation is alleged to be in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 956.\n\n949.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that no compensation has been paid, or offered, by the Respondent. On that basis alone, and on the Tribunal\u2019s findings above, the Respondent\u2019s expropriation of the Taken Plots was in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\n**XI. ISSUE 5: MERITS - FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n950.\n\nPrior to turning to FET, the Tribunal notes that as the Claimants have been successful in relation to the Taken Plots on the basis of expropriation, there is no utility in considering any claim in relation to those plots under alternative causes of action such as FET, and the Tribunal does not do so. The following analysis applies to those plots of land other than the Taken Plots, namely the Remaining Plots.\n\n**ISSUE 5.1: IS BREACH OF A LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION A FAILURE TO ACCORD \"FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT\"?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n951.\n\nThe most common distillation of the FET standard is that a host State that has promised FET to foreign investors must \"provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment.\"1076 Legitimate expectations do not necessarily require an explicit promise from the State or a promise directed exclusively at the investor. For example, an investor may legitimately expect a State to act in a consistent and reasonable manner and not renege on terms agreed by a State\u2019s own organs.1077 Nor is there a requirement that legitimate expectations be based on a legally enforceable right.1078\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 745-747, *citing* *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003 (***Tecmed v Mexico***) (CL-0041), \u00b6 154. *See also* *Eureko B.V. v Republic of Poland*, *ad hoc* Arbitration, Partial Award, 19 August 2005 (***Eureko v Poland***) (CL-0047), \u00b6 235; *EDF v Romania* (CL-0048), \u00b6 216; *Toto Construzioni Generali S.p.A. v Republic of Lebanon*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/12, Award, 7 June 2012 (***Toto v Lebanon***) (CL-0049), \u00b6 152; *MTD Equity Sdn.

First, legitimate expectations must be based on a legally enforceable right.1081 Second, certain expectations are properly dealt with in domestic law and do not amount to expectations protected at the international level.1082 Third, any expectations must be reasonable, which imports an objective element.1083 Fourth, the existence of legitimate expectations and the existence of contractual rights are different issues.1084\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 675-715.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 670-671.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 684-685.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 698.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 536-540.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n954.\n\nIn an oft-cited passage,1085 the tribunal in *Tecmed v Mexico* said that the FET standard requires the contracting parties to provide \"treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment.\"1086 In *El Paso v Argentina* the tribunal referred to \"an overwhelming trend to consider the touchstone of fair and equitable treatment to be found in the legitimate and reasonable expectations of the Parties, which derive from the obligation of good faith.\"1087\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Eureko v Poland* (CL-0047), \u00b6 235, *Toto v Lebanon* (CL-0049), \u00b6 152; *MTD v Chile* (CL-0050), \u00b6 114.\n\n*Tecmed v Mexico* (CL-0041), \u00b6 154.\n\n*El Paso v Argentina* (CL-0053), \u00b6 348. *See also* *EDF v Romania* (CL-0048), \u00b6 216.\n\n955.\n\nAccordingly, it can be said that the breach of a legitimate and reasonable expectation may give rise to a violation of the FET standard, taking into account the scope of the undertaking of FET in the applicable treaty. The Respondent\u2019s submissions rightly proceed on this basis. Precisely what constitutes \"a legitimate and reasonable expectation\" is a separate question.\n\n956.\n\nLegitimate expectations founded on specific assurances or representations made by the State to the investor are protected.1088 The reasonableness of an asserted expectation is to be determined objectively at the time the investment is made, with due regard to the circumstances of the case.1089 Legitimate expectations with respect to consistency and due process in State actions and relations may also be protected,1090 although subject to qualifications. There is little utility in further consideration of this proposition in the abstract; it is a question to be considered by close reference to the factual and evidentiary matrix.\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, 16 December 2002 (***Feldman v Mexico***) (CL-0085), \u00b6 148: \"The facts, and the reasonableness of the Claimant\u2019s reliance in *Metalclad*, are thus quite different from the instant case.

Rather, numerous investor-State tribunals have found that State conduct at the time the investment was acquired can also give rise to legitimate expectations.1092\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 751.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 752, *citing* *Kardassopoulos v Georgia* (CL-0117), \u00b6 191.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n958.\n\nThe Respondent argues that any supposed breach of FET that is premised on an existing property right by definition fails if that right does not exist.1093 It cites *LG&E v Argentina* where it was said that one characteristic of an investor\u2019s fair expectations is that \"they must exist and be enforceable by law.\"1094\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 523; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 670.\n\n*LG&E v Argentina* (CL-0081), \u00b6 130.\n\n959.\n\nIn this case, registration of the Properties by the Respondent cannot be unfair when the Claimants had no title. Nor can the Croatian court decisions denying the Claimants\u2019 registrations be inequitable where the Claimants did not have title to register. Similarly, the registration or sale of the Apartments is not unjust if the Claimants never had a valid claim to the se.1095\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 524; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 671.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n960.\n\nThe Claimants concede that there can be no claim for direct or indirect expropriation with respect to plots that the Respondent acquired prior to the Purchase Agreement.1096 However, the Claimants contend that, under the FET standard, the status of the property under domestic law is irrelevant. The question in the legitimate expectation context is, in this particular case: Was there a legitimate expectation the investor had that he was acquiring the asset concerned?1097\n\nTr Day 10, 2417:13-2418:11.\n\nTr Day 10, 2418:12-2418:4.\n\n961.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s unfair and inequitable treatment \"relates most notably to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s registration of real property that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 reasonably and legitimately believed belonged to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. at the time of his purchase.\"1098 In addition, the Claimants say that they had legitimate expectations that the Respondent \"would recognise Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s purchase of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., treat it fairly and reasonably, and not take actions to undermine that purchase arbitrarily, or in bad faith, including the coercive and harassing strategies adopted by [the] Respondent in response to commencing this Arbitration.\"1099\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 755.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 756.\n\n962.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants must show that there was a representation made by the judiciary to the effect that the Claimants are entitled to the claimed property, but there is no such specific representation in the documents on which they rely.1100\n\nTr Day 10, 2416:11-2417:6.\n\n963.\n\nA legitimate expectation does not necessarily depend on the existence of a contractual or property right under domestic law. A State may be taken to have made specific assurances and representations as to the validity of an agreement and the representations and warranties set forth therein.\n\n964.\n\nIn *Kardassopoulos v Georgia*, the tribunal found that the State could not avoid the legal effect of the joint venture agreement and the concession by arguing that they were void *ab initio* under domestic law.1101 It was immaterial whether the two entities that contracted with the claimant were authorised to grant the rights contemplated by the joint venture agreement and the concession, or whether or not they otherwise acted beyond their authority under domestic law, as both entities were an organ of the State or an entity empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority within the meaning of ILC Article 7 and the conduct in question was attributable to the State.1102 The tribunal held that the respondent created a legitimate expectation for the claimant that his investment was made in accordance with domestic l aw.1103\n\n*Kardassopoulos v Georgia* (CL-0117), \u00b6 191.\n\n*Kardassopoulos v Georgia* (CL-0117), \u00b6 190.\n\n*Kardassopoulos v Georgia* (CL-0117), \u00b6 192.\n\n965.\n\nHowever, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, in the present case, there can be no legitimate expectation in respect to the Properties to which the Claimants have no property or contractual right. This follows from the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion on Issue 5.3(a) *infra* that there was no legitimate or reasonable basis for an expectation that the Claimants were to acquire each of the claimed properties at the time the Purchase Agreement was signed. *Kardassopoulos v Georgia* is distinguishable for reasons articulated below.\n\n**ISSUE 5.3: HAS THE RESPONDENT BREACHED THE OBLIGATION TO AFFORD THE CLAIMANTS' INVESTMENTS FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT UNDER ARTICLE 2(1) OF THE BIT?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Issue 5.3(a): Did the Claimants have a legitimate expectation that the Second Claimant would be able to register ownership over the Properties?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n966.\n\nThe Claimants say that the record in this case unequivocally demonstrates that, at the time Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 purchased the Five Companies \"all relevant actors believed that the Five Companies owned the real estate related to their functions.\"1104 Therefore, the Claimants contend, they had \"a legitimate expectation that [Croatia] would register [the Claimants'] ownership over such real estate.\"1105\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 757.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 757.\n\n967.\n\nThe Claimants also point to events after the signing of the Purchase Agreement, but before Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 paid the purchase price, that are said to validate the legitimacy of their expectations.1106\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 766-770.\n\n968.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the proper date to consider for the formation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s legitimate expectations is March 1992 when the purchase price was paid.1107 If the Respondent had made clear to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 before that point that the Five Companies in fact did not own any property, the Claimants say it would be farcical to suppose that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 would still have gone through with the purchase.1108\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 787.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 788.\n\n969.\n\nThe belief of the relevant actors is said to rest on the following evidence:1109\n\n(a) The Five Companies were provided \"for the purpose of [their] founding and functioning [\u2026] objects, means of production and other means of work\" in specified dinar amounts,1110 and were registered with these same amounts of capital \"in things.\"1111\n\n(b) The Bankruptcy Court repeatedly mentions the real estate owned by the Five Companies, for example noting that \"the entire property of the [Five Companies]\" was located in Petrinja.1112\n\n(c) The Bankruptcy Court agreed to grant Bankhaus Feichtner security interests in real estate owned by the Five Companies.1113\n\n(d) The Purchase Agreement specifically sets forth that part of the amounts of the purchase price of each LLC were set aside for real estate.1114\n\n(e) In its approval of the Purchase Agreement, the Bankruptcy Court again acknowledged that the Five Companies owned real estate stating: \"this property in its greatest part is still not available to [the First Claimant] and is situated out of the reach of the Croatian authorities because it is under occupation of the Serb aggressor and it is a well known fact that the biggest part of the factory in Petrinja as well as the real estate and facilities of the company [Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture] have been destroyed.\"1115\n\n(f) The Liquidator and Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 concluded the Record, setting forth in detail the real estate assets of the Five Companies.1116\n\n(g) With the Record the Liquidator delivered the Asset List\u2014lists of the assets of the Five Companies taken from the Six Socialist Companies\u2019 internal records\u2014 which included many pieces of real estate among those assets.1117\n\n(h) In February 1992, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed that a warehouse in Rijeka formed part of the bankruptcy estate of Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce.1118 In the same month, the Bankruptcy Court also confirmed:\n\n[T]*he entire assets which had belonged to* [the Five Companies] *over which the bankruptcy proceedings had been conducted belongs to the Company* [Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.] [...] *That means that the real estate regarding which the civil proceeding has been conducted before this Court* [...] *also belongs to the Company* [Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.].1119\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 105;

However, even if Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 does not have a vested right in the claimed properties, the relevant question is whether Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 legitimately relied on Croatia\u2019s representations.1123\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 771-773.\n\n973.\n\nThe Claimants refer to *Kardassopoulos v Georgia* as instructive. There the tribunal observed:\n\n[The State] *cannot simply avoid the legal effect of the representations and warranties set forth in the JVA and the Concession by arguing that they are contained in agreements which are void ab initio under Georgian law. The assurances given to Claimant regarding the validity of the JVA and the Concession were endorsed by the Government itself, and some of the most senior Government officials of Georgia* [\u2026] [and] *was signed and \"ratified\" by the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, an organ of the Republic of Georgia.*1124\n\n*Kardassopoulos v Georgia* (CL-0117), \u00b6 191.\n\n974.\n\nAs such, the tribunal held that Georgia created a legitimate expectation for the claimant that his investment was made in accordance with Georgian law. Similarly, according to the Claimants, whether or not the Five Companies had a \"vested right\" to the claimed properties, the Respondent\u2019s representations made before, during, and after, the execution of the Purchase Agreement created a legitimate expectation that this was the case.1125\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 777-779.\n\n975.\n\nSecond, taking into account the specific circumstances of the case,1126 the purchase price was not too low to prohibit a legitimate expectation that the Five Companies owned the claimed properties. Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 purchased the Five Companies from a newly-formed State that was losing the fight for its independence against a larger adversary, and the only way the purchase would include rights over the majority of the claimed properties was if Croatia managed to retake the territory it had already lost.1127 This is shown by the fact that the Court provided two opportunities to the public to make a bid, and no other bids were received.1128\n\n*See Oostergetel v Slovakia* (RL-0081), \u00b6 224.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 780-784.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 65.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n976.\n\nLegitimate expectations depend on express, specific and unambiguous assurances made by the host State that are relied upon by the investor to make an investment.1129 In order to be protected by the FET standard, legitimate expectations must be in place at the time the investment is made.1130\n\n*See* footnote 1088 *supra*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 688-690.\n\n977.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 made the decision to invest on 3 October 1991 when he submitted his bid for the Five Companies, or at the latest, on 11 November 1991 when he entered into the Purchase Agreement.1131 Aside from the Purchase Agreement, the Claimants have identified only one document allegedly containing a pre-investment representation: the sale notice of the Five Companies.1132 The Respondent argues that neither the Purchase Agreement, nor any other document or statement, provided Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 with legitimate expectations regarding the Five Companies\u2019 alleged title to or ability to register the claimed properties.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 691.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 691.\n\n978.\n\nAs to the Purchase Agreement, first, it was obtained through illegality and cannot be given effect. Second, the Purchase Agreement is limited to the Five Companies sold as legal persons, and contains no obligations in respect of any property, let alone the 3,717 claimed plots.1133 Third, any representations made under the Purchase Agreement, in particular by the Liquidator, are not attributable to Croatia.1134 Fourth, even assuming obligations are undertaken by Croatia itself under the Purchase Agreement (which is denied), certain expectations are properly dealt with in domestic law and do not amount to expectations protected at the international level.1135 The Respondent posits that \"[i]t is difficult to imagine how any expectation the First Claimant could legitimately harbour could not be dealt with at the domestic level as the Purchase Agreement mandates.\"1136\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 679.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 681-683.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 684-685.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 685.\n\n979.\n\nAs to the other documents on which a legitimate expectation may rest, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not singled out one representation by the Respondent concerning the Five Companies\u2019 alleged title to the claimed plots. None of the documents, including the notice of sale of the Five Companies, the bid, the Record, the Asset List, the Resolution, the court decision of 16 December 1992 and the six court decisions from 1992 to 1995 relating to six apartments, contain express, specific and unambiguous commitments capable of giving rise to legitimate expectations regarding the claimed plots.1137 Similar to the Purchase Agreement, the Respondent argues, the reference in the notice of sale to \"each bankruptcy debtor (real estate, equipment and inventory [\u2026])\" is an indication that the Five Companies were sold as legal entities and the offeror should therefore place his bid for the companies as a whole with everything they own, although there is no indication of what the companies own, and no representation that they have registrable title to property.1138\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 691-697; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 193-195.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 692.\n\n980.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues that any alleged expectations were not legitimate. Any expectations must be reasonable, which imports an objective element.1139 The laws and conditions governing the area in which an investment is made constitute the foundations on which any reasonable expectations must be based.1140 In addition, the Respondent stresses that tribunals have repeatedly treated an investor\u2019s ignorance of the applicable legal regime or the application of that regime to the investment as a failure of due diligence and as a factor relevant to the legitimacy of any alleged expectations.1141\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 698.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 699-700.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 701-702.\n\n981.\n\nAgainst this background, the Respondent states that the Claimants\u2019 professed expectations are subjective and unreasonable, and therefore not protected by the BIT. First, the purchase price of EUR 1.5 million for the Five Companies, of which EUR 255,000.00 was allocated for real estate, was \"derisory\" considering the value of the companies and the claimed properties.1142 Second, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 purchased the Five Companies at a time when Croatia was undergoing a transition that involved a \"radical transformation\" from a property and corporate system based on social ownership to one based on private ownership.1143 The Respondent also suggests that the property relations of the Five Companies purchased by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 were particularly complex.1144 Notwithstanding the complex legal environment, according to the Respondent, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 purchased the Five Companies \"without conducting the most rudimentary due diligence.\"1145\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 704-705.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 706.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 707.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 708.\n\n982.\n\nFinally, the Claimants do not assert that the Respondent violated domestic law, domestic procedure or domestic notions of due process in failing to recognise the Claimants\u2019 investment.1146 In effect, the Claimants are alleging that they had a legitimate expectation that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. would be able to register title to the claimed plots, notwithstanding that such registrations would have been contrary to Croatian law.1147\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 712, *citing* Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 638, 640.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 192.\n\n983.\n\nThe Respondent contends that there can therefore be no violation of a legitimate or reasonable expectation, as the Claimants accept that Croatia\u2019s registrations, Croatian court decisions denying the Claimants\u2019 registration and Croatia\u2019s registration and/or sale of certain claimed apartments was in accordance with Croatian law and procedure.1148\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 713-715.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n984.\n\nAs set out above, legitimate expectations depend on specific assurances or representations made by the State to the investor, which are relied upon by the investor at the time of making the investment.1149\n\n*See* Issue 5.1 *supra*.\n\n985.\n\nIn *Saluka v Czech Republic*, the tribunal stated that \"the scope of the Treaty\u2019s protection of foreign investment against unfair and inequitable treatment cannot exclusively be determined by foreign investors\u2019 subjective motivations and considerations. Their expectations, in order for them to be protected, must rise to the level of legitimacy and reasonableness *in light of the circumstances*.\"1150 In *National Grid v Argentina*, the tribunal clarified that \"[t]he protection of investor expectations has been made subject to two significant qualifications: first, that the investor should not be shielded from the ordinary business risk of the investment and, second, that the investor\u2019s expectations must have been reasonable and legitimate in the context in which the investment was made.\"1151 Merely not living up to expectations does not amount to a breach of the FET standard.1152\n\n*Saluka v Czech Republic* (CL-0042), \u00b6 304 (emphasis in original).\n\n*National Grid p.l.c. v Argentine Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award, 3 November 2008 (CL-0094), \u00b6 175.\n\n*Glamis v USA* (CL-0095), \u00b6 620.\n\n986.\n\nAn evaluation of the reasonableness of an investor\u2019s expectations will also take into account the due diligence performed before effecting the investment.1153\n\n*Biwater v Tanzania* (RL-0117), \u00b6 601; *Investmart v Czech Republic* (CL-0182), \u00b6 254; *Lemire v Ukraine*, Jurisdiction and Liability (CL-0061), \u00b6 285.\n\n987.\n\nThe circumstances in the State at the time of the investment are also of import. In *Mamidoil v Albania*, the tribunal found that \"[a]n investor may have been entitled to rely on Albania\u2019s efforts to live up to its obligations under international treaties, but that investor was not entitled to believe that these effort [sic] would generate the same results of stability as in Great Britain, USA, or Japan.\"1154 Similarly, in *Parkerings-Compagniet v Lithuania* the tribunal opined that \"it would have been foolish for an investor in Lithuania to believe, at that time, that it would be proceeding on stable legal ground, as considerable changes in the Lithuanian political regime and economy were undergoing.\"1155\n\n*Mamidoil v Albania* (RL-0180), \u00b6 626.\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS v Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007 (***Parkerings-Compagniet v Lithuania***) (CL-0084), \u00b6 306.\n\n988.\n\nAccordingly, in analysing whether the Claimants had a legitimate expectation that the Second Claimant would be able to register ownership over the claimed properties, the Tribunal first examines what was known at the time of the investment; second, any specific assurances or representations made; and, third, the circumstances of the case.\n\n989.\n\nAs to the first, the Tribunal must determine the time at which the investor\u2019s expectations are to be considered. It is well-established that the expectations to be taken into account are those existing at the time when the investment is made.1156 The Parties were *ad idem* on this point, although they disagree on when that point of time was.1157\n\n*Lemire v Ukraine*, Jurisdiction and Liability (CL-0061), \u00b6 264 (\"The FET standard is thus closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations - actions or omissions by Ukraine are contrary to the FET standard if they frustrate legitimate and reasonable expectations on which the investor relied at the time when he made the investment.\"); *Bayindir v Pakistan* (CL-0034), \u00b6\u00b6 190-191.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 622; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 688-689. *See also* Tr Day 1, 107:11-12 (Claimants\u2019 Opening Statement: \"He had this expectation when he made the bankruptcy purchase [\u2026].\").\n\n990.\n\nIn later submissions, the Claimants also contend that subsequent acts by the State or State organs can lead to an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.1158 This proposition is not consistent with the commonly understood basis of any legitimate expectations: the conditions offered by the host State at the time of the investment. It is also contrary to their earlier acceptance, including that it would be \"improper[] [to] look[] beyond the time when [Mr Gavrilovi\u0107] made [his] investment\",1159 and unsupported by the case law cited by the Claimants. In *Arif v Moldova*, the tribunal said that \"[a]s the investment increased and matured, the consequences of any failure to fulfil the legitimate expectations became increasingly severe.\"1160 This passage is consistent with the notion that expectations are to be assessed at the time the investment is made; it simply adds that the *implications* for the State\u2019s obligations under the FET standard may not be the same when a legitimate expectation is breached at the commencement of the investment, as when the investment is well advanced. In the passage of *Metaclad v Mexico* cited by the Claimants, the tribunal held that the claimant \"was entitled to rely on the representations of federal officials and to believe that it was entitled to continue its construction of the landfill.\"1161 That an expectation may be forward-looking is similarly consistent with the view that the investor\u2019s expectations are to be assessed at the time the investment is made.

The notice of sale of the Five Companies was published in the daily newspaper on 28 September 1991.1162 On 3 October 1991, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 submitted his bid to the Bankruptcy Court.1163 In accordance with the authorisation from the Bankruptcy Court,1164 the Purchase Agreement was executed on 11 November 1991.1165 Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was entered into the court register as owner of the Five Companies on 22 November 1991. On 5 March 1992, the Bankruptcy Liquidator issued the Record,1166 and also provided the Asset List dated 30 June 1991.1167 Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 then paid the purchase price with the assistance of the loan received from Minister Martinovi\u0107.1168\n\nA copy of the announcement of the sale of the Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Companies in *Vecernji list* can be found in the Confirmation issued by the Chairman of the Bankruptcy Council, Judge Branimir Majanovic, on 3 December 1992 (C-0039).\n\nBankruptcy Bid (C-0043).\n\nNovember 1991 Bankruptcy Ruling (C-0042).\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047).\n\nRecord (C-0049).\n\nAsset List (C-0050).\n\nLoan Agreement (C-0216); Amendment Agreement (C-0217).\n\n992.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s payment of the purchase price was expressly conditioned on the receipt of a list of the real estate of the Five Companies, pointing out that he did not pay the purchase price until March 1992, after he received the Record.1169 The Claimants say that this was agreed at the meeting of 11 February 1992. However, the Minutes do not establish that the payment of the purchase price was conditional on production of such a list of company assets. Under the Purchase Agreement, the agreed price was to be paid within 90 days.1170 The Minutes are not properly considered a variation to the Purchase Agreement, nor the eventual Record.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 51.\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047), Art 5.\n\n993.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the investment was made at the time the Purchase Agreement was signed, on 11 November 1991. The bid was a mere offer, which required acceptance and approval from the Bankruptcy Court and formalisation of an agreement. Following execution of the Purchase Agreement, the parties\u2019 obligations and entitlements were enlivened, including Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s obligation to pay the purchase1171 price.\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047), Art 5.\n\n994.\n\nIt is now helpful to elucidate what was known at the time of the investment, and any specific representations or assurances to the Claimants regarding the claimed properties and any entitlement to register ownership that are apparent from the same.\n\n995.\n\nThe Resolution of 23 April 1991 organising the new companies makes passing reference to \"assets\" of the Five Companies.1172 The annexures record the value of the non-material and material investments according to each company. The Respondent says that the Resolution was an internal document that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 would not have seen, as he was neither an employee, director or shareholder of Food Industry (or any other Gavrilovi\u0107 company prior to November 1991).1173 The Claimants do not appear to dispute that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was unaware of the Resolution at the time of making the investment. Even if Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 had seen the Resolution, the Tribunal considers that it merely discloses that each of the Five Companies held buildings and/or land of certain value. The Resolution does not specify the property owned by each company. Nor does it convey a representation that any purchaser of the Five Companies would be able to register ownership over each of the claimed properties.\n\nResolution (C-0015).\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 695.\n\n996.\n\nThe registry certificates allocate the nominal capital of the Five Companies \"in things.\"1174 The notice of sale of the Five Companies provides that each offeror \"should state in his offer the amount he is offering for each bankruptcy debtor (*real estate*, equipment and inventory at the moment of submitting the bid, i.e. conclusion of the [p]urchase and [s]ales [a]greement).\"1175\n\n*See* Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0016); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0017); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0018); Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Foreign Trade d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0019); and Registry Certificate for Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport d.o.o. dated 26 April 1991, issued by the Commercial District Court in Zagreb (C-0020).\n\nConfirmation issued by the Chairman of the Bankruptcy Council, Judge Branimir Majanovic, on 3 December 1992 (C-0039) (emphasis added).\n\n997.\n\nMr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s bid referred to real estate, including \"the factory and business buildings\", \"the building of the old factory\" and the \"business administration buildings and IT centre\" of Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry, the \"silo for fodder and the buildings\" of Gavrilovi\u0107 Agriculture, and a \"significant number of retail places\" of Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce.1176 In relation to the retail places, the bid continues, \"only 3 shops in Zagreb are in [Gavrilovi\u0107 Commerce's] ownership, while all other shops are leased or located on the territory outside Croatia. All shops outside Croatia are out of the current owner\u2019s reach, and most of them were expropriated by way of founding independent companies by the local workers in those shops.\"1177 In relation to Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport, the bid notes that the assets of the company \"consist only of trucks.\" While indicative of the fact that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 believed that the purchaser of the Five Companies would acquire property, as reflected in these general descriptions, this document is not a specific representation or assurance by the Respondent in respect of each (or any) of the claimed properties.\n\nBankruptcy Bid (C-0043).\n\nBankruptcy Bid (C-0043), p 3.\n\n998.\n\nThe decision of the Bankruptcy Court placing the Five Companies in bankruptcy1178 makes broad reference to the \"property\" and \"real estate\" of the Five Companies.\n\nSeptember 1991 Bankruptcy Ruling (C-0035), p 3.\n\n999.\n\nThe Purchase Agreement provides for the purchase of the Five Companies \"as legal entities together with the entire assets which belong to these companies as legal entities.\"1179 The Purchase Agreement does not specify what those assets are, nor specify the precise claimed plots or claimed properties. Under the Purchase Agreement, DEM 500,000.00 is allocated to real estate, but there is no indication of what that real estate comprises. Article 6 provides that \"[t]he Buyer will take over the companies from Article 2 of this Agreement after the conclusion of the Agreement when it will be objectively possible considering the existing circumstances, and the contractual parties will make a separate record on that.\"1180\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047), Art 3.\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047), Art 6.\n\n1000.\n\nThe decision of the Bankruptcy Court also made broad reference to the \"property\" and \"real estate\" of the Five Companies, and provided that the Liquidator \"is allowed to conclude the Purchase Agreement with [Mr Gavrilovi\u0107] [\u2026] on the sales of the [Five Companies] as legal entities.\"1181\n\nNovember 1991 Bankruptcy Ruling (C-0042). *See also* Purchase Agreement (C-0047), Art 1.\n\n1001.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave its consent to the Purchase Agreement,1182 as required by the Foreign Investment Act because of the foreign nationality of the buyer, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107. The approval does not amount to any assurance or representation as to the legal effect of the terms of the Purchase Agreement, including any entitlement to register ownership over the claimed properties.\n\nApproval of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, File No 521-0607/91-2366 dated 14 November 1991 (C-0048).\n\n1002.\n\nFor completeness, the Tribunal notes the following documents and alleged representations that were issued after the investment was made, that is, after 11 November 1991.\n\n1003.\n\nThe Record was issued to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 on 5 March 1992, together with the Asset List. The Respondent says it is evident that the Record is not that envisaged by Article 6 of the Purchase Agreement from the fact that: (i) the Record makes no reference to Article 6, and (ii) the Record itself acknowledges to be a \"confirmation of the delivery of the possession and ownership over [certain] property [\u2026]\" and not, as envisaged by Article 6 of the Purchase Agreement, a record regarding the taking over of the Five Companies.1183 In fact, according to the Respondent, the record envisaged by Article 6 of the Purchase Agreement was included in the Minutes of the Bankruptcy Court, which refer to the \"handing over of the company 'Gavrilovi\u0107' under bankruptcy pursuant to Article 6 of the [Purchase Agreement].\"1184 Those Minutes record, amongst other things, the \"possibility of taking over the purchased companies [\u2026].\" This view is supported by the Bankruptcy Report which describes the \"record of the delivery of the [Five Companies]\" by reference to a record that sets out the proportions in which the companies could be delivered,1185 which is also contained in the Minutes.1186 The Respondent also notes in its Post-Hearing Brief that the Claimants do not appear to dispute that the Record was not the record foreseen in Article 6 of the Purchase Agreement.1187 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, at the time the investment was made, the parties to the Purchase Agreement did not foresee the production of the Record. The record envisaged in Article 6 appears to be contained in the Minutes. Further, the Record appears to have been produced as a result of the meeting of 11 February 1992, rather than in compliance with a term of the Purchase Agreement. Most importantly, at the applicable time, the parties had no precise expectation of the real estate that was the subject of the sale, or the number of properties thereof. Accordingly, it is not relevant to the assessment of the legitimacy of the expectations.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 137.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 138.\n\nFinal Bankruptcy Report (C-0036), Art 4.\n\nMinutes (R-0028), Art 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, fn 487.\n\n1004.\n\nIn relation to the Asset List, although it pre-dates the Purchase Agreement, there is no evidence that either the List or the properties listed therein were within the knowledge (or even contemplation) of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 at the time of the investment. Therefore, it is to be disregarded in considering Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s expectations.\n\n1005.\n\nThe court decisions of 5 February 19921188 and of 16 December 1992,1189 and the six court decisions from 1992 to 1995 relating to six apartments,1190 all post-date Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s investment. In any event, the decisions contain no indication or representation that the Five Companies had registrable title to all of the claimed properties.\n\nConfirmation of the Bankruptcy Court pertaining to File Nos St-102/91, St-103/91, St-104/91, St-105/91 and St-106/91 dated 5 February 1992 (C-0264).\n\nNotice regarding the 30 June 1992 decision issued by the Bankruptcy Court pertaining to File No St-105/91 dated 16 December 1992 (C-0041)\n\nConfirmation issued by the Bankruptcy Court to the Municipal Court of Sisak dated 11 February 1992 (C-0074); Decision, Municipal Court of Rijeka, 21 February 21 (C-0069); Decision, Municipal Court of Split, 26 September 2005 (C-0070); Decision, Municipal Court of Ploce, 10 March 1994 (C-0071); Decision, Municipal Court of Zadar, 12 April 1995 (C-0072); Decision, Municipal Court of Zadar, 9 June 1995 (C-0073).\n\n1006.\n\nThe Claimants also point to the decision of the Bankruptcy Court to grant Bankhaus Feichtner security interests.1191 Similarly, the document cited post-dates the Purchase Agreement, and does not further any expectation that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 acquired registrable title to all of the claimed properties.\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 389, *citing* Letter from Dr Bruno Ettanauer to Dr Zdravko Tuk\u0161a dated 17 March 1992 (C-0263).\n\n1007.\n\nThe sale notice, the bid and the Purchase Agreement each contemplated the transfer of \"real estate.\" The decisions of the Bankruptcy Court make oblique references to the property of the Five Companies. However, the Claimants have not produced any document or put forward any representation that establishes that, as at the time the Purchase Agreement was signed, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 reasonably expected that he was acquiring the claimed properties, nor the claimed plots.\n\n1008.\n\nThe instant case is distinguishable from *Kardassopoulos v Georgia* for at least two reasons. First, central to the conclusion in *Kardassopoulos* was the finding that there were specific assurances to the claimant that the joint venture agreement and the concession were valid. For example, there was an express provision in the agreement that the execution, delivery and performance of the agreement was \"duly authorized\" and \"constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation, enforceable against [the State entity]\", and there was a representation and warranty by each party that \"it is in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations of all judicial, administrative or governmental authorities or political subdivision thereof.\"1192 The concession contained similar declarations and warranties. The tribunal in *Kardassopoulos* also noted that assurances given to the claimant regarding the validity of the joint venture agreement and the concession were endorsed by the government itself.1193 The Claimants have not established any specific representation or warranty made by the Respondent that they were to purchase a registrable right to all of the claimed properties, irrespective of whether it was owned by the Five Companies at the time of purchase, and whether ownership could be established. In particular, the Purchase Agreement does not contain analogous representations, warranties, declarations or acknowledgments.\n\n*Kardassopoulos v Georgia* (CL-0117), \u00b6 186.\n\n*Kardassopoulos v Georgia* (CL-0117), \u00b6 191.\n\n1009.\n\nSecondly, and relatedly, in *Kardassopoulos* the contracting entities were an organ of the State or an entity empowered to exercise elements of the governmental authority, such that their conduct was considered an act of the State under ILC Article 7. The concession was also signed and \"ratified\" by a ministry of the respondent government. Further, some of the most senior government officials were involved in the negotiation of the agreements. There are no comparable findings on the attribution of conduct to the Respondent in the instant case. For example, the Tribunal finds that the contracting entity was not an entity within the meaning of ILC Article 7, and the Respondent is not a party to the Purchase Agreement or otherwise bound. Further, the actions of the Liquidator are not attributable to the Respondent.\n\n1010.\n\nIn result, the Tribunal finds that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 could not have legitimately or reasonably believed at the time of signing the Purchase Agreement that he would be able to register ownership over all of the claimed plots. It is on this basis that the Tribunal has concluded that the Claimants could not have a legitimate expectation in respect of property to which the Claimants have no property or contractual right.\n\n1011.\n\nThere is a further difficulty with whether Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 could reasonably have expected that he was acquiring registrable title. At the time of the investment, Croatia was in the process of transitioning from a property and corporate system based on social ownership to one based on private ownership. The Claimants\u2019 land law expert, Dr Ernst, observed that this \"was a long and complex process\" and \"[t]he proclaimed ideological shift [\u2026] was far quicker than its legal expression.\"1194 The Claimants\u2019 company law expert, Prof Dr Boric, said that from 1989 through to 1997 there was a period of \"disintegration of [...] the whole concept of socially owned enterprises.\"1195 The complexity of this transitional period is also marked in the present case in the corporate reorganisation and restructuring of the Gavrilovi\u0107 Enterprise.\n\nErnst Report, \u00b6 29, fn 77.\n\nTr Day 7, 1420:19-22 (Testimony of Prof Dr Tomislav Boric).\n\n1012.\n\nThe reasonableness of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s expectation is additionally complicated by the absence of any evidence of due diligence being performed before the execution of the Purchase Agreement. In the circumstances, the Tribunal considers that a reasonable and legitimate expectation that an investor would be able to register ownership over the claimed properties would be grounded in extensive investigation into the precise properties and plots owned by each of the Five Companies, taking into account the corporate changes that had occurred and, in particular, the transitioning corporate and ownership systems under Croatian law. No evidence of any such investigation being performed has been adduced by the Claimants.\n\n1013.\n\nHowever, plainly, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 purchased the Five Companies as legal entities, together with the \"entire assets\" of those companies.1196 The notice of sale, the decision of the Bankruptcy Court approving the sale, and the terms of the Purchase Agreement contemplate that the assets of the Five Companies included real estate. This is also reflected in the bid and the allocation of 13.5% of the purchase price for real estate.\n\nPurchase Agreement (C-0047), Art 3.\n\n1014.\n\nThe Tribunal has held that the Claimants have established title to 326 plots. Of these, the Tribunal has found that 242 plots were directly expropriated by the Respondent. The Tribunal need not further consider these plots, as the Claimants\u2019 position is that a finding of breach of the FET standard would result in the same quantum of damages as for a finding of expropriation.1197\n\nTr Day 10, 2420:8-2421:14.\n\n1015.\n\nThe Tribunal has also held that the Claimants have not established ownership of the Apartments. The Tribunal need not examine whether there has been a breach of the FET standard in respect of the Apartments, as the Claimants could have no legitimate expectation in respect of property to which the Claimants did not acquire a proprietary or contractual right.\n\n1016.\n\nAs to the Remaining Plots, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 had a reasonable and legitimate expectation that he had registrable title. The expectation is confined to these Remaining Plots because of the problems of identification of assets, which are reinforced by the absence of specific references to the Properties to be acquired in any of the documents and the level of due diligence as at the time of the investment.\n\n1017.\n\nAlthough there was no specific representation or assurance from the Respondent to this precise effect, that is not determinative. As the tribunal in *Saluka v Czech Republic* opined, \"reasonable expectations to be entitled to protection under the [t]reaty need not be based on an explicit assurance\", it is sufficient that the claimant when making its investment could reasonably expect that the State would act in a consistent and evenhanded way.1198 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants had a legitimate and reasonable expectation that they could register ownership over properties to which they could establish ownership to the requisite standard, through the appropriate process. This is so irrespective of the transitioning system of ownership.\n\n*Saluka v Czech Republic* (CL-0042), \u00b6 329. *See also* *Electrabel S.A. v Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012 (RL-0112), \u00b6 7.78.\n\n1018.\n\nWhether the Respondent violated any such legitimate expectation is addressed below. The analysis that follows is appropriately confined to the Remaining Plots in respect of which the Tribunal has found that the Claimants have established ownership, but not expropriation.\n\n***Issue 5.3(b): Did the Respondent violate any legitimate expectation by the following?***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Issue 5.3(b)(i): Did the Respondent violate any legitimate expectation by filing the Annulment Action in 1996?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Issue 5.3(b)(ii): Did the Respondent violate any legitimate expectation by commencing a criminal investigation of the First Claimant in 1996?*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Issue 5.3(b)(iii): Did the Respondent violate any legitimate expectation by allegedly publicising the Annulment Action and the criminal investigation of the First Claimant?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1019.\n\nThe Claimants claim that the filing of the Annulment Action, the criminal investigation of the First Claimant in 1996, and the publicising of both, each constitute a violation of the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations. The Tribunal considers it apt to deal with the three aspects of Issue 5.3(b) together.\n\n1020.\n\nThe State Attorney registered the Annulment Action seeking annulment of the Purchase Agreement with the Bankruptcy Court on 22 May 1996.1199 The State sought to annul the Purchase Agreement on a number of grounds, including violation of Article 129 of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nJudgment of the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb dated 6 May 1996 pertaining to File No P-1729/96, signed by State Attorney Mr Petar Sale (C-0077).\n\n1021.\n\nIn parallel with the Annulment Action, on 8 August 1996, the State Attorney\u2019s Office submitted a proposal to the Municipal Court in Petrinja requesting that (i) a notice be entered into the land register in Petrinja indicating that an action to annul the Purchase Agreement was ongoing, and (ii) a prohibition be enacted to prevent registration at the Land Registry in Petrinja of any sales contract between the Second Claimant and a tenant of the former Complex Enterprise Gavrilovi\u0107.1200 There is no evidence that the pendency notice was issued otherwise than in accordance with standard practice in Croatia. The Respondent points out that the Claimants have never shown that the proposal submitted by the State Attorney\u2019s Office to the Municipal Court in Petrinja to enter a notice in the land registry was actually so entered.1201 However, the Tribunal will proceed on the same basis as the Parties and assume, *arguendo*, that a pendency notice was entered on the land register.\n\nProposal from the Deputy of the State Attorney of Croatia to the Municipal Court of Petrinja dated 8 August 1996 (C-0132).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 180.\n\n1022.\n\nThe Annulment Action was withdrawn by the State Attorney on 15 November 2000, apparently in furtherance of settlement negotiations under the new Croatian Government.\n\n1023.\n\nThe 1996 criminal investigation into the actions of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 during the purchase of the Five Companies was instituted at a similar time as the Annulment Action.1202 The inquiry principally concerned an allegation that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 deliberately incited the Liquidator to overstep the limits of his authorisation.

Once this notice was recorded, any contract between Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. and a third party relating to real property within Petrinja would have been invalidated if the Annulment Action was eventually successful.1220 The Claimants point out that, even if Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. had been successful in recording its ownership over real property in Petrinja without additional documentation from Croatia, it would \"likely\" not have been able to enter into contracts with third-parties to sell or mortgage such real estate.1221\n\nProposal from the Deputy of the State Attorney of Croatia to the Municipal Court of Petrinja dated 8 August 1996 (C-0132).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 134 *citing* Land Registry Act (CL-0022).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 134; Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 254-261. *See further* Gulam Statement, \u00b6 19.\n\n1031.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the Respondent \"sold [the] Claimants\u2019 property in reliance on the pending Annulment Action and a groundless letter from the State Attorney which lacked evidence, or even argumentation, to support the claim that the property was not included in the assets of the Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Companies.\"1222\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 637.\n\n1032.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants argue that Croatia attracted Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s investment based on a public tender and specific assurances regarding the investor\u2019s legal rights made during the bankruptcy procedure. Several years later Croatia arbitrarily disclaimed the legality of the purchase.1223 Croatia then left open the Annulment Action to prevent the Claimants from registering and productively improving the properties.1224 The Claimants say that \"the damage inflicted on [the] Claimants\u2019 investment can be causally linked to the coordinated actions of [the] Respondent\u2019s state organs.\"1225\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 298.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 619.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 661, *see also* \u00b6\u00b6 662-665.\n\n1033.\n\nAs to Issue 5.3(b)(ii), the Claimants contend that commencing an unfounded criminal investigation or proceeding against an investor or representatives of the investment violates an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.1226 The Claimants say that, in this case, there is \"no question\" that the Respondent\u2019s decision to commence a criminal investigation of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 (approximately five years after the execution of the Purchase Agreement, and concurrent with the filing of the Annulment Action) and to hold it open for some four years, did not have any good-faith basis.1227\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 801-802, *citing* *Swisslion v Macedonia* (CL-0039), \u00b6\u00b6 297-299; *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v Romania*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/3, Award, 6 May 2013 (RL-0080), \u00b6 278.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 803.\n\n1034.\n\nThe Claimants point to the fact that the County State Attorney in Zagreb decided that the information and documentation collected through the Police Administration in Zagreb led to a conclusion that the criminal charges against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 were unfounded.1228 Further, the Respondent has not provided any evidence to show why it opened the criminal investigation in the first place, why it was not closed years earlier, and why the Respondent chose to investigate Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, but not any member of the Bankruptcy Court.1229\n\nDecision No Z-1367/12, Municipal Court Gospic, 29 August 2012 (R-0273).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 805.\n\n1035.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants contend that they had a legitimate expectation, \"like any investor would\", that the Respondent would not undertake ill-founded criminal investigations violating even a minimum standard of treatment.1230\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 806.\n\n1036.\n\nAs to Issue 5.3(b)(iii), the Claimants say that the Respondent\u2019s \"attacks\" shared common themes: (1) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s purchase was null and void; (2) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s purchase was immoral because the purchase price was insufficient; (3) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s purchase was a product of nepotism and corruption; and (4) Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was himself a Serb and/or favoured the Serbs.1231 It is further said that Holding d.o.o. \"covered Petrinja\" with leaflets and posters \"informing the citizens of Petrinja that [the Five Companies'] sale will soon be annulled.\"1232 The Claimants rely on the fact that these statements and actions were carried out by Members of the Croatian Parliament, the State Attorney, the local government, and the \"State-owned\" Holding d.o.o.1233\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 810.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 153, *citing* \"A Sausage War is Raging in Petrinja\", *Slobodna dalmacija*, 13 August 1996 (C-0100).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 810.\n\n1037.\n\nThe Claimants state that the Respondent has provided no documentary evidence or testimony as to why it engaged in the publication of the charges against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107, which were never substantiated. The record is also notably devoid of any statements made by the State Attorney or other public officials when the Annulment Action and the criminal investigation were terminated.1234\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 815.\n\n1038.\n\nThe Claimants contend that these attacks were particularly damaging to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s business because they occurred as the IFC was visiting Petrinja to discuss possible financing of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.'s\u2019s expansion.1235\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 144.\n\n1039.\n\nThe Claimants submit that investment tribunals have held that publicising accusations, court proceedings, or investigations regarding an investment is unfair, arbitrary and evidences bad faith, particularly since publication by the Government will likely garner public disdain for the investment and undermine its business prospects.1236\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1032, *citing* *Vivendi v Argentina* (CL-0064), \u00b6\u00b6 7.4.18-7.4.19, 7.4.28-7.4.29.\n\n1040.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants say that the Respondent engaged in egregious and bad faith conduct, which is in turn a breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n1041.\n\nAs to Issue 5.3(b)(i), the Respondent notes the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the Annulment Action was brought in bad faith, and observes that, concerning legal standards, bad faith is a significant threshold for a claimant to cross.1237 Malicious or egregious conduct is an essential ingredient of bad faith conduct.1238 Arbitral case law requires particularly serious misconduct by the State.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 735, *citing* *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V., ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. and ConocoPhillips Company v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/30, Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 September 2013 (CL-0087), \u00b6 275.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 735, *citing Investmart v Czech Republic* (CL-0182), \u00b6 422.\n\n1042.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the filing of the Annulment Action was a *bona fide* action based on credible legal grounds given the illegalities and irregularities that surround the purchase of the Five Companies.1239 Further, the Action to annul the Purchase Agreement did not preclude the use or enjoyment of the disputed property, nor affect its control.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 754.\n\n1043.\n\nThe Respondent recites that the Annulment Action explained the different legal grounds it was based on, including violations of Article 129 of the Bankruptcy Act. The Action was based on the illegalities and irregularities known at the time.1240 A State\u2019s decision to start a civil proceeding based on irregularities and illegalities that it has uncovered is not a breach of an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. That the case was later dropped because negotiations resumed1241 cannot be evidence of bad faith.1242 The Claimants\u2019 statement that two of the grounds for the Action had \"already been discussed and dismissed by the competent court\" is untrue and, in any event, irrelevant to the legitimacy or probability of success of the Annulment Action, according to the Respondent.1243\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 173.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 152, 154.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 737.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 173-177.\n\n1044.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that the entry of a notice of dispute in the land register is \"a widespread and standard practice\" to ensure that, during the period of an annulment action, the outcome of the action is not frustrated by a party who, in the interim, sells property to which it may not be entitled. The notice was therefore a standard corollary to the decision to commence the Annulment Action and not part of any alleged \"campaign\" to harass the Claimants.1244 Irrespectively, the Respondent also argues that the alleged pendency notice did not affect the ability of the Second Claimant to (i) be entered into the land register as the owner of the properties over which it claimed ownership, (ii) use and enjoy the properties over which it claimed ownership, or (iii) with the exception of the Apartments, enter into sales agreements or security instruments in respect of those properties.1245\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 738.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 150-151.\n\n1045.\n\nAs to Issue 5.3(b)(ii), the Respondent says that the criminal inquiry against the First Claimant was conducted because he was reported for inciting the Liquidator to commit an abuse of authority or powers.1246 The inquiry was done in strict accordance with Croatian law and was reasonably justifiable in light of public policies. According to the Respondent, taking into account the illegal acquisition of the alleged investment, there is nothing that frustrates legitimate expectations or that is shocking or outrageous.1247 Further, the decision of the State Attorney\u2019s Office to withdraw the criminal inquiry shows, if anything, the degree to which the institutions of Croatia are impartial and respect the rule of l aw.1248\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 739.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 739.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 188.\n\n1046.\n\nAs to Issue 5.3(b)(iii), the Respondent argues that the Claimants\u2019 allegation of a \"public campaign against the company\" is shallow and baseless.1249 Statements made by the private media or the director of Holding d.o.o. are not attributable to the Republic of Croatia.1250 Nor do the views of politicians on the campaign trail or in the course of political debate, including in Parliament, engage the State.1251 None of the alleged statements of the State Attorney rise to the level of egregiousness or wilfulness required to cross the threshold of bad faith. The illegal circumstances in which the alleged investment was made fully warranted the initiation of legal proceedings and the \"inherent contestation.\"1252\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 745.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 746.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 747.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 748.\n\n1047.\n\nIn relation to each of the actions that are the subject of Issues 5.3(b)(i) through 5.3(b)(iii), the Respondent observes that the Claimants do not allege that these actions, even if established, caused any damage.1253 According to the Respondent, this is telling and the claims should be discarded on this basis alone.1254\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 734.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 734.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n1048.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the filing of the Annulment Action, and, in turn, the pendency notice, lead to the following \"damage.\" First, the Claimants would \"likely\" not have been able to enter into contracts with third parties to sell or mortgage such real estate, \"even if Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. had been successful in recording its ownership over real property in Petrinja without additional documentation from Croatia.\"1255 Second, the Claimants were prevented from registering and productively improving the properties.1256 Third, the Respondent sold the Claimants\u2019 property in reliance on the pending Annulment Action.1257\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 134; Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 254-261. *See* Gulam Statement, \u00b6 19.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 619.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 637.\n\n1049.\n\nThe only real damage that the Claimants seem to point to is as a result of the pendency notice. The Tribunal will assume that inscriptions were entered in the land register in the terms of the State Attorney\u2019s proposal. That is, the Annulment Action was noted in the land register, and a prohibition was enacted to prevent registration at the Land Registry in Petrinja of any sales contract between the First Claimant and a tenant of the former Complex Enterprise Gavrilovi\u0107.\n\n1050.\n\nThe Claimants have not established that they were unable to register, sell or mortgage any of the Properties by reason of the Annulment Action or notice. That the Claimants *likely* would not have been able to sell or mortgage the Properties is too remote to ground a claim for damages. The same can be said of the claim that any contract between Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. and a third party relating to real property within Petrinja *may* have been invalidated *if* the Annulment Action was *eventually* successful.\n\n1051.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge this in their Reply when they state that \"formally, the pendency notice should not of and in itself prevent a books registration of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s ownership.\"1258 While the situation may be different in practice, as the Claimants contend, that situation did not eventuate in the present case. The hypothetical impact of the pendency notice cannot ground any claim for violation of the FET standard, much less a claim for damages.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 258.\n\n1052.\n\nThe prohibition in respect of the Apartments is a different matter. However, the Tribunal has concluded that the Claimants have not established ownership of the Apartments on the evidence. As there is no reasonable or legitimate basis for an expectation that the Claimants could register ownership over the Apartments, or otherwise transact in relation to the Apartments, the Tribunal need not consider whether damage is made out.\n\n1053.\n\nIn relation to the criminal investigation, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants have not established a causal link between the 1996 criminal investigation and their alleged inability to register ownership or obtain financing, nor any impact on the profits (and thus value) of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. Indeed, the Claimants do not appear to allege that the investigation caused the claimed damage.\n\n1054.\n\nIn relation to the \"public campaign against the company\" painted by the Claimants, leaving aside the fact that others affected by the bankruptcy sale of the Five Companies and its impact on Holding d.o.o. could reasonably form the view that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 had obtained the companies in a proceeding that was marked by irregularities, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have not established any damages proximately caused by the statements and actions said to comprise that campaign, taken singularly or together. In particular, the Claimants have not satisfied the Tribunal that there is any link between the publicity, the visit by the IFC to discuss possible financing of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s expansion, and their alleged failure to obtain financing.\n\n1055.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the Annulment Action, the criminal investigation in 1996 and the publication of the same did not affect the Claimants\u2019 entitlement or ability to register ownership over the Properties, nor any associated loss. It is therefore unnecessary to consider whether each constitute a violation of Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\n***Issue 5.3(c): Did the Respondent fail to facilitate the registration of the claimed properties and, if so, did the Respondent violate thereby a legitimate expectation in breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n1056.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent had the power to facilitate registration of the claimed properties, and had an obligation to do so pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the Record.1259 They contend that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 legitimately expected that, \"even before the execution of the Record in March 1992, Croatia facilitated Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s registration of certain of the [Five Companies'] Properties that were still in Croatian-controlled territory.\"1260 The expectation that Croatia would transfer the properties was confined to \"all assets or rights held by the [Five Companies]\" as held by the Claimants in their Memorial.1261 The Claimants also note that Croatian courts recognised Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s ownership of accessible apartments during Croatia\u2019s War of Independence.1262 However, from 1995 the Respondent has refused to provide assistance to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. to register the claimed properties.1263\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 825.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 819, *citing* Confirmation of the Bankruptcy Court pertaining to File Nos St-102/91, St-103/91, St-104/91, St-105/91 and St-106/91 dated 5 February 1992 (C-0264).; Decision No P-997/92, County Commercial Court Rijeka, 4 February 1992 (C-0276), p 1.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 299.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 819.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 820.\n\n1057.\n\nThe most marked reason for the failure of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. to register its ownership was: (i) the lack of documentation required by the Respondent\u2019s courts pursuant to Article 54 of the Land Register Act; and (ii) the lack of documentation required by the Respondent\u2019s courts pursuant to Article 390 of the Ownership Act.1264 The Respondent has not suggested that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. could have come into possession of such documentation in any way other than through the Respondent.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 824.\n\n1058.\n\nPrevious decisions of investor-State tribunals have held that a host State\u2019s failure to facilitate subsequent steps necessary to implement an investment violates an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations and breaches the state\u2019s obligation to afford FET.1265\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 826.\n\n1059.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants submit that Croatia\u2019s failure to facilitate the registration of the Properties violates the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations and therefore Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n1060.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants were at all times treated fairly and equitably (including with respect to any legitimate expectations they had) and within a legal framework of general application.1266\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 718.\n\n1061.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the requirements for registration are transparent and found in the Land Register Act. The Act and its application cannot be said to constitute a misuse of a legal or executive process for another reason than for which it was created, or be an indicator of unfair and inequitable treatment.1267 They were within the purview of the Respondent\u2019s general right to regulate, and not a form of dispossession outside of ordinary constraints and practices.1268 The Claimants do not, and cannot, assert a denial of justice. There is no evidence or argument that there are systemic defects in the administration of justice in Croatia.1269\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 553.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 500.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 475.\n\n1062.\n\nThe Respondent also points out the following. First, the Claimants acknowledge that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. failed to register title in land registration proceedings because it did not have the required documentation showing chain of title from the Six Socialist Companies and containing exact land identifiers. Second, the Claimants further acknowledge that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. is not the successor to all the property of the Six Socialist Companies and, moreover, the assets of Holding d.o.o. were never divided among the Nine Companies.1270 At the same time, title of the Second Claimant was often recognised and registered in correction proceedings and ordinary civil proceedings, where the burden of proof can be discharged in different ways.1271\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 299.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 549.\n\n1063.\n\nGiven this reality, according to the Respondent, Croatia cannot *ex machina* provide Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. with title. Such title must be established. To this end, Croatian courts have repeatedly informed Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. that it must commence civil contentious proceedings or enter into settlement negotiations with the other potential title holders.1272 There is nothing more Croatia could do within the confines of its laws.1273 It was incumbent on the Claimants to try to register through any means that Croatian law allows.1274\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 617, 621-638.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 184.\n\nTr Day 10, 2333:1-2335:1.\n\n1064.\n\nFurther, the Respondent explains:\n\n*What the* [Six Socialist Companies] *should have done is conclude an agreement on the division of assets between themselves. This would have provided title for the acquisition of ownership and would have been the document on the basis of which each of the* [Nine Companies] *could have filed requests with the competent land registry division of the municipal court in whose territory the respective property is located. Moreover, there were repeated attempts by the Respondent to reach out-ofcourt settlements with the Claimants on the resolution of property relations, and the Second Claimant was throughout at liberty to vindicate any claimed property rights in the Croatian courts*.1275\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 469.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n1065.\n\nThe Tribunal must first determine whether the Respondent has failed to facilitate registration of the claimed properties. It bears repeating that the Claimants only have a legitimate and reasonable expectation in respect of the plots to which they could establish ownership to the requisite standard, through the appropriate process. Accordingly, the Tribunal remains concerned with the Remaining Plots for which the Claimants have established ownership, but as yet no violation of the BIT.\n\n1066.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 case on the Respondent\u2019s alleged \"failure to facilitate\" appears to turn on the Respondent\u2019s failure to provide exact land identifiers and proof of chain of title. The Claimants say that it is common that \"the most marked reason\" for the Second Claimant\u2019s failure to register ownership was the lack of documentation required by the Respondent\u2019s courts pursuant to Article 54 of the Land Registration Act (the land identifiers), or pursuant to Article 390 of the Ownership Act (a demonstrable link between the registered predecessor of each plot and the applicant).1276 According to the Claimants, the Respondent has not suggested that the Second Claimant could have come into possession of such documentation in any way other than through the Respondent.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 824. *See also* Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 246, 265. *See*, *e.g.*, Registration Proceedings of File Nos Z-786/96 and Z-2171/91 at the Municipal Court of Petrinja, Appellate Decision of the County Court of Sisak dated 17 February 1997 (C-0110), p. 3.\n\n1067.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 additional argument that the Respondent failed to negotiate in good faith is addressed separately, in accordance with the List of Issues.1277\n\n*See* Issue 5.3(e) *infra*.\n\n1068.\n\nWhere, as here, registration is sought on the basis of a legal transaction (e.g. a purchase), the application for registration must be supported by documentation that precisely designates the land or right.1278 Land registration proceedings in Croatia are limited in scope and decided on the basis of documents submitted with a request.1279 A request is approved if the grounds for the registration proposal are clear from the documentation and there are no vitiating factors.1280 Where this requirement is not satisfied by an applicant (including because title could not have been held due to a statutory provision to that effect), the land registry court has no choice but to dismiss the application.1281 A party who is not successful because it does not have conclusive documentation can initiate civil proceedings for a declaration of ownership.1282 If successful, the judgment forms the basis of registration. It is also possible to initiate land registry correction proceedings.\n\nLand Register Act (RL-0040), Art 54(1)(a).\n\nKlaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 502, *citing* Land Register Act (RL-0040), Art 108(1).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6502. *See also* Tr Day 8, 1649:6-8 (Testimony of Judge Lilijana Matusko); Klaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; Tr Day 7, 1581:21-1582:5 (Testimony of Dr Hano Ernst); Ernst Report, \u00b6 107; Tr Day 7, 1582:914 (Testimony of Hano Ernst); Ernst Report, \u00b6\u00b6 107-109.\n\nKlaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6 26.\n\n1069.\n\nTo obtain the evidence required to succeed in land register proceedings\u2014the exact land identifiers and proof of chain of title\u2014the Respondent\u2019s consistent position was that the Claimants must commence civil contentious proceedings or land registry correction proceedings, or enter out-of-court settlements.1283\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 509, 588-589, 617, 621-638, 711, 722; Respondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 200. *See also* Second Klaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6 56.\n\n1070.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent \"consistently indicated that it had the sole authority to fulfil the obligations under the Purchase Agreement.\"1284 The Claimants point to a statement by the Head of the Office of the President in settlement talks that \"this is the framework, the only possible one and on the basis of which we can solve this problem.\"1285 The Minister for Regional Development said that \"finding solutions for the subject problems should be coordinated with the competent State Attorney\u2019s Office.\"1286 The Minister for Agriculture and Forestry also wrote to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 stating that the Government of Croatia had charged him with the task of solving the dispute with the Claimants in a settlement.1287 However, on the state of the evidentiary record held by the Claimants, each statement is consistent with the Claimants\u2019 options for achieving registration within the existing legal framework.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 731\n\nMinutes of Meeting between Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107, Sarinic, Sale, Kovac, Druzak and Brodarac, 15 October 1997 (C-0284), p 21.\n\nLetter from the Minister of Regional Development, Bozidar Pankretic, to the Mayor of Petrinja, Zeljka Nenadic dated 24 March 2010 (C-0160), p 3.\n\nLetter to Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 from the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Mr Bozidar Pankretic dated 15 January 2001 (C-0086).\n\n1071.\n\nIn line with the Respondent\u2019s position, and the broader legal framework, the Second Claimant succeeded in registering title in all (four) of the civil contentious proceedings that it commenced.1288 It is noteworthy that the Claimants never commenced civil contentious proceedings in respect of land plots where they were denied registration in land registration or land registration correction proceedings.1289\n\n*See* Second Gulam Statement, Annex I; Tr Day 4, 868:17-21 (Testimony of Ms Mirela Gulam); Tr Day 8, 1651:17-20 (Testimony of Judge Lilijana Matusko). *See* Second Klaric and Matusko Report, \u00b6\u00b6 68-83.\n\n*See* Second Gulam Statement, Annex I; Tr Day 4, 874:2-21 (Testimony of Ms Mirela Gulam).\n\n1072.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants have not established that the Respondent failed to facilitate registration of ownership. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the Respondent deliberately withheld the documents required for the Claimants to succeed in land registry proceedings. Nor is there evidence that the Respondent unduly interfered in the registration process.\n\n1073.\n\nMoreover, even if it is assumed that the above facts constitute a \"failure to facilitate the registration of the claimed properties\", for the reasons that follow, the Tribunal does not find that it constitutes a violation of a legitimate expectation.\n\n1074.\n\nThe Claimants could have no legitimate or reasonable expectation that the Respondent would or could have facilitated the registration otherwise. There was no representation, assurance or alternate basis for such an expectation. Moreover, such an expectation would amount to requiring Croatia to facilitate registration of the claimed properties outside of the standard processes.\n\n1075.\n\nThe registration of the claimed properties was dealt with within a clear legal framework of general application. It is significant that nowhere in their FET claims do the Claimants assert that the Respondent violated domestic law, domestic procedure or domestic notions of due process in failing to recognise the Claimants\u2019 investment.1290\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 638. *See further* Claimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\n1076.\n\nThe above view is strengthened when one considers that what is at stake in investment arbitration, including the present proceeding, is the State\u2019s international responsibility. In *Arif v Moldova* the tribunal observed:\n\n*An investor might well consider that it has a legitimate expectation that a State will comply with all its obligations under an investment contract, but if the investor has also agreed that compliance with the investment contract is subject to the law of the State party and the jurisdiction of the courts of the State party, then in the absence of aggravating factors, such as an element of puissance publique or sovereign power in the breach, non-performance is outside the scope of the fair and equitable treatment standard*.1291\n\n*Arif v Moldova* (RL-0120), \u00b6 536. *See also* *Parkerings-Compagniet v Lithuania* (CL-0084), \u00b6 344.\n\n1077.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal is not persuaded that there was a violation of any legitimate expectation relating to the Respondent\u2019s role in the registration of the Remaining Plots.\n\n***Issue 5.3(d): Did the Respondent interfere with attempts of the Claimants to register ownership and registration over the claimed properties and, if so, did the Respondent thereby violate a legitimate expectation in breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT?***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n1078.\n\nIn addition to the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to facilitate registration of the claimed properties, the Claimants contend that the Respondent actively interfered with the Second Claimant\u2019s attempts to register the Properties with three different types of actions.\n\n1079.\n\nFirst, \"State-owned\" Holding d.o.o. proceeded to renew its application (which had been made before the sale of the Five Companies) to register the Properties in its own name.1292 The Claimants say that had Holding d.o.o. not challenged the Second Claimant\u2019s ownership of the Petrinja properties, the Claimants\u2019 registration \"would likely have been successful.\"1293\n\n*See* Registration Proceedings of File Nos Z-786/96 and Z-2171/91 at the Municipal Court of Petrinja, Appellate Decision of the County Court of Sisak dated 17 February 1997 (C-0110).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 833-834.\n\n1080.\n\nSecond, soon after filing the Annulment Action, the State Attorney issued an official letter to the City of Petrinja (copying the Croatian News Agency) stating that, acting in the name of Croatia, he had recently commenced the Annulment Action against Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 to declare the Purchase Agreement null and void.1294 The State Attorney also repeated his claim directly to the Land Registry Court for Petrinja.1295 A pendency notice stayed in force until after 2002, despite the fact that the request was submitted without evidence or argumentation and never seriously pursued by the State Attorney.1296\n\n*See* State Attorney Office\u2019s Opinion No M-292/96, contained in a letter from State Attorney Mr Petar Sale to the Mayor of the City of Petrinja regarding the Opinion on the sale of flats that were managed by the former OSIZ \"Gavrilovi\u0107\" in Petrinja dated 6 August 1996 (C-0130).\n\nProposal from the Deputy State Attorney of Croatia to the Municipal Court of Petrinja dated 8 August 1996 (C-0132).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 838-841.\n\n1081.\n\nThird, over a decade after the Purchase Agreement was executed, Croatia started to register the Properties in its own name. According to the Claimants, this process was facilitated by the Croatian Fund Opinion, which stated that it was not possible to determine the assets Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 purchased with the Five Companies and the impossibility of such determination triggered the application of Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act.1297\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 842-845.\n\n1082.\n\nThe Claimants submit that tribunals have held that a host State\u2019s unreasonable interference with an investment undermines an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations and breaches its obligation to provide FET.1298 Such interference need not be in bad faith.1299\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 846, *citing* *Rumeli v Kazakhstan* (RL-0111), \u00b6 615; *CME Czech Republic B.V.

Accordingly, the Respondent argues, Holding d.o.o.\u2019s action had no effect on the Claimants\u2019 investment.1304\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 653.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 653.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 653.\n\n1087.\n\nIn relation to the second alleged instance of interference, the Respondent repeats its submissions concerning the filing of the Annulment Action and the recording of the suit in the land registry, as summarised *supra* in connection with Issue 5.3(b). In short, the Respondent submits that the filing of the Annulment Action was *bona fide*, as was the entry of a notice of pending dispute in the land register.1305 Further, both the Annulment Action and the pendency notice were temporary, and neither affected the control of the disputed property.1306 Elsewhere, the Respondent stresses that the Second Claimant never had title to the Apartments.1307\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 654.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 654.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 602-606.\n\n1088.\n\nIn relation to the third alleged instance of interference, the Respondent again asserts that the Claimants do not have title to the plots that were registered under Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act.1308 Moreover, even if the Tribunal determines that the Claimants have successfully established ownership of these plots, there was no impropriety in the application of Article 362(3). First, there was a valid basis for the Respondent\u2019s applications for registration, which was unconnected to the Croatian Fund Opinion.1309 Second, the Opinion was a *bona fide* legal opinion of the Croatian Fund. As a matter of law, the Respondent says the content of the letter is unimpeachable.1310 Third, the Croatian Fund Opinion was produced by Croatia in certain land registration proceedings as a piece of evidence, and the courts always assessed it as such.1311 The letter, being a letter, merely expressed an opinion and, according to the Respondent, does not (and cannot) itself affect the Claimants\u2019 use, enjoyment or control of any of the claimed plots.1312 Fourth, the reasoning of the Croatian court decisions applying Article 362(3) to the claimed plots is faultless as a matter of Croatian law.1313 The Respondent also notes that registrations under this presumption are only temporary placeholders until ownership is determined and the Claimants have never attempted to displace Croatia\u2019s temporary registrations.1314\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 572-574.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 575-577.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 655.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 578. *See also* Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 579.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 655.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 580-582.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 588-590.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n1089.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants have not established that the Respondent interfered with the Claimants\u2019 attempts to register ownership over the claimed properties.\n\n1090.\n\nAs to the first claimed basis of interference, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants do not establish a causal link between the application for registration by Holding d.o.o. and the Claimants\u2019 inability to register the claimed properties. The Claimants\u2019 contention that they would \"likely have been successful\" but for the actions of Holding d.o.o. is insufficient.\n\n1091.\n\nAs to the second claimed basis of interference, the Tribunal has found that the filing of the Annulment Action, the publicising of the Action, and the pendency notice, while seemingly intended to interfere with the Claimants\u2019 property rights, did not affect the Claimants\u2019 entitlement or ability to register ownership over the Properties or Apartments, nor any associated loss. The State Attorney\u2019s correspondence with the Land Registry Court, the resultant pendency notice, and the letter to the Croatian News Agency are of a similar character, if not the same, and can be dismissed for similar reasons. That is, the alleged actions had no effect on the Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n1092.\n\nAs to the third claimed basis of interference, the Tribunal need not examine the Claimants\u2019 contentions as to the Respondent\u2019s registrations, such as those pursuant to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act. The 84 Remaining Plots with which the Tribunal is concerned in this section were not the subject of registrations by the Respondent. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent did not interfere with the Claimants\u2019 attempts to register ownership. The ensuing question\u2014whether the Respondent\u2019s alleged interference violated any legitimate expectation in breach of the BIT\u2014does not arise.\n\n***Issue 5.3(e): Did the Respondent fail to negotiate in good faith with the Claimants regarding the ownership and registration of the claimed properties and, if so, did the Respondent thereby violate a legitimate expectation in breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n1093.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent was \"well aware of the dire situation Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was in\" without clean ownership title over properties that could serve as loan security.1315 The Respondent also understood that the Claimants\u2019 inability to register such ownership rights was caused by two problems that only Croatia could remedy: (i) the Annulment Action and the pendency notice, and (ii) the lack of documentation of chain of title.1316 The Claimants contend that, rather than negotiate in good faith, the Respondent attempted to leverage this situation into an agreement by which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 would renounce his rights to the vast majority of Properties.1317\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 852-854, *citing* Minutes of Meeting between Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107, Sarinic, Sale, Kovac, Druzak and Brodarac, 15 October 1997 (C-0284).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 855.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 856.\n\n1094.\n\nThe Claimants recount that Croatia proposed that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 should (re)purchase or lease any additional Properties from the State.1318 Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 disagreed, believing the bankruptcy purchase to be valid and the concrete assets identified, or at a minimum identifiable.1319\n\nMemorandum by the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Croatia, 9 January 1998 (R-0052), pp 2-3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 857, *citing* Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 60; Letter from Ms Margarete Gavrilovi\u0107 to Mr Rudolf Bogner dated 25 March 1998 (C-0285).\n\n1095.\n\nThe 1997 Draft Settlement allegedly demanded that Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 explicitly state that the bankruptcy proceeding never identified any assets of the Five Companies, and further required Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 to explicitly renounce any other rights to all the other properties he had acquired in bankruptcy.1320 Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 says that he had no choice but to refuse the 1997 Draft Settlement because he was concerned it could have been found unenforceable because it was inconsistent with a number of final court judgments confirming his ownership of some of the Properties purchased in the bankruptcy, and, further, it contained no guarantee that the Respondent would not restart its Annulment Action.1321\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 858-859, *citing* Draft Settlement Agreement between Croatia, the Croatian Fund, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. dated 21 November 1997 (**Draft Settlement Agreement**) (R-0053).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 860, *citing* Letter from Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 to Mr Petar Sale dated 25 January 1999 (C-0288); Letter from Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 to Mr Petar Sale dated 9 February 1999 (C-0286); Letter from Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 to Mr Petar Sale dated 10 March 1999 (C-0149).\n\n1096.\n\nIn December 1997, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 submitted a proposal that was, in substance, identical to the one presented by the Respondent, but respected previous court decisions and contained provisions that would guarantee it would be a final resolution to the dispute.1322 The Claimants say that they never received a response to the proposal.1323\n\nLetter from Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 to the Chief of the President\u2019s Office [undated] (C-0289).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 861 *citing* Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 74-75.\n\n1097.\n\nIn November 1998, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 received another proposal from the Respondent.

The Claimants say that they \"raised this again with the State Attorney\" in correspondence of January 1999, February 1999 and March 1999.1324 Interestingly, this is the same correspondence relied upon by the Claimants to support their contention that they were justified in refusing the 1997 Draft Settlement.1325\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 863-864.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 860, fns 863-864, 1102, 1107-1109.\n\n1098.\n\nIn 2000, a new round of negotiations commenced following the election of a new government.

But, again, without giving any reasons, Croatia did not accept the settlement proposal.1332\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 881-882.\n\n1101.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the Respondent used lists of real estate claimed by the Claimants, and provided in the course of negotiations, to register the claimed properties.1333 The Claimants point to a letter from the State Attorney to the local State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak of March 2003, requesting them to examine the land registry ownership status of each of the named plots and \"urgently register the ownership right\" if any of the real estate is the property of Croatia.1334 The Claimants point to a response from the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak in April 2003, which they say shows that registration over certain properties had already been requested in the name of Croatia, pursuant to the instructions of the State Attorney.1335 The State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb again wrote to the office in Sisak in May 2004, asking to be informed whether the plots of land allegedly owned by the Claimants are agricultural land and whether they are encompassed by court decisions, or proceedings, for registering these plots that were to be initiated on behalf of Croatia.1336 The Claimants say that the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak continued to conduct registrations in the name of Croatia throughout the next few years.1337\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 866-876.\n\nLetter from the State Attorney\u2019s Office to the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak dated 19 March 2003 (C-0294).\n\nLetter from the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak to the State Attorney\u2019s Office dated 7 April 2003 (C-0298), p 1.\n\nLetter from the State Attorney\u2019s Office to the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak dated 17 May 2004 (C-0297).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 873.\n\n1102.\n\nThe Claimants reiterate that the Respondent must act non-arbitrarily, and in good faith, to comply with the FET standard of the BIT.1338 Indeed, according to the Claimants, investor-State tribunals have found that the State\u2019s failure to negotiate in good faith undermines an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations and is a breach of the FET standard.1339\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 883.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 884-886, *citing* *PSEG v Turkey* (CL-0043), \u00b6\u00b6 246-247; *CME v Czech Republic* (CL-0058), \u00b6 611; *Vivendi v Argentina* (CL-0064), \u00b6\u00b6 7.4.28-7.4.29.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n1103.\n\nThe Respondent recounts that, for more than 10 years, the Respondent (i) engaged in settlement discussions with the First Claimant at the highest levels of the Croatian State; (ii) held numerous in-person meetings with the First Claimant to determine what properties could be granted to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.; and (iii) exchanged dozens of draft settlement agreements on the subject.1340\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 744.\n\n1104.\n\nThe Respondent contests the Claimants\u2019 portrayal of the settlement negotiations.1341 The Respondent depicts the negotiation process as follows.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 198-199.\n\n1105.\n\nThere was an \"earlier agreement\" that would have confirmed the Purchase Agreement and transferred to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. the factory in Petrinja.1342 However, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 allegedly \"reneged\" on this, which necessitated the commencement of negotiations in 1997.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 204.\n\n1106.\n\nThe negotiations progressed over a number of meetings in 1997, drawing to a close with a firm oral agreement.1343 In accordance with this oral agreement, the Respondent provided the Claimants with the 1997 Draft Settlement.1344 Under this Draft, the Respondent agreed to transfer all properties linked to production to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. in addition to the factory in Petrinja. In particular, the Draft:\n\n(a) Recalled that the purpose of the settlement was to \"identify the assets of the legal persons sold in bankruptcy proceedings.\"1345\n\n(b) Recognised Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s ownership over the new and old factory in Petrinja, the Stanci farm, the Gavrilovi\u0107 villa and vineyard, commercial premises in Petrinja and Umag, the fleet of transportation vehicles in the possession of Gavrilovi\u0107 Transport, and all the equipment in the possession of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. in all rented properties currently in its possession.\n\n(c) Granted the Claimants a lease and pre-emptive purchase rights over eight other properties, including a supply centre in Petrinja, commercial centres in Varazdin, Rijeka, Bibinje, and Split, and retail stores in Varazdin and Ploce.\n\n(d) Allowed the Claimants to recover any investments in properties that were not transferred to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. under the settlement agreement.\n\n(e) Allowed the Claimants to retain any rent received up to the date of the settlement on commercial properties that were in their possession.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 211-212.\n\nDraft Settlement Agreement (R-0053).\n\nDraft Settlement Agreement (R-0053), p 1.\n\n1107.\n\nFurther, in accordance with the Draft, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 would renounce any further claims to property, but would, at the same time, have the right to purchase such property from the Croatian Fund. These terms were clearly and repeatedly stated during the meeting with no objection from Mr Gavrilovi\u0107.1346 The 1997 Settlement Draft was never signed, despite the fact that it recorded the Parties\u2019 consensus. The Respondent explains that the clause confirming that no properties were identified in the bankruptcy purchase, so were only currently being identified, was a truism: if the Five Companies had clear title to assets, the Parties would not be entering into an agreement for that purpose.1347 The clause by which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 renounced all claims on other properties in bankruptcy did nothing more than encapsulate the *raison d\u2019etre* of any settlement agreement, which is to finally and comprehensively determine an issue between the Parties.1348 Further, the Claimants never expressly state how or in what way the 1997 Settlement Draft proposed by the Respondent was contrary to any decision issued by the Croatian courts, chiefly because it was not.1349 The 1997 Settlement Draft included a firm undertaking from Croatia to \"permit without any further question or consent, the real properties from point II.1 of this settlement to be registered in the land register as the property of [Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.].\"1350\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 209-214, 217-219, *citing* Minutes of Meeting between Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107, Sarinic, Sale, Kovac, Druzak and Brodarac, 15 October 1997 (C-0284), pp 8, 10, 13-14.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 215-216.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 215-216.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 221-225. *See also* Letter from the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o and Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 dated 1 February 1999 (C-0151); Letter from the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o and Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 dated 22 February 1999 (C-0150) (\"The suggested settlement does not negate the purchase agreement of legal persons under bankruptcy, which you have bought, but rather [...] it defines the corpus of assets on which Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o acquires ownership, it permits the registration into land registry [...] We, therefore, do not know what is your reason for insisting on specifying the status changes that existed before the conclusion of the said agreement of 11 November 1991.\").\n\nDraft Settlement Agreement (R-0053), \u00b6 II.3.\n\n1108.\n\nThe Parties continued to attempt to reach a settlement throughout 1998 and the first half of 1999, but, according to the Respondent, the Parties were unable to firmly agree on which properties would be transferred to the Second Claimant.1351\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 163-164.\n\n1109.\n\nFollowing the election of a new government in 2000, the Respondent initiated a second round of negotiations. In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent states that the parties \"made little progress because of the First Claimant\u2019s exaggerated demands.\"1352 The Respondent does not specify or explain the exaggerated nature of these demands. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent said that concrete progress was made, and by November 2002 the negotiations were completed and the settlement proposal from Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. to the Respondent was being awaited.1353\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 165.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 227-228, *citing* Letter from State Attorney\u2019s Office to the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak dated 19 March 2003 (C-0294).\n\n1110.\n\nIn 2008, the Parties restarted negotiations, and agreed that Ing Ekspert should evaluate the properties that the Second Claimant could register in its name, but the Parties were unable to agree on a list of properties and only the First Claimant provided a list (to which the Respondent never agreed).1354\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 165.\n\n1111.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 allegations that the Respondent negotiated with the sole intention of \"forc[ing] [the] Claimants to give up their rights to [Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.'s] [p]roperties for minimal consideration\" and \"us[ing] information gathered during such negotiations to proactively register its ownership over [Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.'s] [p]roperties\" are unsupported by the evidence, including the Claimants\u2019 own documents.1355 The Respondent explains that, as part of the settlement proposed by the Claimants to the Croatian Government in March 2003, the Claimants sent a \"Draft Donation Agreement\" listing the properties that they were willing to \"donate\" to the Republic of Croatia.1356 The State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb transmitted this agreement to the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak, as the region where the properties in question were located, requesting that the Sisak office determine the ownership structure of all of the real estate encompassed by the agreement to verify that these properties could be the subject of a donation (i.e. did not already belong to Croatia or third parties).1357 The Respondent says it was on this basis that, in April 2003, the State Attorney in Sisak sent a preliminary report on the ownership status of the properties listed in the \"Draft Donation Agreement\", informing the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb that the Respondent was entered as the owner of two of the properties that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. offered to \"donate\" and other properties were agricultural land that already belonged to the Respondent. In relation to the latter properties, the land register still bore the old \"social ownership\" entries, so the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak filed a request to update the register.1358 Again, the correspondence of 17 May 2004 between the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb and the office in Sisak was to confirm that the properties encompassed by the Claimants\u2019 \"donation\" proposal did not already belong to the Respondent.1359 The Respondent argues that its registration requests exclusively covered properties that were already owned by the Respondent prior to the Purchase Agreement.1360\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 202, *referring to* Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 269.\n\nLetter from the Government of Croatia to the State Attorney\u2019s Office and others dated 10 March 2003 (C-0292).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 230-231.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 232-233.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 236.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 234, 237.\n\n1112.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the negotiations and written exchanges were conducted with the best efforts of various ministries and the State Attorney\u2019s Office and in good faith with the sole aim of determining the assets of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.1361\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 744.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n1113.\n\nThe first part of this issue invites the Tribunal to determine whether the Respondent failed to negotiate in good faith with the Claimants regarding the ownership and registration of the claimed properties.\n\n1114.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent engaged in negotiations to determine what properties could be granted to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., and to finally and comprehensively determine the Claimants\u2019 property issues. The negotiations spanned more than 10 years, during which a number of draft settlement agreements were exchanged.1362\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Draft Settlement Agreement (R-0053); Memorandum by the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Croatia, 9 January 1998 (R-0052), pp 2-3; Letter from Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 to the Chief of the President\u2019s Office (undated) (C-0289).\n\n1115.\n\nThe Tribunal is not minded to analyse the Parties\u2019 settlement negotiations. The Parties exchanged settlement offers and participated in negotiations for an extended period. A brief review of the record discloses that the settlement proposals were not unreasonable. Nor were the Parties\u2019 discussions, as recorded in the minutes. The lead negotiator for the Respondent, Mr Sarinic, is recorded as saying in October 1997: \"[W]e must see what would be reasonable here, without being slaves to papers, and then implement that.\"1363 Mr Sarinic also said \"Yes, if [we] would look at it in [a] strictly legal sense -then you are right, [b]ut, I think that we are here a little like that [...] And here we are in favour of agreement.\"1364 Similarly, when Mr Brodarac mentioned the fraudulent nature of the Record, Mr Sarinic stated: \"Gentlemen, we all agree with this, but here we are, not to see who is right, but to try and solve this, so that we can move on with the production.\"1365 It is not possible to find that there was no negotiation in good faith.\n\nMinutes of Meeting between Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107, Sarinic, Sale, Kovac, Druzak and Brodarac, 15 October 1997 (C-0284), p 4.\n\nMinutes of Meeting between Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107, Sarinic, Sale, Kovac, Druzak and Brodarac, 15 October 1997 (C-0284), p 7.\n\nMinutes of Meeting between Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107, Sarinic, Sale, Kovac, Druzak and Brodarac, 15 October 1997 (C-0284), p 12.\n\n1116.\n\nAs to the Claimants\u2019 allegation that, in parallel with the negotiation process, the Respondent registered the Claimants\u2019 properties on the basis of lists exchanged in the settlement, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the State Attorney\u2019s Office sought to use the lists and register the properties in bad faith. The Respondent\u2019s explanation of the correspondence between the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zagreb and the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak\u2014a process of verifying whether the real estate encompassed by the \"Draft Donation Agreement\" could be the subject of a donation\u2014is plausible. In any event, the Respondent\u2019s registrations did not touch upon the Remaining Plots with which the Tribunal is concerned. Again, the Tribunal does not consider it possible to find that the Respondent failed to negotiate in good faith.\n\n1117.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal does not find that the circumstances complained of by the Claimants constitute a violation of any legitimate expectation. Two points bear noting.\n\n1118.\n\nFirst, the cases cited by the Claimants do not support the proposition that a failure to engage in settlement negotiations in good faith undermines an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. It is of import that the purpose of these negotiations was to arrive at an out-of-court settlement to enable the Claimants to register ownership over the claimed properties, or part thereof. Further, the difficulties stem from the Purchase Agreement, to which the Respondent is not a party or bound. In the first case cited by the Claimants, *PSEG v Turkey*, the tribunal found that the State\u2019s failure to negotiate and implement a concession contract in good faith undermined the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations that the negotiations would be handled competently and professionally.1366 The tribunal was concerned with the negotiations that preceded entry into a concession contract. The character of the negotiations and the obligation to negotiate (in good faith) is plainly distinguishable, as are the tribunal\u2019s findings in relation to the negotiations, which extended to \"serious administrative negligence and inconsistency.\"1367\n\n*PSEG v Turkey* (CL-0043), \u00b6 246.\n\n*PSEG v Turkey* (CL-0043), \u00b6 246.\n\n1119.\n\nThe Claimants also cite *Vivendi v Argentina*, in which the tribunal found that seeking to bring the concessionaire to the renegotiation table through threats of rescission based on colourable allegations, after having wrongly deprived the concessionaire\u2019s billings of formal legitimacy, was clearly wrong.1368 This is distinguishable on factual and legal bases. First, the concession was awarded by the Government and ratified by the legislature. Whereas, here, the State was not a party or otherwise bound by the Purchase Agreement. Secondly, again, the character of the negotiation process and the events that necessitated the negotiation differed markedly. The other cases cited by the Claimants do not examine the FET standard in the context of negotiations.1369\n\n*Vivendi v Argentina* (CL-0064), \u00b6\u00b6 7.4.28-7.4.29, 7.4.31.\n\n*See Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No ARB/99/6, Award, 12 April 2002 (***Middle East v Egypt***) (CL-0059), \u00b6 143; \u00b6 143; *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine* (CL-0065), \u00b6 123; *CME v Czech Republic* (CL-0058), \u00b6 611.\n\n1120.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent violated any legitimate expectation during the settlement negotiations. There are at least three reasons. First, the Tribunal has found that there is no evidence of negotiations in bad faith, such that the Claimants could not legitimately expect that the negotiations would proceed or conclude otherwise. Secondly, the Respondent was not a party or otherwise bound by the Purchase Agreement,1370 and there was no legitimate basis for the Claimants to expect that the Respondent would reach a particular settlement outcome. Third, and relatedly, the Claimants have only established ownership to the satisfaction of the Tribunal in respect of 326 plots. There is no representation, assurance or other basis on which the Claimants could expect that the Respondent would negotiate in respect of plots for which the Claimants remain unable to establish ownership.\n\n*See* Issue 4.8 *supra*.\n\n1121.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent did not fail to negotiate in good faith with the Claimants regarding the ownership and registration of the claimed properties, and, in any event, did not violate a legitimate expectation in breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\n***Issue 5.3(f): Did the Respondent by its registration of title of claimed properties i*****n** ***persons other than the Second Claimant violate any legitimate expectations of the Claimants and, if so, thereby breach of Article 2(1) of the BIT?***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n1122.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 submissions on this issue are confined to the Respondent\u2019s sale of apartments that the Claimants contend had been owned by the Five Companies.1371 From 1996 to the present, the Claimants say that the Respondent has sold at least 223 of the 470 Apartments to private persons, and appears to have donated another unknown number of Apartments, based solely on the opinion of the State Attorney that such apartments had not been sold.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 186-200; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 887-890.\n\n1123.\n\nThe Claimants argue that these actions are a breach of Mr Gavrilovi\u0107\u2019s legitimate expectations that the Respondent would act consistently, non-arbitrarily, and under due process.1372\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 890.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n1124.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that, as a matter of Croatian law, the Five Companies never had title to the claimed plots.1373 The Respondent expounds additional reasons specific to the Apartments that explain why the Five Companies did not (and could not) have title: (i) the Nine Companies (and *a fortiori* Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.) are not the universal successors of Holding d.o.o.; (ii) the Nine Companies were never separately transferred title to specific assets of Holding d.o.o.; and (iii) in any event, even if the Nine Companies did receive assets from Holding d.o.o. by universal succession or separate transfer, the Claimants have never shown that the Apartments were part of the assets of Holding d.o.o. or, if they were, that they were specifically allocated to the Five Companies.1374 Independently of these reasons, the Respondent also contends that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. never had title to the Apartments because the apartments did not belong to Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry spo (or any other of the Six Socialist Companies), but were instead part of the common pool of the Six Socialist Companies and later Holding d.o.o. Furthermore, the Apartments were not means of production for the Nine Companies and accordingly remained with Holding d.o.o. and were to be the subject of separate agreements in accordance with Article 7 of the Resolution. These reasons have been traversed above.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 536.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 537-553, 605.\n\n1125.\n\nThe Respondent argues that any supposed breach of FET that is premised on an existing property right by definition fails if that right does not succeed. In particular, the registration or sale of Apartments is not unjust if the Claimants never had a valid claim to these.1375\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 670-671.\n\n1126.\n\nAgain, the Respondent submits that the Claimants were at all times treated fairly and equitably and within a legal framework of general application.1376\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 718.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n1127.\n\nAs to the Apartments, two earlier findings of the Tribunal are dispositive. First, the Claimants have not established title to the Apartments. Second, the Claimants had no legitimate or reasonable expectation that they were to acquire title to the Apartments. It follows that the registration of certain of the Apartments is not unjust or unfair as the Claimants had no title or legitimate expectation to the same.\n\n1128.\n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by the fact that nowhere in their FET claims do the Claimants assert that the Respondent violated domestic law, domestic procedure or domestic notions of due process in failing to recognise the Claimants\u2019 investment.1377 The Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s argument that, given the Claimants accept that Croatia\u2019s registration and/or sale of certain Apartments was in accordance with Croatian law and procedure, the Claimants\u2019 alleged legitimate expectation that Croatia was not entitled to register and/or sell the Apartments is contrary to domestic law.1378 No such expectation can be deemed legitimate or reasonable, particularly in view of the absence of an express, specific and unambiguous representation or assurance by the State to that effect.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 638.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 715.\n\n1129.\n\nThe Tribunal need not examine the Claimants\u2019 contentions as to the Respondent\u2019s registrations, such as those pursuant to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act.

In *Vivendi v Argentina*, the tribunal said it is well-established that \"even if a single act or omission by a government may not constitute a violation of an international obligation, several acts taken together can warrant [a] finding that such [an] obligation has been breached.\"1386\n\n*See Vivendi v Argentina* (CL-0064), \u00b6\u00b6 232-233.\n\n1135.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the Respondent\u2019s actions that are said to constitute a campaign of harassment. Taken together, the Tribunal remains of the view that there is no violation of any legitimate expectation. The Claimants have not made out an \"illegitimate\" or \"deliberate\" campaign on the part of the Respondent against the Claimants.\n\n1136.\n\nMoreover, taking the case at its highest, the Tribunal does not find that the postulated campaign lead to the claimed damages. On the basis of the record, the Tribunal concluded that the Claimants could only have a legitimate expectation in respect of the 326 plots to which the Claimants could establish title, and, therefore, could have a reasonable expectation to register the Properties. Accordingly, the Tribunal remains concerned with the Remaining Plots in respect of which the Tribunal has not yet found a violation of the BIT.\n\n1137.\n\nTo recall, the Claimants were unable to register the Remaining Plots because they did not adduce evidence of the exact land identifiers, nor proof of chain of title. The Tribunal has found that the Respondent did not deliberately withhold these documents. Nor is there evidence that the Respondent unduly interfered in the registration process, whether through the alleged \"campaign\" or otherwise.\n\n1138.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal once again notes that the Claimants do not advance a denial of justice claim. Indeed, the Claimants do not assert that the Respondent violated domestic law, domestic procedure or domestic notions of due process in failing to recognise the Claimants\u2019 investment.1387\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 638. *See further* Claimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\n1139.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Claimants\u2019 inability to register the Remaining Plots was a result of the supposed campaign, even if the alleged actions are evaluated as a whole. In result, the Tribunal finds that there was no breach of a legitimate expectation in violation of Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\n**ISSUE 5.4: IF THE SECOND CLAIMANT DOES NOT HAVE A PROPERTY INTEREST IN THE CLAIMED PROPERTIES UNDER CROATIAN LAW, DID THE CLAIMANTS HAVE A LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION THAT THE COMPANIES PURCHASED BY MR GAVRILOVIC. WOULD HAVE SUCH PROPERTY INTERESTS, AND WOULD BE ABLE TO REGISTER OWNERSHIP OVER THE CLAIMED PROPERTIES?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1140.\n\nWhile legitimate expectations do not necessarily depend on the existence of a contractual or property right under domestic law (Issue 5.2), in the instant case, the Claimants could have no legitimate expectation in respect of property to which the Claimants have no property or contractual right (Issue 5.3(a)). It follows that the Tribunal\u2019s answer to Issue 5.4 must be \"no.\"\n\n**XII.

Hence, such obligations receive extra protection by virtue of their consideration under the bilateral treaty.1388\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 960, *citing LG&E v Argentina* (CL-0081), \u00b6 170. *See also* *Noble Ventures v Romania* (CL-0082), \u00b6 53; *SGS v Paraguay* (CL-0083), \u00b6 176.\n\n1142.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Article 8(2) of the BIT extends the protections provided therein to contractual obligations assumed by the Respondent towards the Claimants.1389 It is on this basis that the Claimants submit that the Respondent is bound by the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and the Respondent\u2019s \"failure to honor\" the terms of the Purchase Agreement constitutes a breach of Article 8(2) of the BIT.1390\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request, \u00b6 198.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 963-964.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n1143.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that there are at least six reasons why the claim in respect of Article 8(2) of the BIT must fail.\n\n1144.\n\nFirst, the Respondent reiterates that it is not a party to, or otherwise bound by, the Purchase Agreement.1391 The language of Article 8(2) of the BIT requires a direct contractual nexus\u2014so-called privity of contract\u2014between the host State and the investor.1392 In the absence of a direct nexus, the claim must be dismissed.1393 Further, the \"umbrella clause\" cannot create privity of contract where there is none, nor can it be used to expand the scope of the obligors.1394 That is, the umbrella clause does not change the nature of, or the parties to, the underlying contractual obligations, such that the umbrella clause does not allow Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 to extend the obligations in the Purchase Agreement to the Respondent.1395\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 757.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 219.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 872.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 862.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 874, *citing CMS v Argentina*, Annulment (CL-0028), \u00b6 95.\n\n1145.\n\nSecond, the Respondent says that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. was never a party to the Purchase Agreement, noting that it did not exist at the time the Purchase Agreement was executed.1396\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 761.\n\n1146.\n\nThird, the Respondent reiterates its contention that the Purchase Agreement is unenforceable since it was procured and concluded in unlawful circumstances and in contravention of Croatian law, international law, and international public policy.1397\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 762.\n\n1147.\n\nFourth, the Respondent stresses that, even if the Purchase Agreement was enforceable, the umbrella clause claim would be inadmissible by reason of the exclusive jurisdiction clause.1398\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 763. *See further* submissions and analysis in respect of Issue 2.4 *supra*.\n\n1148.\n\nFifth, the Respondent again argues that there was no breach of the Purchase Agreement, as all contractual rights acquired by Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 under the Purchase Agreement were performed.1399 As set out above,1400 in the Respondent\u2019s view, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was only entitled to a transfer of the Five Companies as legal entities and authorised to register his name in the company register.1401\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 764.\n\n*See further* Issue 6.2 *supra*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 764.\n\n1149.\n\nSixth, the Respondent submits that any alleged contractual breach would not \"rise to the level of a BIT breach.\"1402 An umbrella clause only covers State conduct in the exercise of \"a sovereign State function or power.\" The Claimants have failed to establish that any purported breach of an obligation in the Purchase Agreement was the direct result of such conduct on the part of the Respondent. The Respondent further says that it never exercised sovereign powers in relation to the property dispute stemming from the Purchase Agreement.1403\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 756, 765.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 766.\n\n**(3) The Claimants\u2019 Responsive Arguments**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1150.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the six reasons proffered by the Respondent as to why this umbrella clause claim is fundamentally flawed are without merit,1404 and counter each as follows.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 129.\n\n1151.\n\nFirst, for reasons articulated previously, the Respondent is bound by the Purchase Agreement.1405\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 130.\n\n1152.\n\nSecond, it is not correct for the Respondent to argue that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. did not exist as at the date of the Purchase Agreement.1406 The Claimants refer to the fact that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. did exist as Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry, and when the other four of the Five Companies merged into Gavrilovi\u0107 Meat Industry its name was changed to \"Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o\", and submit that a name change does not make the prior company non-existent. Further, in any event, the Claimants state that \"the fact that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. was not a party to the Purchase Agreement is irrelevant\" because Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is the sole shareholder of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. and the Respondent is said to owe the obligation to Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and the Five Companies, and later, to their successor, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.1407\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 131.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, fn 298.\n\n1153.\n\nThird, by reference to its submissions in relation to Issue 4.1, the Claimants contend that the Respondent failed to prove any illegality and cannot argue that the Purchase Agreement is \"unenforceable.\"1408\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 132.\n\n1154.\n\nFourth, the Respondent\u2019s argument that the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Purchase Agreement would deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction is without authority, and the Claimants point to eight cases in which tribunals have held otherwise.1409\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 133.

It follows that there can be no breach of Article 8(2) of the BIT, and the Tribunal need not further consider this argument.\n\n*Hamester v Ghana* (CL-0038), \u00b6 347(i). *See also* *EDF v Romania* (CL-0048), \u00b6\u00b6 318-319; *CMS v Argentina*, Annulment (CL-0028), \u00b6 95(c).\n\n*See* Issue 4.8 *supra*.\n\n**XIII.

This enabled Mr Impri\u0107 to successfully register the Lodging Property within a few days.\n\n(i) To this day, the Claimants have not received from the Respondent a similar document which would allow the Claimants\u2019 registration of the Properties.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 971.\n\n1173.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the circumstances as between Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 and Mr Impri\u0107 with respect to the sale process, the source of dispute, the land registry status, the history of the asset, the mother company and possibility of permanent registration were \"almost identical.\"1430 Further, Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107 and Impri\u0107 were in \"like\" circumstances in respect of the seller and the object of dispute.1431\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 974.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 973.\n\n1174.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimants and Mr Impri\u0107 were not in like circumstances because the Claimants had no title and Mr Impri\u0107 had \"unambiguous\" title over the purchased properties, the Claimants submit that the Respondent compares the results of the unequal treatment, instead of the circumstance preceding the Respondent\u2019s (allegedly) less favourable treatment.1432 The correct approach, however, is to compare the circumstances preceding the Respondent\u2019s less favourable treatment, and when this is done it would be seen that the comparators were in almost identical positions.1433\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 972.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 791-793.\n\n1175.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they have clearly succeeded in proving *prima facie* that Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107 and Impri\u0107 were in like situations and, although the evidentiary burden to rebut the Claimants\u2019 case shifts to the Respondent, the Respondent has not provided any evidence to the contrary.1434\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 976.\n\n1176.\n\nAs to whether the Respondent treated the Claimants less favourably than Mr Impri\u0107, the Claimants say that the Respondent has repeatedly denied that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. owns the Properties, \"directly and through Holding d.o.o.\u2014actively worked to block Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s attempts to register its ownership of the Occupied Properties\",1435 and sought to force Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 into a one-sided deal that would take most of the Properties. But the Respondent \"allowed and helped\" Mr Impri\u0107 to register his ownership over the Lodging Property.1436\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 218.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 977.\n\n1177.\n\nThe Claimants note that, in the instant case, the Respondent denied and continues to deny that any of the Properties belong to the Five Companies because the ownership division was allegedly not performed, and the individual assets of individual companies are undeterminable. At times, the Respondent\u2019s experts even deny that any property passed to the Nine Companies.1437 The Claimants refer to the comment of the State Attorney, Mr Sale, who said, \"this [was] the strongest argument for [Croatia]\", and which they maintain was consistently used by the Respondent to deny helping Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 register the properties.1438\n\n*See* Issue 4.2 *supra*.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 346.\n\n1178.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the Respondent does not deny that the key to successful ownership registration was at all times within its control.1439 The Claimants argue that this leverage was used throughout the negotiations: whenever the property lists appeared to be agreed, Croatia \"suddenly expressed dilemmas\" as to whether the properties actually belonged to Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.1440\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 344.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 345.\n\n1179.\n\nConversely, when bankruptcy proceedings were commenced against Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging in 2004, the Bankruptcy Court determined its \"assets\" and there was no doubt that assets had passed to the Nine Companies.1441 Accordingly, the assets were unambiguously identified as belonging to Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging and offered for sale, \"despite there being no additional documentation relating to the Lodging Property beyond what existed for the Five Companies at the time of their sale.\"1442\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 978.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 978; Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 347.\n\n1180.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the only document needed to register the Lodging Property (which shared the exact same legal destiny as the Properties), without any problems, was the out-of-court settlement.1443 The issuance of this document saved Mr Impri\u0107 \"a tremendous amount of time and difficulty\", but Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 \"never received the same help.\"1444\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 980.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 980. *See also* Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 802.\n\n1181.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent provided Mr Impri\u0107 the path to resolve his unsorted property situation, pointing to the Respondent\u2019s issuance of a document showing an unbroken chain of title and exact land identifiers for the Lodging Property.1445 Broadly, this is the exact treatment that the Claimants assert should have been afforded to the Claimants, but was not.1446\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 137.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 137.\n\n1182.\n\nWith respect to the standard of \"treatment\" in Article 3(1), the Claimants submit that Article 3(1) lays down an objective standard of equal treatment, and does not require additional qualifications such as intent, arbitrariness or lack of justification.1447 The Claimants refute the Respondent\u2019s contention that *Lemire v Ukraine* supports a heightened standard of less favourable treatment (i.e. requiring proof of racial prejudice in order to support a finding of breach).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 381; Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 795; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 986.\n\n1183.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants say that the Respondent failed to accord Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 \"treatment no less favourable\" than that accorded to Mr Impri\u0107 in violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n1184.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the claimed breach on two grounds, arguing first that the Claimants and Mr Impri\u0107 were not in \"like circumstances\" and thus there was no Croatian national against which Croatia\u2019s treatment of the Claimants could be compared; and second, that the Claimants have failed to make out their claim that they have been accorded less favourable treatment.\n\n1185.\n\nRelevantly, the Respondent recounts that the Real Estate Purchase Agreement recognised that Croatia had registered title to the property pursuant to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act and recorded the fact that Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging had submitted a request for an out-of-court settlement with Croatia with a view to establishing its ownership right over the Lodging Property.1448 A settlement was then reached, which rebutted Croatia\u2019s registration pursuant to Article 362(3) and was a necessary preliminary step to commencing civil contentious proceedings against Croatia.1449\n\nOwnership Act (CL-0010 / RL-0236), Arts 1, 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6771; Out-of-Court Settlement Agreement concluded between the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak and Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging d.o.o. dated 10 May 2011 (C-0168).\n\n1186.\n\nWith respect to the first ground, the Respondent submits that the Claimants were not in like circumstances with Mr Impri\u0107 because, unlike the Claimants, he had \"unambiguous title to the properties\" that were registered.1450 When Mr Impri\u0107 applied to register title to the Lodging Property, he had title that was fit for registration.1451 That is, both the out-of-court settlement and the Real Estate Purchase Agreement (as amended) showing (i) an unbroken chain of title from the person entered in the land register to himself; and (ii) the exact land identifiers (i.e. the piece of property by plot and cadastral number).1452 In contrast, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. does not have title to the 3,717 claimed plots that is fit for registration in land registration proceedings, nor does it have documents showing an unbroken chain of title and containing exact land identifiers.1453\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 597-598.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Decision of the Municipal Court in Sisak pertaining to File No 12-P-1171/2011 dated 7 March 2012 (C-0166), p. 6: \"It is incontestable that [Mr Impri\u0107] had purchased the aforementioned real estate from the Company Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging d.o.o. in bankruptcy through the public tender. It is incontestable that the Company Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging d.o.o. in bankruptcy became the owner of the aforementioned real estate pursuant to the out-of-court settlement with the Republic of Croatia.\"\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 771.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 774; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 773-774\n\n1187.\n\nAs for the Claimants\u2019 contention that they were treated less favourably than Mr Impri\u0107, the Respondent recalls the observation made by the tribunal in *Lemire v Ukraine*, namely, that more than different treatment is required when an allegation of discrimination is advanced:\n\n*Discrimination, in the words of pertinent precedents, requires more than different treatment. To amount to discrimination, a case must be treated differently from similar cases without justification; a measure must be 'discriminatory and expose* [ ] *the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice'; or a measure must 'target* [ ] *Claimant\u2019s investments specifically as foreign investments'*.1454\n\n*Lemire v Ukraine*, Jurisdiction and Liability (CL-0061), \u00b6 261 (internal citations omitted) (Respondent\u2019s CounterMemorial incorrectly cited *Lemire v Ukraine* (RL-0123), \u00b6 599, fn 576).\n\n1188.\n\nIn the instant case, the Respondent argues that the Claimants were treated just like Mr Impri\u0107 in that there were \"repeated good faith negotiation attempts to reach similar settlements in respect of the unsorted properties of the [Five Companies].\"1455 The fact that the settlement attempts failed \"because of the Claimants\u2019 exaggerated demands\" did not alter this.1456 The Respondent takes issue with the Claimants\u2019 allegation that \"discrimination\" is established because the Respondent entered into a settlement with Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging, but never reached a settlement with the Claimants concerning the claimed plots.1457 The Respondent says that, in contrast to the approach of Mr Impri\u0107, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 has never taken the step of attempting to displace the Respondent\u2019s registrations pursuant to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act, whether by initially attempting to settle or by starting contentious proceedings.1458\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 600.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 600.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 202.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply PHB, \u00b6 202.\n\n1189.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. was not treated less favourably \"when it was denied registration for lack of valid documentation showing title and directed towards civil contentious proceedings or out-of-court settlements to establish that title\", once again by reference to the absence of documents showing unbroken chain of title and containing exact land identifiers.1459 Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have \"failed to demonstrate the existence of any unjustified differentiation or prejudice.\"1460 Indeed, the courts have repeatedly informed the Second Claimant of the path to resolve its property situation, which was the path adopted by Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging and Mr Impri\u0107.1461\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 775.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 775.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 775.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n1190.\n\nThis issue raises a fundamental tenet underlying the BIT that there be equal treatment of the investors to whom the protections of the BIT is provided and those who are nationals of the host State. Applying this here, the Claimants, foreign investors, should be treated no less favourably than nationals, such as Mr Impri\u0107.\n\n1191.\n\nAlthough the Parties were at variance as to the burden of proof and the standard of treatment, it is common ground that establishing a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT requires an inherently fact-specific analysis of whether: (i) the Claimants and Mr Impri\u0107 were in like circumstances; and (ii) the Claimants were accorded less favourable treatment than Mr Impri\u0107.\n\n1192.\n\nAs for the burden of proof in establishing \"like circumstances\", the Claimants cite *Apotex v USA* as authority for the proposition that it is \"sufficient for the claimants to point out at least one *prima facie* appropriate comparator\", at which point \"the evidentiary burden of proof to rebut [the] claimant\u2019s case shifts to the respondent.\"1462 The Respondent does not join issue on the burden of proof, but merely submits that, to establish a breach of national treatment, one element that \"the Claimants must show\" is that they and Mr Impri\u0107 were in like circumstances.1463\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 976, *citing* *Apotex v USA* (CL-0246), \u00b6\u00b6 8.10, 8.61.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 770.\n\n1193.\n\nIn *Apotex v USA*, the national treatment claim was grounded in a similar provision.1464 The claimants did not dispute that they carried a *legal burden* of proof, but pointed to the distinction between the legal burden of proof (which defines which party has to prove what in order for its case to prevail) and the *evidential burden* (which may rest upon a party alleging a fact on which it relies in support of its case or defence).1465 According to the claimants in that case, the distinction is relevant because the tribunal was required to consider whether the respondent had established with sufficient evidence the facts alleged in its defence.1466 The tribunal held that \"a distinction exists between the legal burden of proof (which never shifts) and the evidential burden of proof (which can shift from one party to another, depending upon the state of the evidence).\"1467 The claimants established *prima facie* appropriate comparators, and the tribunal considered that the evidentiary burden did shift to the respondent to establish its \"positive defence\" which became \"an important potential differentiator\": whether the claimants and their investments were subject to the same legal regime or regulatory requirements (to those to which the identified national comparators were subject).1468 Importantly, the question of whether the evidentiary burden will shift is dependent on the state of the evidence. The Tribunal turns, first, to the question of whether the Claimants have established a *prima facie* appropriate comparator.\n\nIn that case, the claimants made claims pursuant to NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103. Article 1102 relevantly provides:  \n*Article 1102: National Treatment*  \n*1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.*  \n*2. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments*  \n [\u2026].  \n NAFTA, Ch 11 (CL-0247), Art 1102.\n\n*Apotex v USA* (CL-0246), \u00b6 8.7.\n\n*Apotex v USA* (CL-0246), \u00b6 8.7.\n\n*Apotex v USA* (CL-0246), \u00b6 8.8.\n\n*Apotex v USA* (CL-0246), \u00b6 8.43.\n\n1194.\n\nFor each of Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107 and Impri\u0107, the object of their dispute with the Respondent was the Properties and the Lodging Property. The properties were sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings administered by the Bankruptcy Court against one/Five of the Nine Companies. The seller, in each case, was the respective bankruptcy liquidator. Both sought to register ownership in respect of the properties that they claimed they had purchased.\n\n1195.\n\nThe Properties and the Lodging Property shared the same status in several important respects. First, the Lodging Property and the Properties share a common history of ownership. The properties originated from the same estate of Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR.1469 As established above, the assets of Gavrilovi\u0107 SOUR were transferred to Food Industry, which then became Holding d.o.o. and divided its assets to the Nine Companies, including the Five Companies and Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging (from which Mr Impri\u0107 purchased the Lodging Property).\n\nIn relation to the Lodging Property, *see* Objection of the State Attorney\u2019s Office filed with the Commercial Court in Sisak, File No IP-DO-67/04, 15 November 2007 (C-0165).\n\n1196.\n\nSecond, at the time of the respective acquisitions of the Lodging Property and the Properties, the documentation of ownership prior to the sale of the Lodging Property to Mr Impri\u0107 appears similar to the documentation of ownership for the Properties. The Respondent\u2019s objection to ownership of the Lodging Property states:\n\n*Since the bankruptcy debtor obviously has no evidence regarding the real estate entered in his nominal capital, i.e. the company\u2019s assets in the process of its transformation, and since he has no land register excerpts with his registered ownership rights or any other evidence of the non-registered ownership that is the subject of the sale, the County State Attorney\u2019s Office suggests that the Notice on sale of the subject real estate should be annulled, i.e. declared null and void, while any conclusion of an agreement or possible sale of the real estate would represent a criminal offence and would result in criminal responsibility of all those participating in such action*.1470\n\nThis is alike to the Respondent\u2019s objections in the present case.\n\nObjection of the State Attorney\u2019s Office filed with the Commercial Court in Sisak, File No IP-DO-67/04, 15 November 2007 (C-0165), p 5.\n\n1197.\n\nRelatedly, it is common to both the Claimants and Mr Impri\u0107 that the Respondent objected to ownership of the claimed properties due to the absence of proof of chain of title, at least initially. For example, the Respondent maintains that there was no transmission of property from Holding d.o.o. through the operation of the Resolution, and, even if there was, the vast majority of the Properties claimed by the Claimants were not owned by Holding d.o.o. at the time of the Resolution, either through operation of law or as a matter of fact.1471 More particularly, the Tribunal has found that 167 plots were registered in the name of the Respondent pursuant to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act. Similarly, as noted above, at the time of execution of the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, the Lodging Property was registered in the name of Croatia pursuant to Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act on the ground that, *inter alia*, \"it is impossible to establish whether the subject real estate constitutes the property of the successors of the [Five Companies], the property of the LLC[s] deleted in the bankruptcy proceedings or the property of [Gavrilovi\u0107 Small Economy].\"1472\n\n*See* above in relation to the ownership of the various plots. *See also* Minutes of Meeting between Messrs Gavrilovi\u0107, Sarinic, Sale, Kovac, Druzak and Brodarac, 15 October 1997 (C-0284), pp 4-5: \"The final division of property that was supposed to go to LLC[s] [...] had never been done. Accordingly, during the bankruptcy proceeding it was not known what belonged to these 5 which went into bankruptcy and what remained in [...].\"\n\nObjection of the State Attorney\u2019s Office filed with the Commercial Court in Sisak, File No IP-DO-67/04, 15 November 2007 (C-0165), p. 2.\n\n1198.\n\nHowever, for a number of reasons, the circumstances of the Claimants and Mr Impri\u0107 in their attempt(s) to register ownership were at variance. First, Mr Impri\u0107 purchased one specific, identified plot from one of the Nine Companies in bankruptcy.1473 In contrast, Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 purchased the Five *Companies* in bankruptcy.\n\nReal Estate Purchase Agreement (R-0347), Art 1.\n\n1199.\n\nSecondly, in several important respects, the terms of the Purchase Agreement (to which Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 is a party) differ from the terms of the Real Estate Purchase Agreement (to which Mr Impri\u0107 is a party). The Real Estate Purchase Agreement precisely identifies the real estate of the debtor in bankruptcy that the buyer has purchased.1474 It also notes that, by virtue of a certificate of the Croatian Fund, the Lodging Property is the bankruptor\u2019s property, as well as the non-registered property of the seller (Gavrilovi\u0107 Ugostiteljstvo Petrinja, d.o.o.), with the express agreement of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Croatia acting as the representative of Croatia.1475 Further, the Real Estate Purchase Agreement acknowledges that Croatia has been registered as the land registered owner of the Lodging Property,1476 and provides in Article 5:\n\n*Pursuant to previously mentioned consent of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the Seller declares that it has submitted to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office the application for the issuance of the intabulation deed for the real estate that is a property of the Republic of Croatia, and after its receipt the Seller will authorize the Buyer, based on this Agreement, the Annex to this Agreement and the intablulation deed received form* [sic] *the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, without need for any further consent and authorisation, to obtain the registration of its ownership in land registry and other public registers, on the entire properties mentioned in Article 1 of this Agreement*.1477\n\nReal Estate Purchase Agreement (R-0347), Art 1.\n\nReal Estate Purchase Agreement (R-0347), Art 1.\n\nReal Estate Purchase Agreement (R-0347), Art 1.\n\nReal Estate Purchase Agreement (R-0347), Art 5.\n\n1200.\n\nIn contrast, the Purchase Agreement does not identify the property that is the subject of the sale or make mention of the land registry status of such property. Moreover, the Agreement does not make provision for a procedure to obtain the registration of ownership of any such property. These are properly considered differences in the circumstances of the Claimants and Mr Impri\u0107, rather than differences in treatment afforded by the Respondent.\n\n1201.\n\nThirdly, and importantly, the Tribunal is tasked with determining the Claimants\u2019 claims on the evidence and the submissions before it. In this proceeding, the Claimants have not established registrable title to all the claimed Properties and Apartments to the satisfaction of the Tribunal (or even a substantial portion). The Tribunal was required to determine whether the Five Companies owned the Lodging Property, as the Claimants contend it is one of the plots in respect of which ownership was conferred on the Claimants by the Purchase Agreement. In relation to the Lodging Property, the Tribunal has found that it has insufficient evidence to make a determination as to whether the property is related to the function of one of the Five Companies, such that the Tribunal is not in a position to determine whether the Lodging Property was transferred to one of the Five Companies. Moreover, the Tribunal has not been asked to determine, and it is not in a position to determine, whether Gavrilovi\u0107 Lodging was the proper owner of the Lodging Property. Accordingly, in the absence of evidence and findings as to the owner of each of the Properties and the Lodging Property, it is difficult to establish Mr Impri\u0107 as a comparator.\n\n1202.\n\nFourthly, the Claimants sought to register ownership over a great number of plots (the number varying over time), whereas Mr Impri\u0107 sought to establish and then register ownership in respect of one plot.\n\n1203.\n\nFifthly, and finally, when considering the land registry status of each of the plots underlying the Properties, it is difficult to conclude that it is \"like\" the sole basis for the outstanding objection to the Lodging Property, being Article 362(3) of the Ownership Act. The Properties and Apartments were, and are, the subject of a multitude of complex issues of ownership, which include the division of assets, in particular as between the Five Companies and the other four of the Nine Companies, and the *ex lege* transfer of properties pursuant to various pieces of legislation that predated the Purchase Agreement. Indeed, in relation to the plots shaded red, purple and green in Annexure 1, the Tribunal has found that the Claimants have failed in their burden of establishing ownership rights to the satisfaction of the Tribunal.\n\n1204.\n\nOn balance, the Claimants have not established that Mr Impri\u0107 is, *prima facie*, an appropriate comparator. Accordingly, the evidentiary burden does not shift to the Respondent to positively defend the claim that the Claimants and Mr Impri\u0107 were in like circumstances.\n\n1205.\n\nEven if it is assumed that the Claimants and Mr Impri\u0107 were in like circumstances, for the reasons that follow, the Tribunal decides that the Claimants were not afforded less favourable treatment than Mr Impri\u0107.\n\n1206.\n\nAs regards the standard of \"treatment\", the Tribunal considers that Article 3(1) of the BIT requires an objective analysis of the identified treatment, and a determination of whether it is less favourable. It follows from the factual findings on \"like circumstances\" that the Tribunal need not further consider what is required to establish a breach of Article 3(1). Without deciding the matter, the Tribunal has proceeded on the basis that considerations of \"justification\" or \"sectional or racial prejudice\" are not required to establish a breach of Article 3(1). This is consistent with the terms of Article 3(1), and cases that have considered a similar provision, such as *Feldman v Mexico*,1478*Occidental v Ecuador*,1479 and *Cargill v Mexico*.1480\n\n*Feldman v Mexico* (CL-0085), \u00b6 181.\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No UN3467, Award, 1 July 2004 (CL-0248), \u00b6\u00b6 177 *et seq.*\n\n*Cargill, Incorporated v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009 (CL-0052), \u00b6\u00b6 219 *et seq*.\n\n1207.\n\nThe Claimants identify five instances that are said to summarise the Respondent\u2019s allegedly less favourable treatment. First, the duration of the negotiations. Second, the consideration offered in the course of negotiations. Specifically, the Claimants refer to their offer for Croatia to receive \"about 2700 real estates\" and all of the Apartments, as compared with the alleged absence of consideration offered by Mr Impri\u0107.1481 Third, the Claimants point to Croatia\u2019s demands for documents, whereby Mr Gavrilovi\u0107 was required to provide a comprehensive record of the claimed properties, as well as data regarding use and value, but Mr Impri\u0107 was not asked to provide anything. Fourth, the Claimants take issue with Croatia\u2019s conduct in registering certain of the Claimants\u2019 plots during the course of negotiations and the outcome of each settlement process. Fifth, the Claimants cite the legal value of the settlement (drafts) in view of its (perceived) enforceability.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 982, *citing* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 165.\n\n1208.\n\nIn each case, there is no difference in treatment in view of the differences in the circumstances of the Claimants *vis-a-vis* Mr Impri\u0107, as set out above.\n\n1209.\n\nThis view is reinforced by the fact that the Claimants\u2019 contentions as to less favourable treatment focus on the negotiation process and outcome. For reasons expressed in connection with the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to negotiate in good faith (Issue 5.3(e)), it is not for the Tribunal to analyse the intricacies of the Parties\u2019 negotiations, particularly as the Tribunal has found no evidence of an absence of good faith on the part of the Respondent from a review of the contemporaneous evidence concerning the negotiations cited by the Parties.1482\n\n*See* paragraphs 1113-1121 *supra*.\n\n1210.\n\nFor completeness, to the extent the alleged differences in treatment relate to the Claimants\u2019 conduct, the Tribunal reiterates its finding that the Claimants have not established that the Respondent interfered with the Claimants\u2019 attempts to register ownership over the claimed properties, whether by Holding d.o.o.\u2019s renewed application to register properties in its name, Croatia\u2019s registration of certain plots in its own name, or other alleged interference in the registration process.1483 Rather, the Tribunal has found that the Respondent treated the Claimants within the legal framework for land registration, which was of general application.1484\n\n*See* paragraphs 1089-1092 *supra*.\n\n*See* paragraphs 1065-1077 *supra*.\n\n1211.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal dismisses the claim made by the Claimants under Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n**XIV. ISSUE 9: QUANTUM**\n-------------------------\n\n**ISSUE 9.1: ARE THE CLAIMANTS ENTITLED TO DAMAGES AND, IF SO, IN WHAT AMOUNT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Issue 9.1(a): What are the direct damages?***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*Issue 9.1(a)(i): Are they entitled to the value of the Properties and Apartments over which Claimants would have registered ownership but for the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1212.\n\nIn the light of the Tribunal\u2019s findings above, the Claimants have been successful in their claim for direct expropriation of the Taken Plots. For ease of reference these Taken Plots have been listed in Annexure 5 to this Award.\n\n1213.\n\nIt is noted by the Tribunal that the Claimants\u2019 claim for damages was pursued in a manner where damages were sought in relation to the entirety of the Properties that were the subject of this dispute, with little consideration given to how the Tribunal was to proceed in the case where the Claimants were only partially successful.\n\n1214.\n\nPrior to turning to the Claimants\u2019 entitlement for damages relating to the value of the Properties, the Tribunal sets out the differing methodologies used by the Parties in valuing the Properties, and the points of principle on which the Tribunal has proceeded in assessing this component of the Claimants\u2019 claim for damages.\n\n**(1) Evidence of Direct Loss**\n-------------------------------\n\n1215.\n\nAs a first point, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not in fact shown that they have suffered any direct loss. To support this submission, the Respondent points to the evidence of Ms Gulam wherein she stated that \"[i]n almost all years since the purchase, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. possessed without disturbance 34 of the Properties claimed in this arbitration, and regularly paid all the utilities bills, and covered all the other property costs for 27 of the Properties.\"1485 The Respondent further adds that the Claimants were able to sell a property for which they did not have registered title.1486\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 812, *citing* Second Gulam Statement, \u00b6 114 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 813.\n\n1216.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the fact that the Second Claimant has had use of some of the Taken Plots does not result in a conclusion that no direct loss has occurred. In relation to the Taken Plots, the Respondent has registered itself as owner, and has therefore deprived the Claimants of the ability to sell the relevant plot; in such circumstances, the Respondent has caused a direct loss equal to the value of the plots.\n\n**(2) Competing Methodologies in Calculating the Value of the Properties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1217.\n\nIn this arbitration, on the issue of valuation, the Claimants were supported by the expert evidence of Mr \u017darko Zeljko of Ing Ekspert. Mr Zeljko is a civil engineer who founded, along with his father, Ing Ekspert in 1991. The primary business of Ing Ekspert is to supply expertise to Croatian courts in the areas of construction, architecture and real estate valuation. Mr Zeljko is a permanent court expert in these matters.1487 The Respondent was supported by Mr Hrvoje Zgombic, who is a partner based in PWC\u2019s Zagreb office. Mr Zgombic is a certified auditor, licensed tax advisor and Croatian court expert for finance and accounting matters.\n\nIng Ekspert Report, pp 8-9.\n\n1218.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 respective experts, and the Parties themselves, have divergent views on the appropriate methodology for the valuation of the Properties. The areas of disagreement can be summarised as:\n\n(a) Mr Zeljko, on behalf of the Claimants, has adopted methods known as the cost method and the income capitalisation method in order to value the Properties, while Mr Zgombic, on behalf of the Respondent, has used the comparative method.\n\n(b) The experts disagree as to how to value certain buildings which are in a state of disrepair.\n\n(c) The Parties disagree as to each other\u2019s application of their respective methods.\n\n**(3) Method of Valuation**\n---------------------------\n\n1219.\n\nAs explained by Mr Zeljko in his report, the cost method involves estimating the construction cost of a building and then depreciating that value based on its age. This value is then increased by the value of the land on which the building stands and also the communical fees, which represent the fees paid for the development of communal infrastructure.1488 The land itself is valued by determining the current amount being offered and the demand for land in the real estate market, which involves the use of the expert\u2019s experience.1489\n\nIng Ekspert Report, p 15.\n\nIng Ekspert Report, p 20.\n\n1220.\n\nThe income capitalisation method involves deriving the value of property from the value of rental or lease income. The income is corrected for expenses and risk factors which are determined by an expert using their experience.1490\n\nIng Ekspert Report, p 23.\n\n1221.\n\nThe comparative method adopted by Mr Zgombic instead attempts to compare the properties in question to comparable sales. The source of data used by Mr Zgombic were records obtained from the Croatian tax authority database.1491\n\nSecond PWC Report, p 34.\n\n1222.\n\nIn relation to the Claimants\u2019 valuation method, the Respondent has made the following submissions:\n\n(a) The comparative method is to be preferred where data is available as the method is a market driven method which values by comparison and there is no better indication of value.1492\n\n(b) Comparative data, in the form of the tax authority database exists, and was made available to the Claimants.1493\n\n(c) The methods used by Mr Zeljko rely too heavily on the alleged experience of Mr Zeljko and do not refer to objective standards such as industry data and transactions occurring in the real estate market.1494\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 819-820.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 822.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 220.\n\n1223.\n\nIn relation to the Respondent\u2019s valuation method, the Claimants have made the following submissions:\n\n(a) Comparative data used by Mr Zgombic was not in fact comparative, as the tax database does not contain sufficient detail about the properties it refers to, giving only a general descriptor as commercial, residential or agricultural. In the absence of such detail, Mr Zgombic was unable to know that properties had similar characteristics, and was unable to account for differences. This alleged flaw was coupled with adjustments to the tax database amounts which, on the Claimants\u2019 submission, were made without basis.1495\n\n(b) The main driver of the difference in determination between Mr Zeljko and Mr Zgombic was Mr Zgombic\u2019s treatment of certain buildings. In cases where Mr Zeljko had identified that a building was not rentable due to its current state of repair, Mr Zgombic ascribed no value to the building, whereas the Mr Zgombic contends that such buildings do have value, even though they require work in order to make them functional.1496\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 1025-1026, 1031, 1035.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 1029-1030; Tr, Day 8, 1751:20-1753:8.\n\n1224.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr Zeljko\u2019s expertise is in real estate valuation, an expertise on which he relied heavily in his valuation. As revealed during his cross examination, many of the factors used in his valuation method are based solely on his experience without reference to any objective third party data.1497 Mr Zeljko visited each of the properties, and valued them according to his experience. On the other hand, Mr Zgombic\u2019s experience is not specifically in real estate valuation, however his valuation methodology attempted to use objective third party data, being the tax administration database, this data suffers for being de-identified, thus not allowing either Mr Zeljko or Mr Zgombic to take a view as to whether it is truly comparative to the properties in question. Further, Mr Zgombic did not in fact attend the Properties in order to perform his valuation.\n\n*See* Tr Day 8, 1780-1789.\n\n1225.\n\nThe Tribunal sees some limitations in both expert reports. Mr Zeljko\u2019s report is somewhat opaque while Mr Zgombic appears to lack specific real estate valuation expertise in the Croatian market.\n\n1226.\n\nOn balance, the Tribunal prefers the evidence of Mr Zeljko given his specific experience relating to real estate valuation in Croatia. However, in certain instances the Tribunal finds below that it does not agree with the Claimants\u2019 valuation in relation to devastated buildings. The Tribunal sets out its valuation of the Properties for each Property for which the Claimants have established ownership, and have also established an expropriation. In cases where the Claimants have been unsuccessful in their claim for an entire Property, but have been successful in relation to certain plots which constitute that Property, the Tribunal has relied on the per square metre values supplied by Mr Zeljko.\n\n**(4) The Tribunal\u2019s Valuations of the Properties**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\u2022 Property 3\n------------\n\n1227.\n\nProperty 3 consists of a single plot that contains a retail building, over which the Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of. The Claimants have claimed EUR 33,720.88 in relation to this Property.1498 The Tribunal notes that this is significantly less than the valuation proffered by the Respondent of EUR 41,031.52.1499 Given that the Respondent has valued the Property at an amount greater than that claimed by the Claimants, the Tribunal finds that the value of the Property was EUR 33,720.88.\n\nIng Ekspert Report for Property 3.\n\nSecond PWC Report, Appendix C1.\n\n\u2022 Property 7\n------------\n\n1228.\n\nProperty 7 consists of a retail space on a single plot, over which the Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of. The Claimants have claimed EUR 206,557.78 in relation to this Property.1500 The Tribunal notes that this is less than the valuation proffered by the Respondent of EUR 211,321.75.1501 Given that the Respondent has valued the Property at an amount greater than that claimed by the Claimants, the Tribunal finds that the value of the plot was EUR 206,557.78.\n\nIng Ekspert Report for Property 7.\n\nSecond PWC Report, Appendix C1.\n\n\u2022 Property 10\n-------------\n\n1229.\n\nProperty 10 consists of empty land which has been classified by the experts as agricultural. The Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of eight out of the nine plots underlying the Property. As set out in Annexure 5, adopting the per square metre rate as found by Mr Zeljko, this results in a value of HRK 596,242.50.1502\n\nIng Ekspert Report for Property 10.\n\n\u2022 Property 13\n-------------\n\n1230.\n\nProperty 13 consists of a retail space in a building, which is situated on two plots, both of which the Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of. In this case, Mr Zeljko has stated that the \"property in question is [] not operational and is in a very poor condition. Furthermore, the exact position of the retail space in the building cannot be determined. Hence, in our opinion, said property in current condition cannot be rented. Therefore, no rent estimation for this property can be given.\" Mr Zeljko proceeds to value the Property at HRK 396,644.51.1503 Given that Mr Zeljko was unable to determine which part of the building in fact belonged to the Second Claimant, it is unclear on what basis that value was derived. In this case, given the nature of the building, as apparent from photos contained in Mr Zeljko\u2019s report, and the uncertainty as to which part of the building the Second Claimant owns, the Tribunal prefers the evidence of Mr Zgombic who has valued the land only at an amount of EUR 1,468.05.\n\nIng Ekspert Report for Property 13.\n\n\u2022 Property 14\n-------------\n\n1231.\n\nProperty 14 is a building on three plots, over all of which the Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of. As with Property 13, Property 14 is in a state of disrepair.1504 Mr Zeljko has valued the building in the amount of EUR 31,518.66, while Mr Zgombic has valued the Property on the basis of land value only at EUR 1,490.74. The photos of the building contained in Mr Zeljko\u2019s report seem to indicate that the building is in a better state of repair than Property 13, however it is still described by Mr Zeljko as in \"very poor condition.\" In relation to Property 14, based on Mr Zeljko\u2019s experience, and a review of the available evidence, the Tribunal values the Property at EUR 31,518.66.\n\nIng Ekspert Report for Property 14.\n\n\u2022 Property 15\n-------------\n\n1232.\n\nProperty 15 is retail premises on a single plot, over which the Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of. While Property 15 is not currently occupied, Mr Zeljko has not indicated that it is not able to be rented.1505 Mr Zeljko has valued the property at EUR 32,975.08, while Mr Zgombic has valued the property at EUR 36,201.65. Given the Respondent\u2019s valuation is greater than the Claimants\u2019 valuation, the Tribunal finds that the value of the Property, and its underlying plot, was EUR 32,975.08.\n\nIng Ekspert Report for Property 15.\n\n\u2022 Property 16\n-------------\n\n1233.\n\nProperty 16 is a functioning retail premises on a single plot, over which the Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of. Mr Zeljko has valued the property at EUR 35,105.11, while Mr Zgombic has valued the property at EUR 36,618.87. Given the Respondent\u2019s valuation is greater than the Claimants\u2019 valuation, the Tribunal finds that the value of the Property, and its underlying plot, was EUR 35,105.11.\n\n\u2022 Property 18\n-------------\n\n1234.\n\nProperty 18 consists of 6 plots, over all of which the Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation. The type of land is described by the experts as construction land and valued on that basis.1506 The experts differ in the amount that they value the land on a square metre basis, with Mr Zeljko\u2019s valuation of the Property being EUR 159,888.60 and Mr Zgombic\u2019s valuation being EUR 67,356.81. In this case, on the basis of Mr Zeljko\u2019s valuation experience, the Tribunal favours the valuation of Mr Zeljko and finds that the value of the Property, and its underlying plots, was EUR 159,888.60.\n\nIng Ekspert Report for Property 18; Second PWC Report, Appendix C1.\n\n\u2022 Property 20\n-------------\n\n1235.\n\nThis Property is a functioning retail premises on three plots, over all of which the Claimants have been successful in proving ownership, and showing expropriation of. Mr Zeljko has valued the Property at EUR 79,698.98, while Mr Zgombic has valued the Property at EUR 73,905.22. Given the proximity between the two valuations, the Tribunal accepts Mr Zeljko\u2019s valuation evidence. The Tribunal finds that the value of the Property, and its underlying plots, was EUR 79,698.98.\n\n\u2022 Property 23\n-------------\n\n1236.\n\nProperty 23 is a functioning retail premises and surrounding land on three plots. Of the three plots, only two appear in List 1 as prepared by the Parties, and only those two plots have been found to have been expropriated by the Respondent as set out above. The remaining plot 1685/50 in L.B. Sheet No 4379 does not appear in the lists prepared by the Parties. The missing plot, being the plot on which the retail building is constructed, also accounts for the bulk of the value of this Property on the opinion of both experts.\n\n1237.\n\nIn the above circumstances, given that the Tribunal has had no material on which to establish ownership or expropriation of the missing plot, the Tribunal values only the remaining two plots on the basis of the square metre rate provided by Mr Zeljko. The Tribunal finds that the value of the relevant plots was HRK 47,100.\n\n\u2022 Property 24\n-------------\n\n1238.\n\nProperty 24 is a functioning retail premises on multiple plots. The Claimants have only been successful in establishing ownership over one of the plots: plot 539/1. As is apparent from Mr Zeljko\u2019s valuation, the single plot over which the Claimants have been successful is the plot on which the retail premises sits, while the additional plots are empty construction land.1507 Mr Zeljko has separately valued the retail premises from the associated land using the cost method. Given this separation, it is possible for the Tribunal to determine that the value of the plot 539/1 is HRK 884,175.23. The Tribunal notes that Mr Zgombic has also valued the land and the premises separately, valuing the premises at EUR 255,585.93, which equates to approximately HRK 1,950,120. The Tribunal finds that in relation to plot 539/1 underlying Property 24, the value was HRK 884,175.23.\n\nIng Ekspert Report for Property 24.\n\n\u2022 Property 33\n-------------\n\n1239.\n\nProperty 33 is used as a retail premises and is constituted by a single plot, over which the Claimants have been successful in establishing ownership and showing expropriation of. Mr Zeljko has valued the property at EUR 34,024.03, while Mr Zgombic has valued the property at EUR 94,186.81. Given that the Respondent\u2019s valuation is greater than the Claimants\u2019 valuation, the Tribunal finds that the value of the Property, and its underlying plot, was EUR 34,024.03.\n\n\u2022 Property 36\n-------------\n\n1240.\n\nProperty 36 is a space within a building on a single plot, over which the Claimants have been successful in establishing ownership and showing expropriation of. As with previous properties, it is in a state of disrepair.1508 Mr Zeljko has valued the building in the amount of EUR 9,755.78, while Mr Zgombic has valued the land only at EUR 430.66. It is described by Mr Zeljko as in \"poor condition.\" Again, as with Property 14, the Tribunal prefers the evidence of Mr Zeljko based on his experience, and on the basis of the available evidence, including the photographs of Property 36, finds that the value of the Property was EUR 9,755.78.\n\nIng Ekspert report for Property 14.\n\n\u2022 Property 37\n-------------\n\n1241.\n\nProperty 37 is a retail premises which is constituted by a single plot, over which the Claimants have been successful in establishing ownership and showing expropriation of. Mr Zeljko has valued the property at EUR 43,294.98, while Mr Zgombic has valued the property at EUR 41,028.54. Given the proximity between the two valuations, the Tribunal accepts Mr Zeljko\u2019s valuation evidence. The Tribunal finds that the value of the Property, and its underlying plot, was EUR 43,294.98.\n\n\u2022 Property 54\n-------------\n\n1242.\n\nProperty 54 is a commercial building built on three plots. The Claimants have established ownership and expropriation over one of those plots, 197/25. From the report of Mr Zeljko, it is possible to discern that the relevant plot, 197/25, is empty land, while the remaining two plots of this Property house the commercial building. The Tribunal values the relevant plot on the basis of the square metre rate provided by Mr Zeljko. The Tribunal finds that the value of the relevant plot was HRK 34,636.00.\n\n\u2022 Property 55\n-------------\n\n1243.\n\nProperty 55 is a retail premises located in a multi-storey complex constituted by five separate plots, over all of which the Claimants have established ownership and expropriation. Mr Zeljko has valued the Property at EUR 119,135.37, while Mr Zgombic has valued the Property at EUR 70,793.19. The Tribunal notes that the discrepancy between the valuations for this Property is significant. Given Mr Zeljko\u2019s experience as a property valuer, the Tribunal prefers his evidence in this case and finds that the value of the Property was EUR 119,135.37.\n\n\u2022 Property 59\n-------------\n\n1244.\n\nProperty 59 constitutes several dilapidated buildings spread over 77 underlying plots. The Claimants have only been successful in proving their ownership and the subsequent expropriation of 43 of those plots. Many of the buildings on the Property have been ascribed no value by Mr Zeljko due to their condition; however, in relation to three buildings designated as Warehouse 1, Warehouse 2 and Administration Building, Mr Zeljko has estimated a value of HRK 705,722.49. As is apparent from maps provided by Mr Zeljko, the buildings in question are not on plots which the Tribunal has found were expropriated, being plots over which the Respondent has not attempted to register ownership. The 43 plots in question are therefore to be valued only as land. Such valuation is possible as Mr Zeljko has provided square metre rates for both construction and agricultural land in the location of the Property, which are accepted by the Tribunal based on Mr Zeljko\u2019s experience as land valuer. As is apparent from Annexure 5, once the land area of the 43 plots is multiplied by the relevant per square metre rates, this results in a value of HRK 290,731.00. The Tribunal finds that the value of relevant component of this Property was HRK 290,731.00.\n\n\u2022 Property 62\n-------------\n\n1245.\n\nProperty 62 is a warehouse complex situated on four plots, over all of which the Claimants have established ownership and expropriation. Mr Zeljko has valued the property at EUR 578,282.63, while Mr Zgombic has valued the property at EUR 949,269.72. Given the Respondent\u2019s valuation is greater than the Claimants\u2019 valuation, the Tribunal finds that the value of the Property, and its underlying plots, was EUR 578,282.63.\n\n\u2022 Property 67\n-------------\n\n1246.\n\nProperty 67 is farmland made up of six plots. The Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of one of those plots. This Property is unique amongst the relevant Properties in that the plot which the Claimants have been successful in relation to, plot 464/396, constitutes the vast bulk of the Property both in value and in area. From the reports of Mr Zeljko and Mr Zgombic, it is possible to identify that both experts consider that plot 464/396 constitutes construction land on which buildings currently exist, while the remainder of the property constitutes agricultural land. Mr Zeljko has ascribed little value to the agricultural land, valuing it at HRK 5,880.00, which equates to approximately EUR 770.00. Mr Zgombic values the agricultural plots at a similarly small amount of EUR 678.15. Once those values are subtracted from the overall valuation provided by both experts, it is apparent that Mr Zeljko values the relevant construction plot at EUR 104,397.64, while Mr Zgombic values it at EUR 134,697.50. Given that the Respondent\u2019s valuation is greater than the Claimants\u2019 valuation, the Tribunal finds that the value of the relevant plot was EUR 104,397.64.\n\n\u2022 Property 69\n-------------\n\n1247.\n\nProperty 69 is farmland made up of 89 plots. The Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of 24 of those plots. By his report, Mr Zeljko has calculated the value of the Property based on a per metre rate, which is accepted by the Tribunal on the basis of Mr Zeljko\u2019s experience as a valuer. The Tribunal has used this per metre rate to calculate the value of the 24 plots as set out in Annexure 5, which results in a finding that the value of the expropriated plots was HRK 281,172.00.\n\n\u2022 Property 70\n-------------\n\n1248.\n\nProperty 70 is a manufacturing facility encompassing 17 plots. The Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of two of those plots. For the relevant two plots Mr Zeljko has, by his report, provided a value on a per square metre rate, which is accepted by the Tribunal on the basis of Mr Zeljko\u2019s experience as a valuer. The Tribunal has used this per metre rate to calculate the value of the 2 plots as set out in Annexure 5, which results in a finding that the value of the expropriated plots was HRK 4,704.00.\n\n\u2022 Property 72\n-------------\n\n1249.\n\nProperty 72 is farmland made up of 128 plots. The Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of six of those plots. The Property further includes buildings which are described by Mr Zeljko as \"devastated and in poor condition\", which is shown to be an apt description by the photos attached to Mr Zeljko\u2019s report. It is unclear to the Tribunal, on the evidence provided, whether the buildings situated on this Property are located on the relevant six plots, or on some of the other 128 plots; however, it is ultimately of no consequence as the Tribunal declines to ascribe any value to the buildings on the same basis as above. By his report, Mr Zeljko has provided a per square metre rate for the land value of the plots, which is accepted by the Tribunal on the basis of Mr Zeljko\u2019s experience as a valuer. The Tribunal has used this per metre rate to calculate the value of the 6 plots as set out in Annexure 5, which results in a finding that the value of the expropriated plots was HRK 1,697,209.00.\n\n\u2022 Property 73\n-------------\n\n1250.\n\nProperty 73 is farmland made up of 121 plots. The Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of three of those plots. The Property further includes buildings which are described by Mr Zeljko as \"devastated and in poor condition\", which is again borne out by the photos attached to Mr Zeljko\u2019s report. Similar to Property 72, it is unclear to the Tribunal, on the evidence provided, whether the buildings situated on this Property are located on the relevant three plots, or on some of the other 118 plots, however, it is ultimately of no consequence as the Tribunal declines to ascribe any value to the buildings on the same basis as above. By his report, Mr Zeljko has provided a per square metre rate for the land value of the plots, which is accepted by the Tribunal on the basis of Mr Zeljko\u2019s experience as a valuer. The Tribunal has used this per metre rate to calculate the value of the three plots as set out in Annexure 5, which results in a finding that the value of the expropriated plots was HRK 45,370.50.\n\n\u2022 Property 74\n-------------\n\n1251.\n\nProperty 74 is a lake and surrounding land consisting of six plots, over all of which the Claimants have established ownership and expropriation. Mr Zeljko has valued the property at EUR 7,426.61, while Mr Zgombic has valued the property at EUR 13,242.06. Given that the Respondent\u2019s valuation is greater than the Claimants\u2019 valuation, the Tribunal finds that the value of the Property, and its underlying plots, was EUR 7,426.61.\n\n\u2022 Property 76\n-------------\n\n1252.\n\nProperty 76 is the old Gavrilovi\u0107 factory which sits on 13 plots, over all of which the Claimants have established ownership and expropriation. The experts have a significant divergence of opinion over the value of the Property, with Mr Zeljko valuing it at EUR 1,698,050.46 and Mr Zgombic valuing it at EUR 110,662.94. As with previous properties, Mr Zeljko has valued the property on a cost method, and therefore his valuation represents a perceived residual value in the structures present on the Property in addition to the land on which the structures sit. Again, Mr Zgombic has valued the Property on the basis of the land only.\n\n1253.\n\nMr Zeljko has stated that the factory buildings are \"devastated\" and that inspection of the internal areas of the buildings was only \"partially possible.\" The buildings are further described as \"not operational\" and in \"very poor condition.\" These descriptions by Mr Zeljko are borne out by the photos attached to his report, which show a series of structures in a state of disrepair.\n\n1254.\n\nAs with the previously considered Properties, the Tribunal ascribes no value to the structures. In these circumstances the Tribunal prefers the evidence of Mr Zgombic and finds that the value of the Property, and its underlying plots, was EUR 110,662.94.\n\n\u2022 Property 77\n-------------\n\n1255.\n\nProperty 77 is a farm consisting of a single plot, over which the Claimants have been successful in establishing ownership and expropriation. Property 77 is described by Mr Zeljko as being \"devastated, abandoned and not in use.\" Mr Zeljko has valued the farm on the cost method, relating to the farm buildings, resulting in a value in the amount of EUR 71,047.37. The photos of the building contained in Mr Zeljko\u2019s report seem to indicate that the building might have some remaining function. Mr Zgombic has valued the Property on the basis of land value only at EUR 2,997.19. As with Properties 14 and 36 above, the Tribunal accepts the valuation of Mr Zeljko based on his experience and supported by the available evidence. The Tribunal finds that the value of the Property was EUR 71,047.37.\n\n\u2022 Property 78\n-------------\n\n1256.\n\nProperty 78 is a large farm made up of 393 plots. The Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of 70 of those plots. Mr Zeljko in his report values the entire Property at EUR 3,166,565.00 while Mr Zgombic values the Property at EUR 1,303,022.96. The Property contains various structures and a wastewater lagoon. The Tribunal notes that on the evidence before it, it is not possible for the Tribunal to determine on which plots the structures sit, and on which plots the wastewater lagoon is located. Given this lack of evidence, the Tribunal is unable to determine whether the Claimants are entitled to be compensated for the value of those facilities.\n\n1257.\n\nGiven this evidentiary failing, on which the Claimants bear the burden, the Tribunal can only make a determination in relation to the value of the relevant land constituted by the 70 plots. By his report, Mr Zeljko has calculated the value of the Property based on a per metre rate, which is accepted by the Tribunal on the basis of Mr Zeljko\u2019s experience as a valuer. The Tribunal has used this per metre rate to calculate the value of the 70 plots as set out in Annexure 5, which results in a finding that the value of the expropriated plots was HRK 5,384,736.00.\n\n\u2022 Property 79\n-------------\n\n1258.\n\nProperty 79 is farmland made up of 209 plots. The Claimants have been successful in proving ownership and showing expropriation of 32 of those plots. By his report, Mr Zeljko has calculated the value of the Property based on a per metre rate, which is accepted by the Tribunal on the basis of Mr Zeljko\u2019s experience as a valuer. The Tribunal has used this per metre rate to calculate the value of the 32 plots as set out in Annexure 5, which results in a finding that the value of the expropriated plots was HRK 433,387.50.\n\n**(5) Conclusion on valuation**\n-------------------------------\n\n1259.\n\nIn total, as set out in Annexure 5, the Tribunal finds the value of the Taken Plots to have been HRK 9,699,463.73 and EUR 1,658,960.49.\n\n*Issue 9.1(a)(ii): Are the Claimants entitled to the present value of the rental income that the Claimants would have collected from the Properties and the Apartments but for the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT?*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1260.\n\nIn addition to their claim for the value of the expropriated Properties, the Claimants have made a further claim for lost rental income. The Claimants\u2019 calculation of lost rental income commences in 2002 when the Claimants state they \"certainly would have been able to register the Properties and Apartments, if [the] Respondent had acted in good faith, in accordance with the Purchase Agreement.\"1509\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1046.\n\n1261.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 calculation of lost rental income is based on figures estimated by Mr Zeljko. Mr Zeljko has provided rental estimates for each of the Properties on which he has opined, both for 2002 and 2014. This information was relied upon in the production of the Compass Lexecon report, which took a mid-point between these two values, adjusted the rental incomes for projected cost and tax implications, and then compounded the annual foregone rent using the Second Claimant\u2019s cost of equity.1510\n\nCompass Lexecon Report, \u00b6 81.\n\n1262.\n\nWhat is immediately apparent from this process is that the potential rental income for the Properties was considered by the Claimants\u2019 experts on a whole Property basis. During the hearing Mr Zeljko observed that in relation to a Property where five out of ten plots were found to be expropriated:\n\n*In theory, you could single out or set aside these five plots and define their value. However, based on what we have seen, we are talking about functional end--unities, and it\u2019s not possible to separate certain land plots and continue using the whole property, especially if there is a building located on this property*.1511\n\nTr Day 8, 1771:11-16.\n\n1263.\n\nOn the basis of functional nature of the Properties as claimed, the Tribunal determines that in cases where it has not been satisfied that the Claimants were the owners of an entire Property and that the Property was entirely expropriated by the Respondent, the Claimants have not established any loss attributable to lost rental income.\n\n1264.\n\nFurther, as is apparent from the evidence of Ms Gulam, the Claimants were in possession of the relevant Properties during the relevant period. In such circumstances, no claim for lost rental income can be sustained, and the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have made no such claim in relation to those Properties.1512\n\nSecond Gulam Statement, Annex IV; Compass Lexecon Report.\n\n1265.\n\nGiven the above two facts, in relation to the Taken Plots there is only one Property for which a claim for lost rental can be sustained: Property 15.\n\n1266.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is not in a position to determine the amount attributable to such lost rental income, due to the fact that the Tribunal has no evidence on which to do so.\n\n1267.\n\nWhile Mr Zeljko has provided the estimated gross rental income for Property 15, that estimate is only one input into the calculations of Compass Lexicon, which were performed on a global basis. On the information provided, the Tribunal is unable to determine what the net return to the Second Claimant would have been in relation to this Property. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that no amount should be awarded for lost rental income.\n\n***Issue 9.1(b): What are the indirect damages?***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*Issue 9.1(b)(i): Are the Claimants entitled to damages for the alleged inability to obtain financing resulting from the Respondent\u2019s failure to register the claimed properties?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Issue 9.1(b)(ii): If so, what is the difference between the current value of the Second Claimant and the likely value of the Second Claimant if it had been able to register its ownership of the claimed properties by 2002?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Issue 9.1(c): Is there a causal link between the alleged BIT breaches and any loss or damage suffered by the Claimants?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Issue 9.1(d): Are the Claimants entitled to \"indirect\" damages for the alleged inability to obtain financing resulting from the Respondent\u2019s failure to register the claimed properties?***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n1268.\n\nThe Claimants allege that they have suffered (and continue to suffer) indirect losses as a result of lost business opportunities due to the Claimants\u2019 inability to employ the claimed properties as collateral for the financing needed to execute the expansion plans they considered in the 2000s.1513 In particular, the Claimants say that they suffered two types of indirect damages. The first is historical discrete damages: the damages suffered until the date of assessment, 31 December 2013, which reflect the difference between the actual performance of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. during the period, and the \"but for\" performance that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. would have achieved had it been able to secure the necessary funds to carry out the projected plant expansions.1514 The second is equity damages: the loss in the market value of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. as of the date of assessment, 31 December 2013, due to Croatia\u2019s violations of the BIT.1515\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opening Presentation dated 7 March 2016 (C-0632), slide 192; Second Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6 16.\n\nCompass Lexecon Report, \u00b6 86.\n\nCompass Lexecon Report, \u00b6 111.\n\n1269.\n\nAs of 2001, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. was the Croatian industry leader in processed meat products.1516 According to the Claimants\u2019 experts at Compass Lexecon, as of 2001, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. was in a particularly good position to undertake a rapid expansion. Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. was, among its competitors, the company with the highest brand value, with the best efficiencies and highest profit margins.1517 Since 2001, the company\u2019s growth has stagnated.1518 The Claimants submit that this is primarily due to financial constraints on funding, while \"well-financed\" competitors have taken its market share.1519\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1056; Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6 32; Second Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6 8.\n\nTr Day 8, 1808:14-19.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1056; Claimants\u2019 Opening Presentation dated 7 March 2016 (C-0632), slide 3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 1056 *et seq*.\n\n1270.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, *but for* the Respondent\u2019s actions, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. would have been able to register its ownership over the claimed properties by at least 2002, and could have used them as collateral to increase its profits.1520 Further, had it been able to implement a growth plan in 2002, the Claimants contend it is \"likely\" Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. would have enjoyed a first-mover advantage that would have increased its market share, discouraged competitors, and improved its overall sales and profitability.1521 This, in turn, would have increased the value of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. as a going concern.1522\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 1059-1062.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1057.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1075.\n\n1271.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s failure to allow the Claimants to register their ownership over the claimed properties is the proximate cause of the indirect losses estimated by Compass Lexecon.1523\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b61075.\n\n1272.\n\nThe Claimants rely on the following as evidence of their desire to expand between 1996 and 2007:\n\n(a) the IFC 1996 Report;1524\n\n(b) the IFC 2002 Report, prepared by consultants chosen by the IFC, which analysed the progress the company had made since 1996 and prepared a development plan for the company for the next five years;1525 and\n\n(c) the engagement of LiBner between 2001 and 2007 to prepare a strategic expansion plan for the company\u2019s production facilities.1526\n\nIFC 1996 Report (C-0061).\n\nIFC 2002 Report (C-0142).\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1058; *See* LiBner 2006 Business Plan (C-0144); Gavrilovi\u0107 Jr Statement, \u00b6 18.\n\n1273.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 indirect damages claim, in particular as to the projected expansion of the company and financing requirements, is in large part premised on the IFC 2002 Report. The 2002 Report envisaged a production increase from 10,000 tons in 2001 to 25,000 tons in 2007. It required a total investment of EUR 68 million from 2002 to 2007 to be divided as EUR 36 million of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s own funds, EUR 21 million from a strategic investor, and EUR 11 million from local banks.1527 This total included an investment of EUR 26.5 million in working capital, most of which had already been committed by Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.1528 Ultimately, the IFC decided not to enter the project financing for portfolio reasons.1529\n\nIFC 2002 Report (C-0142), p 74. *See also* Second PWC Report, \u00b6 243; PWC Presentation, March 2016 (R-0372), slide 31. The LiBner 2006 plan only reported an estimate of between EUR 12.6 million and EUR 16.2 million related exclusively to the engineering and building component of the expansion plan (i.e., excluding equipment and working capital needs). *See* LiBner Production Plan (2006-2010) (CLEX-0015).\n\nCompass Lexecon Report, fn 59.\n\nGavrilovi\u0107 Jr Statement, \u00b6 25.\n\n1274.\n\nThe timing of the investment was critical for Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s ability to capture growth potential and outgrow its competitors, according to the Claimants.1530 The Claimants say that they tried reaching out to commercial banks to obtain loans to implement the plans, but were unable to obtain sufficient funding due to a lack of collateral to obtain such financing, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the ownership of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. and its ownership of assets.1531\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1061; Compass Lexecon Report, \u00a7 V.4; Second Compass Lexecon Report, \u00a7 III.2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1059, *citing* Gavrilovi\u0107 Sr Statement, \u00b6 65; M\u00fcller Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Letter from Mr Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 to Mr Herbert Stepic, Deputy Chairman of the Managing Board of the Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG, regarding financing for Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. dated 21 October 1996 (C-0140).\n\n1275.\n\nThe Claimants stress that access to collateral was essential to securing debt financing at the time.1532 The Claimants submit that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., however, had, at the time, only been able to register properties valued at approximately EUR 1.3 million.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1062; Claimants\u2019 Reply PHB, \u00b6 189; Compass Lexecon Report, \u00a7 VI; Second Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6 68; Ettenauer Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n\n1276.\n\nBased on the contemporaneous IFC 2002 Report and the growth of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s primary competitor PIK Vrbovec, Compass Lexecon has set forth an estimate of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s likely performance in terms of profits and equity value if it had been able to register the Properties and the Apartments, and use the same to implement the plan contained in the IFC 2002 Report. Pursuant to this analysis, Compass Lexecon estimates that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. suffered lost profits of EUR 58.63 million,1533 and that the equity value of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. was depressed by EUR 86 million.1534\n\n*See* Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6\u00b6 86-110; Second Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\n*See* Second Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6 7, *referring to* Second Direct Damages Calculations (CLEX-0085), and Compass Lexecon Second Valuation Model (CLEX-0086).\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n1277.\n\nThe Respondent advances numerous criticisms of the Claimants\u2019 indirect damages claim, which may be summarised as falling broadly into three main flaws in the Claimants\u2019 claim. First, the Claimants have suffered no indirect loss given that they actually invested the amounts envisaged under the business plan on which their alleged losses are based. If they failed to expand as envisaged, it was because of a sales problem, not a production problem.1535\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00a7 VI.D.2(a).\n\n1278.\n\nSecond, the \"but for\" scenario on which the Claimants base their alleged indirect losses is speculative and unsupported by the available evidence.1536 According to the Respondent, the lower than envisaged sales under the IFC 2002 Report were not due to a lack of funding; rather, the lower figures were due to: (i) the departure from the strategy and recommendations set out in the IFC 2002 Report; (ii) the different development of prices and other factors than those estimated in the IFC 2002 Report; and/or (iii) the fact that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. was not in as unique a position for expansion as Compass Lexecon assumed.1537\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00a7 VI.D.2(b).\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 873-884.\n\n1279.\n\nThird, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants are unable to show a sufficient causal link between their alleged indirect losses and any specific measure in alleged violation of the BIT. In particular: (i) the Claimants have not produced a single contemporaneous document showing that they ever intended to implement any of the alleged business plans that they commissioned; (ii) the Claimants have not produced a single contemporaneous document showing that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. was ever denied a loan due to lack of real property collateral in the period for which they claim damages, nor that they attempted to obtain financing by mortgaging or pledging assets other than real property or by requesting financing from other sources; (iii) the estimated value of the claimed properties would not have been sufficient to raise the funding required to implement the plan set out in the IFC 2002 Report; and (iv) Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. did not suffer from a financing problem, it suffered from a sales problem that is unrelated to any action undertaken by the Respondent.1538\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 889-897.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n1280.\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses the Claimants\u2019 claim for indirect damages for the reasons that follow. In sum, the Tribunal finds that there is no causal link between the alleged BIT breaches and any indirect loss or damage suffered by the Claimants.\n\n1281.\n\nThe claim rests on the proposition that Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. could not use the Properties and the Apartments as collateral to raise the funds required to expand. This, in turn, is founded on the proposition that the value of the Properties and the Apartments that were the subject of specific measures in violation of the BIT would have constituted sufficient collateral to raise monies to fund the expansion of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. Indeed, for this reason, counsel for the Claimants described the indirect damages claim as an \"all-or-nothing type proposition.\"1539\n\nTr Day 10, 2440:3-9.\n\n1282.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 experts opine that the combined value of the Properties and the Apartments would have been sufficient to fund the proposed expansion of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.,1540 as total financing needs for the Claimants\u2019 proposed expansion plan through 2014 were EUR 19.4 million, while the value of the Properties and the Apartments as of 2001 was EUR 28.2 million.1541 Compass Lexecon further explains:\n\n*Contrary to* PwC\u2019s *assertion, the 2002 market value of the properties and apartments (at approximately EUR 28 million) would have been sufficient to cover the incremental financing needed to fund our assessed expansion plan. PwC incorrectly compare the EUR 20 million of additional financing that could have been raised from the collateral from the Properties (Ing\u2019s estimated market value of the Properties at EUR 28 million as of 2002 reduced, by PwC, by a 40% margin) to the external financing needs of the IFC plan at EUR 32 million.*\n\n*The proper comparison should be between the available collateral and the debt financing requirements per our but-for investment plan on an annual basis, and not the financing requirements per the IFC plan. When assessing financial needs on an annual basis rather than overall, cash flows obtained from expanded production can be used to both repay the loans and also to help fund the expansion plan, thus reducing the overall external financing requirements*.1542\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1064, *citing* Second Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6\u00b6 62-66.\n\nSecond Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6 8.\n\nSecond Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6\u00b6 64-65, *referring to* PWC Report, \u00b6 187.\n\n1283.\n\nMore particularly, the Claimants\u2019 experts state that the IFC 2002 Report required capital expenditure of EUR 17.8 million to be incurred between 2002 and 2006.1543 According to the Claimants, EUR 8.5 million would be sourced from cash flow generated by Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o., leaving EUR 9.4 million that was required from external funding sources.1544 Applying the collateral margin of 139% used in the Compass Lexecon Report,1545 the Claimants\u2019 alleged expansion plan required around EUR 13 million in asset collateral.1546 This is depicted in the diagram that follows.\n\nCompass Hearing Presentation, 16 March 2016 (C-0627), slide 18; Tr Day 8, 1820:13-17.\n\nCompass Hearing Presentation, 16 March 2016 (C-0627), slide 18; Tr Day 8, 1820:18-1821:3.\n\nCompass Lexecon Report, \u00b6 58.\n\nCompass Hearing Presentation, 16 March 2016 (C-0627), slide 18; Tr Day 8, 1821:3-15.\n\n1284.\n\nConsistently with this estimation, the Claimants\u2019 counsel confirmed that the indirect damages claim was not proportionate to the direct damages claim. Most importantly, while the Claimants\u2019 indirect damages claim is not premised on *all* of the Properties and the Apartments as collateral, \"it would have required asset collateral of EUR 13 million at 139 percent.\"1547\n\nTr Day 10, 2339:18-2440:9.\n\n1285.\n\nThere is force in the Respondent\u2019s submission that it is unclear where Compass Lexecon\u2019s figure of EUR 17.8 million of future capital expenditure to be incurred comes from. Further, Compass Lexecon\u2019s analysis does not include the cost of financing working capital, as provided in the IFC 2002 Report. Further, if Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. incurred capital expenditure other than in accordance with the areas specified in the IFC 2002 Report, additional capital expenditure would have to be incurred compared to the level assumed by Compass Lexecon in Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o.\u2019s but-for scenario.1548 However, for the reasons that follow, the Tribunal can proceed with the figure of EUR 13 million calculated by Compass Lexecon.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 895.\n\n1286.\n\nDeterminatively, the combined value of the Properties and the Apartments as at 2014 for which the Claimants have established a breach of the BIT is HRK 9,699,463.73 and EUR 1,658,960.49. On the evidence of Mr Zeljko, the value of the Properties has increased between 2002 and 2014.1549 Thus, assuming *arguendo* that the Claimants\u2019 assumptions, propositions and calculations are correct, the value of the properties as at 2002 for which the Claimants have established a breach of the BIT did not provide sufficient collateral. In other words, Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. did not lack the collateral necessary to obtain such financing by reason of the Respondent\u2019s violations of the BIT.\n\n*See* Ing Ekspert reports for the Properties, comparing the valuations from 2002 and 2014.\n\n1287.\n\nAccordingly, the indirect damages claim fails entirely on the Claimants\u2019 own \"all-or-nothing\" proposition. As such, the Tribunal need not consider whether the Claimants intended to implement these expansion plans (or a convenient variation thereof), whether the Claimants invested the amounts envisaged under the investment plan and the failure to expand was due to certain other issues, whether the Claimants were unable to obtain financing or funds from other sources, whether other assumptions underlying the but-for scenario and damages calculation are appropriate, nor whether the valuation method employed by Compass Lexecon to calculate the alleged historical discrete losses is accurate.\n\n1288.\n\nIt follows that the question of the difference between the current value of Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. and its likely value had there been no violation of the BIT does not arise.\n\n***Issue 9.1(e): How are any damages to be apportioned between the two Claimants?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1289.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the damages should be apportioned to the Second Claimant. The Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT harmed Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. As the 100% equity holder of the Second Claimant,1550 the First Claimant will be made whole from the payment of damages to the Second Claimant.1551\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 272; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 794.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1080. *See also* Tr Day 10, 2431:14-2432:3 (\"[Arbitrator Alexandrov:] Why is it that the Claimants would not be made whole if the payment is awarded to Claimant Number One? Mr Soller: That would also be, I think, acceptable to [the] Claimants. It\u2019s just as a matter of principle. Money doesn't flow through the owner of a company to the company, but money does flow through a company to its owner. So, I think, as just a matter of general principle, the owner of a company is made whole if the company he owns is given the money, but it\u2019s not something that [the] Claimants have a preference on.\").\n\n***Issue 9.1(f): Are the Claimants entitled to pre- and post-Award interest and, if so, at what rate(s)?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1290.\n\nThe Claimants claim pre-Award and post-Award interest from the date of valuation.1552 The Parties disagree as to the entitlement of interest and the rate at which interest should be paid. Many of the arguments raised by the Parties are only relevant in the light of the Claimants\u2019 claim for indirect damages, which has ultimately been unsuccessful. The Tribunal does not address those arguments below.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 1082.\n\n**(1) The Claimants\u2019 Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n1291.\n\nThe Claimants, in summary, contend that:\n\n(a) The concept of full compensation requires the award of pre-Award and postAward interest and the appropriate rate of that interest is the Second Claimant\u2019s average cost of equity compounded from the valuation date of 31 December 2013 until the amount is paid.1553 This date has been selected as the Claimants\u2019 indirect damages claim takes into account the value of the amount of direct damages allegedly suffered by the Claimants up to that date.1554\n\n(b) The well-settled standard for damages in international law is that compound interest is payable from the date of damage until the date of payment.1555 The Claimants further contend that compound interest reflects commercial reality.1556\n\n(c) The Second Claimant\u2019s average cost of equity represents the appropriate rate of interest as it is the rate at which the Claimants will be compensated for foregone revenues and the associated financial cost due to the delay in payment.1557\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 433.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 916.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 915 *citing* ILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), p 107; *Middle East v Egypt* (CL-0059), \u00b6\u00b6 174-175.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 919 *citing* *MTD v Chile* (CL-0050), \u00b6 251.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 918.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n1292.\n\nThe Respondent, in summary, contends that:\n\n(a) Interest is not automatically awarded by arbitral tribunals, and the Claimants have not shown why interest is necessary to provide them with full reparation.1558\n\n(b) Compound interest is also not awarded automatically and is not a principle of international law.1559\n\n(c) The Claimants are not entitled to pre-Award interest as their entitlement to compensation only accrues at the time of the Award.1560\n\n(d) Awarding interest at the Second Claimant\u2019s cost of equity would provide a windfall to the Claimants, not adequate compensation, and a more appropriate rate would be the Croatian deposit rate.1561\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 707 *citing* ILC Articles (CL-0054 / RL-0115), Art 28.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6708 *citing* *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008 (RL-0145), \u00b6 473. The Respondent further refers to C. Brower and J. Sharpe, \"Awards of Compound Interest in International Arbitration: The *Aminoil* Non-Precedent\" in G. Aksen and others (eds), *Global Reflections on International Law, Commerce and Dispute Resolution: Liber Amicorum in honour of Robert Briner* (ICC Publishing, 2005) (RL-0146), p 156 (\"In one respect, however, arbitral tribunals (like national courts) have been nearly unanimous: compound interest (or interest on interest) is not allowed.\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 709 *citing Lemire v Ukraine* (RL-0123), \u00b6 363.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 711.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n1293.\n\nArticle 4(2) of the BIT states that in the case of an expropriation, compensation \"shall include interest at the prevailing commercial rate, however, in no event less than the current LIBOR-rate or equivalent from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.\"1562 The Tribunal considers that the payment of pre-Award and post-Award interest on that basis at least should be uncontroversial.\n\nBIT (CL-0025), Art 4(2).\n\n1294.\n\nAs to the date from which interest is to be calculated, the Tribunal considers that the date of 2 January 2014 is appropriate. The valuations relied upon by the Claimants and utilised by the Tribunal in determining the value of the Taken Plots were made as of that date, and therefore encompassed any increase in value of the Taken Plots from the time of expropriation until that date.\n\n1295.\n\nAs to the rate of interest, the Tribunal finds that the appropriate rate in this case is, in line with the requirement of Article 4(2) of the BIT, a commercial one, not linked to the cost of equity of the Second Claimant. While the Second Claimant\u2019s cost of equity may have been relevant to its claim for indirect damages, there is no evidence before the Tribunal that had the Taken Plots not been expropriated, they would have had a value to the Second Claimant equivalent to that cost of equity. The Tribunal finds that an appropriate commercial rate is LIBOR + 2% on an annual basis.\n\n1296.\n\nThe Tribunal further finds that such interest should be calculated on a compound basis, compounded annually. The Tribunal finds that the award of compound interest is in accordance with the reality of the losses suffered by the Claimants, as was found by the tribunal in *MTD v Chile*.1563\n\n*MTD v Chile* (CL-0050), \u00b6 251.\n\n***Issue 9.1(g): What is the effect of any award of damages for expropriation on potential domestic claims to the respective property?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1297.\n\nThe question of the effect of this Award on claims that may in the future be brought in Croatian courts is a question for those courts. Ultimately, those courts may have reference to this decision so as to prevent double-recovery. No doubt the Respondent will bring this Award to the attention of those courts.\n\n**XV.

Rather, the practice has been to split the costs evenly, whether the claimant or the respondent prevails.\").\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Lemire v Ukraine* (RL-0123), \u00b6 380 (\"The Arbitral Tribunal, however, welcomes the newly established and growing trend, that there should be an allocation of costs that reflects in some measure the principle that the losing party should contribute in a significant, if not necessarily exhaustive, fashion to the fees, costs and expenses of the arbitration of the prevailing party.\").\n\n1317.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the Parties correctly agree that a party\u2019s procedural conduct should be taken into account in the allocation of costs.1585\n\nClaimants\u2019 SoC, \u00b6 5; Respondent\u2019s Reply SoC, \u00b6 4.\n\n1318.\n\nIn this case, the Claimants have been successful in this arbitration but have only recovered HRK 9,699,463.73 and EUR 1,658,960.49, which is less than 2% of the quantum claimed.1586\n\nIn their Memorial, the Claimants claimed EUR 47.6 million in direct damages and EUR 157.4 million in indirect damages.\n\n1319.\n\nRelevantly, the Respondent has been unsuccessful in a number of jurisdictional arguments it has raised, including that there was no investor, no investment and its \"illegality\" argument. The Respondent has also objected at numerous stages of the proceedings to alleged \"wrongdoings\", which were ultimately unsuccessful. Some of these arguments and challenges unnecessarily, and significantly, increased the time and costs involved in this arbitration.\n\n1320.\n\nHaving careful regard to the Parties\u2019 submissions and the above factors, the Tribunal has determined that the Claimants are entitled to recover some, and not all, of their costs. The Tribunal considers it appropriate and reasonable that the Respondent reimburse the Claimants for thirty percent of their legal and other costs and that the Respondent reimburse the Claimants for thirty percent of the costs of the arbitration for which the Claimants are liable.\n\n1321.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts. As a result, both the Claimants\u2019 and the Respondent\u2019s share of the costs of the arbitration amounts to USD 950,960.93. The Respondent shall pay to the Claimants an amount of USD 285,288.28 representing 30% of the amount paid by the Claimants. Any remaining monies held on deposit shall be returned to the Parties in equal shares.\n\n1322.\n\nThe Respondent shall pay the Claimants an amount of EUR 2,593,642.36 in relation to their legal and other costs.\n\n1323.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal finds that it is just and proper to award post-Award interest on both the claim for legal costs, and costs of the arbitration, from the date of this Award until the date of payment, so as to compensate the Claimants in circumstances where the payment of costs are delayed.\n\n**XVI. AWARD**\n--------------\n\n1324.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Tribunal finds that:\n\n(a) It has jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 claims;\n\n(b) The Respondent has breached its obligation under Article 4(1) of the BIT;\n\n(c) The Respondent shall pay the Second Claimant the amounts of HRK 9,699,463.73 and EUR 1,658,960.49 by way of damages;\n\n(d) The Respondent shall pay interest, compounded annually, on the above amount from 2 January 2014 at a rate of LIBOR + 2% until such time as the amount has been paid in full;\n\n(e) The Respondent shall pay the Claimants an amount of EUR 2,593,642.36 being 30% of the Claimants\u2019 legal and other costs;\n\n(f) The Respondent shall pay the Claimants an amount of USD 285,288.28 being 30% of the fees and expenses of ICSID, the Tribunal, and the Tribunal Assistants paid by the Claimants;\n\n(g) The Respondent shall pay interest, compounded annually, on the amounts stated in paragraphs (e) and (f) from the date of this Award at a rate of LIBOR + 2% until such time as the amount has been paid in full; and\n\n(h) All other claims are dismissed."}]}
