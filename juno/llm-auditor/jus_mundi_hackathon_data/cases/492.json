INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Claimant**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nEureko B.V. (\" **Eureko** \" or \" **Claimant** \") is a Dutch private company with limited liability, having its statutory seat in Amsterdam and its head offices in Zeist, The Netherlands.\n\n2.\n\nThe group of companies headed by Eureko is a financial services group that offers a range of insurance products internationally, including health insurance, life and non-life insurance, pension products, asset management and banking. Eureko operates in the Slovak Republic through two companies: (i) Union poist\u2019ov\u0148a a.s. (\" **Union Insurance** \"), incorporated in 1991 by the Government of the Slovak Republic and privatised in 1992, in which Eureko acquired shares in 1997; and (ii) Union zdravotn\u00e1 poist\u2019ov\u0148a, a.s (\" **Union Healthcare** \"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eureko incorporated in 2006 and funded by Eureko.1 This arbitration primarily concerns Eureko's investment in Union Healthcare.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 II.2, 4-12.\n\n3.\n\nEureko is represented in this arbitration by Marnix Leijten, Rogier Schellaars, Albert Marsman, and Patrick Ploeger of De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V., Claude Debussylaan 80, 1082 MD Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and by Ren\u00e9 Visser and Nynke Hupkens of Eureko B.V.\n\n**B. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Slovak Republic (\" **Slovak Republic** \" or \" **Respondent** \") is a sovereign State, formerly a part of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. It gained independence on 1 January 1993 and joined the European Union (\" **EU** \") on 1 May 2004. The Slovak Republic is a multiparty parliamentary democracy, with executive power lying with the government headed by a Prime Minister.2\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 II.16-22.\n\n5.\n\nRespondent is represented in this arbitration by Andrej Sol\u00e1r and Andrea Hol\u00edkov\u00e1 of the Slovak Republic Ministry of Finance, Stefanovicova 5, 817 82 Bratislava, the Slovak Republic; Martin Maisner, Milos Ol\u00edk, Pavel \u010cernohorsk\u00fd and David Fyrbach of Rowan Legal, s.r.o., N\u00e1mestie Slobody 11, 811 06 Bratislava, Slovak Republic; Luk\u00e1s Trojan, Jan Stov\u00ed\u010dek and Martin Dole\u010dek of KSD Stov\u00ed\u010dek advok\u00e1tska kancel\u00e1ria, s.r.o., Michalsk\u00e1 7, 811 01 Bratislava, Slovak Republic; and Jay Alexander and Alejandro Escobar, Baker Botts LLP, The Warner, 1299 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20004-2400, United States of America.\n\n**C. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n6.\n\nClaimant initiated this arbitration on the basis of claims that the Slovak Republic has violated the 1992 Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (\" **Treaty** \" or \" **BIT** \").3\n\nSigned on 29 April 1991, entered into force on 1 October 1992 (Exhibit C-10).\n\n7.\n\nClaimant complains that various legislative measures introduced by Respondent after a change in government in July 2006 constituted a systematic reversal of the 2004 liberalisation of the Slovak health insurance market that had prompted Eureko to invest in the Slovak Republic's health insurance sector. According to Claimant, these actions destroyed the value of Eureko's investment. Claimant characterises the measures as constituting an unlawful indirect expropriation of its investment in Union Healthcare, in breach of **Article 5** of the BIT. Claimant further alleges that Respondent's conduct amounts to a violation of the BIT's standards of protection contained in its provisions on (i) fair and equitable treatment including as to nondiscrimination (**Article 3(1)** of the BIT), (ii) full protection and security (**Article 3(2)** of the BIT), and (iii) free transfer of profits and dividends (**Article 4** of the BIT).4 Claimant seeks, *inter alia*, compensation in an amount exceeding \u20ac100 million for damages suffered as a result of the Slovak Republic's alleged breaches of the Treaty, as well as costs, interest and a declaration to the effect that the Slovak Republic has breached and continues to breach its obligations under the Treaty.5\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 IV.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 10. Claimant will present a detailed damages claim in a subsequent phase of the arbitration as appropriate (Statement of Claim, \u00b6 V.28; Procedural Order No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 5.6).\n\n8.\n\nThe Slovak Republic challenged the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the dispute under the principles of *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae* and raised a further jurisdictional objection based on the Slovak Republic's membership of the EU. It denies that it has expropriated or otherwise violated any obligation\u2014international or otherwise\u2014 purportedly owed to Eureko, that any of Eureko's claims are viable as a matter of fact and law, and that Eureko has suffered any cognizable damages or injury. Respondent asserts that it has complied fully with all applicable international legal requirements.6\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2, 128.\n\n9.\n\nIn accordance with the procedure agreed with the Parties, this Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension deals exclusively with Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on the Slovak Republic's membership of the EU. In essence, Respondent argues that, as a matter of international law, EU law, Slovak law and German law, the accession of the Slovak Republic to the EU in May 2004 terminated the BIT or rendered its arbitration clause inapplicable, and accordingly this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute (the \" **Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection** \"). Claimant denies this.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Commencement of the Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nPursuant to Article 8 of the Treaty and Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Eureko sent a Notice of Arbitration to Respondent on 1 October 2008, which Respondent received on 3 October 2008.\n\n11.\n\nArticle 8 of the Treaty provides in the relevant parts as follows:\n\n(1) All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement.\n\n(5) The arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure applying the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n(6) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively:\n\n\u2022 the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n\u2022 the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n\u2022 the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;\n\n\u2022 the general principles of international law.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 17 October 2008, Claimant appointed Professor Albert Jan van den Berg as the first arbitrator.\n\n13.\n\nOn 26 November 2008, Respondent appointed His Excellency Judge Peter Tomka as the second arbitrator.\n\n14.\n\nOn 20 December 2008, the co-arbitrators jointly appointed Professor Vaughan Lowe QC as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Parties signed Terms of Appointment on 5 March 2009, confirming the constitution of the Tribunal and designating the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\" **PCA** \") to act as registry in the arbitration. It was agreed that the language of the proceedings would be English.7\n\nTerms of Appointment, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5 and 11.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal held a procedural hearing with the Parties on 19 March 2009 at the Peace Palace in The Hague. On that date, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1**, taking into account the agreements reached at the hearing. In Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal determined Frankfurt, Germany to be the place (seat) of the arbitration, while reserving the Tribunal's right to conduct hearings and meetings at any location considered appropriate.8 Procedural Order No. 1 also provided, *inter alia,* for a preliminary schedule for the Parties' submissions, for the use of teleconference as a means of communication between the Tribunal and the Parties, for the methods of production of evidence and for confidentiality undertakings.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, \u00b6 1.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter dated 7 April 2009, Judge Tomka notified his co-arbitrators and the Parties of his decision to resign as arbitrator in the present case, with effect from 30 April 2009. On 6 May 2009, Respondent notified the appointment of Mr. Van Vechten Veeder QC as substitute arbitrator, who formally accepted the appointment on 18 May 2009. The PCA drew the Parties' attention to the fact that both Mr. Veeder and Professor Lowe are members of Essex Court Chambers. By e-mails from Respondent dated 27 May 2009 and from Claimant dated 5 June 2009, both Parties confirmed in writing that they had no objection to Mr. Veeder's appointment.\n\n**C. Written Proceedings**\n--------------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Claimant filed its **Statement of Claim**, with accompanying exhibits, on 16 June 2009.\n\n19.\n\nRespondent filed its **Statement of Defence**, with accompanying exhibits, on 30 October 2009. In addition to rejecting Claimant's claims, Respondent asserted that Eureko had not presented sufficient facts to establish either jurisdiction *ratione personae* or *ratione materiae*.9 Respondent also introduced the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, arguing that the Slovak Republic's membership in the EU deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction because, *inter alia* : (i) the European Community treaty (\" **EC Treaty** \")10 governs the same subject matter as the BIT and therefore the BIT should be considered terminated and/or inapplicable pursuant to Articles 59 and 30 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\" **VCLT** \" or \" **Vienna Convention** \"),11 (ii) the arbitration clause in the BIT cannot apply because it is incompatible with the EC Treaty, as the ECJ has exclusive jurisdiction over Eureko's claims, and (iii) clauses such as Article 4 of the BIT relating to free transfer of capital have been held by the European Court of Justice (\" **ECJ** \") to be incompatible with EU law, which is supreme.12\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 125-126.\n\nTreaty Establishing the European Community 25 March 1957 (entered into force on 1 January 1958) now Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 5 September 2008, 2008 O.J. (C 115) 47 (hereafter \" **TFEU** \").\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, UN Doc. A/Conf.39/27; 1155 UNTS 331; 8 ILM 679 (1969); 23 May 1969 (entered into force 27 January 1980) (hereafter \" **VCLT** \"). The Netherlands acceded to the VCLT on 9 April 1985 and the Slovak Republic succeeded to the VCLT on 28 May 1993.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 119-124.\n\n20.\n\nOn 3 December 2009, having considered the matters raised during a teleconference held with the Parties the previous day, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2**... In Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal decided to hold a preliminary jurisdictional phase dedicated to Respondent's Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, and set a schedule for the Parties' submissions, for requests for document disclosure and for a hearing on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection. The Tribunal noted from the teleconference that there had been no agreement between the Parties on any form of consolidation of hearings on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection in this case with those in other pending cases against the Slovak Republic in which similar issues might also arise. With respect to the *ratione personae* jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal requested Claimant to produce evidence of the extent of its shareholding and written assurances as to its continued ownership of the claim, after which Respondent would be given an opportunity to particularise any outstanding concerns. With respect to the *ratione materiae* jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal ordered the Parties to proceed by way of concurrent requests for document production in the form of \"Redfern Schedules.\" The Tribunal reserved any decision on how and when to resolve the *ratione materiae* issues until after it had reviewed the Parties' positions.\n\n21.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 2, the Parties exchanged requests for disclosure of documents related to the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection on 4 December 2009, and replies and responses on disclosure on 11 and 17 December 2009. On 21 December 2009, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 3**, deciding the outstanding issues of document production.\n\n22.\n\nOn 29 January 2010, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Claimant provided evidence of the extent of its shareholding in Union Healthcare at all relevant times and written assurances as to its continuous ownership of the claims that it has brought against Respondent in this arbitration. By letter dated 22 February 2010, Respondent stated that it raised no questions regarding the Claimant's jurisdiction *ratione personae*... By letter dated 25 February 2010, the PCA informed the Parties that the Tribunal, after review of the Parties' positions, decided that no action needed to be taken on the question of jurisdiction *ratione personae*.\n\n23.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Respondent submitted its Memorial on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection with accompanying exhibits on 29 January 2010 (\" **Jurisdiction Memorial** \") and Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection with accompanying exhibits on 26 February 2010 (\" **Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial** \"). The Parties' jurisdictional arguments are set out in more detail in Part IV below.\n\n24.\n\nOn 5 February 2010, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Respondent filed a request for disclosure of documents with respect to the so-called *ratione materiae* concerns (relating, *inter alia*, to the objective criteria of an \"investment\" and Claimant's compliance with Slovak law), and Claimant sent a letter stating it was not in a position to submit such a request in the absence of specific allegations by Respondent. On 5 March 2010, Claimant filed objections to Respondent's document requests relating to the so-called *ratione materiae* concerns, to which Respondent replied on 12 March 2010. Further correspondence amongst the Parties ensued and the Tribunal held a teleconference on 8 April 2010. Following the teleconference, on 8 April 2010, the Tribunal informed the Parties in writing that:\n\ni. The Tribunal has decided not to order any disclosure at this time.\n\nii. The Partial Award on Jurisdiction [ *i.e.*, the present Award] will decide only the \"Intra EU\" challenge.\n\niii. The Tribunal is not minded to arrange a second jurisdictional stage devoted to the *ratione materiae* challenge if it rejects the \"Intra EU\" challenge.\n\niv. Points (ii) and (iii) above are without prejudice to the right of the Respondent to raise arguments based on \u2018illegality' and / or \u2018business risk' in relation to questions of liability and / or quantum, if the case proceeds that far.\n\nv. Similarly, both Parties will be able to make fresh requests for disclosure in relation to questions of merits and / or quantum, if the case proceeds that far.\n\n25.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Respondent submitted its Reply on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection with accompanying exhibits on 23 March 2010 (\" **Jurisdiction Reply** \") and Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection with accompanying exhibits on 16 April 2010 (\" **Jurisdiction Rejoinder** \").\n\n26.\n\nOn 14 April 2010, Respondent submitted a document entitled \"Respondent's Position on Amicus Curiae Brief of the European Commission\" in which Respondent proposed that the European Commission be invited to participate in the Intra-EU Jurisdictional phase of the arbitration proceedings as *amicus curiae*.\n\n27.\n\nOn 15 April 2010, the Parties jointly filed a \"List of agreed uniform terminology for key entities in the arbitration,\" the contents of which are incorporated in the List of Defined Terms at the front of this Award.\n\n28.\n\nOn 21 April 2010, each Party sent the Tribunal a short summary list of headings under which it would be making its oral submissions at the hearing on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection.\n\n**D. Hearing on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nOn Saturday, 24 April 2010, a hearing on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection was held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London. Present at the hearing were:\n\nTribunal : Professor Vaughan Lowe QC\n\nProfessor Albert Jan van den Berg\n\nMr. V. V. Veeder QC\n\nClaimant : Mr. Marnix Leijten, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek NV\n\nMr. Rogier Schellars, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek NV\n\nMr. Albert Marsman, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek NV Mr. Rene Visser, Eureko B.V.\n\nMrs. Nynke Hupkens, Eureko B.V.\n\nRespondent : Mr. Martin Maisner, Rowan Legal\n\nMr. Jiri Feichtinger, Rowan Legal Mr. David Fyrbach, Rowan Legal Mr. Milos Ol\u00edk, Rowan Legal\n\nMs. Andrea Hol\u00edkov\u00e1, Ministry of Finance, Slovak Republic Mr. Radovan Hronsky, Ministry of Finance, Slovak Republic Mr. Matej Sapak, Ministry of Finance, Slovak Republic\n\nRegistry : Ms. Judith Levine, Permanent Court of Arbitration\n\nMs. Trina Ng, Permanent Court of Arbitration\n\n30.\n\nEach Party presented arguments on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection and answered questions from the Tribunal. The Tribunal discussed with the Parties the possibility of approaching the European Commission and the Netherlands Government to provide comments to the Tribunal.\n\n**E. Post-Hearing Proceedings**\n-------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nAfter the hearing on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection and following consultations with the Parties, on 10 May 2010, the Tribunal wrote to the Director General of the Legal Service of the European Commission providing information about the present arbitration, referring to observations that the European Commission had made in the *Eastern Sugar BV (Netherlands)* v. *Czech Republic* arbitration (\" ***Eastern Sugar*** \") concerning the effect upon the Tribunal's jurisdiction of the fact that both the Respondent and the national State of the Claimant are Member States of the EU,13 and inviting the European Commission to submit any further observations on that jurisdictional question that it might wish to communicate to the Tribunal.\n\n*Eastern Sugar B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL Rules, SCC Case No. 088/2004, Partial Award, 27 March 2007 (hereafter \" ***Eastern Sugar*** \"). Available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/EasternSugar.pdf.\n\n32.\n\nAlso on 10 May 2010, following consultations with the Parties, the Tribunal wrote to the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs noting that the Netherlands Government had already provided a letter to the Claimant for purposes of the present arbitration,14 and inviting the Netherlands Government to provide to the Tribunal any further observations that it might have on the jurisdictional question.\n\nSee below, \u00b6 101.\n\n33.\n\nBy e-mail dated 28 May 2010, the European Commission requested copies of Eureko's claims. After consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal provided the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim to the European Commission on 17 June 2010.\n\n34.\n\nOn 10 June 2010, the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs responded to the Tribunal's invitation on behalf of the Netherlands Government with a letter setting out its position on the jurisdictional question, as is described in more detail at paragraphs 155 to 163.\n\n35.\n\nBy e-mail dated 11 June 2010, Claimant drew the Tribunal's attention to an award dated 9 October 2009 (made public, in redacted form, on 2 June 2010) in the matter of *Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic*, an arbitration brought pursuant to the Austrian-Slovak BIT under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Claimant pointed out that in that case the Slovak Republic had raised no objection to jurisdiction based on the fact that the BIT in question was between two EU Member States.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter dated 23 June 2010, the Netherlands Government sent a further letter to the Arbitral Tribunal attaching a formal written statement in the form of a \"Note Verbale\" from the Slovak Republic dated 16 June 2010 that had been sent in response to a request from the Netherlands Government of 4 May 2010. This document is described in more detail below at paragraphs 164 to 166.\n\n37.\n\nOn 7 July 2010, the European Commission responded to the Tribunal's invitation setting out its observations on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, as is described in more detail below at paragraphs 175 to 196.\n\n38.\n\nOn 12 July 2010, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 4**, in which the Tribunal: (i) re-affirmed its order to Claimant to produce documents covered by paragraph 2.4 of Procedural Order No. 3 by Monday, 2 August 2010; (ii) ordered Respondent to produce the Slovak Republic's Reply to the European Commission's \"Article 226\" letter by 13 July 2010 (the \" **226-Reply** \"); and (iii), recalling both Parties' desire for the expeditious and efficient resolution of the dispute, and Claimant's willingness to proceed to prepare immediately for the merits \"at its own risk\" without waiting for the Award on Jurisdiction to be rendered, set 2 August 2010 as the date by which Claimant should submit its Memorial on the Merits (which Claimant proceeded to do).\n\n39.\n\nOn 13 July 2010, Respondent complained to the Tribunal that, as revealed in the European Commission's Observations, Claimant had sent the European Commission an \" *ex parte* communication\" on 11 June 2010. Claimant provided a copy of the communication in question to Respondent and to the Tribunal on 13 July 2010. Also on 13 July 2010, Respondent produced to Claimant and to the Tribunal a copy of its 226-Reply.\n\n40.\n\nOn 19 July 2010, the Tribunal declined a request by Respondent to allow disclosure of the European Commission's observations in this arbitration to an arbitral tribunal constituted in another arbitration involving the Slovak Republic under the same BIT.\n\n41.\n\nOn 19 July 2010, each Party submitted comments on the observations provided by the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and the European Commission, as well as on the (redacted) *Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic* award and the 226-Reply (\" **Post Hearing Submissions** \").\n\n42.\n\nFurther comments relating to the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection were received from the Parties on 22 July, 29 July, 4 August, 6 August and 10 August 2010. On 16 August 2010, the Tribunal confirmed to the Parties that it considered that it had all the material it needed for its deliberations on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection.\n\n**III. HISTORICAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe summary below is drawn from the Parties' pleadings and is presented to give context to the timing of the investment and alleged BIT violations against the background of the Slovak Republic's entry into the EU. It in no way presents factual determinations by the Tribunal that would be binding or could affect any assessment at any later stage of this case.\n\n**A. The Slovak Republic's Entry into the European Union**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nStarting in 1989 with the collapse of the Soviet Eastern Bloc, Czechoslovakia (from 1990 the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic (\" **CSFR** \")) underwent a transformation from a system of central economic planning to a market economy. According to the Slovak Republic, this transformation necessitated the creation of a \"sufficient legal framework, which would safeguard the functioning of the new system and protection of the participating subjects.\" Integration into the European Community and Council of Europe was a priority in fostering the economic and political stability desired, while ensuring the protection of foreign entities entering a then-emerging market.15\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\n45.\n\nIn 1989 Czechoslovakia initiated contact with the European Community. Negotiations resulted in the conclusion on 16 December 1991 of the European Agreement Establishing an Association between the European Community on the one hand, and the CSFR, Hungary and Poland on the other (\" **CSFR Association Agreement** \").16 That Agreement was subject to ratification.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.\n\n46.\n\nDuring the same period, the CSFR concluded the Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-related Matters by and between the CSFR, European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community, which entered into force from 1 March 1992. The CSFR also concluded bilateral agreements on the promotion and protection of investments, including the BIT with The Netherlands, which was signed on 29 April 1991 and came into force from 1 October 1992.17\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. The Netherlands has been a member of the EU since it became party to the Treaty of Rome Establishing the European Economic Community on 25 March 1957. The Netherlands had become a party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms on 31 August 1954.\n\n47.\n\nThe CSFR became a member of the Council of Europe and a signatory to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\" **ECHR** \") on 21 February 1991. The ECHR has been in force for the CSFR since 18 March 1992.\n\n48.\n\nThe Slovak Republic separated from the CSFR and became an independent State on 1 January 1993. It succeeded to the CSFR-Netherlands BIT, as well as to the ECHR, as of the day of its independence. Because of the split of the CSFR, the CSFR Association Agreement was never ratified. The Slovak Republic had to renegotiate its relationship with the European Community by concluding the Agreement Establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States [including The Netherlands] and the Slovak Republic on 4 October 1993 (\" **Association Agreement** \"). The Association Agreement has been in force since 1 February 1995.18\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\n49.\n\nOn 16 April 2003, the Slovak Republic signed the **Accession Treaty**,19 and its membership of the EU became effective when the Accession Treaty entered into force on 1 May 2004.\n\nTreaty between the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Member States of the European Union) and the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, concerning the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic concerning the Accession of The Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union, signed on 23 September 2003, entered into force on 1 May 2004, (2003) O.J. L 236 of 23 September 2003. Available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:236:SOM:en:HTML.\n\n50.\n\nOn 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force for all EU Member States, including the Slovak Republic and the Netherlands.\n\n**B. Liberalisation of Slovak Heath Insurance Sector in 2004 and Eureko's Entry to Market**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Slovak Republic established a mandatory and universal public health insurance system in 1993.20 This system, administered by a single state-owned Health Insurer, was modified in 1994 to permit the creation of other state-owned and private entities to perform public healthcare functions.21\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 6. Act No. 9/1993 Coll. (Exhibit R-2).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 10. Act No. 273/1994 Coll. (Exhibit R-4). See also Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 III.1-11.\n\n52.\n\nBy 2004, the public health insurance system had accumulated a substantial deficit. The Slovak Republic addressed this deficit by an infusion of funds from the state budget and a series of reforms to liberalise the legal framework of the health insurance market. The 2004 reforms aimed at achieving a mix of public and private investment.22 Among other things, the reforms (i) eliminated administrative expenses caps and enabled insurance companies to compete for clients, (ii) reduced the scope of the mandatory health-care package by providing for supplementary health insurance through voluntary additional out-of-pocket co-payments by the beneficiaries, (iii) gave health insurers leverage in setting prices for services, as well as the ability to make and use profits from the provision of such services, (iv) enabled privatisation of state-owned health care providers by providing for conversion of existing health insurance companies into joint-stock companies, (v) envisaged the use of surplus funds by joint-stock companies, and (vi) established an independent Health Care Regulator to supervise and control the health insurance market.23\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 III.12-14, Acts No. 580/2004 Coll. and No. 581/2004 Coll. (Exhibits C-20 and C-21).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 17; Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 III.16-20.\n\n53.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the 2004 liberalisation was \"instrumental in making investment in the Slovak health insurance sector attractive to Eureko.\" Eureko resolved to invest in the Slovak health insurance market through the incorporation of Union Healthcare on 9 March 2006.24 By 1 January 2007, Union Healthcare had obtained a share of around 8.5 percent in the Slovak health insurance market and received top rankings and awards within the industry.25\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 26; Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 III.15, III.24. Eureko already had a presence in the Slovak Republic through its shareholding in Union Insurance, which provided a further motivation to launch Union Healthcare.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 II.15, III. 25; Exhibit C-22.\n\n**C. Reforms in the Slovak Republic Health Insurance Sector in 2006 - 2009**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nOn 17 June 2006 parliamentary elections in the Slovak Republic resulted in the victory of the SMER Social Democracy party. The new Slovak Government introduced measures amending the 2004 reforms. Claimant bases its claim on nine of these measures:26 (i) the cap on operating expenses, (ii) the ban on brokers, (iii) the repositioning of the Healthcare Regulator and the entire management board, (iv) the amended network requirements obliging health insurance companies to contract with specific state hospitals, (v) the ban on the distribution of profits to shareholders, (vi) the changes to the redistribution system, (vii) the scrutiny of the budgets of health insurance companies, (viii) the newly-introduced solvency requirements, and (ix) the ban on the transfer of insurance portfolios.\n\nFor detailed descriptions of the various legislative reforms and their alleged impact on Claimant, see Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 III.78-III.154; Exhibits C-40, C-41, C-43, C-49, C-54, C-55, C-61, C-62, C-63, C-64.\n\n**D. Dispute Between Eureko and Slovak Republic and Complaint to the EU**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nOn 28 February 2008, Eureko filed a complaint with the European Commission. According to Eureko, this filing was made in order to impress upon the Slovak Government Eureko's view that its policies are not in line with basic EU law principles that had been a cornerstone of Eureko's confidence in investing in the Slovak Republic. The complaint led to the opening of an infringement procedure by the European Commission against the Slovak Republic under Article 226 of the EC Treaty.27 The infringement procedure, including the European Commission's administrative investigation into the Slovak health care legislation, is currently ongoing.28\n\nArticle 226 provides that: \"If the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity to submit its observations. If the State concerned does not comply with the opinion within the period laid down by the Commission, the latter may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union.\" That provision is Article 258 of the TFEU. The Complaint procedure was registered under reference number 2008/4268. See Observations of the European Commission dated 7 July 2010 (hereafter \" **European Commission Observations** \"), \u00b6 7.\n\nFor reference to the current status of the Complaint proceedings, see Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 29-34, and European Commission Observations, \u00b6 7.\n\n56.\n\nNoting that Eureko's influence on the progress and direction of this complaint procedure is \"limited,\" that \"ancillary proceedings in the European Court of Justice can by their very nature not result in a damages award,\" and that Eureko's damages \"cannot be redressed through other EU-channels,\" Claimant explained that it was forced to turn to arbitration to seek redress.29 On 4 March 2008, Eureko sent the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic a \"trigger letter\" setting out its grievances with respect to the reforms to the health insurance sector and formally notifying its intention to commence arbitration proceedings under the BIT. After attempts at amicable settlement failed, Eureko formally commenced an arbitration by a Notice of Arbitration dated 1 October 2008.30\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 1.17; Exhibit R-45\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Annex 1; Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 1.8-14.\n\n**IV. ARGUMENTS ON THE \"INTRA-EU JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe \"Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection\" was first raised in Respondent's Statement of Defence dated 30 October 2009, in accordance with Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Respondent further articulated the grounds for its Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection in its Jurisdiction Memorial, Jurisdiction Reply, oral argument during the hearing on 24 April 2010, and Post-Hearing Submission.\n\n58.\n\nAccording to Respondent, as of the date of the Accession Treaty (1 May 2004), the EC Treaty has governed the relationship between the Slovak Republic and the Netherlands.31 By acceding to the EU, the Slovak Republic became a part of a specific system of law which creates a much more complex, wide-reaching and elaborate framework of investment protection and human rights than that provided by the BIT.32 Respondent points out that Claimant has simultaneously complained of breaches of the BIT and breaches of the EC Treaty and ECHR and also commenced a complaint procedure with the European Commission.33 Respondent contends that these treaties cannot be applied simultaneously or in parallel and that the application of the BIT is therefore excluded.34\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6 14.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 120; Jurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 44, 149; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 116, 148; Respondent's PostHearing Submission, \u00b6 83.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 19-23.\n\n59.\n\nEssentially, Respondent's arguments underlying the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection can be summarised as follows:\n\n\u2022 As a matter of public international law, pursuant to Article 59 (\"Termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty\") of the Vienna Convention, the BIT was terminated upon the Slovak Republic's accession to the EC Treaty.\n\n\u2022 As a matter of public international law, pursuant to Article 30 (\"Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter\") of the Vienna Convention, since the Slovak Republic's accession to the EC Treaty the arbitration clause in the BIT can no longer be considered applicable.\n\n\u2022 As a matter of EU law, which forms part of the law of the Slovak Republic (applicable by this Tribunal pursuant to Article 8(6) of the BIT), the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the arbitration clause is incompatible with the EC Treaty, the principle of autonomy of EU law, and the principle of supremacy of EU law.\n\n\u2022 As a matter of German law (the law of the place of the arbitration) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the dispute is not arbitrable.\n\n60.\n\nThese arguments are each detailed further below, along with Claimant's response to such arguments, as articulated in Claimant's Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial, Jurisdiction Rejoinder, oral argument during the hearing on 24 April 2010, and Post-Hearing Submission.\n\n61.\n\nClaimant describes the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection as boiling down to \"an outright denial, by the Slovak Republic, of rights offered to a party that has invested in its economy to seek redress from an arbitral tribunal under the BIT because the Slovak Republic has chosen to enter the European Union.\"35 Claimant notes also that the objection first came to light over a year after the arbitration commenced, had never been mentioned in prior discussions and is undermined by multiple statements in which the Slovak Republic has held out the BIT as valid and binding.36\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 2.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23; Exhibits C-81, C-82, C-64, C-70, C-81, C-82.\n\n62.\n\nBoth Parties stressed the importance of the issues at stake. For example, at the hearing, Respondent stated that the Tribunal's decision \"may affect entire jurisprudence in this matter and numerous disputes in the future,\" noting that \"the uncertain fate of the old Intra-EU BITs provokes an ever growing debate in the whole of Europe without unfortunately clear outcome at the moment.\"37 Claimant, for its part, asserted that Respondent's logic would \"mark the end of arbitration\" in the EU, because every tribunal that touched upon a question of EU law, considered by a respondent to be difficult, would be forced to say it has no jurisdiction.38\n\nTranscript, p. 7.\n\nTranscript, pp. 45-46.\n\n**A. Termination of the BIT under Article 59 of the Vienna Convention**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Parties presented detailed arguments based on the VCLT. According to Respondent, the BIT was effectively terminated upon the Slovak Republic's accession to the EC Treaty by virtue of Article 59 of the VCLT, which provides as follows:\n\n*Termination or Suspension of the Operation of a Treaty Implied by Conclusion of a Later Treaty*\n\n(1) A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject matter and:\n\n(a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or\n\n(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.\n\n64.\n\nClaimant asserts that the following requirements must be satisfied in order to fulfil the conditions for termination under Article 59: (i) the two treaties must relate to the same subject matter; (ii) the two States must have intended Eureko's investment to be governed by the EC Treaty instead of the BIT; and (iii) the provisions of the BIT must be so far incompatible with the provisions of the EC Treaty that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.39 Claimant denies that these conditions are met.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 30-33.\n\n**1. Do the BIT and the EC Treaty relate to the same subject matter?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n65.\n\nRespondent argues that the BIT and the EC Treaty relate to the same subject matter because they cover the same types of investors and investments, serve the same purposes, offer the same standards of protection, and provide for equivalent remedies.\n\n66.\n\nWith respect to *investors*, the definition in BIT Article 1(b) includes investors that are natural persons citizen of contracting parties or legal entities established in accordance with the law of the contracting parties. The EC Treaty, Article 48(1), protects all citizens of EU Member States including natural persons and legal entities.\n\n67.\n\nWith respect to covered *investments*, Article 1(a) of the BIT defines investments as \"every kind of asset invested either directly or through an investor of a third State\" and lists examples. Under EU law, the protection of investments is provided for by the freedoms of the internal market, such as the freedom of establishment, the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.40 Although the EC Treaty does not define \"capital,\" an explanatory note to a Council Directive and decisions of the ECJ have, according to Respondent, confirmed that the term \"investments\" in the Council Directive covers the same type of investments as those covered by the BIT.41\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 45-47, referencing EC Treaty Title III (now TFEU Title III), and EC Treaty, art. 43 (now TFEU, art. 49).\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, n. 18-19, citing Council Directive 88/361/EEC of 24 June 1988, O.J. L 178, 08/07/1988 p. 0050018, for the implementation of Article 67 of the Treaty; Joined Cases C-282/04 to C-283/04, *Commission v. Kingdom of the Netherlands*, Judgment of 28 September 2006, [2006] ECR I-9141; Case C-174/04, *Commission v. Italian Republic*, Judgment of 2 June 2005, [2005] ECR 1-4933.\n\n68.\n\nRespondent argues that the BIT and EC Treaty serve identical *purposes*, which are fundamentally to broaden and strengthen mutual economic relationships and to promote the flow of capital and economic development of the contracting parties, while at the same time guaranteeing fair and equitable treatment. Respondent points to the preamble of the BIT and to Articles 2, 3 and 12 of the EC Treaty.\n\n69.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the *standards of protection* offered by the two treaties are the same. For example:\n\n\u2022 With respect to the *establishment of investments*, Respondent compares the undertaking in Article 2 of the BIT to promote the investments between the two countries to Articles 2 and 3 of the EC Treaty, in which the Slovak Republic undertook to eliminate any restrictions preventing foreign investors' access to the market in the territory of another Member State. Article 56 of the EC Treaty further prohibits any restrictions on the free movement of capital and payments.42\n\n\u2022 With respect to *equal treatment and non-discrimination*, Respondent notes the similarities between the promise in Article 3(1) of the BIT \"not to impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal\" of an investment, and the principles of non-discrimination and equality of treatment fundamentally protected by EU law through Articles 12 and 43 of the EC Treaty and under the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union.43 Respondent acknowledges that Article 3(3) of the BIT makes some exceptions to equal treatment in certain circumstances. Respondent points out that Claimant itself invoked EU law to support its argument that the Slovak Republic failed to provide fair and equitable treatment of Eureko's investment as required by the BIT.44\n\n\u2022 In relation to *free movement of payments*, Respondent points to the \"identical\" protections offered by Article 4 of the BIT (guaranteeing that payments related to an investment may be transferred) and Article 56 of the EC Treaty (prohibiting \"all restrictions on the movement of capital\" and \"all restrictions on payments\" between Member States...\"). Respondent additionally invokes recent decisions of the ECJ in cases brought against Austria, Sweden and Finland, relating to breaches of their obligations as EU Member States arising from the investment treaties that they had concluded with third (*i.e.*, non-EU) countries (hereafter the \" **Extra-EU BIT Cases** \").45\n\n\u2022 Respondent argues that the standard of \" *full protection and security* \" under Article 3(2) is similarly guaranteed under the EC Treaty, by virtue of the rules of the internal market. The ECJ has held such internal market rules to include protection of investment from physical interventions, impairment or neutralisation measures which might discourage investors from other Member States.46 Respondent acknowledges that the EC Treaty in some respects goes beyond the guarantees offered by the BIT but contends that the EC Treaty \"exhaustively covers the standard of full protection and security of investments.\"\n\n\u2022 Respondent argues that the *protection of proprietary rights* is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by both the BIT (through Article 5 on expropriation) and EU law, especially within the scope of the freedom of movement, freedom of establishment, free movement of capital and Article 17(1) of the ECHR.47\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 62-64. EC Treaty art. 56 (now TFEU art. 63).\n\nEC Treaty, arts. 12 and 43 (now TFEU arts. 18 and 49).\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 IV.79-90; Jurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6 72.\n\nCase C-205/06, *Commission v. Republic of Austria*, Judgment of 3 March 2009, [2009] ECR I-01303; Case C-249/06, *Commission v. Kingdom of Sweden*, Judgment of 3 March 2009; Case C-118/07, *Commission v. Republic of Finland*, Judgment of 19 November 2009.\n\nSee, for example, Case C-531-06, *Commission v. Italian Republic*, Judgment of 19 May 2009, \u00b6 46.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 86-90.\n\n70.\n\nAt the hearing on 24 April 2010, Respondent submitted a \"Comparative Table\" illustrating that all the rules in the BIT allegedly breached by Respondent are covered by the EC Treaty, as summarised below:\n\n**BIT - EC Treaty**\n\nFree Transfer of Capital (Art. 4) - Free Movement of Capital (Art. 56)\n\nFair and Equitable Treatment (Art. 3(1)) - Prohibition of Discrimination (Art. 12)\n\nFull Security and Protection (Art. 3(2)) - Freedom of Establishment (Art. 43)\n\nIndirect Expropriation (Art. 5) - Freedom of Establishment (Art. 43)\n\n71.\n\nFinally Respondent argues that both the BIT and EU law provide the same system of *remedies* where investments have been impaired as a result of state action. Under EU law, investors pursue their claims before national courts with involvement of the ECJ via a preliminary ruling procedure; and under the BIT investors can have their dispute heard before an arbitral tribunal. Both mechanisms aim at the same objective, namely the protection of investments. Under both mechanisms, investors may seek compensation for damages from States for unlawful conduct (a right confirmed by the ECJ in 1991 in the case of *Francovich v. Italian Republic* (\" ***Francovich*** \").48\n\nUnder EU law, this duty was established in the Joined Cases C-690 to C-9190, *Francovich and Others v. Italian Republic*, Judgment of 19 November 1991 [1991] ECR I-5357 (hereafter \" ***Francovich*** \").\n\n72.\n\nRespondent characterises Claimant's approach to what constitutes the \"same subject matter\" for the purposes of the VCLT as too narrow. According to Respondent, the VCLT requires that both treaties \"relate to\" the same subject matter: not that they cover or regulate *exactly* the same subject matter. If particular conduct is such as to attract the application of both treaties, then the treaties relate to the same subject matter. This broader interpretation is, according to Respondent, consistent with the position taken by the ILC and in *Oppenheim's International Law*.49\n\nJurisdiction Reply,\u00b6\u00b6 54-58; citing A Ramanujan, *Conflicts over Conflict: Preventing Fragmentation of International Law*, Trade, Law and Development, Vol. 1, No. 1, 2009 (Exhibit R-51) and UN International Law Commission (hereafter \" **ILC** \"), Study Group of the ILC, *Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law*, U.N.

Respondent states that the Tribunal should in any event not follow *Eastern Sugar* because: (i) the violations complained of by the claimant in *Eastern Sugar* occurred before the Czech Republic's accession to the EU, and the principle of supremacy did not therefore come into play; (ii) the important Extra-EU BIT Cases were decided by the ECJ after the award in *Eastern Sugar* ; (iii) when assessing the \"same subject-matter\" argument, the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal only took into account the EU regulation of free movement of capital and not other rules of EU law that overlap with the BIT; (iv) the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal failed properly to address the opinions of EU institutions; and (v) the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal incorrectly concluded that the EU \"does not provide for possibility for an investor to sue a host state directly,\" despite the possibility of investors claiming damages through a national court under the interpretative supervision of the ECJ.52\n\nSee discussion below at \u00b6\u00b6 80-82. Respondent refused to address the *Binder* case because it is not publicly available and no source was given that provided information about the conclusions of the tribunal in that case. See Jurisdiction Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 127-8.\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 119-126.\n\n75.\n\nRespondent also maintains that a further award cited by Claimant, *Austrian Airlines v.* *Slovak Republic*, should have no impact on the current proceedings.53 Respondent explains that in the *Austrian Airlines* case the Slovak Republic had raised other strong jurisdictional objections and did not have any reason to complicate the proceedings by raising in addition the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, which would have required inviting the European Commission to share its views. This approach was vindicated as Respondent was ultimately successful on its other jurisdictional objections. The *Austrian Airlines* case was, moreover, a factually distinct proceeding from the present arbitration. The fact that a party does not develop a certain argument in one case does not estop that party from subsequently developing and advancing such a line of argumentation in different proceedings. Nor does it impact on the validity of the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection itself, the seriousness and significance of which is demonstrated by the level of interest amongst European institutions, Member States (including the Czech Republic, the other original party to the BIT), academics and practitioners.54\n\n*Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, (Austria/Slovak BIT), Final Award of 9 October 2009, (hereafter \" ***Austrian Airlines*** \"). Available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/AustrianAirlinesv.Slovakia.pdf. See Respondent's letter dated 2 July 2010 responding to Claimant's arguments about the significance of the Award, discussed below at \u00b6 83. See also Respondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\nRespondent's letter of 2 July 2010.\n\n76.\n\nRespondent notes Claimant's failure to address the Extra-EU BIT Cases, which are relevant because (i) they address the legal overlap between the EC Treaty and Extra-EU BITs regarding the protection of investments,55 and (ii) they are concerned with situations in which there is a conflict between treaties, arising from the impossibility of applying restrictions on the free movement of payments and capital adopted by the Council under the EC Treaty where at the same time the Extra-EU BITs forbid such restrictions.56 Respondent argues *a fortiori* that the principle established in the Extra-EU BIT Cases also applies to intra-EU BITs because both kinds of BITs relate to the same subject-matter. Intra-EU BITs may also compromise the effectiveness of EU law which the Member States are obliged to ensure pursuant to Article 10 of the EC Treaty.57\n\nSee Case C-205/06, *Commission v. Austria,* Judgment of 3 March 2009, [2009] ECR p. I-01301, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, cited in Jurisdiction Reply, \u00b6 43.\n\nSee *Ibid,* \u00b6 37.\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 44-50.\n\n77.\n\nAt the hearing, Respondent argued that the subject matter of the EC Treaty not only relates to the same aspects of investment protection as the BIT but in many aspects, especially with regard to the area of full security and protection and indirect expropriation, the protection granted by EU law under freedom of establishment is substantially *more* extensive.58 Moreover, the fact that there has never been a BIT concluded between two EU Member States confirms there is overlapping subject- matter.59\n\nTranscript, pp. 13-14.\n\nTranscript, p. 15.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n78.\n\nClaimant rejects the proposition that the BIT and EC Treaty relate to the same subject matter. This is because the EC Treaty deals with *initiation* of investments, while the BIT primarily aims to protect investments once made. The EC Treaty is primarily concerned with the integration of the economies of the Member States and removal of restrictions on trade and investments and thus establishes the freedom to make investments.60 While the EC Treaty provides for free movement of capital and freedom to establish undertakings, it does not require Member States to afford investments \"fair and equitable treatment,\" \"full security and protection\" or dispute resolution through arbitration.\n\nAs seen in freedom to establish branches, subsidiaries and undertakings, per EC Treaty, art. 43 (now TFEU, art. 49), free movement of capital and payments in EC Treaty, art. 56 (now TFEU, art. 63).\n\n79.\n\nThe expression \"relating to the same subject-matter\" must, according to Claimant, be interpreted strictly and narrowly. It should not apply when a later *general* treaty impinges indirectly on *specific* provisions of an earlier treaty.61 The EC Treaty is a general wide ranging treaty regulating agriculture, fisheries, public health, culture, consumer protection, citizenship and development cooperation. While the EC Treaty contains some provisions on the free flow of capital and payments and freedom of establishment, the BIT has more detailed and particularised provisions on the *protection* to be afforded to investments. Thus, even if the EC Treaty offers *some* protections of investments, this does not mean the BIT and the EC Treaty relate to the same subject matter.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 73, citing Sir Humphrey Waldock, Special Rapporteur, Sixth Report on the Law of Treaties, *Yearbook of the ILC*, 1966.\n\n80.\n\nIn support of its position, Claimant refers to arbitral \"precedents\" in two similar disputes involving EU investors against the Czech Republic. Claimant distinguishes these cases from the Extra-EU BIT Cases, which it says are entirely different from cases involving *intra-EU BITs* and therefore irrelevant to the present proceedings.\n\n81.\n\nThe first case is the March 2007 partial award in *Eastern Sugar*, involving a claim by a Dutch investor against the Czech Republic under the Czech-Netherlands BIT, which is identical to the BIT in the present case. The Czech Republic had argued that Article 59 of the VCLT resulted in the BIT no longer being effective, that the BIT could be considered terminated following the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, that the intra-EU investment regime as at the date of accession superseded the obligations in the BIT and that the BIT would breach the non-discrimination principle in Article 12 of the EC Treaty. The tribunal in *Eastern Sugar* rejected the Czech Republic's argument under Article 59 of the VCLT. The *Eastern Sugar* tribunal did not accept that the EC Treaty and the BIT in question covered the same subject matter.62\n\n*Eastern Sugar*, \u00b6\u00b6 159-166.\n\n82.\n\nThe second case relied on by Claimant is a June 2007 award on jurisdiction in *Binder v. Czech Republic*, between a German investor and the Czech Republic under the German-Czech BIT.63 According to Claimant's sources, the Czech Republic argued that the BIT was no longer applicable in view of the Czech Republic's accession to the EU and investment protection offered by EC law, that intra-EU BITs are inconsistent with the \"mutual trust principle\" under EC law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the ECJ, that there is discrimination against investors from EU Member States where investors have no similar rights to those under the BIT and that Article 59 of the VCLT causes termination of the BIT. The Czech Republic sought a stay of proceedings pending a statement by the competent EU authorities or a preliminary ruling from the ECJ. The tribunal dismissed the Czech Republic's arguments in their entirety, holding that the intra-EU BIT and EC law were compatible and still in force.64\n\nUnreported. Tribunal: Justice Hans Danelius, Prof. Jurgen Creutzig and Professor Emmanuel Gaillard.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 133. The *Binder* case was subject to a pending challenge before the Czech courts. The Czech Republic has reportedly taken steps to terminate some of its intra-EU BITs, which according to Claimant shows that the Czech Republic no longer considers intra-EU BITs to have been implicitly terminated.\n\n83.\n\nAdditionally, Claimant draws attention to the award in *Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic*, an arbitration brought pursuant to the Austrian-Slovak BIT.65 Claimant points out that in that case the Slovak Republic raised seven jurisdictional objections but none related to the termination or inapplicability of the Austrian-Slovak BIT on the basis that both Austria and the Slovak Republic are members of the EU. In fact, the objections concerned the interpretation of the Austrian-Slovak BIT, thus presuming its continued validity and applicability.66 According to Claimant, this shows that the Slovak Republic has no genuine concern about the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection but rather considers it an \"argument of last resort\" to be used to cause substantial delay.67 Claimant notes that the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal considered as relevant the position that the respondent State had taken towards intra-EU BITs in other arbitral proceedings.68\n\nSee *Austrian Airlines*, \u00b6\u00b6 65-72. See also Claimant's e-mail to the Tribunal, 11 June 2010.\n\nClaimant, in its Post-Hearing Submission of 19 July 2010 noted that although the Slovak Republic was ultimately successful in having the case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the objections were not so strong as to have justified omitting the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, as shown by the fact that the award was not unanimous.\n\nSee Claimant's e-mail to the Tribunal, 11 June 2010, and Claimant's Post Hearing Submission, 19 July 2010.\n\n*Eastern Sugar*, \u00b6 155.\n\n84.\n\nAt the hearing, Claimant was asked about the possible impact of the Lisbon Treaty. Claimant stated that even if Article 307 could possibly be relevant to intra-EU BITs (which it is not), or if the EU competence in respect of \"foreign direct investment\" covered everything that BITs covered (which it does not), at most the only possible ruling could be that a Member State breaches its obligation under EU law by having treaties in place that fall within the exclusive competence of the Community, and that would entail only the obligation to terminate them. There is no support, according to Claimant, for the proposition that, as a result of the Lisbon Treaty, all EU BITs would be *automatically* terminated as a matter of law. That would leave an \"enormous gap\" in the protection of investors.69\n\nTranscript, pp. 66-67.\n\n85.\n\nAddressing the Extra-EU BIT Cases, Claimant notes that the ECJ determined that the member states had not complied with their obligation to bring the relevant BITs in line with EU law but until such amendments are made, the BITs remain fully in force. Even under the Lisbon Treaty, the BITs remain in force and do not lapse or automatically expire under public international law. At any rate, according to Claimant, expropriation issues remain with the individual member states under the Lisbon Treaty.70\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12.\n\n**2. Did the Parties intend the EC Treaty to replace the BIT?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n86.\n\nRespondent argues that by concluding the Accession Treaty, \"the intention of the contracting parties was to replace the former treaty with the later one.\"71 Against the backdrop of the Slovak Republic's efforts to join the EU, the ultimate objective of the BIT was to help the Slovak Republic accede to the EU and create a trading platform on which basis the nationals of Member States could invest in the Slovak Republic without fears of uncertainty or lack of a legal framework for foreign investments. However, when the Slovak Republic acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004, that trading platform \"became obsolete.\"72\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6 100.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 105-106.\n\n87.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the BIT was merely an accessory to the Association Agreements and since those were terminated by the accession of the new Member States, so was the applicability of the BIT.73 The Accession Treaty itself proves that the intention of the Slovak Republic and the Netherlands was that their mutual relations, including those relating to the subject matter of the BIT, should be governed by EU law. Any other methods of interpreting the intention of the States, such as the statements and communications cited by Claimant, are redundant and irrelevant to the present case since the termination of the BIT is implied by the conclusion of the Accession Treaty.\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00b6 70.\n\n88.\n\nThis conclusion is not impeded by Article 3(5) of the BIT (which envisages more favourable treatment under later agreements) because Article 3(5) does not prohibit changing or replacing the BIT itself.74 Further, Article 3(5) is incompatible with the principles of direct effect and supremacy. In any event, Article 3(5) is also deemed to have been terminated along with the rest of the BIT pursuant to Article 59 of the VCLT.\n\nArticle 3(5) of the BIT provides: \"If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over the present Agreement.\"\n\n89.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's argument that the BIT and EC Treaty were already operating in parallel before the Accession Treaty, under Articles 12 and 56 of the EC Treaty. These provisions could only have applied to Respondent's nationals under the principle of personal applicability, and did not impose obligations on Respondent itself under EU law. Respondent also considers Claimant's argument on Article 6(12) of the Act on Accession attached to the Accession Treaty as irrelevant to this dispute because that provision concerns \"external agreements or conventions\" and not intra-EU BITs.\n\n90.\n\nAs evidence that Respondent was of the opinion that its post-Accession BITs would be considered inapplicable, it submitted with its Jurisdiction Memorial Exhibit R-46, an e-mail dated 5 April 2004 from the Slovak Ministry of Finance to the economic and commercial counsellors at diplomatic missions of several EU Member States in Bratislava (the \" **5 April 2004 E-mail** \"). The 5 April 2004 E-mail stated as follows:\n\nOne of the priorities of Accession of the Slovak Republic in the European Union is accomplish obligations concerning harmonisation of international trade agreements - Agreement for protection and reciprocal promotion of investment contains Articles which are not compatible with the *acquis communautaire*.\n\nThe officials of the Slovak Republic have already made initial contact with the European Commission concerning this issues, and as a reply we have received this opinion from Mr. J\u00f6rn Sack - expert of the Legal Service of the European Commission in Brussels:\n\n*\u2018For the second point (BITs among MS) we have agreed in a coordination meeting at the Commission that these become obsolete under Article 59 of the Vienna Convention, but that the parties should notify each other that they agree on that'.*\n\nOn the basis of the above-mentioned, as well unofficial information from the European Commission, we would like to initiate the reception common procedure concerning to harmonization BIT's with Member States and Accession Countries.\n\nWe would like to know your unofficial opinion to our proposal as soon as possible.\n\n91.\n\nAt the hearing, Respondent was asked whether any of the States who were recipients of the 5 April 2004 E-mail had replied to the request for \"unofficial opinion[s] to our proposal.\"75 Respondent obtained information about five such responses. One was from Poland which opined that \"from the day of accession articles which are not compatible with the EU *acquis communautaire* according to the Article 59 in connection with Article 30 par. 3 of Vienna Convention are terminated (*lex posteriori derogate lex priori*). Therefore there is no need to initiate any procedure.\" One response was from a German counsellor, who \"without having the occasion to consult with the competent ministries in Berlin\" gave his \"rather personal - *i.e.*, totally unofficial - opinion\" that the \"whole complex of Foreign Trade will be harmonized and coordinated by the EU. Therefore the BIT would become obsolete. About this fact the parties concerned should give notice to each other.\" According to Respondent, a response from Greece opined that the BITs are still valid parallel to EU law; and responses from Latvia and France reserved their right to make their opinions later, which they never did. Respondent remarked that these responses showed \"how different the interpretation of this issue is.\"76\n\nTranscript, p. 26; Exhibit R-46.\n\nTranscript, pp. 95-98\n\n92.\n\nRespondent maintains that irrespective of any notification procedures, the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU had the legal consequence of terminating the BIT. The Netherlands and Slovak Republic \"definitely intended to govern their relationships with the nationals of their respective counterparty under EU law.\" This is a necessary consequence of the fundamental characteristics of EU law, including supremacy, direct applicability and direct effect. According to Respondent, so long as the intention of the Parties is to terminate the earlier treaty, an *explicit* intention to terminate the former treaty is not required for purposes of Article 59 of the VCLT.77\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6 112.\n\n93.\n\nIn other words, termination of the BIT occurs *ex lege* without notification to the other party. The Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection concerns a legal question that cannot be affected by unilateral statements made by the parties to the BIT, as confirmed by VCLT Articles 31(2) and (3). Thus, the position of the Dutch Government, as set out in a letter provided to Eureko (described below in Section V.A), can have no effect on the legal consequences relating to the conclusion of the Accession Treaty seven years earlier. Similarly, statements made by Slovak authorities referring to the possibility of investors commencing arbitration have no import because they fail to address the validity, termination or applicability of the BIT, and in any event were made after Eureko established Union Healthcare and could not have been relied on by Eureko at the time of establishing its investment.78\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00b6 24.\n\n94.\n\nAt the hearing, Respondent was asked by a member of the Tribunal whether it had followed Article 65 of the VCLT, which establishes \"a procedure to be followed with respect to invalidity, termination, withdrawal from or suspension of the operation of a treaty,\" requiring a state to notify its counterparty of its claim and the reasons therefor. Respondent had two answers. First, the 5 April 2004 E-mail was an explicit communication relating to termination of the Treaty. Second, notification is not in any event a requirement for termination when the termination occurs automatically by virtue of Article 59 of the VCLT.79\n\nTranscript, pp. 16-20.\n\n95.\n\nRespondent was also asked about the statement of the European Commission included in the *Eastern Sugar* award. Respondent acknowledged the European Commission's position, at least at the time of *Eastern Sugar*, to be that there was no automatic termination of intra-EU BITs, but stressed that it was important for the Commission to be invited to present its views in the present arbitration.80\n\nTranscript, p. 23.\n\n96.\n\nIn response to a question about the termination provisions in Article 13(3) of the BIT, Respondent stated that first, Claimant's investment took place only after the Slovak Republic entered the EU, and thus the termination occurred before the investment was made. Second, Article 13(3) should apply only to termination by an act of a Contracting Party, and not to the termination *ex lege* under the VCLT.81\n\nTranscript, pp. 24-25.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n97.\n\nClaimant argues that the requirement in Article 59(1)(a) of an intention to terminate the BIT has not been met. Rather, the EC Treaty and the BIT were intended to function alongside each other. According to Claimant, numerous indicators show the absence of any intent to terminate the BIT.\n\n98.\n\nFirst, when concluding the BIT, the two States had in mind that future treaties between them would complement the parties' rights and obligations, and not that such provisions would replace provisions in the BIT.82 For example, Article 8(6) of the BIT explicitly acknowledges the permissibility of other treaties relating to investment protection by referring to \"other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties\" as a possible source on which a tribunal may rely to decide an arbitration. Similarly, Article 3(5) of the BIT refers to the possibility of more favourable provisions in \"obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement.\" Claimant notes that even prior to the Slovak Republic's accession to the EC Treaty, the BIT and EC Treaty already functioned alongside each other to the extent that Slovak investors were eligible to invoke some aspects of the EC Treaty as external investors.83\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 78-80.\n\nCiting EC Treaty, art. 56 (now TFEU, art. 63), on free movement of capital and payments; and the prohibition to discriminate on grounds of nationality (EC Treaty, art. 12, now TFEU, art. 18).\n\n99.\n\nSecond, Claimant says that the Accession Treaty itself evidences that the Netherlands and the Slovak Republic did not intend to replace or terminate the BIT, because Article 6(12) of the Act attached to the Accession Treaty provides that:\n\nThe new Member States shall take appropriate measures, where necessary, to adjust their position in relation to [\u2026] those international agreements to [\u2026] which other Member States are also parties, to the rights and obligations arising from their accession to the Union.\n\nIf the intent had been implicitly to terminate these treaties, there would be no need to require \"measures\" in order for agreements to be \"adjusted\" to the rights and obligations arising under the EC Treaty.\n\n100.\n\nThird, neither State manifests on its website or in its official treaty records any intention to terminate the BIT and have the subject matter governed solely by the EC Treaty. The BIT is listed as a treaty in force on the official websites of the Slovak Ministry of Finance and the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs.84 Claimant recalls that the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal held that implicit termination could not be found in circumstances where both contracting parties to the BIT still list the BIT as an international treaty to which they are party. The *Eastern Sugar* tribunal found that it was not the common intent of the Netherlands and the Czech Republic for the EC Treaty to supersede the BIT.\n\nExhibits C-83 and C-84.\n\n101.\n\nThe Netherlands also publicly affirms the BIT to be valid, as is reflected in its official record of treaties and on the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.85 The Netherlands Government also confirmed explicitly, in a letter of 10 February 2010, responding to questions from Eureko, that it considers the BIT to be \"in force.\"86 The Netherlands Government stated that the \"Slovak Republic has never indicated to the Kingdom of the Netherlands in any way that the [BIT] is no longer in force or that its applicability could be in doubt\"; nor had the Slovak Republic \"indicated any wish to negotiate termination of the [BIT].\"\n\nExhibits C-85 and C-86.\n\nExhibits C-87 and C-88.\n\n102.\n\nClaimant further observes that the Slovak Republic has taken no steps to invoke the termination provisions in the BIT. The sole evidence submitted by Respondent to suggest otherwise was the informal 5 April 2004 E-mail, which does not appear to have been effectively sent to or received by the Dutch Embassy (there were flaws in the e-mail address used) and in any event is \"blatantly insufficient to terminate a BIT.\"87 Further the 5 April 2004 E-mail refers to \"harmonization of BIT's,\" which would not be necessary and would not have been proposed had the intra-EU BITs been automatically terminated.88 Claimant does not consider the German or Polish responses to the 5 April 2004 E-mail (produced at the hearing) to be supportive of Respondent's position.89\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 54. See also Transcript, p. 48.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 30-32.\n\nTranscript, pp. 98-99. Claimant observes that \"[t]he Polish e-mail simply makes an obvious statement that articles which are not compatible with the EU Acquis according to the VCLT are terminated under the VCLT, but does not state that the BIT itself or any particular article therein was terminated. The German e-mail is mysterious but does not make Respondent's point.\"\n\n103.\n\nClaimant proffers a number of statements by the Slovak Republic, made in the context of the 2007 Reforms, holding out the BIT to be valid and binding. For example, two communications from the Slovak Ministry of Finance to other government departments warned of likely arbitrations \"for breach of bilateral investment treaties due to indirect expropriation of shares.\"90 Similarly, the Government's Legislative Board raised the prospect of investors having \"the option to revert to arbitration to claim... compensation of damages from the Slovak Republic\" pursuant to the BIT.91 Finally, in 2008, the Ministry of Finance stated that if certain measures were taken, then \"[f]rom an international perspective, such step of the State might be interpreted as an unreasonable intervention with the rights of foreign investors guaranteed by the State under agreements on support and mutual protection of investments... and their violation may give rise to international arbitrations.\"92 All these statements were made some three to five years *after* the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23; Exhibits C-81, C-82.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23; Exhibit C-64.\n\nExhibit C-70.\n\n104.\n\nThe Slovak Republic also made statements directly to Eureko that are \"wholly incompatible with the Slovak Republic's argument that the BIT has terminated upon its accession to the EU.\" For example, in a January 2007 letter, a Minister Valentovi\u0109 assured Eureko that the proposed Ministry of Health procedures would be \"in accordance with EU regulations and bilateral treaties between the Slovak Republic and the Netherlands.\"93 In subsequent communications there was no mention that the BIT was considered invalid.94 When the prospect of arbitration was raised, the Minister of Finance referenced the possibility of reaching an \"amicable settlement\" within the meaning of the BIT.\n\nExhibits C-27.\n\nExhibits C-2, C-4, C-5.\n\n105.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the above-described statements of the Contracting Parties to the BIT are \"highly relevant\" to the analysis under VCLT Article 59 because they reveal whether or not there was the requisite implicit intent on the part of the BIT Contracting Parties to terminate the treaty. Such intent is an essential element of the Article 59 test, and it is therefore wrong for Respondent to dismiss the statements as irrelevant to the resolution of \"purely legal\" issues under the VCLT.\n\n106.\n\nAt the hearing, Claimant was questioned about the European Commission's letter quoted in the *Eastern Sugar* partial award. Claimant highlighted that the European Commission had stated as follows:95\n\nthe EU Acquis does not entail at the same time the automatic termination of the concerned BITs or necessarily the non-application of all their provisions. Without prejudice to the primacy of Community law, to terminate these agreements Member States would have to strictly follow the relevant procedure provided for this in the agreements themselves. Such termination cannot have a retroactive effect.\n\nTranscript, pp. 55-56; *Eastern Sugar*, p. 25.\n\n107.\n\nClaimant reiterated that there was nothing on the record to indicate that the European Commission considered that the treaties had been rendered inapplicable, as a matter of law and in their entirety, at the moment of accession.96\n\nTranscript, pp. 64-65.\n\n108.\n\nA member of the Tribunal pointed out that the European Commission's letter cited in *Eastern Sugar* appeared to reflect a distinction between situations in which the facts that had occurred before accession, and situations such as those where the alleged violations occurred after the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU. Claimant nevertheless considered that this should not make a difference to the legal proposition that a BIT is not automatically terminated but requires strict procedures to be followed in order to effect termination.97\n\nTranscript, pp. 56-57.\n\n**3. Are the provisions of the EC Treaty and BIT so far incompatible that the treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n109.\n\nAs an alternative to a finding that the BIT was terminated by virtue of Article 59(1)(a) of the VCLT, Respondent argues that Article 59(1)(b) is, in any event, satisfied. That is, the provisions of the EC Treaty are so far incompatible with those of the BIT that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time. Under Article 59(1)(b), a conflict occurs when the performance of one treaty necessarily causes a breach of the other treaty: in other words, the obligations arising out of the BIT and the EC Treaty cannot both be fulfilled at the same time.98\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 119-120.\n\n110.\n\nRespondent posits that the provisions on the *free movement of payments* and the *protection and security of investments* guaranteed under the BIT are incompatible with the EC Treaty because Article 58 of the EC Treaty permits exceptions to the free movement of capital relating to taxation and financial supervision or public policy and security. Thus a State may be in breach of the BIT but be in compliance with the EC Treaty.99\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 130-133. A discussion ensued about Article 10 of the BIT, which deals with arbitration of disputes between the two Contracting Parties to the BIT. There appeared to be the suggestion in the European Commission's letter cited in *Eastern Sugar* that such disputes should be dealt with as a matter of Community Law and therefore Article 10 might not be valid.\n\n111.\n\nRespondent further argues that the *expropriation clause* in Article 5 of the BIT is incompatible with the regulation of expropriation and damages under EU law, which is derived largely from the ECHR.100 This is because EU law enables possible restrictions on proprietary rights \"necessary for the general interest\" which could cause a breach of Article 5 of the BIT. Respondent argues that Article 5 of the BIT would also breach Article 10 of the EC Treaty, dealing with loyal cooperation.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 134-138.\n\n112.\n\nRespondent criticises Claimant's failure to address the Extra-EU BIT Cases, even though those cases precisely define what should be considered an incompatibility between EU law and international law instruments.\n\n113.\n\nAccording to Respondent the *arbitration clause* in Article 8 of the BIT is also incompatible with the EC Treaty for two reasons: (i) the arbitration clause violates the exclusive competence of the ECJ to interpret EU law; and (ii) the EC Treaty does not provide for arbitration proceedings between investors and Member States leading to a discrimination problem.101\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 52, 65-72, 106, 140, 153, 155, 156.\n\n114.\n\nAs to the first, arbitral tribunals, unlike national courts, are not entitled to raise preliminary questions of EU law to the ECJ, pursuant to Article 234 of the EC Treaty. Were an arbitral tribunal to resolve questions of EU law in the absence of a referral to the ECJ, this would seriously jeopardise the uniform application of EU law.\n\n115.\n\nRespondent disagrees with Claimant's statement that the ECJ has held that arbitral tribunals are under an obligation to apply fundamental EU law.102 Although it is common ground that this Tribunal should apply EU law, according to Respondent, this Tribunal is prevented from doing so because it is not able to ensure the uniform application and interpretation of EU law, which is the role of the ECJ under Article 220 of the EC Treaty. Even if this Tribunal could request a national court to assist, the national court could not do so because it does not ultimately decide the case on its merits.103\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00b6 91.\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 96-98.\n\n116.\n\nRespondent explains that the uniform application of EU law may not be sufficiently safeguarded by the possibility of annulment or enforcement proceedings in national courts because: (i) such proceedings are not obligatory; (ii) such remedies are limited by specific prerequisites and not every misinterpretation of the law results in the annulment of an award or refusal of its recognition and enforcement; and (iii) if such proceedings are commenced outside the EU, then the national courts will neither be obliged nor entitled to request a preliminary ruling from the ECJ.\n\n117.\n\nOn discrimination, Respondent argues that the arbitration clause is incompatible because it fundamentally violates the principle of equality as stipulated in Article 12 of the EC Treaty. Article 12 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Investors from Member States which have not concluded BITs with the Slovak Republic would be discriminated against as a result of the Arbitration Clause. Thus the fact that only certain EU nationals may seek compensation for damages caused by a breach of EU law before an international arbitral tribunal is discriminatory and in violation of Article 12 of the EC Treaty. In this connection, Respondent dismisses the reasoning of the arbitral tribunal in the *Eastern Sugar* arbitration as based on an \"unconvincing\" and \"cursory analysis.\"104 Because the BIT leads to unequal treatment of EU nationals, the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal ought to have found that compliance with one treaty (the BIT) causes breach of the other treaty (the EC Treaty) and there thus exists an incompatibility for purposes of Article 59(1)(b) of the VCLT.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6 158.\n\n118.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant's suggestion that the discriminatory effects of the BIT could be removed by offering the same rights granted under the BIT to investors from other Member States. This is because the EU has exclusive power to govern and amend the rights relating to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital. As a result, the Member States do not have competence to enter BITs. Even if they did have such competence, this would not remove the discriminatory effect of the BIT retrospectively, as the Vienna Convention's concept of \"incompatible\" provisions includes any provision in a treaty which requires a party to act in a way which necessarily causes a breach of a later treaty. The arbitration clause in the BIT is such a provision because its invocation by Claimant necessarily causes discrimination against citizens from other Member States by the Slovak Republic and the Netherlands. Hence, the BIT must be deemed to have been terminated or inapplicable because of its incompatibility with the EC Treaty.\n\n119.\n\nIn response to a question from a member of the Tribunal at the hearing, Respondent confirmed its view that any complaint that could be made under the fair and equitable treatment provision in the BIT (and not only those complaints specifically raised in the present arbitration) could also be made under the provisions on equality and the prohibition of discrimination in the EC Treaty. In response to a question concerning the example of a flat corporate tax, to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner but which could be said to be unfair and inequitable, Respondent said that this could be an example of a measure incompatible with the BIT but permitted by EU law, and therefore a clear example of incompatibility between the two Treaties. The question was posed whether \"incompatibility\" describes a situation where something that is forbidden under the BIT is *permitted* by EU law, or only where something that is forbidden under the BIT is *mandated* by EU law. According to Respondent, incompatibility occurs when an act is permissible under one treaty, but not permissible under the other.105\n\nTranscript, pp. 27-31.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n120.\n\nClaimant argues that the BIT and EC Treaty are not \"so far incompatible... that the two are not capable of being applied at the same time.\" Article 59(1)(b) requires, according to Claimant, a \"gross incompatibility,\" to such an extent that the parties must be considered to have intended to abrogate the earlier treaty. As Claimant argued with respect to Article 59(1)(a), such intent is absent.\n\n121.\n\nFurther, according to Claimant, the weight of opinion in the literature supports the view that Article 59(1)(b) requires an incompatibility of \"regimes\" of both treaties *as a whole*, and not merely an incompatibility between *some* provisions of the treaties. The incompatibility must be such that the two treaties are \"not capable of being applied at the same time\" and therefore that it is \"not at all possible\" for them to be simultaneously applied. Claimant points to the fact that various tribunals in intra-EU BIT disputes have rendered awards, showing that such treaties are perfectly capable of being applied at the same time.106\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 100.\n\n122.\n\nClaimant observes that the dispute resolution mechanism in Article 8 of the BIT is not incompatible with the EC Treaty, as is shown by the fact that the ECJ has repeatedly held that arbitral tribunals are under an obligation to apply fundamental EU law, despite the fact that arbitral tribunals in and by themselves are not empowered to raise preliminary questions.107 Ultimately, the uniform application of EU law is safeguarded by national courts in exercise of their competence to set aside or refuse to enforce arbitral awards or in their capacity to submit preliminary questions to the ECJ.108\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 101. Citing cases in the context of competition law (Case C-126/97, *Eco Swiss China Time Ltd. v. Benetton International NV*, Judgment of 1 June 1999, [1999] ECR I-03055, hereafter \" ***Eco Swiss*** \") and consumer rights (Case C-168/05, *Elisa Mar\u00eda Mostaza Claro v. Centro M\u00f3vil Milenium SL*, Judgment of 26 October 2006, [2006] ECR I-10421, hereafter \" ***Claro*** \").\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 101-103.\n\n123.\n\nClaimant disputes Respondent's contention that Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with Article 12 of the EC Treaty (prohibiting discrimination on grounds of nationality). According to Claimant, Article 8 of the BIT merely grants Dutch investors a right to be heard by an arbitral tribunal, and if the Slovak Republic considers the exercise of this right to be discriminatory *vis-\u00e0-vis* non-Dutch investors it should grant those non-Dutch investors the same right. Discriminatory behaviour should be remedied by granting others a similarly favourable position, not by placing all parties in a similarly unfavourable position.109\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 104.\n\n124.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal rejected arguments based on discrimination and also observed that the European Commission had not commenced infringement proceedings against either the Netherlands or the Czech Republic, which would have been expected if the Czech Republic were correct about incompatibility. Similarly, according to sources relied upon by Claimant, the *Binder* tribunal dismissed the Czech Republic's arguments in their entirety, holding that the intra-EU BIT and EC law are compatible and still in force. The *Binder* tribunal found no discrimination and no conflict between the substantive protections offered by the BIT and the terms of the EC Treaty, and thus no need to debate the primacy of EC law.110\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 116-136. Claimant noted that the *Binder* case was subject to a pending challenge before the Czech courts and that the Czech Republic had reportedly taken steps to terminate some of its intra-EU BITs, evidencing that the Czech Republic no longer holds the view that intra-EU BITs have been implicitly terminated.\n\n125.\n\nAt the hearing, Claimant responded to questions about discrimination. Claimant argued that where Investor A may bring a State to arbitration, but Investor B cannot bring that same State to arbitration, the State cannot renege on its promise to Investor A by invoking its own discriminatory act. The proper remedy would be for Investor B to seek a right to arbitration. It was discussed whether this in any event presented a problem of compatibility in terms of Article 30 or Article 59 of the VCLT.111 In this context, the Extra-EU BIT cases were recalled, and Claimant pointed out that the ECJ did not refer to discrimination in those cases.\n\nTranscript, pp. 76-81.\n\n126.\n\nClaimant also points to statements by organs of the EU itself which it says confirm the validity of the intra-EU BITs - in particular, the 2007 annual report of the EU's Economic and Financial Committee (\" **EFC** \") in which the EFC argued for the eventual termination of \"remaining\" intra-EU BITs and invited Member States to address their concerns. In the subsequent annual report, the EFC noted that there are over 190 intra-EU BITs and that the Commission had informed Member States of the need to address the issue \"through bilateral actions.\" The 2008 EFC annual report noted that \"most Member States did not share the Commission's concern in respect of arbitration risks and discriminatory treatment of investors and a clear majority of Member States preferred to maintain the existing agreements.\"112\n\nExhibits C-89, C-90. With respect to the statements of the EFC in its Annual Reports of 2006-2008, Respondent submitted in its Jurisdiction Reply that these do not represent the opinions of the Commission, and when read in context they clearly imply, *inter alia*, that at least some of the provisions of the BIT have been superseded by EU law and the Commission's belief that the application of the BITs causes discrimination.\n\n**B. Inapplicability of the BIT's Arbitration Clause BIT under Article 30 of the Vienna Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n127.\n\nRespondent argues that even if Article 59 of the VCLT does not operate to terminate the BIT, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide this case because the arbitration clause in the BIT is not \"compatible\" with the EC Treaty within the meaning of Article 30 of the VCLT, which provides:\n\n*Successive Treaties Relating To The Same Subject Matter*\n\n\u2026\n\n3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty\n\n128.\n\nUnlike Article 59, Article 30 requires no proof of the parties' intentions and does not relate to the incompatibility of the treaties as a whole, but rather to the incompatibility of individual provisions. In this arbitration, Claimant asserts the Slovak Republic violated Articles 3(1), 3(2), 4 and 5 of the BIT, all of which, according to Respondent, were supplanted by EU law. Therefore, the dispute has to be solved under EU law. However, the Tribunal lacks the competence to apply and interpret EU law. According to Respondent, Article 30(3) of the VCLT therefore renders the arbitration clause inapplicable, and the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the case.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n129.\n\nClaimant argues against an application of Article 30(3) of the VCLT on the grounds that the BIT and EC Treaty do not \"relate to the same subject matter\" (as previously discussed) and that Article 8 is not incompatible with provisions of the EC Treaty (as discussed in the context of Article 59(1)(b)).113\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 105.\n\n130.\n\nClaimant points out that the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal rejected the VCLT Article 30(3) argument with respect to the arbitration clause. That tribunal found that \"the fact that [the EC Treaty] does not provide for a possibility for an investor to sue a host state directly, and that in international BIT arbitration this is an essential feature of most bilateral investment treaties, is in itself sufficient to reject the Czech Republic's equivalence argument.\"114\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 122, citing *Eastern Sugar* partial award, \u00b6 180. In its Jurisdiction Reply, Respondent points out that *Eastern Sugar* is the only published decision dealing with the relationship between an intra-EU BIT and EU law; but the tribunal in that case only did so through the prism of Article 59 of the VCLT, and not through Article 30(3) or through principles of arbitrability according to the *lex loci arbitri*.\n\n131.\n\nClaimant's responses to the European Commission's observations on the applicability of VCLT Article 30(3) in the present arbitration are discussed below at paragraphs 205 to 207.\n\n**C. Inapplicability of the BIT and Incompetence of the Tribunal as a Matter of EU Law**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n132.\n\nIn the alternative to a finding of inapplicability under the VCLT, Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction as a matter of EU law, which the Tribunal is bound to apply in accordance with Article 8(6) of the BIT. Article 8(6) provides as follows:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively:\n\n\u2022 the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n\u2022 the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n\u2022 the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;\n\n\u2022 the general principles of international law.\n\n133.\n\nAccording to Respondent, this provision obliges the Tribunal to take into account EU law as part of the \"law in force of the Contracting Party concerned.\" By the accession of the Slovak Republic to the EU, the *acquis communautaire* has become part of the Slovak legal order with supremacy over other legal rules. The notion of supremacy stems from both ECJ jurisprudence and the Constitution of the Slovak Republic.115\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 176-180. Article 7(2) of the Slovak Constitution states that \"Legally binding acts of the European Communities and of the European Union shall have precedence over laws of the Slovak Republic.\" Respondent also cites: Case C-6/64, *Flaminio Costa v. E.N.E.L.*, Judgment of 15 July 1964, [1964]; Case 106/77, *Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v. Simmenthal SpA*, Judgment of 9 March 1978, [1978] ECR 00629; Case C-425/06, *Ministerio* *dell'Economia e delle Finanze v. Part Service Srl*, Judgment of 21 February 2008, [2008] ECR I-00897; Case 26-62, *NV Algemene Transport en Expeditie Onderneming van Gend & Loos v. Netherlands Inland Revenue Administration*, Judgment of 5 February 1963.\n\n134.\n\nRespondent complained that Claimant had not complied with an order from the Tribunal that it produce exchanged correspondence with the European Commission, from a certain date range, relating to the alleged breach of EU law by the Slovak Republic. As a result, Respondent requested the Tribunal to draw the following adverse inference from Claimant's failure to produce such correspondence: \"the Tribunal should consider it to be proved that the legal subject matter of the Dispute is governed by EU law.\"116 However, because the ECJ has an \"interpretive monopoly\" with regard to EU law under Articles 220 and 234 of the EC Treaty, and the Tribunal lacks the competence to refer to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide a dispute governed by EU law.117\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 133-5.\n\n135.\n\nSeveral of Claimant's BIT complaints correspond to complaints under EU law. For example, unlawful expropriation contrary to Article 5 of the BIT is also governed by Article 6(2) of the EC Treaty and the ECHR, as well as by Articles 43 and 56 of the EC Treaty on indirect expropriation. Parallel application of both EU law and the BIT is not possible, according to Respondent, because of the supremacy and direct effect of EU law. Respondent argues that as a matter of national law the supremacy of EU law enables EU law to supersede the legal systems of its Member States, including bilateral treaties concluded between Member States, as confirmed by the ECJ.118 In support of this argument, Respondent points out that no intra-EU BITs have ever been concluded between Member States after their accession to the EC/EU.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6 114, citing Case C-478/07, *Bud* *e* *jovicky Budvar, narodni podnik v. Rudolf Ammersin GmbH,* Judgment of 8 September 2009, [2009] ECR I-07721.\n\n136.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the ECJ considers EU law to prevail over bilateral treaties concluded between Member States as it does over rules of national law.119 Thus, EU law should be applicable and take priority over the provisions of the BIT.120 Respondent concludes that \"due to the fact that the subject matter regulated by the BIT is comprehensively covered by EU law, the provisions of the BIT are no longer applicable... and thus the Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide on the breach of the EC Treaty is not given.\"121\n\n*Ibid*, \u00b6 26.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6 182.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 183-185.\n\n137.\n\nRespondent argues that, under the principles of direct applicability and supremacy of EU law, intra-EU BITs are contrary to EU law. The unity of the *acquis communautaire* does not allow for any difference in the position of EU law within the legislation of individual Member States. Uniform application of EU law can only occur when all member states accord priority to EU law over any other rule of law, including the intra-EU BITs (supremacy of EU law), and provide for the direct and immediate application of EU law (direct effect). Application of a rule of law belonging to a legal system outside that of the EU would undermine the creation of the internal market and result in the resolution of matters of EU law being removed from the ambit of the ECJ.122\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 27-43.\n\n138.\n\nAt the hearing, Respondent acknowledged that with Frankfurt as the place of arbitration and therefore with German law as the *lex loci arbitri*, the doctrine of separability of the arbitration clause would apply in this case, but Respondent did not consider this to be problematic.123 Respondent also acknowledged that all over Europe there are arbitration tribunals, particularly in commercial arbitration, that apply EU law on a regular basis. According to Respondent, such tribunals are wrong to do so, as such questions of EU law should be sent to the ECJ for a preliminary interpretation and arbitral tribunals have no competence to do so.124 It was put to Respondent that although a tribunal cannot make a reference to the ECJ, an arbitration matter may end up before a national court and that national court may itself make a reference to the ECJ. Respondent acknowledged this to be possible, but pointed out that if the parties had agreed to a seat of arbitration outside of the ECJ, such as Switzerland, there could be no referral to the ECJ.125\n\nTranscript, p. 37. The doctrine of separability appears in Book 10 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung, or \" **ZPO** \"), \u00a7 1040. See also UNCITRAL Rules, art. 21(2).\n\nTranscript, pp. 39-41.\n\nTranscript, p. 41-42.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n139.\n\nIn answer to Respondent's argument referring to the applicable law under Article 8(6) of the BIT, Claimant contends that the argument is (i) untimely and thus inadmissible, (ii) incomprehensible, and (iii) in any event based on a misreading of Article 8(6) of the BIT, which expressly *permits* the Tribunal to apply both the provisions of \"this Agreement and other relevant Agreements\" as well as \"the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned.\"126\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 140-144.\n\n140.\n\nClaimant addresses Respondent's request that the Tribunal draw from Eureko's non-production of certain correspondence with the European Commission the adverse inference that \"the legal subject matter of the dispute is governed by EU law.\" Claimant submits that the procedural history shows Respondent to have changed its motive for requesting the documents, and that the requested inference is incapable of being drawn from the documents in question.127\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 150-56.\n\n141.\n\nClaimant considers Respondent's expos\u00e9 about the principles of \"supremacy\" of EU law over national law to be irrelevant. Claimant points out that the BIT is not a national law but an instrument of public international law. EU law is not superior to and does not take precedence over international law. A rule of international law is not automatically rendered inapplicable if it contravenes a rule of EU law, and at most an EU Member State may be obliged to amend or terminate such an international law obligation. However such an international law obligation remains fully in force as long as the Member State does not actually procure its amendment or termination.\n\n142.\n\nClaimant explained at the hearing that under Respondent's logic, every tribunal that would touch upon an issue of EU law that a respondent considered to be controversial would be forced to declare that it had no jurisdiction because the tribunal could not itself make a referral of the controversial question to the ECJ.128 Claimant also pointed out that lower national courts apply EU law every day, and that while lower national courts *may* refer preliminary questions of EU law to the ECT, they are not bound to do so.\n\nTranscript, pp.45-46.\n\n**D. Non-Arbitrability as a Matter of German Law**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n143.\n\nRespondent argues that arbitrability under the *lex loci arbitri* (German law), provides an alternative basis for finding that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute.129\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 186-93.\n\n144.\n\nUnder German law, an arbitral award issued in a non-arbitrable dispute may be set aside by a German court under Section 1059(2)(2)(a) of the ZPO.130 Under Section 1030 of the ZPO, disputes involving an economic interest can be the subject of an arbitration agreement unless any other German legal regulation stipulates that national courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6 188 (\"An arbitral award may be set aside only if [\u2026] the court finds that the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under German law\").\n\n145.\n\nAccording to Respondent, EU law constitutes an integral part of the legal order applicable in Germany as an EU Member State. Thus, any and all statutory provisions of EU law governing the protection of investments constitute an integral part of the German legal order. In this case, Claimant asserts a breach of both EU law and the BIT. As the whole area covered by the BIT overlaps with legal regulations arising under EU law, the Tribunal would inevitably be deciding on a breach of EU law. EU law does not allow the conferral on an arbitral tribunal of jurisdiction over the area covered by the BIT and therefore, Respondent argues, the dispute would be non-arbitrable under Section 1030(3) of the ZPO.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n146.\n\nClaimant considers that Respondent's argument based on arbitrability must fail because Article 8(6) obliges the Tribunal to apply EU law as one of the sources of law. This is consistent with ECJ jurisprudence on the obligation upon arbitral tribunals to apply EU law, subject to limited review by state courts subsequent to the conclusion of arbitral proceedings.131\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 156, citing *Eco Swiss* and *Claro*.\n\n147.\n\nClaimant argues that if the ECJ were exclusively competent to interpret EU law, the European Commission would not have invited Eureko \"to seek redress... through arbitration and conciliation procedures available.\"132 The fact that an arbitral tribunal is not competent to raise preliminary questions before the ECJ does not render an arbitration agreement invalid. Claimant observed that the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal rejected a similar argument based on arbitrability brought by the Czech Republic.\n\nExhibit R-47.\n\n**E. Request to Submit the Dispute to ECJ or Stay the Arbitration Pending ECJ Decision**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n148.\n\nAs an alternative to a finding that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, Respondent requests that, in the event the Tribunal finds itself competent to submit the request for a preliminary ruling of the ECJ, the Tribunal (i) submit such a request to the ECJ after consulting the Parties; and (ii) stay the arbitration pending the ECJ's decision.133 As discussed below at paragraphs 197 to 203, Respondent is supportive of a similar proposal put by the European Commission.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6 195. Respondent noted that a similar approach was taken in *Ireland v. United Kingdom*, arbitration proceedings initiated pursuant to Annex VII of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (hereafter \" ***MOX Plant*** \"), Procedural Order No. 6 (Termination of Proceedings), 6 June 2008. Available at: http:///www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag \\_id=1148.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n149.\n\nClaimant's primary objective in having filed a complaint with the European Commission was to remain active as a health insurer in the Slovak Republic and thus help persuade the Slovak government to change its approach. Having filed the complaint, proceedings between the European Commission and an EU Member State are out of the control of the complainant. The complaint proceedings must be seen as complementary to the BIT arbitration, instigated under two different treaties and two sets of procedural and substantive norms.134\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n\n150.\n\nClaimant opposes Respondent's suggestions that the arbitral proceedings be stayed and that the Tribunal submit a request to the ECJ, because the Tribunal is not competent to do so. As discussed below at paragraphs 204 to 211, Claimant similarly rejects a proposal by the European Commission that the Tribunal suspend the arbitration.\n\n**F. Request that the European Commission be Invited to Participate in the Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n151.\n\nIn its Jurisdiction Memorial, Respondent requested the Tribunal to invite the EU, represented by the European Commission, to participate in the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings as an *amicus curiae* to express the EU's view on the application of the BIT.135\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00b6 196. See also \"Respondent's Position on Amicus Curiae Brief of the European Commission,\" submitted to the Tribunal by letter dated 14 April 2010.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n152.\n\nIn its written submissions, Claimant opposes the suggestion that the European Commission be invited to submit an *amicus* brief, on the basis that this would result in additional delay and costs and could not in any event be relevant or decisive with respect to the Tribunal's consideration of its jurisdiction on the basis of Article 8 of the BIT.136\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 162.\n\n153.\n\nAt the hearing, Claimant compared the relevance of what the European Commission thinks about the validity of the BIT with what the two contracting parties to the BIT think about the validity of the BIT. As with Eureko's views, the European Commission's views on the validity of the BIT are not relevant to the application of Article 59 of the VCLT. That is why Claimant considered the correspondence between Eureko and the Commission to be irrelevant in the document production phase. It is also why Claimant considered it unnecessary (not to mention a possible source of delay) for the European Commission to be invited to participate as an *amicus curiae* in the arbitration. By contrast, the views of the Slovak Republic and Netherlands, being contracting parties to the BIT, directly weigh on the question of \"intention\" for purposes of Article 59 of the VCLT. That is why Claimant argues that the Slovak Republic's statements to the public, to Eureko and to the European Commission are all relevant (and, in the latter category, explain why the production of Respondent's 226-Reply had been sought).137\n\nTranscript, pp. 51-53.\n\n**V. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 24 April 2010 hearing, the Tribunal consulted with the Parties about the possibility of approaching the Government of the Netherlands and the European Commission for written observations. It was agreed that such invitations could be extended, so long as relatively tight deadlines for the responses were requested in order to keep the proceedings as efficient as possible.138\n\nTranscript, pp. 106-107.\n\n**A. Written Observations of the Netherlands Government**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Netherlands Government Letter of 10 June 2010**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nOn 10 June 2010, the Netherlands Government, by letter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, responded to the Tribunal's invitation to provide observations with regard to the question whether or not the BIT is still legally valid and subsequently whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction to adjudicate this claim.\n\n156.\n\nThe Netherlands Government noted that the BIT was in force long before the Slovak Republic's accession to the European Union. The Government concurred with the following statements made by the European Commission quoted in the *Eastern Sugar* partial award:\n\nHowever the effective prevalence of the EU acquis does not entail, at the same time, the automatic termination of the concerned BITs or, necessarily, the nonapplication of all their provisions. Without prejudice to the primacy of Community law, to terminate these agreements, Member States would have to strictly follow the relevant procedure provided for this in regard in the agreements themselves. Such termination cannot have a retroactive effect.\n\n157.\n\nThe Netherlands Government noted that according to ECJ jurisprudence, the EU must respect international law in the exercise of its powers, in particular with respect to the termination and suspension of international treaties.139\n\nCase C-162/96, *Racke GmbH & Co. v. Hauptzollanmt Mainz*, Judgment of 16 June 1998, [1988] ECR I-03655, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, Case C-286/90, *Anklagemyndigheden v. Peter Michael Poulsen and Diva Navigation Corp.*, Judgment of 24 November 1992, [1992] ECR I-06019, \u00b6 9.\n\n158.\n\nThe Netherlands Government emphasised that the legal validity of the BIT is:\n\nsolely governed by Article 13(2) of the BIT, and where necessary by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and general public international law. Thus, this BIT can only be terminated by informing - at least 6 months before - the other Contracting Party about its intention to terminate the BIT. The Netherlands so far has never received any indication from the Slovak Government that it has the intention to terminate the BIT. Similarly, the Slovak Government so far has also not expressed towards the Netherlands Government its wish to renegotiate the BIT. Nor did The Netherlands express any intention in this direction towards the Slovak Republic.\n\n159.\n\nThe Netherlands Government referred to the letter it had provided to Claimant's counsel in response to a request in January 2010. After receipt of that letter, the Netherlands approached the Slovak Republic officially in order to confirm that the BIT remains fully in force, and in order to receive a confirmation to that effect by the Slovak Republic. As at 10 June 2010, the Slovak Republic had provided oral and informal assurances of the BIT's validity.\n\n160.\n\nThe Netherlands Government stated that the conditions in Article 54 of the VCLT for the termination of a treaty, namely termination in conformity with the provisions of the Treaty or by consent of all parties after consultation with the other contracting States, had not been met here.140\n\nVCLT, art. 54 provides: \"The termination of a treaty or the withdrawal of a party may take place: (a) in conformity with the provisions of the treaty; or (b) at any time by consent of all the parties after consultation with the other contracting States.\"\n\n161.\n\nThe Netherlands Government concluded that:\n\nThe Netherlands affirms again that the BIT in question in this dispute continues to be fully in force. Consequently, there is also no reason to doubt the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal in this dispute. Accordingly, Article 8 of the BIT, which prescribes international arbitration as a dispute settlement tool for disputes between an investor and a Contracting Party, is fully applicable. In the view of The Netherlands, European Union law aspects cannot and do not affect in a way the existing jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal. Thus, this Arbitral Tribunal should fully exercise its jurisdiction and adjudicate this dispute.\n\n162.\n\nOn a more general level, the Netherlands Government stated that it was aware of recent developments regarding BITs and EU law. First, the Extra-EU BIT Cases were not directly relevant for the present dispute; but in order to accommodate these judgments, all Member States and the European Commission were in close discussions with each other \"to adopt a common attitude.\" Second, with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, a transfer of competence from the Member States to the EU has taken place regarding foreign direct investments and the protection of investments as laid down in Article 207 of the TFEU. According to the Netherlands Government, the way the EU will exercise this new power still needs to be determined.\n\n163.\n\nFinally, the Netherlands Government observed that:\n\nCurrently, the European Union Member States are awaiting proposals from the European Commission regarding the future policy towards the new competence pursuant to article 207 TFEU, which will also touch upon the matter of existing BITs of the Member States. The Netherlands is actively involved in working towards a practical solution that takes into account the concerns of the European Commission, while at the same time secures the interests of the Member States and the protection of investors in the European Union.  \n Considering this ongoing process between the Member States and the European Commission, The Netherlands deems it inappropriate to anticipate or even predetermine the question of the status of intra-EU BITs in the present dispute before an international ad hoc Arbitral Tribunal. Legal certainty for all Contracting Parties to BITs and for investors and their investments is of the utmost importance to the Netherlands. Therefore, casting any doubt on the legal validity of existing intra-EU BITs would be unnecessarily harmful and undermine the rights and legitimate expectations of investors relying on existing BITs.\n\n**2. Netherlands Government Letter of 23 June 2010 appending Note Verbale from the Slovak Republic**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nOn 23 June 2010, the Netherlands Government sent a further letter to the Arbitral Tribunal attaching a Note Verbale received by the Netherlands Government from the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs in response to a request from the Netherlands Government on 4 May 2010.\n\n165.\n\nThe Slovak Note Verbale included the following statement:\n\nAccording to competent authority of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of the Finance of the Slovak Republic, the validity of the BIT has not been terminated in accordance with article 13 of the BIT.  \n However, according to competent authority of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of the Finance of the Slovak Republic it is nonetheless important to analyze the issue as to whether the BIT is valid and applicable, since the validity and applicability of the BITs concluded between EU Member States have been repeatedly challenged in investment disputes and also in debates between International Law experts and European Law experts, as well as among EU Member States.\n\n166.\n\nIn light of those observations, the Slovak Republic invited the Netherlands \"to commence discussions regarding the validity and applicability of the BIT,\" while inviting other EU Member States and the European Commission to join these discussions:\n\nOnly within the scope of this broad discussion it is possible find a common solution and eliminate the current legal uncertainty.  \n The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic deems this issue to be of the utmost importance for the future of investment protection in Europe.\n\n**3. Parties' comments on Netherlands Government observations and Slovak Republic Note Verbale**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n167.\n\nRespondent notes that the observations of the Netherlands Government do not exhaustively consider the legal status of intra-EU BITs. Indeed, the observations should have \"no substantial impact on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal,\" because \"the Netherlands Government failed to substantiate its assertions... omitted to present its observations with respect to the inapplicability of the BIT as a result of its incompatibility with the EC Treaty,\" and relied on only one portion of the European Commission's views as cited in the controversial *Eastern Sugar* award.141\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n\n168.\n\nIn relation to the Netherlands Government's reference to Article 54 of the Vienna Convention, Respondent notes that Article 54 does not purport to contain an exhaustive list of means to terminate a treaty.142\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 24.\n\n169.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Netherlands Government misinterprets the alleged confirmation by the Slovak Republic of the validity of the BIT. By its Note Verbale, the Slovak Republic merely confirmed that the BIT had not been terminated by means of the procedure under Article 13 of the BIT (a fact never contested by Respondent.) The Note Verbale actually reiterates the importance of considering the validity and applicability of the BIT. In this context, the Slovak Republic invited the Netherlands and other Member States to participate in discussions that might lead to a common solution to the legal uncertainty.143\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22, 25-26.\n\n170.\n\nRespondent thus concludes that the observations from the Netherlands Government are not persuasive with respect to the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n171.\n\nClaimant emphasises that the observations of the Netherlands leave no doubt whatsoever that the Netherlands considers the \"the BIT... is still fully in force.\"\n\n172.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the Slovak Republic \"has also in effect admitted that the BIT has not terminated,\" though according to the Note Verbale the Slovak Republic confirmed only that the BIT has not \"terminated under its own provisions.\" Comparing the strongly-argued position taken by Respondent in this arbitration with the ambiguous language in the Note Verbale that it is \"important\" to \"analyse\" validity of the BIT, Claimant considers that the Slovak Republic's position is inconsistent and disingenuous. Claimant thus states:\n\nIf the Slovak Republic had truly believed that the BIT had terminated as of its EU accession, it could have simply communicated so to its treaty partner (and to Eureko upon notification of a claim under the BIT). Its failure to give that simple confirmation evidences that the Slovak Republic is not truly convinced that the BIT has terminated.\n\n173.\n\nClaimant concludes that there can be no doubt the BIT is a treaty in force that has not terminated under Article 59 of the VCLT.\n\n174.\n\nWith respect to incompatibility, Claimant notes that the Netherlands considers that \"European Union law aspects cannot and do not affect in a way the existing jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal.\" Claimant also notes the absence of any argument in the Slovak Republic's Note Verbale that the arbitration clause is not applicable.144\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4-6, 9.\n\n**B. Written Observations of the European Commission**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nOn 7 July 2010, the European Commission submitted detailed observations in response to the Tribunal's invitation to update and elaborate upon the observations that had been submitted in 2006 to the tribunal in *Eastern Sugar.*\n\n**1. Distinction between extra-EU BITs and intra-EU BITs**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nAt the outset of its observations, the Commission distinguishes between extra-EU BITs (of which there are over 1000) and intra-EU BITs (of which there are approximately 190).145 The Commission's concerns about extra-EU BITs relate to questions of treaty making competence and incompatibility with mandatory EC law relating to investment, other capital movements and payments. With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU has exclusive competence in respect of foreign direct investment as part of the common commercial policy (TFEU, Art. 207(1), Art. 3(1)(e)). The Commission refers to a new proposal for an EU Regulation establishing the terms and procedures under which Member States are authorised to maintain in force, amend or conclude extra-EU BITs. That proposal expressly does *not* encompass intra-EU BITs. According to the Commission, \"unlike intra-EU BITs, it is important to clarify that the European Commission does not take issue with third party arbitration mechanisms set out in these BITs entered into with non-EU countries.\"\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 10-19.\n\n177.\n\nThe Commission's concerns with intra-EU BITs are of \"a different order\" and relate to the compatibility of such BITs with mandatory provisions of EU law and with the EU's judicial system.146 Intra-EU BITs amount to an \"anomaly within the EU internal market.\" There is at the very least a partial overlap between intra-EU BITs and the internal market provisions of the EU, and this calls into question the permissibility of the continued existence of intra-EU BITs.\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 20-38.\n\n178.\n\nIn the EU judicial system, the Luxembourg courts have exclusive jurisdiction (i) to determine, in infringement proceedings, whether EU Member States have fulfilled their EU law obligations, and (ii) to give preliminary rulings on questions of EU law as requested by EU domestic courts and tribunals. EU Member States are prevented from submitting their disputes to \"any other method of dispute settlement\" under the principle established in the \" *MOX Plant* \" case between the UK and Ireland, in which the ECJ found that it had exclusive jurisdiction in resolving a dispute between two EU Member States that was at least partially covered by EU law.147 As a consequence, EU Member States that resort to an *inter-State* arbitration mechanism provided for under an intra-EU BIT for matters partially covered by EU law, are in breach of Article 344 of the TFEU.\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6 25, citing Case C-459/03, *Commission v. Ireland*, Judgment of 30 May 2006, [2006] ECR I-4635 (hereafter \" ***MOX Plant*** \").\n\n179.\n\nFor investor-State arbitration, under a BIT, an international tribunal independent from the host State may be seized with the matter; but under the EU judicial system, investors must either address a national court (which may or must refer questions of interpretation to the ECJ) or alternatively call on the Commission to initiate infringement proceedings. According to the Commission, \"the arguments in favour of maintaining an investor-State arbitration mechanism for intra-EU BITs are not persuasive from an internal EU law perspective.\"148\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6 29.\n\n180.\n\nThe Commission asserts that where there is a conflict with EU law, the rule of *pacta sunt servanda* does *not* apply to agreements between EU Member States, because of the jurisprudence establishing that \"EU law takes supremacy not only over the national legal systems, but also over bilateral agreements concluded between Member States.\" This applies to pre-accession bilateral treaties between Member States. The ECJ has consistently held that in cases of conflict between bilateral agreements between Member States and EU law, the latter prevails.149 The Commission explains:\n\n[A]s a result of the supremacy of EU law vis-\u00e0-vis pre-accession treaties between Member States, conflicts between BIT provisions and EU law cannot be resolved by interpreting and applying the relevant EU law provisions in the light of the BIT. Only the inverse approach is possible, namely interpretation of the BIT norms in the light of EU law. The foregoing has implications as regards the ability of private parties (investors) to rely on provisions of an intra-EU BIT that are in conflict with EU law. Under EU law, a private party cannot rely on provisions in an international agreement to justify a possible breach of EU law... This includes resort to judicial settlement mechanisms that conflict with the EU judicial system. Furthermore, in the EU legal system, national legislation of an EU Member State that is incompatible with EU law does not become \u2018invalid'; it merely cannot be applied where it conflicts with EU law. The same applies in the Commission's view, to existing intra-EU BITs that contain provisions that are incompatible with EU law: neither the BIT as such nor the conflicting provisions become \u2018invalid'; but they cannot be applied where they conflict with EU law. [ *emphasis in original* ]\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6 30, citing Case C-235/87, *Matteucci v. Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise of Belgium et. al*, Judgment of 27 September 1988, [1988] ECR 05589, \u00b6 22; Case 3/91, *Exportur SA v. Lor SA and Confiserie du Tech SA,* Judgment of 10 November 1992, [1992] ECR I-5529, \u00b6 8; Case 10/61, *Commission v. Italy*, Judgment of 27 February 1962.\n\n181.\n\nEven when general principles of law, including the Vienna Convention, are followed, \"the conclusion cannot be any different: for all states that accede to the EU, the EU treaties are to be regarded as a \u2018later treaty', *lex posterior.* \" The *pacta sunt servanda* rule only applies to extra-EU BITs.150 This results from an unambiguous conflict rule that forms part of the *acquis communautaire* that Member States sign up to when they join the EU.\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.\n\n182.\n\nThe Commission notes that its continued concerns regarding the compatibility of intra-EU BITs with EU law are well known to all Member States, and claims that:151\n\nEventually, all intra-EU BITs will have to be terminated. Commission services intend to contact all Member States again, urging them to take concrete steps soon. Furthermore, while the Commission is in favour of consensual solutions with EU Member States, as guardian of the EU treaties it cannot exclude eventually having to resort to infringement proceedings against certain Member States.\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6 38.\n\n**2. Discrimination issues with intra-EU BITs**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Commission considers there is serious potential for discrimination between EU investors from different Member States, which is incompatible with EU law. That is because some investors are covered by a BIT and granted the opportunity to resort to investor-State arbitration while others are not. Arbitration is seen by some as more attractive, though the Commission does not accept that arbitration is more efficient than redress through national courts or through a complaint to the Commission. In any event, the availability of a *choice* of dispute resolution procedures gives some investors an advantage over investors from other Member States, and thus constitutes forbidden discrimination against those other EU nationals.152\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6 31.\n\n184.\n\nThe Commission rejects the suggestion that discrimination be resolved positively, not by eliminating the investor-State arbitration mechanism but by extending the preferential treatment to all investors from other EU countries. Such a suggestion is unacceptable from an institutional EU law perspective and misunderstands the EU judicial system, which is \"firmly opposed to the \u2018outsourcing' of disputes involving EU law\" to tribunals outside the EU courts, for the reasons set out by the ECJ in the *MOX Plant* case.153\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6 32.\n\n**3. Competing judicial and arbitral mechanisms**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Commission considers that granting the opportunity for arbitration to all investors would \"inevitably promote competing judicial and arbitral mechanisms, increase \u2018forum shopping' by litigants and contribute to the risk of further fragmentation of international law.\" The Commission explains:\n\nContinued resort to outside dispute settlement mechanisms by EU subjects based on intra-EU BITs also reveals mistrust in the courts of EU Member States. This has no place in the current post-enlargement context, which is rooted in mutual trust between Member States and founded on the development of a common favourable investment environment. Mutual trust in the administration of justice in the European Union is one of the principles regarded as necessary by the European Court of Justice for the sound operation of the internal market.\n\n186.\n\nThe Commission also contests Eureko's assertion that a damages award would be unavailable to it under the EU legal system, and recalls the well-settled and \"inherent\" principle established by the ECJ in *Francovich* that a victim has a right to compensation for damage caused as a result of breaches of EU law.154\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6 36.\n\n**4. Termination of the Dutch-Slovak BIT is desirable but has not happened automatically under VCLT Article 59**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nWith respect to the BIT in this arbitration, the Commission states that \"both EU Member States should terminate this type of bilateral agreement.\" However, the Commission acknowledges that neither party appears to have taken any decisive step formally to terminate this BIT. The Commission does not discern in the 2003 Act of Accession any intention of the parties to abrogate earlier intra-EU BITs. The Commission thus agrees that \"the entire Dutch-Slovak BIT has not been implicitly terminated or suspended by virtue of Article 59(1) of the Vienna Convention.\" However, the Commission argues that \"EU law prevails, which means that private parties are not entitled to rely on EU-inconsistent provisions of this agreement.\"155\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.\n\n**5. Some BIT provisions are inapplicable under VCLT Article 30(3)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nAccording to the Commission, even where it appears the BIT is not rendered invalid or terminated *as a whole*, those provisions of a BIT that are inconsistent with EU law cannot be applied. The Commission observes that Eureko has invoked EU law as well as breaches of the BIT to support its contention that the Slovak Republic failed to offer fair and equitable treatment and restricted the freedom of capital movement with respect to its investment. The Commission recalls that Eureko lodged a complaint with the Commission based in part on the same grievances as the arbitration claim, and that this led to infringement proceedings being opened against the Slovak Republic. The Commission states that the investigation is currently ongoing, but is \"unable at this stage to disclose the scope of its investigation into the Slovak legislation and administrative practice.\"156\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6 45.\n\n189.\n\nThe Commission asserts that the Tribunal is bound to take EU law into account by virtue of Article 8(6) of the BIT. Both as a matter of the internal EU conflict rules of supremacy, and as a matter of public international law, the Tribunal cannot apply provisions of the BIT that are incompatible with EU law.\n\n190.\n\nThe Commission argues that Article 30(3) of the VCLT applies where two treaties cover the \"same subject matter\" and provisions of the earlier treaty are \"incompatible\" with those of the later treaty, and that both of these conditions are satisfied here.\n\n191.\n\nOn the \"same subject matter\" element, the Commission argues that the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal was mistaken in holding that the BIT and EC Treaty do not cover the same subject matter because it \"it did not inquire correctly into the standards of \u2018sameness' under Article 30 of the Vienna Convention. Rather it simply assumed that the two treaties would have to relate to \u2018the same precise subject matter.'\" The Commission argues that the better approach, and that of the ILC, is that the two treaties need only be of a \"similar or comparable degree of generality\" so that their parallel operation could lead to incompatible results. In the instant case, both the BIT and the TFEU \"would have a normative claim to rule on the legality of Slovakian Health Care legislation. It follows that the two treaties relate to \u2018the same subject matter' within the meaning of Article 30 of the Vienna Convention.\" There can be no doubt that the treaties pursue similar objectives. Comparing various provisions in the two treaties, in both the establishment and post-establishment phase of an investment, the Commission concludes that the BIT and the TFEU relate to \"the same subject matter\" within the meaning of Article 30 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n192.\n\nOn the \"incompatibility\" element, while the Commission believes there is no \"incompatibility\" within the meaning of Article 59(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention between the BIT in its *entirety* and the TFEU, there is \"incompatibility\" of *certain* *provisions*, within the meaning of Article 30(3) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n193.\n\nThe Commission takes the view that:157\n\nThere are some provisions of the Dutch-Slovak BIT \"that raise fundamental questions regarding compatibility with EU law. Most prominent among these are the provisions of the BIT providing for an investor-State arbitral mechanism (set out in Art. 8), and the provisions of the BIT providing for an inter-State arbitral mechanism (set out in Art. 10). These provisions conflict with EU law on the exclusive competence of EU courts for claims which involve EU law, even for claims where EU law would only partially be affected. The European Commission must therefore... express its reservation with respect to the Arbitral Tribunal's competence to arbitrate the claim brought before it by *Eureko B.V.*\n\nEuropean Commission Observations, \u00b6 80.\n\n**6. Suspension of proceedings until doubts resolved by ECJ**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Commission believes that were this Tribunal to proceed now, there would be a real risk that it might come to a different view than the Commission (which is dealing with the pending infringement case) or eventually, the ECJ. Thus, the Commission states:\n\nThe prospect of two conflicting decisions involving EU law is most unwelcome. In addition, there is a related risk that the Arbitral Tribunal might render an award that is not compatible with EU law. An arbitral award that has been rendered in violation of EU law may not be executed and enforced in an EU Member State. A Member State that would do so nonetheless, risks infringement proceedings.\n\n195.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission proposes a similar course of action to that in the *MOX Plant* case, where the arbitral tribunal concluded that:\n\nIn the circumstances, and bearing in mind considerations of mutual respect and comity which should prevail between judicial institutions both of which may be called upon to determine rights and obligations as between two States, the Tribunal considers that it would be inappropriate for it to proceed further with hearing the Parties on the merits of the dispute in the absence of a resolution of the problems referred to. Moreover, a procedure that might result in two conflicting decisions on the same issue would not be helpful to the resolution of the dispute between the Parties.\n\n196.\n\nThe Commission suggests that this Tribunal suspend the present arbitration because: (i) EU law forms part of the law that this Tribunal must apply by virtue of Article 8(6) of the BIT and the fact that Eureko itself invokes EU law; (ii) the EU law to be applied includes the principle of exclusive competence of the EU courts in respect of disputes between EU law subjects that involve EU law; (iii) the Commission has already opened an infringement case against the Slovak Republic in connection with Eureko's complaints; and (iv) the \"considerations of mutual respect and comity\" form part of the general principles of law that the Tribunal must apply by virtue of Article 8(6) of the BIT.\n\n**7. Parties' comments on the European Commission's observations**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Comments*\n-----------------------\n\n197.\n\nRespondent considers that the Commission's observations are \"of the utmost importance\" to the Tribunal's jurisdictional decision. The observations confirm the significance of the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection and thus undermine Claimant's accusations that Respondent has brought a frivolous challenge.158 In this respect, Respondent draws the Tribunal's attention to an e-mail from the Commission of 19 July 2010 inviting Member States to meet to discuss their views and concerns regarding intra-EU BITs.159\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 29-30.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 31; Exhibit R-59.\n\n198.\n\nRespondent draws support from the Commission's position that the BIT and EC Treaty relate to the \"same subject matter\" in light of the purposes of both treaties, the content of the basic freedoms, the procedural protections offered (including the right to damages) and the significance of the Extra-EU BIT Cases. Claimant's preference for a narrow interpretation of \"same subject matter,\" by contrast, is rejected by the Commission.160\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 53-61.\n\n199.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that the Commission found no *explicit* statement of the Contracting Parties that the BIT should be terminated, but points out that the Commission did not focus on evidence of the Contracting Parties' intention that as of the date of accession EU law should govern investment protection as contained in the BIT.161\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 62-64.\n\n200.\n\nRespondent notes that the Commission did not examine in depth the question of incompatibility of the BIT and EU law. Nevertheless, Respondent concludes from the Commission's observations that \"in every case whereby an investor claiming the breach of the BIT is simultaneously entitled to claim a breach of the EC Treaty (TFEU), the parallel operation of both treaties is precluded. Due to the principle of supremacy, the exclusive jurisdiction of the EU courts and finally as consequence of the discriminatory effects of the BIT, the invocation of such an Arbitration Clause would therefore breach EU law.\"162\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 65-77.\n\n201.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Commission \"unambiguously expresses that from the perspective of EU law, the European legal norms automatically supersede any other national norms, including intra-EU international treaties, from the moment they conflict, with every intersection between intra-EU BITs and EU law having thus to be resolved in favour of EU law.\" The principle of supremacy also applies \"from the perspective of international law.\"163\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 93.\n\n202.\n\nRespondent notes the Commission rejects Claimant's stance on discrimination and on the principle of the uniform application and interpretation of EU law.164\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 94-101.\n\n203.\n\nFinally, Respondent is convinced that \"the Tribunal in the present case is facing the same circumstances and therefore should follow the example of the *MOX Plant* Tribunal and suspend the proceedings, if it does not find that it lacks jurisdiction to decide on the merits.\"165\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 117.\n\n*Claimant's Comments*\n---------------------\n\n204.\n\nClaimant highlights that the Commission unequivocally confirms that the BIT has \"not been implicitly terminated or suspended by virtue of Article 59(1) of the Vienna Convention\" and that this is consistent with the view already been expressed in *Eastern Sugar.*166\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 35.\n\n205.\n\nWith respect to inapplicability of the arbitration clause under Article 30 of the VCLT, Claimant considers the Commission's observations run contrary to ECJ jurisprudence and are internally inconsistent. Claimant suggests that the Commission's positions are \"induced by political doctrine rather than legal reasoning,\" citing as examples of opinionated statements the Commission's remarks that (i) intra-EU BITs are \"an anomaly within the EU internal market,\" and (ii) intra-EU BIT arbitrations conducted to date \"reveal mistrust in the courts of the EU Member States\" which has \"no place in the current post-enlargement context.\"167\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\n206.\n\nClaimant argues that questions of supremacy of EU law are only relevant *after* it is established that an incompatibility exists.\n\n207.\n\nClaimant describes the Commission's analysis with respect to discrimination as a basis of incompatibility as \"inconsistent\" and \"irreconcilable.\" On the one hand, the Commission notes that some investors will have the opportunity to resort to arbitration while others do not. On the other hand, the Commission states that the systems of enforcement of investor rights under the BIT and TFEU offer \"at least equivalent protection,\" and the Commission denies that arbitration is \"more efficient\" than redress before national courts. In any event, Claimant maintains that it is not the offer of arbitration that is discriminatory, but the refusal to grant a similar benefit to other EU investors.168 Claimant points out that the ECJ did not find discrimination in the Extra-EU BIT Cases. Claimant also notes as \"telling\" the fact that the Commission has never brought an infringement case against a Member State with an intra-EU BIT in place.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 15-17, citing ECJ jurisprudence on double taxation treaties and *Matteucci* case.\n\n208.\n\nClaimant also criticises the Commission's position on the competence of an arbitral tribunal to resolve EU law disputes as being \"devoid of reality.\" Claimant notes that numerous arbitral tribunals all over the EU render awards on a daily basis that involve the application of EU law, and such practice is fully accepted, even *mandated*, by the ECJ since the *Nordsee* case.169 According to Claimant, this long-standing ECJ case law is ignored by the Commission and runs contrary to the Commission's assertion of the \"exclusive competence of EU courts for claims which involve EU law.\"\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.\n\n209.\n\nClaimant distinguishes the *MOX Plant* case from the present case. *MOX Plant* was based on UNCLOS, a treaty that explicitly provides that dispute resolution procedures in regional treaties shall have precedence over those contained in UNCLOS. Further, the *MOX Plant* case was between two EU Member States, thus falling under TFEU Article 344, whereas the present case between a Member State and a private party falls under no such EU law provision. For these two reasons, *MOX Plant* should not be applied to suspend the proceedings in this arbitration. A suspension would in any event \"bring nothing but unacceptable delay.\"170\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 38.\n\n210.\n\nClaimant also observes that: (i) the Commission itself had advised Eureko to turn to arbitration;171 (ii) the Commission has advocated the use of investor-state arbitration in the context of extra-EU BITs and described it as an \"established feature\" of investment agreements essential to attracting investors;172 and (iii) the Commission's position would reduce intra-EU BITs to meaningless agreements between states that provide only unenforceable protections to private parties.173\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 28.\n\n211.\n\nFinally, Claimant complains that the Commission has neglected to fully inform the Tribunal of its views and status of the infringement proceedings. According to Claimant, the Commission's initial conclusion, expressed in a November formal notice, was that \"the Slovak Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the EC Treaty.\"174 In April 2010, the Commission completely reversed its position and informed Eureko that it intended to close the complaint procedure on the basis that EU law does *not apply* to Eureko's investment in the first place (because the freedom of establishment and freedom of movement of capital do not apply).175 According to its 7 July 2010 observations, however, the Commission is apparently now looking further into the facts of the infringement case and states that \"EU law is incontestably relevant to the dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal.\" Claimant considers these changes in position to be \"disconcerting\" and sufficient reason to reject the Commission's appeal to \"considerations of mutual respect and comity... between judicial institutions.\" Claimant is anxious that it will be left without a forum to recover damages if it is denied arbitration and at the same time is confronted by assertions from both the Commission and the Slovak Republic (in its 226-Reply) that its dispute is not covered by the EU legal system.176\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 31; Exhibit C-105.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 34; Exhibit C-106.\n\n**VI. RELIEF REQUESTED BY THE PARTIES**\n---------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Request for Relief*\n---------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nRespondent requests that the Tribunal find that it lacks jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n213.\n\nShould the Tribunal come to the conclusion that it has jurisdiction over the dispute or that it is not possible to properly assess its jurisdiction at this moment, the Tribunal should, according to Respondent, follow the European Commission's suggestion and suspend the proceedings until the European Commission and/or the ECJ have come to a decision on the EU law aspects of the infringement proceedings.177\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 118-19.\n\n214.\n\nRespondent further requests the Tribunal to dismiss Claimant's request for an interim costs award because Respondent has a legitimate right to file jurisdictional objections, and the Tribunal's decision on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection is of substantial importance.178\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00b6 150.\n\n*Claimant's Request for Relief*\n-------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal reject the Slovak Republic's jurisdictional arguments and also requests an interim award on costs in favour of Eureko.179\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 163; Jurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00b6 20; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 39.\n\n216.\n\nClaimant seeks an interim costs award because the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection was raised belatedly, is irreconcilable with earlier statements by the Slovak Republic, is inconsistent with accessible case law and literature, and can only be explained as a strategy to delay proceedings.180\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 12-16.\n\n**VII. ANALYSIS BY THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered carefully the submissions made by the Parties, as well as the observations of the Government of the Netherlands and of the European Commission, all of which were helpful and for all of which the Tribunal thanks their respective authors. All of the points made in those submissions have been taken into account by the Tribunal, even though it is not here necessary to address and decide in turn each and every one of these submissions and observations.\n\n218.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal wishes to emphasise that its decisions are here limited both by the requirements of this particular case and by the scope of the arguments presented by the Parties. This award is thus necessarily confined to the specific circumstances of the present case; and the Tribunal does not here intend to decide any general principles for other cases, however ostensibly analogous to this case they might be. For example, this case arises from a BIT concluded in 1991 before the CSFR Association Agreement, the Association Agreement and the Accession Treaty; it does not arise from a multi-lateral treaty or a treaty to which the EU is a party or signatory; and, moreover, these arbitration proceedings were instituted in 2008 before the Lisbon Treaty came into force, amending the EU Treaty and the EC Treaty (now the TFEU).\n\n219.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal must satisfy itself of the existence and extent of its jurisdiction. It considers that its jurisdiction is fixed by laws (as explained further below), and that such jurisdiction cannot here be created, continued or extended by arguments based on the possible operation of doctrines of acquiescence, waiver or estoppel in respect of acts or omissions of Respondent (or Claimant). In any event, the Tribunal has not found it necessary to rest any part of its decision upon the ostensible attitude of either Party to these arbitration proceedings - still less upon that of the Government of the Netherlands or of the European Commission - to the question of the status of the BIT or the existence, continuation or extent of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n220.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind, as a paramount factor relating to jurisdiction, that the Tribunal is established by, and derives its powers (if any) from, the consent of the Parties. That consent operates at two successive stages.\n\n221.\n\nThe first stage originates from the agreement between the Netherlands and the Slovak Republic in Article 8 of the BIT dated 29 April 1991 that investors of one Contracting Party181 have a right to submit disputes with the other Contracting Party before an arbitration tribunal. Article 8 (1) and (2) read as follows:\n\nArticle 8  \n (1) All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible, be settled amicably.  \n (2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement.\n\nAs defined in Article 1(b) of the BIT: viz., \"the term \u2018investors' shall comprise: i.e. natural persons having the nationality of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its law; ii. legal persons constituted under the law of one of the Contracting Parties.\"\n\n222.\n\nAs a matter of international law, those provisions constitute an offer which can be accepted by an investor. At this first stage, the Tribunal is concerned with the consent of the Netherlands and the Slovak Republic as expressed in Article 8 of the BIT, to be interpreted in accordance with international law and, in particular, the VCLT.\n\n223.\n\nThe second stage originates from the offer's acceptance by Claimant, as an investor and national of the Netherlands, here effected through the initiation of arbitral proceedings under Article 8 of the BIT. Upon such acceptance there is consent between the investor and the Contracting Party to submit to the jurisdiction of the tribunal constituted in accordance with the BIT, in respect of the dispute referred to it. Providing that all other conditions stipulated in the BIT, including those relating to such matters as the nationality of the investor, the six-month delay and the investment, have been met, the tribunal established in accordance with the BIT has at least *prima facie* jurisdiction over the dispute.182\n\nUnlike some BITs (such as the 1997 Germany-Philippines BIT, Article 9) the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT does not explicitly confine the right to initiate arbitration to the investor; but it is not necessary for the Tribunal to take a position on the effect of this and it does not do so. It is sufficient to determine that the investor has the right to initiate arbitration.\n\n224.\n\nThis second stage operates both under international law and, here, also under German law as the *lex loci arbitri* applying to UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings where the agreed place of arbitration is Frankfurt in the Federal Republic of Germany (within the meaning of Article 16 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and \u00a7 1043 of the German Arbitration Law, the Tenth Book of the German Code of Civil Procedure). As a result, this is a German arbitration; and this Tribunal is an *ad hoc* German arbitration tribunal subject to German law and not an international tribunal (such as an ICSID tribunal under the 1965 Washington Convention). Germany is a founding member of the EU; and German law includes, of course, EU law.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot derive any part of its jurisdiction or authority from EU law as such: its jurisdiction is derived from the consent of the Parties to the dispute, in accordance with the BIT and German law. Although EU law, as between the EU and member States of the EU (including Respondent and the Netherlands, but not Claimant), operates at the level of international law, EU law operates, as between the Parties, as part of German law as the *lex loci arbitri*.\n\n226.\n\nIt is, however, possible that the Parties' consent and the jurisdiction flowing from such consent might be circumscribed not only by the terms of the BIT itself but also both by international law applicable to the BIT and by provisions of German law incorporating EU law. Indeed, as explained above, the consent of the Parties can be or become qualified by the operation of legal provisions that lie outside the text of the BIT, whether at the first stage or second stage (or both).\n\n227.\n\nIn the present case, Respondent argues, in effect, that EU law operates in this way. EU law has, in Respondent's submission, displaced or rendered inapplicable the provisions of the BIT. Respondent also argues that the arbitration cannot proceed because the dispute is non-justiciable under German law as the *lex loci arbitri*... As further explained below, this latter argument depends upon the non-arbitrability of the dispute under EU law, as part of German law.183\n\nSee above, \u00b6\u00b6 143-145.\n\n228.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the proper framework for its analysis of these arguments is, in the first place, the framework applicable to the legal instrument from which the Tribunal derives its *prima facie* jurisdiction. Just as the Court of Justice of the European Communities has held that its own perspective is dictated by the treaties that established it,184 so the perspective of this Tribunal must begin with the instrument by which and the legal order within which consent originated, *i.e.*, the first stage described above. That framework is the BIT and international law, including applicable EU law.\n\nSee Cases C-402/05 P to C-415/05 P, *Yassin Abdullah Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation*, Judgment of 3 September 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 280-291.\n\n229.\n\nWhatever legal consequences may result from the application of EU law, those consequences must be applied by this Tribunal within the framework of the rules of international law and not in disregard of those rules. Those consequences may operate in a number of distinct ways. For example, EU law may affect the capacity of a State to consent to an international treaty, or may affect the performance of obligations under the treaty, or may be part of the law applicable to determine the scope of obligations under the treaty, or may affect the manner in which disputes arising under the treaty must be settled and the jurisdiction of tribunals established outside the EU legal order. These distinctions are important in the present case.\n\n230.\n\nRespondent puts forward its objections to jurisdiction under four broad headings:\n\nA. Termination of the BIT under Article 59 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\u2018VCLT')\n\nB. Inapplicability of the BIT under VCLT Article 30\n\nC. Inapplicability of the BIT under EU law\n\nD. Non-arbitrability of the dispute under German law\n\nIn addition, Respondent has made submissions concerning the proper relationship between this Tribunal and the institutions of the EU. These arguments and submissions are considered in turn in the following paragraphs.\n\n**A. Termination of the BIT under Article 59 of the Vienna Convention**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nRespondent has been a State Party to the VCLT since 28 May 1993; and the Netherlands since 9 April 1985.185 While the VCLT does not apply retrospectively, it is widely regarded as reflecting customary international law. Respondent has argued on the basis of the provisions of the VCLT, and neither Party has suggested that the rules set out in the provisions which it discusses are not applicable to the BIT.\n\nSee above, note 11.\n\n232.\n\nVCLT Article 59 provides for the termination of treaties. It is convenient to set it out in full at this point:\n\n*Article 59. Termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty*\n\n1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject matter and:\n\n(a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or\n\n(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.\n\n2. The earlier treaty shall be considered as only suspended in operation if it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that such was the intention of the parties.\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the submission that the BIT has been terminated in accordance with the rules set out in VCLT Article 59. There are three main reasons for this decision.\n\n234.\n\nThe first main reason is that the operation of VCLT Article 59 is subject to the provisions of VCLT Article 65 (\"Procedure to be followed with respect to invalidity, termination, withdrawal from or suspension of the operation of a treaty\"). VCLT Article 65(1) - (3) read as follows:\n\n*Article 65. Procedure to be followed with respect to invalidity, termination, withdrawal from or* *suspension of the operation of a treaty*  \n 1. A party which, under the provisions of the present Convention, invokes either a defect in its consent to be bound by a treaty or a ground for impeaching the validity of a treaty, terminating it, withdrawing from it or suspending its operation, must notify the other parties of its claim. The notification shall indicate the measure proposed to be taken with respect to the treaty and the reasons therefor.  \n 2. If, after the expiry of a period which, except in cases of special urgency, shall not be less than three months after the receipt of the notification, no party has raised any objection, the party making the notification may carry out in the manner provided in article 67 the measure which it has proposed.  \n 3. If, however, objection has been raised by any other party, the parties shall seek a solution through the means indicated in article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\n235.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, it is therefore clear from the text of the VCLT that the invalidity or termination of a treaty must be invoked, according to the Article 65 procedure. The VCLT186 does not provide for the automatic termination of treaties by operation of law (with the exception of treaties that conflict with rules of *jus*  *cogens*).187\n\nThe Tribunal observes that this interpretation of the clear meaning of the text is supported by the terms of the ILC Commentary on the draft of VCLT article 65 (then numbered article 62): see: http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/1\\_1\\_1966.pdf at pp. 261-3.\n\nSee VCLT, arts. 53, 64. Neither party has suggested that questions of *jus cogens* are engaged in this case.\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal does not regard Respondent's e-mail dated 5 April 2004188 as a notification for the purposes of VCLT Article 65. That e-mail was phrased as a request to be told the \"unofficial position\" of the addressees on Respondent's proposal to initiate a common procedure to \"harmonize\" BITs. It was not a notification to the Netherlands that Respondent regarded the BIT as terminated. Moreover, the e-mail appears not to have been followed up by Respondent.\n\nExhibit R-46. See above, \u00b6\u00b6 90, 94.\n\n237.\n\nVCLT Article 65(5) provides that:\n\n5. Without prejudice to article 45,189 the fact that a State has not previously made the notification prescribed in paragraph 1 shall not prevent it from making such notification in answer to another party claiming performance of the treaty or alleging its violation.\n\nVCLT, art. 45 reads as follows: *\"Article 45. Loss of a right to invoke a ground for invalidating, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty*... A State may no longer invoke a ground for invalidating, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty under articles 46 to 50 or articles 60 and 62 if, after becoming aware of the facts: (a) it shall have expressly agreed that the treaty is valid or remains in force or continues in operation, as the case may be; or (b) it must by reason of its conduct be considered as having acquiesced in the validity of the treaty or in its maintenance in force or in operation, as the case may be.\" Article 45 is not applicable in the present case.\n\n238.\n\nIn the present case it is not \"another party\" to the treaty that is alleging its violation. Claimant is not a party to the BIT, which was concluded by the Netherlands and (via the initial ratification by Czechoslovakia) the Slovak Republic, now Respondent. It is, however, not necessary for the Tribunal to decide whether VCLT Article 65(5) would permit Respondent to give a notification of invalidity in answer to a request for arbitration made by an investor under the BIT, because the Tribunal considers that in any event the other conditions for the application (and hence the invocation under Article 65) of VCLT Article 59 are not met.\n\n239.\n\nThe second main reason for dismissing this objection to jurisdiction is that the application of VCLT Article 59 is expressly limited to situations where there are successive treaties \"relating to the same subject-matter.\" (see Article 59(1) cited above). The same phrase appears in VCLT Article 30 in a different context; but while the notion of \"sameness\" may be common to those two instances, the manner in which the overlap between the treaties is approached is manifestly not common. This is evident from the roles accorded by the VCLT to Articles 30 and 59.\n\n240.\n\nArticle 59 is concerned only with the termination of *the entire treaty*... Article 30, in contrast, is concerned with the priority between *particular provisions* of earlier and later treaties relating to the same subject-matter.190 While Article 30 is, therefore, focused on particular provisions, the question under Article 59 is whether the entire treaty should be terminated by reason of the adoption of a later treaty relating to the same subject-matter. The very fact that these situations are treated separately in the VCLT points to the need under Article 59 for a broader overlap between the earlier and later treaties than would be needed to trigger the application of Article 30.\n\nThis point was explained by the ILC in its Commentary on the draft of article 59 (then numbered article 56): see http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/1\\_1\\_1966.pdf, at pp. 252-3 (paragraph 4).\n\n241.\n\nThis conclusion is borne out by a comparison of the terms of Article 30 and Article 59. Under Article 30 the test is whether the two successive treaty provisions are \"compatible.\" Under Article 59 the test is whether the provisions of the later treaty are \"so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.\" Article 30 may be triggered by the slightest incompatibility between the provisions of the earlier and later treaties. Article 59 clearly requires a broader incompatibility between the two treaties.\n\n242.\n\nNothing in Article 59 requires that the two treaties should be in all respects coextensive; but the later treaty must have more than a minor or incidental overlap with the earlier treaty. In any event, it is also necessary, as Article 59 expressly stipulates, that either (a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended the later treaty to govern the subject-matter or (b) the provisions of the treaties that relate to the subject-matter are so far incompatible as to preclude the concurrent application of the two treaties. One or other limb of that test must be satisfied if VCLT Article 59 is to operate.\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that while test (b) requires incompatibility between treaty provisions, test (a) does not. Test (a) would apply even in circumstances where successive treaties contain identical provisions. The result would be that it is the provisions in the later treaty that govern. That may be significant for questions of jurisdiction that turn upon the date of the governing instrument, for example.\n\n244.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal does not consider that either of the two tests is met. As far as an intention that the later treaty should \"govern the matter\" is concerned, it is plainly established that the Parties to the BIT - Respondent and the Netherlands -subsequently intended that EU law should apply in full between them. There is, however, no evidence of any intention that the provisions of EU law should result in the termination of the entire BIT. Nothing in the text of the EU treaties produces that result; and the necessary intention is not established by extraneous evidence. Indeed, such evidence as there is indicates that there was no or, at least, no clear intention that the BIT should be terminated by any of the CSFR Association Agreement, the Association Agreement, the Accession Treaty or the Lisbon Treaty.\n\n245.\n\nMoreover, the BIT establishes extensive legal rights and duties that are neither duplicated in EU law nor incompatible with EU law. The protections afforded to investors by the BIT are, at least potentially, broader than those available under EU law (or, indeed, under the laws of any EU Member State). Those rights and duties are central to the purpose of the BIT. This, too, indicates that no intention that EU law should entirely displace the BIT can be inferred.\n\n246.\n\nThe claims in this case are made under Articles 3(1) (fair and equitable treatment; non-discrimination), Article 3(2) (full protection and security; non-discrimination), Article 4 (free transfer of profits and dividends), and Article 5 (expropriation), pursuant to Article 8 (investor-state arbitration) of the BIT.191\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 IV.\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Respondent provided the following summary of its submissions on the equivalence between the provisions of the BIT and the provisions of the EC Treaty:192\n\n**BIT - EC LAW**\n\nFree transfer of capital (Art 4) - Free movement of capital (Art 56, 58)\n\nFair and equitable treatment (Art 3-1) - Prohibition of discrimination (Art 12)\n\nFull security and protection (Art 3-2) - Freedom of establishment (Art 43, 56)\n\nIndirect expropriation (Art 5) - Freedom of establishment (Art 43, 56)\n\nArbitration Clause (Art 8) - Damage claim against the state before national courts\n\nRespondent's e-mail dated 21 April 2010.\n\n248.\n\nThe question of the relationship between free transfer of capital under a BIT and free movement of capital under EU law arose in the *Extra-EU BIT* cases. The European Court of Justice held in those cases that the BIT \"free transfer\" provisions might be a bar to limitations on free movement of capital imposed under EU law, which EU Member States would be obliged to implement, and that the compatibility of the BIT with EU law could not be ensured. The Court considered that there was no adequate mechanism under international law that would allow an EU Member State to derogate from its BIT obligations in respect of the free movement of capital in order to fulfil its obligations under EU law.\n\n249.\n\nThe situation in the present case is different. The situation would not be one in which the EU State sought to invoke its internal law (including EU law) against an investor from a non-EU State in order to derogate from its BIT obligations.193 In the present case, both the EU State and the investor from another EU State would be subject to the same provisions of EU law. It is, accordingly, at least arguable that there is no incompatibility between the BIT and EU law on this point. The Tribunal does, however, accept that it is at least arguable that there is a duplication of rights to free movement of capital, which exist both under the BIT and under EU law. Nonetheless, that fact cannot determine the question of jurisdiction here because the Tribunal considers that the other material BIT provisions are not duplicated in EU law, quite apart from Article 8 of the BIT.\n\nThe Tribunal takes no position on the question whether such a plea should succeed.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the submission that the protection afforded by the BIT provision on fair and equitable treatment is entirely covered by a prohibition on discrimination. Respondent does not allege that there is any principle of EU law that specifically forbids treatment that is not fair and equitable. The Tribunal does not consider that any such principle, independent of concepts of non-discrimination, proportionality, legitimate expectation and of procedural fairness, is yet established in EU law.194\n\nCf. The Tridimas, *The General Principles of EU Law*, (2nd ed. 2006).\n\n251.\n\nTreatment might be unfair and inequitable even if it is imposed on everyone regardless of nationality or, indeed, of any other distinguishing characteristic.195 A flat-rate corporation tax might be an example.196 Respondent accepted that such a measure might be prohibited by the BIT but permitted by EU law.197 That possibility precludes an *a priori* determination that every claim of a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard must fall within the scope of a prohibition on discrimination. Similar hypothetical examples can readily be imagined that relate to other principles of EU law.\n\nSee, e.g., *S D Myers v. Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award on Jurisdiction of 13 November 2000, \u00b6 259, available at: http://www.naftalaw.org/Disputes/Canada/SDMyers/SDMyersMeritsAward.pdf (\"The \u2018minimum standard' is a floor below which treatment of foreign investors must not fall, even if a government were not acting in a discriminatory manner.\"). Cf., *LG&E Energy Corp. v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1 (USA-Argentina BIT), Decision on Liability of 3 October 2006, \u00b6 162, available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/ARB021\\_LGE-Decision-on-Liability-en.pdf (\"characterizing the measures as not arbitrary does not mean that such measures are characterized as fair and equitable.\").\n\nSee above, \u00b6 119.\n\nSee above, \u00b6 119.\n\n252.\n\nIt cannot, therefore, be assumed (as the first test in VCLT Article 59 requires) that EU law is so comprehensive and legally certain as to have been impliedly intended to govern this question. It cannot be assumed that the Parties intended that a right so central to the purpose of the BIT would be displaced by the narrower and more loosely defined rights accorded by EU law.\n\n253.\n\nRespondent argues that this hypothetical situation, where an action that would violate the BIT is permitted by EU law, is a clear example of incompatibility between the BIT and EU law. Incompatibility is a matter to be considered under test (b) in VCLT Article 59. Respondent said that incompatibility occurs when one act is permissible under one law, but not permissible under the other. The Tribunal does not share that view.\n\n254.\n\nArticle 59 is concerned with situations where \"provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.\" That could only arise in the hypothetical situation if the Member State had either a legally-protected right under EU law or a legal duty under EU law to impose the flat-rate tax. It would not arise where, because no law forbade it, the State simply had the freedom to impose such a tax if it so chose. True, the BIT obligation would prevent the State from enjoying its freedom under EU law to impose a flat-rate tax: but all treaty obligations consist in the fettering of a State's freedom to act.\n\n255.\n\nAccordingly, in the view of the Tribunal the fair and equitable treatment provision in the BIT does not fall under either limb of the test set out in VCLT Article 59.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal has focused on the scope of the protections afforded by the BIT and by EU law, rather than on the question whether on the facts of this particular case the claim based on the fair and equitable treatment provision could be raised under EU law. There are several reasons for this focus.\n\n257.\n\nAs discussed further below, the question here is one of jurisdiction; and the extent to which either the BIT or EU law covers the claim cannot be answered until the merits of the case have been considered.\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers that the question of overlap and incompatibility must, under VCLT Article 59, relate to the same legal relationship. Thus, a treaty provision guaranteeing non-discrimination does not have, even indirectly, the \"same subject-matter\" as a treaty provision guaranteeing fair and equitable treatment, even if on the facts of a particular case a claim might be raised under either provision and the claimant might be able to recover compensation for the entire loss under either provision. In this respect the notion of the same \"subject-matter\" has certain common features with the notions of \"identity\" that operate in the context of the doctrine of *res judicata*.\n\n259.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision in relation to the fair and equitable treatment provision in the BIT alone is sufficient to dismiss Respondent's submission that all BIT claims are covered by provisions of EU law. It is enough that one such claim made by the Claimant does not necessarily lie within the scope of the protections afforded by EU law to conclude that the BIT offers protections wider than those afforded by EU law. The fair and equitable treatment claim, however, is not the only claim that is not wholly covered by EU law.\n\n260.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal the BIT right to \"full protection and security\" is not exhausted by the rights flowing from the freedom of establishment under EU law. The right to full protection and security subsists for as long as the investment remains in place, no matter how long after it has been established and no matter whether or not the treatment complained of is discriminatory. While the freedom of establishment under EU law entails various ancillary rights, the Tribunal does not consider that those rights cover the entire ground that the right to full protection and security might be said to cover.198\n\nCf. Case C-186/87, *Ian William Cowan v, Tr\u00e9sor Public* 2 February 1989, [1989] ECR 00195 \u00a717 and see generally European Commission, *Guide to the Case Law of the European Court of Justice on Articles 43 et seq. EC Treaty: Freedom of Establishment* (2001).\n\n261.\n\nSimilarly, the protection in Article 5 of the BIT against expropriation is by no means covered by the EU freedom of establishment. While it certainly overlaps with the right to property secured by Article 17 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (and the First Protocol to the ECHR, as applied under EU law), the BIT provision on expropriation is not obviously co-extensive with it. Both the considerable body of jurisprudence on indirect takings that has emerged in the context of BITs, and also the fact that the BIT protects \"assets\" and \"investments\" rather than the arguably narrower concepts of \"possessions\" and \"property\" protected by the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights, give rise to the possibility of wider protection under the BIT than is enjoyed under EU law.\n\n262.\n\nThus, EU law does not provide substantive rights for investors that extend as far as those provided by the BIT. There are rights that may be asserted under the BIT that are not secured by EU law. Consequently, it cannot be said that it is implicit in the text of the EC Treaties that Respondent and the Netherlands intended that it should supplant the BIT.\n\n263.\n\nNor can it be said that the provisions of the BIT are incompatible with EU law. The rights to fair and equitable treatment, to full protection and security, and to protection against expropriation at least, extend beyond the protections afforded by EU law; and there is no reason why those rights should not be fulfilled and upheld in addition to the rights protected by EU law.\n\n264.\n\nThe third main reason for rejecting the jurisdictional challenge based on VCLT Article 59 may be stated simply. An essential characteristic of an investor's rights under the BIT is the right to initiate UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings against a State party (as the host State) under Article 8 of the BIT. Such a consensual arbitration under well-established arbitration rules adopted by the United Nations, in a neutral place and with a neutral appointing authority, cannot be equated simply with the legal right to bring legal proceedings before the national courts of the host state; and, moreover, the *locus standi* of an investor under the BIT, with its broad definition of \"indirect\" investments under Article 1, is unlikely to be replicated under the court procedures of an EU Member State.\n\n265.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent's submission that the BIT provisions have been displaced by EU law as a result of the principle set out in Article 59 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n266.\n\nThe consequence is that in any particular case investors protected by the BIT may have wider rights than those given under the substantive provisions of EU law to investors of (other) EU Member States. Affording such wider protection to those investors while not affording it to investors of other EU States may violate EU law prohibitions on discrimination. But that is not a reason for cancelling Claimant's wider rights under the BIT. More significantly, it is still less a reason for treating the Parties' consent to these arbitration proceedings as invalid or otherwise ineffective, particularly where the first stage of such consent pre-dated the relevant EU Treaties, the second stage pre-dated the Lisbon Treaty, and Claimant is an EU investor.\n\n267.\n\nThere is moreover no reason, legal or practical, why an EU Member State should not accord to investors of all other EU Member States rights equivalent to those which the State has bound itself to accord to investors of its EU bilateral investment treaty partners - or, indeed, to investors from States that are not members of the EU. Certainly, it is not for an arbitral tribunal to cancel rights created by a valid treaty in order to safeguard a State party against the possibility that it might one day decide to apply the treaty in a way that could violate its obligations under one or more other later treaties.\n\n**B. Inapplicability of the BIT under VCLT Article 30**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nRespondent's argument that the provisions of the BIT are inapplicable because of the operation of the rules set out in VCLT Article 30 can be dealt with briefly.\n\n269.\n\nVCLT Article 30 is concerned with situations of incompatibility between particular provisions in successive treaties. In so far as it is relevant, it reads as follows:\n\n*Article 30. Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter*\n\n1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.\n\n2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.\n\n3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the latter treaty.\"\n\n270.\n\nArticle 30(1) refers to the provision of Article 103 of the UN Charter which gives obligations arising under the Charter priority over other treaty obligations. It is not relevant in this case. Article 30(2) deals with situations where there is an express provision governing relations between successive treaties. There is no such provision in this case. Article 30(3) is the material provision for the present case.\n\n271.\n\nIt has already been explained that in the view of the Tribunal there is no incompatibility in circumstances where an obligation under the BIT can be fulfilled by Respondent without violating EU law. That conclusion is not affected by the principles of supremacy, direct effect or direct application of EU law.\n\n272.\n\nMore importantly, it is difficult to see how Article 30 could deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction based upon the Parties' consent derived from Article 8 of the BIT (whether operating the first stage, second stage or both), even if there may be circumstances in which a true incompatibility between the BIT and EU law arises. Any such incompatibility would be a question of the effect of EU law as part of the applicable law and, as such, a matter for the merits and not jurisdiction.\n\n273.\n\nThe one exception would be if Article 8 of the BIT, which provides for arbitration between the investor and the State, were by itself incompatible with EU law. It could not be incompatible when the BIT was made; but it might be argued that it is incompatible with the CSFR Association Agreement, the Association Agreement, the Accession Treaty or the Lisbon Treaty. If that were so, that would, at least arguably, deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.\n\n274.\n\nThere is, however, no rule of EU law that prohibits investor-State arbitration. Far from it: transnational arbitration is a commonplace throughout the EU, including arbitrations between legal persons and States; and the European Court of Justice has given several indications of how questions of EU law should be handled in the course of arbitrations, including important questions of public policy.199 It cannot be asserted that all arbitrations that involve any question of EU law are conducted in violation of EU law. The argument that the availability of arbitration for some but not all EU investors would amount to discrimination in violation of EU law200 was addressed above, where it was decided that the answer is to extend rights and not to cancel them.\n\nFor example, *Eco Swiss.*\n\nSee above, note 109.\n\n275.\n\nThe fact that there might be remedies available to the Claimant in national courts through *Francovich* procedures does not alter the position. One of the central purposes of arbitration is to provide the disputing parties, by their consent, with an alternative to proceedings in national courts. Moreover, an arbitration clause in a BIT is specifically included to address the substantive protections afforded to investors under the BIT.\n\n276.\n\nReference was made to the ruling of the ECJ in the *MOX Plant* case, that by virtue of Article 344 TFEU (ex Article 292 TEC) and the principle of loyalty the ECJ had exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between two Member States. Whatever the implications of that ruling might be for Article 10 of the BIT, which is concerned with disputes between the BIT Contracting Parties, the ruling is not applicable to disputes under Article 8, which are not disputes between Contracting Parties but investor-State disputes. There is no suggestion here that every dispute that arises between a Member State and an individual must be put before the ECJ; nor would the ECJ have the jurisdiction (let alone the capacity) to decide all such cases.\n\n277.\n\nThe argument that Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with EU law is therefore unsustainable. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent's submission that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the BIT provisions have been disapplied by EU law as a result of the principle set out in Article 30 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n**C. Inapplicability of the BIT under EU Law**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nRespondent's third line of argument is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because, as a matter of EU law, EU law has direct effect and prevails over both national law and international treaties, and because only the European Court of Justice can interpret EU law.\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept this argument. EU law may have a bearing upon the scope of rights and obligations under the BIT in the present case, by virtue of its role as part of the applicable law under BIT Article 8(6) and German law as the *lex loci* *arbitri*... But that is a question for the merits stage, not a question that goes to jurisdiction.\n\n280.\n\nThe only basis - beyond the arguments already discussed in relation to VCLT Articles 30 and 59 - on which the Tribunal might arguably be deprived of jurisdiction on the basis of the status of EU law is that the Tribunal needs to consider and apply EU law in order to decide the present case and yet is entirely precluded from considering and applying any such EU law by the Parties' consent derived from Article 8 of the BIT or German law.\n\n281.\n\nEven assuming, for the sake of argument, that the questions that the Tribunal will need to address might be identified accurately prior to the merits stage, and that they include questions of EU law, that proposition is unsustainable. Indeed, the Tribunal considers it the opposite of the truth. Far from being precluded from considering and applying EU law the Tribunal is bound to apply it to the extent that it is part of the applicable law(s), whether under BIT Article 8, German law or otherwise.\n\n282.\n\nThe argument that the ECJ has an \"interpretative monopoly\" and that the Tribunal therefore cannot consider and apply EU law, is incorrect. The ECJ has no such monopoly. Courts and arbitration tribunals throughout the EU interpret and apply EU law daily. What the ECJ has is a monopoly on the final and authoritative interpretation of EU law: but that is quite different. Moreover, even final courts are not obliged to refer questions of the interpretation of EU law to the ECJ in all cases. The *acte clair* doctrine is well-established in EU law.201\n\nSee Case C-283/81, *Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v. Ministry of Health,* Judgment of 6 October 1982, [1982] ECR I-03415.\n\n283.\n\nThe fact that, at the merits stage, the Tribunal might have to consider and apply provisions of EU law does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction. The Tribunal can consider and apply EU law, if required, both as a matter of international law and as a matter of German law. This jurisdictional objection therefore is rejected.\n\n**D. Non-Arbitrability of the Dispute under German Law**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nRespondent's argument, based upon the alleged non-arbitrability of the dispute under German law, turns upon the proposition that the dispute is outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by virtue of EU law and that German law as the *lex loci arbitri* must therefore treat the dispute as non-arbitrable.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that EU law does not deprive it of jurisdiction; and accordingly, as already indicated above, the jurisdictional objection based on German law must also fail *in limine*.\n\n**E. Relationship between the Tribunal and EU Institutions**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nSubmissions were made on the question of the proper relationship between this Tribunal and EU institutions. The Tribunal understands that there is a relationship between them and that, like all courts and tribunals in the EU, it must take proper account of that relationship.\n\n287.\n\nThe Tribunal is bound by Article 8(6) of the BIT, which stipulates that:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively:\n\n\u2022 the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n\u2022 the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n\u2022 the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;\n\n\u2022 the general principles of international law.\n\n288.\n\nThe question of the content of EU law and its role in the present case is one for the merits stage, as decided above.\n\n289.\n\nWithout prejudice to arguments that might be raised at that stage, the Tribunal considers that in principle EU law appears to fall within the scope of the first two and the last of these bullet points (\"the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned\"; \"other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties\" and as part of \"the general principles of international law\"). Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that in principle the EU legal doctrines, including those of supremacy, precedence, direct effect, direct applicability, are part of the body of EU law that might fall to be applied by the Tribunal in this case under Article 8(6) of the BIT.\n\n290.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal notes that its jurisdiction is confined to ruling upon alleged breaches of the BIT. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to rule on alleged breaches of EU law as such. The manner and extent to which that clear and fixed limitation on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal may impact upon the cases presented by the Parties will become clear at the merits stage and will be addressed at that stage.\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal's findings, set out above, leave it in no doubt that it has jurisdiction in this case and that it can and, by virtue of its mandate, should exercise it in this case.\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered whether it would be appropriate to suspend these arbitration proceedings until the EU Commission and/or the ECJ have come to a decision on the EU law aspects of the infringement case. While the Tribunal wishes to organise its proceedings with full regard for considerations of mutual respect and comity as regards other courts and institutions, it does not consider that the questions in issue in the infringement case are so far coextensive with the claims in the present case that it is appropriate to suspend its proceedings now. Should it become evident at a later stage that the relationship between the two sets of proceedings is so close as to be a cause of procedural unfairness or serious inefficiency, the Tribunal will reconsider the question of suspension.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n293.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DISMISSES the \"Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection\" advanced by Respondent and decides that it has jurisdiction over the dispute;\n\n(b) REJECTS Respondent's request to suspend the proceedings until the European Commission and/or the ECJ have come to a decision on the EU law aspects of the infringement proceedings;\n\n(c) RESERVES all questions concerning the merits, costs, fees and expenses, including the Parties' costs of legal representation, for subsequent determination; and\n\n(d) INVITES the Parties to confer regarding the procedural calendar for the merits phase of the arbitration, and to report to the Tribunal in this respect within 14 days of receipt of this Award."}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2012-12-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**LIST OF DEFINED TERMS**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Term** | **Definition** |\n| 2004 Liberalisation (or 2004 Reform) | See \"2004 Reform\" below |\n| 2004 Reform (or 2004 Liberalisation) | The series of legislative changes to the legal framework governing the health insurance market in the Slovak Republic, introduced by the Slovak Government in 2004, principally in Act No. 580/2004 Coll. and Act No. 581/2004 Coll. |\n| 2007 Reforms | The series of legislative changes to the legal framework governing the health insurance market in the Slovak Republic, introduced by the Slovak Government between 2006 and 2009 (principally in 2006 and 2007); identified variously by the Parties as the \"2007 Reversal\" or the \"2006 Stabilisation\" |\n| amended network requirement | Amendment of Act No. 578/2004 Coll. by Act No. 653/2007 Coll. and amendment of Decree 751/2004 Coll. by Decree 504/2007 Coll. and adoption of Decree No. 640/2008 Coll., relating to the network of healthcare providers contracted with by health insurance companies; also identified by the Parties as the \"Minimum Network Provision\" |\n| Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension | *Eureko B.V. v.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Claimant**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nClaimant in this arbitration is Achmea B.V., a Dutch private company with limited liability, having its statutory seat in Amsterdam and its head offices in Zeist, the Netherlands. Claimant was previously known as \"Eureko B.V.,\" until it changed its name through an amendment of the articles of association of Eureko B.V. that was executed at the occasion of the merger between Eureko B.V. and Achmea Holding N.V. on 18 November 2011 (Eureko B.V. being the surviving entity in that merger). Throughout the relevant period of events underlying the claim, Claimant was known as \"Eureko\" and, for convenience, the Tribunal will refer to Claimant as \" **Eureko** \" or \" **Claimant** \" throughout this Award.\n\n2.\n\nThe group of companies headed by Eureko is a financial services group that offers a range of insurance products internationally, including health insurance, life and non-life insurance, pension products, asset management and banking. Eureko operates in the Slovak Republic through two companies: (i) Union poist\u2019ovna a.s. (\" **Union Insurance** \"), incorporated in 1991 by the Government of the Slovak Republic and privatised in 1992, in which Eureko acquired shares in 1997; and (ii) Union zdravotn\u00e1 poist\u2019ovna, a.s (\" **Union Healthcare** \"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eureko incorporated in 2006 and funded by Eureko.1 This arbitration primarily concerns Eureko's investment in Union Healthcare.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6II.2, 4-12.\n\n3.\n\nEureko is represented in this arbitration by Mr Marnix Leijten, Mr Albert Marsman, and Mr Igor Zubov of De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V., Claude Debussylaan 80, 1082 MD Amsterdam, the Netherlands; and by Mr Ren\u00e9 Visser of Achmea B.V.\n\n**B. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Slovak Republic (\" **Slovak Republic** \" or \" **Respondent** \") is a sovereign State, formerly a part of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. It gained independence on 1 January 1993 and acceded to the European Union (\" **EU** \") on 1 May 2004. The Slovak Republic is a multiparty parliamentary democracy, with executive power lying with the government headed by a Prime Minister.2\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6II.16-22.\n\n5.\n\nRespondent is represented in this arbitration by Ms Andrea Hol\u00edkov\u00e1 of the Slovak Republic Ministry of Finance, Stefanovicova 5, 817 82 Bratislava, the Slovak Republic; and by Dr Martin Maisner, Mr Milos Ol\u00edk, Mr David Fyrbach, Mr Martin Subrt and Mr Ludovit Mi\u010dinsk\u00fd of Rowan Legal s.r.o., N\u00e1mestie slobody 11, 811 06 Bratislava, the Slovak Republic.\n\n**C. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n6.\n\nClaimant initiated this arbitration on the basis of claims that the Slovak Republic has violated the 1992 Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (\" **Treaty** \" or \" **BIT** \").3\n\nSigned on 29 April 1991, entered into force on 1 October 1992 (Exhibit C-10).\n\n7.\n\nClaimant complains that various legislative measures introduced by Respondent after a change in government in July 2006 constituted a systematic reversal of the 2004 liberalisation of the Slovak health insurance market that had prompted Eureko to invest in the Slovak Republic's health insurance sector. According to Claimant, these actions effectively destroyed the value of Eureko's investment. Claimant characterises the measures as constituting an unlawful indirect expropriation of its investment in Union Healthcare, in breach of **Article 5** of the BIT. Claimant further alleges that Respondent's conduct amounts to a violation of the BIT's standards of protection contained in its provisions on (i) fair and equitable treatment including as to non-discrimination (**Article 3(1)** of the BIT), (ii) non-impairment by discriminatory or unreasonable measures (Article 3(1) of the BIT), (iii) full protection and security (**Article 3(2)** of the BIT), and (iv) free transfer of profits and dividends (**Article 4** of the BIT).4 Claimant seeks, *inter alia*, compensation in the vicinity of \u20ac65 million, or any other lower or higher amount of damages that the Tribunal considers as appropriate, as well as interest, tax and all costs of the proceedings.5 Claimant also considers Respondent's position in this arbitration irreconcilable with developments that have taken place in the Slovak Republic since 2010 (see below at paragraph 117ff).\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6IV; Memorial on Damages, \u00b6V.1.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b610; Claimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6V.2; Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6342; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6277; Memorial on Damages, \u00b6V.1.\n\n8.\n\nThe Slovak Republic denies that it has expropriated Eureko's investment or otherwise violated any obligation\u2014international or otherwise\u2014purportedly owed to Eureko, that any of Eureko's claims are viable as a matter of fact or law, and that Eureko has suffered any cognizable damages or injury. Respondent asserts that it has complied fully with all applicable international legal requirements.6 Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to dismiss all claims made by Claimant and to declare that Respondent (a) has not breached the BIT; and (b) has not interfered with Claimant's investment. Respondent further requests the Tribunal to award Respondent costs.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b61, 2, 128; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b62, 672.\n\n9.\n\nThe Slovak Republic also initially challenged the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the dispute. A preliminary phase of these proceedings dealt exclusively with Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on the Slovak Republic's membership of the EU. In essence, Respondent had argued that, as a matter of international law, EU law, Slovak law and German law, the accession of the Slovak Republic to the EU in May 2004 terminated the BIT or rendered its arbitration clause inapplicable, and that accordingly this Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute (the \" **Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection** \"). On 26 October 2010, the Tribunal issued its Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension dismissing the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, confirming that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the dispute, and declining to suspend the proceedings until the European Commission and/or the European Court of Justice (the \" **ECJ** \") came to a decision on EU law aspects of related alleged infringement proceedings.\n\n10.\n\nIn May 2011, the Parties agreed that the remainder of the proceedings would be addressed within a single phase addressing both liability and quantum arguments. Accordingly this Award addresses Respondent's remaining objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, Respondent's alleged violations of the Treaty, and the damage allegedly suffered by Claimant as a result of such violations.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThis Tribunal's Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension of 26 October 2010 recounts in detail the procedural history of the arbitration from its commencement up until the date that Award was issued.7 This Part of the Award recalls key procedural details from the early phase of the proceedings and summarises developments in the proceedings since October 2010.\n\n*Eureko B.V. v. Slovak Republic*, PCA Case No. 2008-13, Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension (\" **Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension** \"), 26 October 2010, available at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag\\_id=1414, \u00b6\u00b610-42.\n\n**A. Commencement of the Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nPursuant to Article 8 of the Treaty and Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Eureko sent a Notice of Arbitration to Respondent on 1 October 2008, which Respondent received on 3 October 2008.\n\n13.\n\nArticle 8 of the Treaty provides in the relevant parts as follows:\n\n(1) All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement.\n\n[...]\n\n(4) The arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure applying the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n(5) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively:\n\n\u2022 the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n\u2022 the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n\u2022 the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;\n\n\u2022 the general principles of international law.\n\n[...]\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal, Language and Place of Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Professor Albert Jan van den Berg (appointed by Claimant on 17 October 2008), Mr V.V. Veeder (appointed by Respondent on 6 May 2009, as substitute for Judge Peter Tomka who resigned on 7 April 2009), and Professor Vaughan Lowe (appointed as Presiding Arbitrator on 20 December 2008).\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Parties signed Terms of Appointment on 5 March 2009, confirming the constitution of the Tribunal and designating the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\" **PCA** \") to act as registry in the arbitration. It was agreed that the language of the proceedings would be English.8\n\nTerms of Appointment, \u00b6\u00b63, 5 and 11.\n\n16.\n\nOn 19 March 2009, following a preliminary procedural hearing in The Hague, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1**, determining among other things, Frankfurt, Germany to be the place (seat) of the arbitration, while reserving the Tribunal's right to conduct hearings and meetings at any location considered appropriate.9\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, \u00b61\n\n**C. Preliminary Jurisdictional Phase**\n---------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Claimant filed its **Statement of Claim**, with accompanying exhibits, on 16 June 2009.\n\n18.\n\nRespondent filed its **Statement of Defence**, with accompanying exhibits, on 30 October 2009. In addition to rejecting Claimant's claims on the merits, Respondent asserted that Eureko had not presented sufficient facts to establish either jurisdiction *ratione personae* or *ratione materiae*.10 Respondent also introduced the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection.11\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6125-126.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6119-124.\n\n19.\n\nOn 3 December 2009, following a teleconference with the Parties, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2**. In Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal decided to hold a preliminary jurisdictional phase dedicated to Respondent's Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, and set a schedule for the Parties' submissions, for requests for document disclosure and for a hearing on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection. It was decided that no action needed to be taken on the question of jurisdiction *ratione personae,* and that document production would take place on the question of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* (relating, *inter alia*, to the objective criteria of an \"investment\" and Claimant's compliance with Slovak law). The Tribunal also noted that there had been no agreement between the Parties on any form of consolidation of the hearings in this case with those in other pending cases against the Slovak Republic in which similar issues might arise.\n\n20.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Respondent submitted its Memorial on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection on 29 January 2010 (\" **Jurisdiction Memorial** \") and Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection on 26 February 2010 (\" **Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial** \"). Respondent submitted its Reply on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection on 23 March 2010 (\" **Jurisdiction Reply** \") and Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection on 16 April 2010 (\" **Jurisdiction Rejoinder** \").\n\n21.\n\nDocument production on Respondent's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* concerns took place in February and March 2010. Further correspondence amongst the Parties ensued and the Tribunal held a teleconference on 8 April 2010 after which it informed the Parties that:\n\ni. The Tribunal has decided not to order any disclosure at this time.\n\nii. The Partial Award on Jurisdiction will decide only the \"Intra EU\" challenge.\n\niii. The Tribunal is not minded to arrange a second jurisdictional stage devoted to the *ratione materiae* challenge if it rejects the \"Intra EU\" challenge.\n\niv. Points (ii) and (iii) above are without prejudice to the right of the Respondent to raise arguments based on \u2018illegality' and / or \u2018business risk' in relation to questions of liability and / or quantum, if the case proceeds that far.\n\nv. Similarly, both Parties will be able to make fresh requests for disclosure in relation to questions of merits and / or quantum, if the case proceeds that far.\n\n22.\n\nOn 24 April 2010, a **Hearing on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection** was held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London. The Tribunal discussed with the Parties the possibility of approaching the European Commission and the Netherlands Government to provide comments to the Tribunal.\n\n23.\n\nOn 10 May 2010, the Tribunal contacted the Director General of the Legal Service of the European Commission and the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs, inviting them to provide to the Tribunal any further observations they might have on the jurisdictional question. The Netherlands Government submitted observations to the Tribunal on 23 June 2010 and on 7 July 2010 the European Commission provided its observations to the Tribunal. The Parties were given an opportunity to submit written comments, *inter alia*, on the European Commission and Netherlands Government observations on 19 July 2012.\n\n24.\n\nOn 12 July 2010, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 4**, in which among other things, recalling both Parties' desire for the expeditious and efficient resolution of the dispute, and Claimant's willingness to proceed to prepare immediately for the merits \"at its own risk\" without waiting for the Award on Jurisdiction to be rendered, the Tribunal set 2 August 2010 as the date by which Claimant should submit its **Memorial on the Merits**, which Claimant proceeded to do on 30 July 2010, accompanied by exhibits, four witness statements and an expert report.\n\n25.\n\nOn 16 August 2010, the Tribunal confirmed to the Parties that it considered that it had all the material needed for its deliberations on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection.\n\n26.\n\nOn 26 October 2010 rendered its **Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension** which included the following decisions at paragraph 293:\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DISMISSES the \"Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection\" advanced by Respondent and decides that it has jurisdiction over the dispute;\n\n(b) REJECTS Respondent's request to suspend the proceedings until the European Commission and/or the ECJ have come to a decision on the EU law aspects of the infringement proceedings;\n\n(c) RESERVES all questions concerning the merits, costs, fees and expenses, including the Parties' costs of legal representation, for subsequent determination; and\n\n(d) INVITES the Parties to confer regarding the procedural calendar for the merits phase of the arbitration, and to report to the Tribunal in this respect within 14 days of receipt of this Award.\n\n**D. Consent to Publication of Award**\n--------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIn November 2010, the Parties consented to make copies of the Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension available to the European Commission and the Netherlands Government.\n\n28.\n\nIn May 2011, the Parties consented to make the Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension available on the PCA's website and for it to be published in the International Law Reports.\n\n**E. Scheduling Matters and Renewed Suspension Request**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nPursuant to paragraph 293(d) of the Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, the Parties conferred on scheduling matters.\n\n30.\n\nOn 26 November 2010, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had applied to the Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main (the \" **Oberlandesgericht** \") for a declaration of the invalidity of the Award on Jurisdiction and for a declaration that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to decide the dispute between Eureko and the Slovak Republic. In light of this development, Respondent requested that the Tribunal reconsider the question of suspending the proceedings pending the final decision of the Oberlandesgericht. Claimant declined to agree to a suspension and expressed its view that the matter of suspension had already been extensively debated before the issuance of the Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension.\n\n31.\n\nOn 3 December 2010, following oral and written consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 5**, in which it (i) reaffirmed its jurisdiction over the case and declined to suspend the proceedings, underscoring its reasoning in paragraphs 292 and 293 of the Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, (ii) set a schedule for document production to precede the filing of Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, (iii) invited the Parties to comment on preferred venues for the hearing on the merits, and (iv) set forth a schedule for the remainder of the written proceedings. The schedule at that point envisaged a hearing on liability to be held in May 2011 and reflected an understanding between the Parties that the remaining proceedings would be bifurcated between a liability part and, to the extent necessary, a quantum part.\n\n32.\n\nOn 10 December 2010, the Parties jointly proposed that the May hearing on the Merits be held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London.\n\n**F. Written Proceedings on Liability**\n---------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 5, and following the exchange of document disclosure requests and objections, on 4 January 2011, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 6**, deciding the outstanding document requests.\n\n34.\n\nThroughout January 2011, the Parties exchanged correspondence with the Tribunal concerning compliance with Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n35.\n\nOn 26 January 2011, Respondent informed the Tribunal of a recent development in the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic (the \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky or \" **Slovak Constitutional Court** \"). The Slovak Constitutional Court had found that Section 15(6) of Act No. 581/2004 Coll., as amended by Act No. 530/2007 Coll. (the \"ban on profits\" discussed below at paragraph 96ff), was unconstitutional. Respondent asserted that the unconstitutionality of the Profit Provision alone does not establish a breach of the BIT by Respondent and noted that since the Profit Provision is no longer in force, Eureko's investment would not be hindered from generating a profit in the future. In response, on 7 February 2011, Claimant commented that although the Slovak Constitutional Court had not yet published an official opinion, the preliminary finding of the Slovak Court confirmed Eureko's position in this arbitration.\n\n36.\n\nOn 14 February 2011, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 5, Respondent submitted its **Counter-Memorial on the Merits** with accompanying exhibits and an expert report. On 2 March 2011, Respondent submitted an additional witness statement to support its Counter-Memorial on the Merits.\n\n37.\n\nOn 28 March 2011, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 5, Claimant submitted its **Reply on the Merits** with accompanying exhibits and a provisional translation of the 26 January 2011 judgment of the Slovak Constitutional Court. In its cover e-mail, Claimant expressed its views regarding aspects of the judgment, including that Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits could not be reconciled with (i) the petition made by members of the then Government of the Slovak Republic to the Slovak Constitutional Court back in 2008 and (ii) the adoption and issuance of legislation amending the \"2007 Reversal\" in 2010 and 2011 (discussed below at 119ff). Claimant requested Respondent to comment on these points.\n\n38.\n\nBy e-mail dated 30 March 2011, Respondent replied that Claimant's e-mail of 28 January 2011 contained \"comprehensive conclusions\" which it would only be able to address in its Rejoinder on the Merits.\n\n39.\n\nOn 15 April 2011, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had obtained a translation of the full opinion of the Slovak Constitutional Court decision of 26 January 2011 and requested that the hearing on liability scheduled for May 2011 be postponed to the second half of 2011 and that such hearing address both liability and quantum issues. Claimant justified its proposal by noting that the Slovak Constitutional Court had ruled on the legitimacy of crucial pieces of legislation underlying the present arbitration and that new legislation had been submitted to the Slovak Parliament that will \"fundamentally affect the scope of the arbitration.\" Claimant pointed to the discrepancy in the views of the Slovak Republic in the current proceedings and the public statements of its new administration. Claimant also requested the Tribunal to order the testimony of the then Slovak Minister of Finance.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter dated 21 April 2011 Respondent rejected the reasoning advanced by Claimant concerning the effect of the Slovak Constitutional Court decision, but agreed in principle to a postponement of the hearing, subject to some other adjustments to the timetable. Respondent also raised again the question of suspending the proceedings until the Oberlandesgericht ruled on the annulment, reporting that the European Commission had recently initiated \"Pilot Proceedings\" against Respondent because of Respondent's application of the BIT in this case.\n\n41.\n\nDuring a teleconference held amongst the Parties, the PCA and the Presiding Arbitrator on 27 April 2011, it was agreed by the Parties that a hearing on the merits (covering both liability and damages) would take place in London from 12 to 16 December 2011.\n\n42.\n\nIn accordance with a request from the Tribunal, the Parties submitted a joint proposal on 6 May 2011 for the remaining procedural schedule which provided for written submissions and document production on quantum issues.\n\n43.\n\nOn 6 May 2011, Respondent, again, formally requested the suspension of proceedings pending the completion of the proceedings in the Oberlandesgericht, providing an update on the proceedings before the Oberlandesgericht, including the participation of the Netherlands, and the interest shown by the European Commission and the Czech Republic. Respondent expressed concerns that the European Commission, having commenced proceedings against the Slovak Republic, considered Respondent to be in breach of EU law in continuing to participate in these arbitration proceedings. Respondent also considered the decision on liability to be no longer urgent in light of the ineffectiveness of the ban on profits.\n\n44.\n\nClaimant opposed the revived request for suspension by letter dated 6 May 2011. Claimant explained that the proceedings concerned the future use of the BIT, and were therefore not relevant to the resolution of the present dispute. Eureko emphasised its desire for resolution of the present arbitration in order for Eureko to remain active in the Slovak market and to avoid \"hibernating\" its investment further. Claimant considered the potential new legislation not to be a valid reason to suspend the proceedings.\n\n45.\n\nOn 27 May 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it did not consider the attendance of the Slovak Finance Minister, Mr Ivan Miklos, to be necessary for the fair and efficient conduct of the remaining proceedings of the case and declined Claimant's request to order his appearance as a witness. The Tribunal also stated that it did not consider the possibility of the initiation of proceedings by the European Commission, or the possibility of a reference of questions by the German courts to the ECJ, or Respondent's legislative program, to provide sufficient reason to suspend the proceedings. It recalled paragraphs 292 and 293 of its Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension and declined to suspend the arbitration.\n\n46.\n\nOn 10 May 2011, Respondent submitted its **Rejoinder on the Merits** with accompanying exhibits and an expert report.\n\n**G. Written Proceedings on Quantum**\n-------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nOn 24 August 2011, in accordance with the schedule agreed by the Parties and confirmed by the Tribunal on 19 July 2011, Claimant filed its **Memorial on Damages** accompanied by exhibits, an expert report on damages, and a supplementary witness statement.\n\n48.\n\nOn 31 August 2011, in accordance with the schedule agreed by the Parties, Respondent filed document requests relating to damages. Claimant responded to the document requests on 5 September 2011. On 8 September 2011, Respondent replied to Claimant's objections. On 12 September 2011, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 7** granting some of Respondent's document requests, denying some of Respondent's document requests and deeming it unnecessary to decide on others.\n\n49.\n\nOn 5 October 2011, Claimant produced documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 7. On 12 October 2011, Claimant acceded to a further document request by Respondent.\n\n50.\n\nOn 11 November 2011, in accordance with the agreed schedule, Respondent filed its **Counter-Memorial on Damages** accompanied by exhibits and an expert report.\n\n51.\n\nOn 22 November 2011, the Parties submitted the names of witnesses that they intended to call for cross-examination. Hearing attendees and other logistical matters were dealt with in correspondence dated 25 November 2011, and during a 29 November 2011 teleconference. Follow-up submissions were exchanged on 30 November 2011 and hearing arrangements were finalised on 2 December 2011.\n\n52.\n\nOne week before the scheduled hearing, on 7 December 2011, Claimant's expert witness, Mr Indge (of Ernst & Young), sent a letter to the Tribunal wishing to \"revise and clarify certain areas\" of his expert report dated 24 August 2011, in order to assist the Tribunal and address certain points made by Respondent's expert witnesses from KPMG (the \" **Indge Letter** \"). This included: (1) a revision of the administration costs in Model E of his report and the method of estimating expected dividends; (2) a correction of the data used for Appendix F, addressing an error made in his original report; and (3) a resultant amendment to the present value of Union under his Methodology 1. Mr Indge attached to his letter revised Appendices D and F.\n\n53.\n\nBy letter dated 8 December 2011, Respondent's expert witness, Mr Peer of KPMG, stated that they \"would need time to understand the revised calculations relied upon by Mr Indge and to consider those changes in light of the remainder of the model.\" The same day, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, requesting a postponement of the hearing to provide adequate time to react to the Indge Letter, or alternatively to proceed with the hearing but exclude the question of damages, which question should be rescheduled to a later time. Claimant wrote to the Tribunal that it considered Respondent's response disproportionate to the types of changes made in the Indge Letter and that Respondent was seeking an excuse to delay the hearing.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal conveyed a message to the Parties on 9 December 2011 that it would not at that moment postpone the hearing, but would address the procedural aspects raised by the Parties on the morning of the first day of the hearing.\n\n55.\n\nOn 9 December 2011, the Parties submitted brief summaries of their main submissions.\n\n**H. Hearing on the Merits**\n----------------------------\n\n56.\n\nFrom Monday, 12 December 2011 to Wednesday, 14 December 2011, a **Hearing on the Merits** was held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London. Present at the hearing were:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tribunal: | Professor Vaughan Lowe Professor Albert Jan van den Berg Mr V. V. Veeder |\n| Claimant: | *Counsel* Mr Marnix Leijten, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V. Mr Rogier Schellars, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V. Mr Albert Marsman, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V.

The first was the matter of the Indge Letter and its effect on the remainder of the proceedings. After hearing from the Parties, the Tribunal decided to continue with the hearing on liability and, in the meantime, asked the expert witnesses on damages from both sides to confer about the possibility of proceeding with their testimony. The second matter concerned the presence at the hearing of two Ernst & Young employees, Ms Victoria Wall and Ms Elizabeth Perks, to assist Claimant's counsel. The Tribunal ruled that they could be present. The third matter concerned scheduling of witnesses and the fourth matter concerned the characterisation of Claimant's witness, Mr Peter Pazitn\u00fd, whom the Tribunal decided could be treated as an expert witness.\n\n58.\n\nEach Party then presented arguments on the merits and answered questions from the Tribunal. The above-listed witnesses were subject to direct examination, crossexamination, and re-direct examination as well as questions from the Tribunal, as recorded in the Transcript.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal consulted further with the Parties and the expert witnesses on damages about the timing and nature of their oral evidence. It was decided that the experts would meet and produce a joint report setting out areas of agreement and disagreement, that the Parties would be offered an opportunity to comment on the joint report, and that the experts would then appear as witnesses on 30 January 2012. A draft version of Procedural Order No. 8, setting out these procedural steps, was circulated to the Parties for their review and comment.\n\n60.\n\nAt the close of the hearing, the Tribunal remarked that it had a sense \"that a settlement in this case would be a good thing, in that the aims of both sides seem to be approximately aligned, and that the black and white solution of a legal decision in which one side wins and the other side loses is not the optimum outcome in this case.\" The Tribunal emphasised that it was not its role to \"get involved in this in any way at all\" but suggested that should the Parties desire to seek out somebody who might act as a mediator or reconciliator, the Secretary-General of the PCA might be in a position to assist. The Tribunal noted that any such steps would be taken in parallel with the continuation of the case.12 The Tribunal also kept well in mind (as it had done before and still does) that the Parties have not expressly authorised it to decide their dispute as \" *amiable compositeur* \" or \" *ex aequo et bono* \" under Article 33(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\nTranscript, 14 December 2011, pp. 140-142. See also pp. 45-46.\n\n**I. Further Proceedings on Quantum**\n-------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nOn 16 December 2011, having consulted with the Parties, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 8**, setting out the procedural steps for the Parties' expert witnesses on damages to confer and report to the Tribunal in advance of a one-day hearing; as well as directions with respect to documenting Claimant's name change, and submitting any amendments to the hearing transcript.\n\n62.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 8, the Parties' expert witnesses on damages exchanged correspondence and data, and then met in person in Prague on 5 January 2012. On 13 January 2012, they submitted a **Joint Expert Report** setting out their areas of agreement and disagreement, and the reasons for their disagreement.\n\n63.\n\nOn 20 January 2012, the Parties exchanged comments on the Joint Expert Report.\n\n64.\n\nAlso on 20 January 2012, Claimant submitted documents evidencing Eureko B.V.'s name change to Achmea B.V. It explained that the name change was effective through an amendment of the articles of association of Eureko B.V. that was executed at the occasion of the merger between Eureko B.V. and Achmea Holding N.V. (Eureko B.V. being the surviving entity in that merger) on 18 November 2011. Claimant attached the deed of merger and amendment of the articles of association; the filing of the name change with the commercial register; and an overview of historical information for Achmea B.V. from the commercial register.\n\n65.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 8, on Monday, 30 January 2012, a **Hearing on Quantum** was held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London. Present at the hearing were:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tribunal: | Professor Vaughan Lowe Professor Albert Jan van den Berg Mr V. V.

The above-listed witnesses were subject to direct examination, cross-examination, and re-direct examination as well as questions from the Tribunal to the witnesses separately and collectively, as recorded in the Transcript.\n\n69.\n\nAt the close of the hearing, the Tribunal consulted with the Parties and indicated that they would request Post-Hearing Briefs as well as submissions on costs shortly after the hearing.\n\n**J. Post-Hearing Proceedings**\n-------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nOn 6 February 2012, the Tribunal confirmed to the Parties its request for \"concise PostHearing Briefs\" as discussed at the hearing. In accordance with the Tribunal's directions, the Parties submitted **Post-Hearing Briefs** on 21 February 2012.\n\n71.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's further directions of 18 February 2012, the Parties submitted **Submissions on Costs** on 27 February 2012. As set forth in the Parties' submissions, Claimant's costs amounted to \u20ac4,235,212.27\\* Respondent's costs amounted to \u20ac13,102,971.21. On 28 February 2012, Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, requesting that Respondent be ordered to clarify its Submission on Costs by providing a breakdown of counsel fees by law firm and of expert fees by each individual expert. Following further correspondence from the Parties, the Tribunal requested on 7 March 2012 that both Parties update their Submissions on Costs with further details regarding counsel and expert fees and a breakdown of such costs according to the phases of the arbitration. On 12 March 2012, the Parties submitted **Revised Submissions on Costs**.\n\nThis figure reflects a correction issued by the Tribunal on 14 December 2012, in accordance with Article 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which is incorporated into this consolidated electronic version of the Final Award.\n\n72.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's directions, the Parties submitted **Reply Submissions on Costs** on 16 March 2012. On 19 March 2012, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal regarding what it considered to be misrepresentations in Claimant's Reply Submission on Costs. On 20 March 2012, Claimant replied to Respondent's comments.\n\n73.\n\nOn 21 March 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it considered that it had all the materials it needed for its deliberations on the outstanding issues and requested the Parties to refrain from further correspondence in the absence of a formal application by a Party to the Tribunal.\n\n**K. Developments before the German Courts**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal takes arbitral notice, from the public record, of the following developments. On 10 May 2012, the Oberlandesgericht issued a decision rejecting Respondent's application for a declaration that the Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension was invalid as a result of the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction over the dispute between Eureko and the Slovak Republic.13 The Oberlandesgericht held that Article 344 TFEU (prohibiting EU Member States from submitting a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the TEU or TFEU to any method of settlement other than those set forth in the Treaties) was applicable only to disputes between EU Member States and not in the context of the investor-State dispute at hand. The Oberlandesgericht also declined to request a preliminary ruling from the ECJ under Article 267 TFEU, noting that the role of the ECJ in such a procedure was to address the validity of EU law in general terms, not to decide on the validity of Article 8(2) of the BIT. The Oberlandesgericht also observed that a reference to the ECJ was unnecessary as the Oberlandesgericht had no reasonable doubts regarding the interpretation of Article 344 TFEU.\n\nOberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main (decision dated 10 May 2012, reference no. 26 SchH 11/10) http://www.lareda.hessenrecht.hessen.de/jportal/portal/t/1hdj/page/bslaredaprod.psml?doc.hl=1&doc.id=JURE120010262 %3Ajuris-r00&documentnumber=1&numberofresults=1&showdoccase=1&doc.part=L\u00b6mfromHL=true#focuspoint (available only in German).\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that Respondent is appealing the aforementioned decision in the German Federal Supreme Court (the \"Bundesgerichtshof\") in Karlsruhe. As of the date of this Award, that Court has not determined whether to make a reference to the ECJ under Article 267 TFEU.\n\n**III. HISTORICAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe following summary of the historical and factual background is drawn from the Parties' pleadings and is presented to give context to Claimant's investment and alleged violations of the BIT. In the course of the Parties' submissions however, it became apparent that the Parties differed significantly in respect of the factual implications of these developments, as well as their relevance within the framework of the BIT. The Parties' competing characterisations of the factual record, and the Tribunal's observations thereon, are presented subsequently.\n\n**A. The Independence of the Slovak Republic and its Accession to the European Union**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nStarting in 1989, Czechoslovakia (from 1990 the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic (\" **CSFR** \")) underwent a profound transformation from a socialist system of central economic planning to a free market economy in a democracy under the rule of law. According to the Slovak Republic (and as the Tribunal accepts), this transformation necessitated the creation of a \"sufficient legal framework, which would safeguard the functioning of the new system and protection of the participating subjects.\"14\n\nRespondent's Memorial on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, \u00b67.\n\n78.\n\nIntegration into the European Community and Council of Europe was a priority in fostering the economic and political stability desired, while ensuring the protection of foreign entities entering a then-emerging free market.15\n\nRespondent's Memorial on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, \u00b6\u00b67-8.\n\n79.\n\nIn 1989 Czechoslovakia initiated contact with the European Community. Negotiations resulted in the conclusion on 16 December 1991 of the European Agreement Establishing an Association between the European Community on the one hand, and the CSFR, Hungary and Poland on the other.16 That Agreement was subject to ratification.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, \u00b6\u00b67-9.\n\n80.\n\nDuring the same period, the CSFR concluded, among other things, bilateral agreements on the promotion and protection of investments, including the BIT with The Netherlands, which was signed on 29 April 1991 and came into force from 1 October 1992.17\n\nRespondent's Memorial on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, \u00b6\u00b69-10. The Netherlands has been a member of the EU since it became party to the Treaty of Rome Establishing the European Economic Community on 25 March 1957. The Netherlands had become a party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms on 31 August 1954.\n\n81.\n\nThe CSFR became a member of the Council of Europe and a signatory to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\" **ECHR** \") on 21 February 1991. The ECHR has been in force for the CSFR since 18 March 1992.\n\n82.\n\nThe Slovak Republic separated from the CSFR and became an independent State on 1 January 1993. It succeeded to the CSFR-Netherlands BIT, as well as to the ECHR, as of the day of its independence. Because of the split of the CSFR, the CSFR Association Agreement of 16 December 1991 was never ratified. The Slovak Republic renegotiated its relationship with the European Community by concluding the Agreement Establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States [including The Netherlands] and the Slovak Republic on 4 October 1993. This Association Agreement has been in force since 1 February 1995.18\n\nRespondent's Memorial on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, \u00b6\u00b612-13.\n\n83.\n\nOn 16 April 2003, the Slovak Republic signed the **Accession Treaty**,19 and its membership of the EU became effective when the Accession Treaty entered into force on 1 May 2004.\n\nTreaty between the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Member States of the European Union) and the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, concerning the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic concerning the Accession of The Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union, signed on 23 September 2003, entered into force on 1 May 2004, (2003) O.J. L 236 of 23 September 2003. Available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:236:SOM:en:HTML.\n\n84.\n\nOn 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force for all EU Member States, including the Slovak Republic and the Netherlands.\n\n**B. The Evolution of the Slovak Heath Insurance Sector**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Constitution of the Slovak Republic, adopted on 1 September 1992, provides in Article 40 as follows:20\n\nEvery person shall have the right to protect his or her health. Through medical insurance, the citizens shall have the right to free health care and medical equipment for disabilities under the terms to be provided by law.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b65. Given the language of this arbitration, all quotations from a non-English text are here given in English translation, as agreed or not disputed by the Parties.\n\n86.\n\nIn 1993, the Slovak Republic established a mandatory and universal public health insurance system in which the payment of a dedicated healthcare levy was made the shared responsibility of employers and employees. Under this system, the State makes contributions for economically-inactive members of the population.21 The system was created by Act No. 9/1993 Coll.22 Initially administered by a single state-owned Health Insurer, this system was modified in 1994 by Act No. 273/1994 Coll. to permit the creation of other state-owned and private entities to perform public healthcare functions.23 As some individuals are likely to require more healthcare expenditure than others, the system provided for the aggregation of the greater part of the funds collected, and their redistribution among the health insurance entities in accordance with a formula that reflects the different predicted needs of the policyholders of each of the separate entities. Act No. 273/1994 Coll. also prohibited the use of levied funds for non-healthcare purposes and capped the administrative expenses of health insurers at 4 percent of collected premiums.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b66. Act No. 9/1993 Coll. (Exhibit R-2).\n\nExhibit R-2.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b610. Act No. 273/1994 Coll. (Exhibit R-4). See also Claimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6III.1-11.\n\n87.\n\nBy 2004, the Slovak healthcare system had accumulated a deficit of approximately SKK 26 billion.24 The Government of the Slovak Republic contributed over SKK 20 billion to reduce the debt and set about to reform the system. This was the 2004 Reform aimed at achieving a mix of public and private investment.25 Among the reforms, two Acts adopted on 21 October 2004 are particularly important in the context of this case: Act No. 580/2004 Coll.26 and Act No. 581/2004 Coll.27\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b616.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6III.12-14, Acts No. 580/2004 Coll. and No. 581/2004 Coll. (Exhibits C-20 and C-21).\n\nExhibit C-20.\n\nExhibit C-21.\n\n88.\n\nThe most significant aspects of the 2004 Reform may be summarised as follows:\n\n(a) health insurance companies were permitted to make profits and to dispose of profits subject to the laws applicable to other commercial entities;\n\n(b) health care providers, including State-owned hospitals, were privatised and free to compete in the provision of health care services ordered by health insurance companies;\n\n(c) no cap was imposed on the administration costs of health insurance companies;\n\n(d) health insurance companies were free to compete for clients;\n\n(e) existing health insurance companies were privatised and converted into joint stock companies;\n\n(f) an independent Regulator, neither controlled nor under the influence of the Government, was established to supervise the health insurance sector;\n\n(g) citizens could switch between licensed health insurance companies once each year;\n\n(h) the insurance premium for the basic level of health insurance was fixed by law;\n\n(i) the system of premium redistribution was applied to 85.5 percent of the premiums that each health insurance company was entitled to receive from its clients;\n\n(j) it was intended that the scope of the (mandatory) basic level health care package would be reduced and could be supplemented by any insured person who wished to pay for (voluntary) additional health insurance; and\n\n(k) a user fee was introduced, payable by the insured on the occasion of each visit to a healthcare provider and on each prescription.28\n\nSee Exhibit C-19, C-20, C-21; Statement of Claim \u00b6m.14-III.22.\n\n89.\n\nThe 2004 Reform made the Slovak health insurance market attractive to private investors, but it was unpopular with part of the population. Further, the liberalisation faced strong political opposition within parts the Slovak Parliament; and it was made the subject of a constitutional challenge.29\n\nStatement of Defence \u00b619-22, 27; Exhibit C-110.\n\n**C. Eureko's Entry into the Slovak Health Insurance Market**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nEureko has been active in the Slovak Republic since 1997, when it purchased shares in **Union Poist'ovna a.s.** (\" **Union Insurance** \"), a Slovak corporation privatised in 1992 which offered a range of insurance products, including travel insurance.30 In December 2005, shortly after the 2004 Reform, Eureko applied for a license to operate a health insurance company31 and incorporated in the Slovak Republic a new company, **Union** **Healthcare** (\" **Union Healthcare** \"), on 9 March 2006 as a \u2018greenfield' operation to offer basic level healthcare insurance.32 Union Healthcare was established with an initial investment of SKK 110 million upon incorporation and a further SKK 2,180,300.000 prior to 25 October 2006, the date of Claimant's last cash investment in Union Healthcare. By 1 January 2007, Union Healthcare had obtained a share of around 8.5 percent of the Slovak health insurance market.33\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6II.9-10.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b671.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b626; Claimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6II.11, III.15, III.24.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6II.15, III. 25; Exhibit C-22.\n\n**D. Reforms in the Slovak Health Insurance Sector in 2006-2009**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nOn 17 June 2006, parliamentary elections in the Slovak Republic resulted in the victory of the SMER Social Democracy party (\" **SMER** \"), led by Mr Robert Fico, who assumed the office of Prime Minister. Over the course of 2006 and 2007, the new Slovak Government introduced a series of changes to the legal framework governing the health insurance market. These measures were referred to by Claimant as the \"2007 Reversal\" and by Respondent as the \"2006 Stabilisation.\" It will be convenient here to refer to them neutrally as the \" **2007 Reforms**,\" despite the fact that not all of the relevant measures were adopted in 2007. It is also convenient to summarise all of the legislative reforms together, before turning to other developments.\n\n92.\n\n**Act No. 522/2006 Coll.**, adopted on 6 September 2006, introduced a cap on the operating expenses of health insurance companies (the \" **cap on operating expenses** \") in the following terms:34\n\n\u00a76a(1) A health insurance company may spend, in the relevant calendar year, for operational activities of health insurance company not more than 4% of the sum of premium prior to redistribution of premium for the relevant calendar year (the \"annual sum\").\n\nThe cap on operating expenses took effect from 1 January 2007 and was subsequently reduced to 3.5 percent of premium revenue by Act No. 530/2007 Coll., adopted on 25 October 2007.\n\nExhibit C-40.\n\n93.\n\n**Act No. 12/2007 Coll.**, adopted on 12 December 2006, introduced a ban on the use by health insurance companies of brokers to sell health insurance (the \" **ban on brokers** \") as follows:35\n\n\u00a76(17) A health insurance company must not carry out recruitment of insured under a mandate agreement or intermediary agreements with natural persons or legal entities for financial or non-financial consideration.\n\n\u00a76(18) A health insurance company must not give to the insured, for receipt and acceptance of application for public health insurance, a financial reward, non-financial reward or other financial, material or immaterial benefit, to which the insured is not entitled under public health insurance.\n\nThe Act further gave the Government the right to remove the Chairman of the Health Care Authority, on the initiative of the Minister of Health, for reasons other than those provided by statute (the \" **repositioning of the Regulator** \").\n\nExhibit C-47.\n\n94.\n\n**Government Resolution 462/2007**, adopted on 23 May 2007, instructed the Minister of Health to draft a legal regulation to ban the generation of profit from public health insurance and to reduce health insurers' operational funds from four percent to three percent; and also to submit a project for the establishment of a single health insurance company governed by public law.36\n\nExhibit C-37.\n\n95.\n\n**Decree 504/2007**, adopted on 24 October 2007, ended the ability of health insurance companies to contract freely with healthcare providers and imposed a requirement that the health insurance companies contract with 34 named state hospitals for the provision of facilities (the \" **amended network requirement** \").37 Decree 504/2007 was subsequently replaced by **Decree 640/2008**, which maintained and supplemented the requirements of the 2007 decree.38\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6III.177-121.\n\nExhibit C-55.\n\n96.\n\n**Act No. 530/2007 Coll.**, adopted on 25 October 2007, introduced a requirement that all profits from health insurance be used for healthcare purposes (the \" **ban on profits** \"):39\n\n\u00a715(6) If, following the fulfilment of the requirement set in paragraph 1 letter (b) the result of economic operations in public health insurance is positive, it may be used only for payments to such extent as is set in a special regulation 25) by no later than the end of the calendar year following that calendar year for which positive result of economic operations was reported, and in a manner not posing a risk for systematic and effective fulfilment of obligation owed by the health insurance company to ensure available healthcare under this Act (paragraph 1(a)) and not contradicting the obligation of the health insurance company to make proper and timely payments for healthcare provided.\n\nExhibit C-41.\n\n97.\n\n**Act No. 594/2007 Coll.**, adopted on 28 November 2007, supplemented the provisions of Act. No. 530/2007, in the following terms:40\n\n\u00a786d A health insurance company shall meet its obligation to use the positive economic result generated from public health insurance to pay for healthcare under \u00a7 15 paragraph 6 for the first time in 2009, and in respect of the financial year 2008.\n\nExhibit C-61.\n\n98.\n\nThe reforms continued in 2008 and 2009. **Act No. 581/2008 Coll.**, adopted on 25 November 2008, increased from 85.5 percent to 95 percent the portion of received premiums to be redistributed among health insurance companies in accordance with the expected needs of their particular client portfolios, obliged health insurance companies to submit their budgets for scrutiny by the Government, and amended the solvency requirements imposed on health insurance companies, requiring that the financial obligations of insurers be met within 30 days.41\n\nExhibit C-68, C-69.\n\n99.\n\n**Act No. 192/2009 Coll.**, adopted on 30 April 2009, ended the possibility of a health insurance company selling its insurance portfolio to another health insurance company and required that in the case of insolvency of an insurance company its portfolio must be transferred without payment to one of the two State insurance companies (the \" **ban** **on transfers** \").42\n\nExhibit C-72.\n\n100.\n\nAlongside these measures, officials of the Slovak Government made a number of statements, both publicly and in the course of correspondence exchanged with Eureko. Although the Parties differ as to the meaning and significance of these statements and exchanges, their content is recounted here.\n\n101.\n\nIn August 2006, the incoming Slovak Government issued a Manifesto setting forth its positions on a wide range of issues. In relevant part, with respect to healthcare, the Manifesto provided as follows:43\n\nThe Government considers health, equality in health care provision, and health care availability as the fundamental right of every citizen. Maintenance and improvement of health is the best investment for a strong economy and satisfied society. The Government considers health care to be one of its priorities. The mission of health care is the provision of care to the public using public money and therefore it has to be under public scrutiny.\n\nThe Government will ensure the principle of solidarity in health care. A socially oriented state must not dispose of the responsibility for ensuring access to adequate health care to all its citizens. The scope of this care must be defined by the law and, to that extent, health care must be financed from health insurance.\n\nAlready in 2006, the Government will cancel some fees that are not directly related to the provision of health care and ensure compensation for the providers.\n\nThe Government is aware that the discrepancy between the lack of funds and the expectations of the population can only be solved by maintaining economically and socially sustainable participation in selected types of health care. The Government considers the support of voluntary health insurance to be critical while enabling access to health care not paid from the health insurance and to a reduction of the immediate financial impact of such participation. The Government will consider the possibility of tax relief against payments of the voluntary health insurance.\n\n[...]\n\nThe Government will ensure an increase of funds for health care in 2007 by increasing insurance premium payments for citizens where the payer is the state from 4% of the average wage to 5%. The Government will ensure that public spending in health care expressed in GDP percent has a growth tendency and that it respects the principle of approximation to advanced states of the European Union.\n\nThe Government will support multi-source financing of health care. It will contribute to the fund for compensation of extremely demanding procedures. The Government considers the constitutionally guaranteed system of health insurance, based on the solidarity principle, to constitute the basis of health care funding. The Government will restore the public character of the Vseobecn\u00e1 zdravotn\u00e1 poistov\u00f1a and Spolo\u010dn\u00e1 zdravotn\u00e1 poistov\u00f1a health insurance companies. The Government will enforce such a legal environment, in which all health insurance companies have equal conditions regardless of their legal form, and which prevents insurance companies from inefficient management of the funds of the insured. The Government will enforce that the amount of health insurance companies' operating costs as of 2007 be limited by law to a maximum of 4% of the mandatory health insurance premiums collected.\n\nThe Government will not admit such legislative changes in health care that could lead to damaging the reputation of the Slovak Republic by failing to ensure an adequate protection of domestic and foreign investments. The Government accepts all forms of ownership of health care facilities and it will create conditions for their multi-source financing.\n\nThe Government will revoke the present form of insurance premiums accounting.\n\nThe Government will pay maximum attention to the use of all possibilities of financing investment activities in health care, including the EU funds.\n\n[...]\n\nThe Government supports decentralisation in health care management while introducing the methodological, regulatory, and control role of the state vis-\u00e0-vis all health care facilities. In hospital care, it will enforce the role of the state as the owner of faculty health care facilities, facilities with nationwide scope, and those performing special tasks in emergency situations.\n\nThe Government will ensure availability and quality of health care for all citizens and it will prevent uncontrolled and inefficient extension of the network of health care facilities. At the same time, it will support the restructuring of the network of health care facilities giving preference to the transfer of activities to the outpatient sphere - including walk-in care, to achieve purposeful specialisation and growth in quality and productivity of the services provided. Medically and financially highly demanding health care procedures will only be provided at accredited workplaces of selected facilities.\n\nThe Government will support the creation of conditions for transparent competition of health care providers. At the same time, it will support creation of a system of a differentiated approach in establishing contractual relationships between health insurance companies and health care providers according to the criteria of efficiency and quality of health care provided.\n\n[...]\n\nThe critical objective of the government will be to develop the health care system informatisation at all levels. The Government will ensure legislative and institutional conditions for implementation of information and communication systems that will assist in improvement of quality, cost efficiency and time availability of services. In this area, the Government will support the project of health care informatisation and gradually implement the objectives of the national eHealth strategy.\n\nAn important objective of the Government will be the support of new, more transparent payment mechanisms for health care procedures.\n\nThe Government will enforce substantial debureaucratisation of health care and cancel all unnecessary administration and duplicity in the activities of the Ministry of Health, Healthcare Surveillance Authority, and other institutions. In 2007, these institutions will be subject to thorough activity audit with subsequent reconsideration of the headcount only for the activities that are inevitable, necessary for the entire society, and that are prescribed by law.\n\nExhibit C-16, pp. 33-35.\n\n102.\n\nAccording to Eureko, the first signs of a significant intervention by the Government in the health insurance market came in November 2006. Eureko says that it then became aware that on 9 November 2006 the chairman of the Slovak Parliament had said to a closed meeting of the \u2018health care club' that he believed that all public funds (including the health care levy) should be under public control, that non-State health insurance companies should not be permitted to make profits, that clients whose healthcare contributions are paid by the State should not have a free choice of insurer, and that there should be restrictions on the ownership rights of health insurance companies.44\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6III.38\n\n103.\n\nAccording to Eureko, it was a report from Mr B\u00f4rik, the CEO of Union Healthcare and a prominent and well-connected member of the Slovakian Association of Insurance Companies, that alerted Eureko to the possibility of a significant change in the system and triggered the request for a meeting between Eureko and Mr Ivan Valentovi\u010d, the Minister of Health, at short notice.45\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 30-32.\n\n104.\n\nOn 24 November 2006, Eureko's CEO, Mr Willem AJ van Duin, met with Mr Valentovi\u010d to discuss developments in the Slovak health insurance sector. Following this meeting, Mr Van Duin wrote to the Minister as follows:46\n\nDear Mr Minister,\n\nHerewith I would like to thank you for the time you have made available on Friday 24th November to discuss the developments on the health insurance market with me and particularly recent information we received on potential proposals to change legislation.\n\nAfter I have given you information on Eureko, our European insurance group with a strong presence in health insurance, I explained that Eureko is a long term investor who entered from this perspective a.o. on the Slovakian health insurance market with Union Zdravodna Poist'ovna.\n\nUnion z.p. is for many years seen in the Slovakian market as a very trustworthy insurance company with a reliable position. I informed you that Eureko has made considerable investments in the health sector and expects to have a break even situation only after a number of years with a pay back period of over 10 years. This underlines the long term approach with entering the health insurance market in Slovakia, where we foresee - as in other European countries - only marginal profits but a strong client relationship which supports our other insurance businesses.\n\nYou mentioned the necessity to create stability in the market which of course we understand. But as we can see in other European countries, we feel that this stability is not by any means influenced through the ownership of the health insurance company, either private or state owned. I offered to share the knowledge that we have within Eureko with you in supporting governments, like we did before in the Netherlands, Romania and Greece.\n\nWe also discussed the proposals set out in de press [sic] to change current legislation. Although we prefer not to react on articles in the press, we do see a considerable threat to developing our business as planned. I pointed out to you that possible proposals as we see now, will be in conflict with European regulations and bilateral treaties between the Netherlands and the Slovakian Republic. You will understand that, we will have to defend our investments if necessary.\n\nIn spite of our discussions last Friday, to our disappointment we had to find out that on Monday 27th November a parliamentary committee discussed proposals to change current legislation which fully conflict with the interests of private health insurers and Eureko as a share holder of Union z.p, in particular. To our interpretation these proposals are very conflictive with the current legislation on which we have based the decision to commit to our investments. You will understand that - separate from controversy with EU-legislation - we will have to confront you with considerable damages claims if these proposals become legislation. In that case we will inform you later about our next steps. Of course it is still our preference that proposed changes in legislation will not take place and that the good business climate will not be affected.\n\nAgain, I would like to thank you for your hospitality and I value the discussions we have had. However, we are disappointed by the fact that you did not mention any of the proposed changes in legislation at all.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWillem van Duin\n\nExhibit C-13.\n\n105.\n\nOn 9 December 2006, the Prime Minister, Mr Robert Fico, made the following statement:47\n\nWe expect, quite legitimately, that our Minister of Health will issue decisions with respect to health insurance companies in the next year. After all, it is not normal that, for instance, health insurance companies - some of them privately owned -generate profit. Clearly, their revenues are not generated from business activities but rather from the collection of health insurance contributions, that is, from public resources.\n\nExhibit C-24.\n\n106.\n\nOn 3 January 2007, Mr Valentovi\u010d replied to Eureko's letter of 24 November 2006 as follows (the \" **January 2007 Letter** \"):48\n\nDear Mr van Duin,\n\nAllow me to thank you for your letter of November 28, 2006, referring to our discussion about the development on the health insurance market.\n\nAs regards to the other part of your letter about the proposals discussed in a parliamentary committee, I would like to inform you that up to now the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic did not present the final conception of state insured persons in state-owned health insurance companies. Currently, there are some problem solving proposals being discussed and the final resolution has not yet been adopted. I would like to assure you that the procedure of the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic will be in compliance with the Slovak legal system and in accordance with the EU regulations and bilateral treaties between the Slovak Republic and the Netherlands. The Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic will adopt the optimal alternative to the benefit of the citizens of Slovakia.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIvan Valentovi\u010d\n\nExhibit C-27.\n\n107.\n\nOn 23 May 2007, Mr Valentovi\u010d made the following statements in a press conference:49\n\nTherefore the Government instructed the Minister of Health to present a draft law that would prohibit generation of profit from public health insurance and guarantee that the funds coming from the public health insurance will be managed only by health insurance companies.\n\n[...]\n\nThe Government's vision is to have \"non-commercial\", i.e. not profit-oriented, public health insurance companies and this differs substantially from the situation in the past.\n\n[...]\n\n[...] could one say that these steps will later, through legislative restrictions, result in the same scenario, i.e. that there will be only one insurance company?\n\n[...]\n\nI clearly said we have found the other way how to achieve the goal of having one public health insurance company that provides public health insurance.\n\nExhibit C-33.\n\n108.\n\nOn 26 May 2007, Prime Minister Fico made the following statement during a radio interview:50\n\nWe would like to gradually achieve a situation with one health insurance company in such a way that we will create such conditions in public health insurance which will not be interesting for private health insurance companies.\n\n[...]\n\nWe want that public health insurance - it means the basic one - will cover the standard care, which much be given free of charge to everybody, no matter what are his possibilities. If somebody wants a luxury, he should pay for it in a private health insurance company. We want to squeeze out private health insurance companies from this space, but we want to squeeze them out in a way, which is not contestable, both from the legal point of [view], and from international - legal point of [view], or political or other point of view.\n\nExhibit C-28.\n\n109.\n\nAlso on 26 May 2007 Prime Minister Fico made the following statement during a second radio interview:51\n\n[...]\n\nWe had to take a serious note of rather significant legal objections, which referred to potential impacts of the use of constitutional concepts that the Minister of Health considered to use, in his projects, against private health insurance companies. So we have subscribed to a view that we want to gradually get to a single health insurance company, but this by creating conditions in public health insurance that will not be interesting for private health insurance companies, this is our underlying philosophy. We are still against private health insurance companies getting rich on public health insurance. It is not possible that someone has a portfolio of clients, cuts 700 million crowns from that money in profit, plus has a 4% as administration fund which covers expensive cars, personal assistants, comfortable office buildings and pretends to make business in this field.\n\n[...]\n\nLet's imagine now something like a basic mandatory [liability] insurance covering cars, and also you have say accident insurance which I may take on of my free will just for the case that I will have a crash and chop up my car. We want that public health insurance, meaning basic insurance, covers the normal standard [of care], that what everyone must get for free in healthcare system, irrespective of his or her means. If anyone wants to enjoy luxury, excessive luxury, he may pay for it in a private health insurance company. This is the same road we wanna [go], I'll tell it in good Slovak [in plain words], may I? We want to drive out private health insurance companies from this area but we want to do that taking such steps that cannot be contested legally, nor from the perspective of international law, nor politically, nor otherwise. Moreover, what's interesting that as long as we have not debated health insurance companies, all attacked us that healthcare and problem and I-don't-know what else [sic]. As soon as we have opened the issue of a single health insurance company, the whole opposition got hooked on that moment and started to defend private health insurance companies [...]\n\nExhibit C-29.\n\n110.\n\nOn 28 May 2007, Prime Minister Fico was quoted in the press as having stated that \"[t]he Government will drive the four private health insurance companies out of the market.\"52\n\nExhibit C-31.\n\n111.\n\nOn 13 June 2008, Prime Minister Fico was quoted by the Slovak Press Agency SITA as having made the following statements:53\n\nWhat is the lost profit? [...] We will never let them profit from the money that people compulsorily send into the system.\n\n[...]\n\nWe refuse to let plain market business principles to dominate the Slovak health care market, we view it as a public service.\n\n[...]\n\nWe still insist that the private health insurance companies cannot cut money from the public health insurance, it is unacceptable for us and we will fight with all our might to prove that the law is in line with the constitution.\n\nExhibit C-36.\n\n**E. Eureko's Response to the 2007 Reforms**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nEureko remained active in the Slovak Republic following the 2007 Reforms, but took a number of steps in response. Most significant in the present context was its decision to go into \"hibernation\" (its phrase); that is, to stop trying to expand its business and to accommodate only its existing clients. Claimant says that this strategy delayed its planned growth and caused it financial loss. The hibernation strategy is described below.54\n\nSee below, paragraph 296 et seq.\n\n113.\n\nClaimant also took other steps. On 28 February 2008, Eureko filed a complaint with the European Commission. According to Eureko, this filing was made in order to impress upon the Slovak Government Eureko's view that its policies were not in line with basic EU law principles that had been a cornerstone of Eureko's confidence in deciding to invest in the Slovak Republic. The complaint led to the opening of an infringement procedure by the European Commission against the Slovak Republic under Article 226 of the EC Treaty.55\n\nArticle 226 TEC provides that: \"If the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity to submit its observations. If the State concerned does not comply with the opinion within the period laid down by the Commission, the latter may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union.\" That provision is now Article 258 TFEU. The complaint procedure was registered under reference number 2008/4268.\n\n114.\n\nNoting that Eureko's influence on the progress and direction of this complaint procedure is \"limited,\" that \"ancillary proceedings in the European Court of Justice can by their very nature not result in a damages award,\" and that Eureko's damages \"cannot be redressed through other EU-channels,\" Claimant explained that it was forced to turn to arbitration to seek redress.56 On 4 March 2008, Eureko sent to the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic a \"trigger letter\" setting out its grievances with respect to the reforms to the health insurance sector and formally notifying its intention to commence arbitration proceedings under the BIT. After attempts at amicable settlement failed, Eureko formally commenced this arbitration by a Notice of Arbitration dated 1 October 2008.57\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b61.17; Exhibit R-45.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Annex 1; Claimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b61.8-14.\n\n**F. Judicial Challenges to the 2007 Reforms**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nOn 25 June 2008, 52 members of the Slovak Parliament lodged a petition with the Slovak Constitutional Court pursuant to Article 125(1)(a) of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, challenging the compliance of the ban on profits with the Slovak Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the Treaty Establishing the European Community.58 On 26 January 2011, the Constitutional Court adjudged that the ban on profits violated Articles 1(1), 20(1), and 35(1) of the Slovak Constitution, in relevant part, as follows:59 The Constitutional Court, basing itself on legal considerations and conclusions stated in the preceding parts of this Ruling, submits that the following occurred as the consequence of Section 15(6) of the Health Insurance Companies Act:\n\n(a) Material restriction of ownership rights of private (non-State owned) health insurance companies having the nature of forced restriction of the ownership right of those health insurance companies and/or their shareholders in the form of material restriction of the possibility to dispose of their own shares as property value which are integral part of their ownership right. Concurrently, material modification of the contents of their licences for performance of the public health insurance business occurred, while legislative intervention is concerned here having a material impact on their legitimate expectations associated with the exercise of their property rights. At the same time, the legislator intervened in the property rights of private health insurance companies without providing/ensuring adequate compensation, while legal regulation is concerned having also the nature of non-genuine retroactivity which, given the circumstance in which it has been passed, the Constitutional Court does not deem necessary in terms of the objective pursued by the legislator and which is, in terms of its consequences, clearly disproportionate to the restriction of rights of the health insurance companies and their shareholders under Article 20(1) of the Constitution and Article 1 of the Additional Protocol.\n\n(b) Unconstitutional intervention in the fundamental right of private (non-State owned) health insurance companies to carry out business under Article 35(1) of the Constitution in the area of public health insurance occurred, such right having been conferred on them in the original wording of the Health Insurance Companies Act, and this was corroborated - until the effective date of the amendment to the Health Insurance Companies Act through Act No. 530/2007 Coll. - also by the procedure for application of the amendment, namely by deprivation of the possibility to decide autonomously on the manner of application of the profit earned in the area of public health insurance, while legislative measure of the nature of non-genuine retroactivity is concerned not respecting the essence and sense of the fundamental right under Section 35(1) of the Constitution and which, at the same time, was not necessary in terms of the objective pursued by the legislator and being, in terms of its consequences, clearly disproportionate with respect to the legitimate interests and legally/validly acquired rights of private (non-State owned) health insurance companies and their shareholders.\n\n(c) Occurrence of a constitutionally impermissible intervention in the general principle of State governed by law as expressed in Article 1(1) of the Constitution, including both the legal certainty principle and proportionality principle.\n\n[...]\n\nExhibit C-75.\n\nThe judgment of the Court is Exhibit C-135, translated as Exhibit C-149. Cf., Part VI (\"Conclusions\") of the Judgment and the Court's Press Communique No. 2/2011, Exhibit C-143.\n\n116.\n\nIn essence, the Constitutional Court ruled that the ban on profits was an impermissible interference with the private health insurance companies' right of ownership and freedom to do business. Accordingly, the ban on profits ceased to have legal effect following the Court's decision.60\n\nAccording to Respondent, the decision took effect upon publication of the judgment on 24 March 2011, pursuant to the Slovak Constitution (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b68). According to Claimant there is a six-month delay from the date of publication of the judgment (unless rectifying legislation is introduced earlier) (see Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 64).\n\n**G. Political Developments in the Slovak Republic**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nOn 12 June 2010, parliamentary elections resulted in a change in the Government of the Slovak Republic and the election of a new coalition headed by the new Prime Minister, Ms Iveta Radi\u010dov\u00e1. Ms Radi\u010dov\u00e1 and other key members of her government were amongst those Members of Parliament who had brought the constitutional challenge to the ban on profits in June 2008.61\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6131-34.\n\n118.\n\nThe Program Theses of the new government, released on 23 June 2010, announced the Government's intention to reverse several elements of the 2007 Reforms in the following terms:62\n\n[...]\n\nWe will restore the possibility to create profit for health insurance companies under strictly defined conditions in a way which would not worsen the position of the state in ongoing litigations on investment protection.\n\n[...]\n\nWe will consider increasing of the percent of premium which will not be subject to redistribution.\n\n[...]\n\nWe will restore independency of \u00daDZS [the Health Care Authority]\n\n[...]\n\nWe will resolve the minimal network of specialised out patients healthcare and inpatient healthcare (re-evaluation of healthcare network and restructuring of network of providers).\n\nExhibit C-124.\n\n119.\n\nThereafter, the Government of Prime Minister Radi\u010dov\u00e1 began to implement its proposed changes, passing legislation on 28 December 2010 to restore the independence of the Healthcare Authority.63 On 22 March 2011, the Government issued for public comment a draft law amending Act No. 581/2004 in relation to operational expenses, financial reserves, and network requirements.64 This new legislation on health insurance was adopted on 8 July 2011 and entered force on 1 August 2011,65 and provided as follows:\n\n(a) health insurers were permitted to earn profits, subject to the creation and maintenance of a reserve fund to ensure the provision of healthcare to individuals on waiting lists;66\n\n(b) the network requirements were amended to require that each insurer \"conclude an agreement on the provision of health care in each district of the Slovak Republic within the fixed network,\" rather than with one provider in each group of districts;67\n\n(c) the Health Care Authority was empowered to monitor diagnoses and costs in assessing redistribution rates;68\n\n(d) the cap on operating expenses was amended to allow smaller insurers to spend a higher percentage of revenue on operating expenses;69\n\n(e) the ban on brokers remained in place;70\n\n(f) the possibility to transfer an insurance portfolio for value was restored, but insured individuals were given the opportunity to opt out of such a transfer or to select a different insurer;71\n\n(g) the scrutiny of the budgets of health insurers was removed;72 and\n\n(h) the solvency requirements were adjusted.73\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b621\n\nExhibit C-137\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6II.9; Respondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b67.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, Annex A-9, \u00b6\u00b65-7.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, Annex A-9, \u00b69.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, Annex A-9, \u00b611.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, Annex A-9, \u00b614.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, Annex A-9, \u00b616.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, Annex A-9, \u00b620.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, Annex A-9, \u00b622.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, Annex A-9, \u00b625.\n\n120.\n\nOn 11 October 2011, the Government of Prime Minister Radi\u010dov\u00e1 fell; and in elections held on 10 March 2012, Mr Robert Fico was re-elected as Prime Minister, assuming office on 4 April 2012.\n\n**IV. AN OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES' PRINCIPAL SUBMISSIONS**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered in full the submissions made by the Parties in their written pleadings and oral arguments. The Tribunal has summarised most of those submissions below; and all of the points made by the Parties have been taken into account by the Tribunal, even though not here expressly summarised and although it is not necessary to address and decide in turn each and every one of those submissions and observations for the purpose of this Award.\n\n122.\n\nBefore turning to the specifics of the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal recalls that the Parties were requested to file brief summaries of their main submissions prior to the hearing on the merits, and each did so on 9 December 2011. It is helpful to set them out here as points of reference for the following analysis:\n\n123.\n\n**Claimant's Summary** reads as follows:\n\n**1 Respondent breached the BIT**\n\n1.1 Respondent breached Article 3(1) of the BIT: It denied Eureko's investment fair and equitable treatment by fundamentally altering the legal and business framework after Eureko had invested, and by taking measures with the ulterior and bad faith aim of eliminating privately-owned health insurers from the market.\n\n1.2 Respondent breached Article 3(1) of the BIT: It impaired Eureko's investment by unreasonable and discriminatory measures including the cap on operating expenses, the Ban on Brokers, the Ban on Profits, an increase in the redistribution rate and EUR 65M in state-aid for VZP, all of which favoured the dominant and incumbent state-owned insurers to the detriment of Eureko's much smaller and newly-entering investment, Union Health.\n\n1.3 Respondent breached Article 3(2) of the BIT: It denied Eureko's investment full security and protection by bringing the powerful Health Care Authority under political control, by publicly harassing Eureko's investment, by enacting unreasonable and unpredictable solvency requirements and by directing Eureko's investment to provide its budget to the state for \"deliberation\".\n\n1.4 Respondent breached Article 4 of the BIT: It denied Eureko's investment the free transfer of profits and dividends through the Ban on Profits.\n\n1.5 Respondent breached Article 5 of the BIT: It expropriated Eureko's investment in 2007 through the Ban on Profits, the ban on portfolio transfer against value, and/or the collective measures comprising the 2007 Reversal, with the admitted intent to \"drive out\" privately-owned health insurers from the Slovak market.\n\n1.6 Eureko has been invited to invest in the Slovak Republic by the Slovak Minister of Health in 2004, and has received specific assurances by the Slovak Minister of Health in January 2007 that its investment would be treated in accordance with the BIT.\n\n**2 Respondent's liability is an admitted fact**\n\n2.1 Members of Respondent's present government asserted in a Constitutional Court petition that the Ban on Profits deprived Eureko of a fundamental property right, interfered with Eureko's legitimate expectations, constitutes expropriation and forms part of a scheme to drive privately-owned insurers out. In this assertion, these members of the present government were supported by a large number of other members of parliament.\n\n2.2 Respondent's Constitutional Court has found that the Ban on Profits forcibly restricted the ownership rights of privately-owned health insurance companies, that the legitimate expectations of their shareholders had been breached, that in interfering with the ownership rights of privately-owned health insurers no compensation had been provided, and that the interference violated provisions protecting against expropriation in the Slovak Constitution and the ECHR.\n\n2.3 Slovak state advisory bodies have warned the Slovak government not to enact the 2007 Reversal because it breaches Slovak law, international law and the BIT.\n\n2.4 Respondent's government acknowledged that the 2007 Reversal was not necessary from a policy perspective by reversing part of the measures.\n\n**3 Eureko is entitled to damages and further relief**\n\n3.1 Eureko suffered damages as a consequence of the enactment of the 2007 Reversal, as set out in the expert report of Ernst & Young.\n\n124.\n\n**Respondent's Summary** reads as follows:\n\n**Part A The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to rule on the dispute**\n\n1. The BIT is not applicable due to EU law *(part D.1 Statement of Defence, part* *D.2 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part H Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(a) The BIT provisions are not applicable due to supremacy, direct effect and direct applicability of EU law *(part D.2 Counter-Memorial on the Merits)*\n\n(b) The alleged discrimination with respect to preferential treatment of VZP is also governed by EU law *(part E.2 Counter-Memorial on the Merits)*\n\n2. The Claimant's investment is not protected by the BIT (*ratione materiae* objection)\n\n(a) Claimant's investment into the portfolio of Union Healthcare is not protected by the BIT, as it has been established contrary to Slovak law *(part E.1 Counter- Memorial on the Merits, part I Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(b) Future investments, which are only planned but were not conducted, are not protected by the BIT *(paragraph 39 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n**Part B The Respondent has not breached any of its obligations under the BIT**\n\n3. The 2006 Stabilisation was adopted within the regulatory powers of the Respondent and thus it is not compensable *(part B.4 Statement of Defence, part D.4.1 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part D Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(a) The health insurance system holds public character consistently *(part C.3.1 Counter-Memorial on the Merits)*\n\n(b) The 2004 Acts were economically and factually incorrect in some aspects *(part C.4 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part B.4 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(c) The 2006 Stabilisation was adopted to remove risks brought by the 2004 Acts *(part C.5.2 Counter-Memorial on the Merits)*\n\n(d) The 2006 Stabilisation pursued the public interest and proportionate to the public interest it pursues *(part D.4.1.2 and D.4.1.5 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part D.3 and D.6 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(e) The 2006 Stabilisation was non-discriminatory and within due process without any promise to the Claimant that it will not be adopted *(part* *D.4.1.2 and D.4.1.3 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part D.4 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n4. The ruling of the Constitutional Court with respect to the Profit Provision does not establish international responsibility of the Respondent *(part A.2 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part D.6.3 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(a) The Constitutional Court did not consider any individual circumstances of the present dispute.\n\n(b) The Constitutional Court did not analyse the Profit Provision pursuant to the standards of protection under the BIT.\n\n(c) Any possible breach of national law does not automatically imply a breach of any of the international obligations of the Respondent.\n\n(d) The Profit Provision was effective only for two years (the Constitutional Court assessed constitutionality of a valid and effective Profit Provision whereas the Tribunal assesses, if two years of effectiveness of the Profit Provision breached the BIT).\n\n5. There has been no deprivation or expropriation of an investment of the Claimant in the Slovak Republic *(part C.1.1 Statement of Defence, part D.4.2 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part C Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(a) The Claimant's investment has not been effectively neutralized by none of the contested provisions *(part D.4.2.2 Counter-Memorial on the Merits)*\n\n(b) There was no loss of control with respect to the Claimant's investment *(part C.1 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(c) The Profit Provision was applicable only temporarily *(part C.2 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n6. The standard of fair and equitable treatment has not been breached *(part C.1.2* *Statement of Defence, part D.4.3 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part E Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(a) The 2006 Stabilisation was adopted in good faith and in public interest *(part D.4.3.2 Counter-Memorial on the Merits)*\n\n(b) The 2006 Stabilisation was in compliance with the non-impairment standard, i.e. non-discriminatory and reasonable *(part D.4.3.4 CounterMemorial on the Merits, part F.2 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n7. The Claimant could not legitimately expect that the 2004 Acts would remain unchanged *(part D.4.3.1 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part E.2 and E.3 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(a) The 2004 Acts were highly unpopular and were rejected both by professionals and the general public *(part B.2 Statement of Defence, part C.5.1 Counter- Memorial on the Merits)*\n\n(b) The 2004 Acts were subject to the complaint submitted to the Constitutional Court.\n\n(c) The Claimant incorporated Union Healthcare one month after the early elections were declared, where election polls indicated that the parties opposing the 2004 Acts were gaining popularity *(part B.3 Statement of Defence, part C.5.3.3 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part E.2.1 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n(d) Circumstances surrounding the Claimant's entrance into the health insurance sector clearly suggested adoption of the 2006 Stabilisation *(part C.5.3 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part E.2.2 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n8. The standard of full security and protection has not been breached *(part C.1.3* *Statement of Defence, part D.4.4 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part F.1 Rejoinder on Merits)*\n\n9. The Claimant did not face any limitations as regards transfer of payments *(part C.1.4 Statement of Defence, part D.4.5 Counter-Memorial on the Merits, part F.3 Rejoinder on Merits*)\n\n**Part C The Claimant did not suffer any damage due to the 2006 Stabilisation (none of its provisions)**\n\n10. The Claimant did not bear its burden of allegation and burden of proof with respect to the alleged hibernation *(part B Counter-Memorial on Damages)*\n\n(a) The Claimant's allegations regarding the hibernation are inconsistent and insufficient *(part B.2 Counter-Memorial on Damages)*\n\n(b) The hibernation did not occur *(part B.2.2 Counter-Memorial on Damages)*\n\n11. There is no causal link between the alleged breach of the BIT and the alleged damage *(part C Counter-Memorial on Damages)*\n\n(a) The alleged hibernation was not caused by the 2006 Stabilisation *(part C.1 Counter-Memorial on Damages)*\n\n(b) The alleged hibernation did not cause any damage to the Claimant *(part C.2 Counter-Memorial on Damages)*\n\n(c) There is no sufficient causal link between the contested provisions of the 2006 Stabilisation, the breach of the duties by the Respondent through these provisions and the Claimant's alleged damage *(part C.3 CounterMemorial on Damages)*\n\n12. The alleged damage could not occur if the Claimant had not breached the Slovak law *(part C.4 Counter-Memorial on Damages)*\n\n**Part D The Claimant's calculation of damages is flawed (Part D CounterMemorial on Damages)**\n\n13. Union Healthcare has insufficient track record for the use of DDM (DCF) method *(part D.1.1 Counter-Memorial on Damages)*\n\n14. The profitability of the Claimant's investment is highly speculative *(part* *D.1.2 Counter-Memorial on Damages)*\n\n15. The tribunals do not award damages in the cases where the claims are highly speculative or the track record is missing *(part D.1 Counter-Memorial on Damages)*\n\n16.

The Parties' Arguments on Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Materiae***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Slovak Republic, in accordance with Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, raised an objection in its Statement of Defence to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over this dispute. It stated that it would challenge Eureko's assertions of \"the existence of a *bona fide* investment.\"79 Respondent proceeded to seek relevant documents from Claimant in this respect in February and March of 2010. After consultations with the Parties, the Tribunal decided on 8 April 2010 to defer questions of the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* challenge to the merits phase of the case, if the case were to proceed that far.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b6117.\n\n132.\n\nRespondent develops this jurisdictional objection further in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits. Respondent recalls that the alleged investment made by Claimant relates not only to the ownership of its subsidiary, Union Healthcare, but also, according to Claimant's own statements, to Union Healthcare's portfolio. Claimant considers this portfolio as its \"most precious asset.\"80\n\nMemorial on the Merits, \u00b641, quoted in Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6633, 657.\n\n133.\n\nRespondent contends that this health insurance portfolio cannot be considered as an \"asset\" within the sense of Article 1(a) of the BIT.81 According to Respondent:82\n\nthe insurance portfolio is not capable of being the subject of ownership under Slovak law since a health insurance provider (i) may not dispose of the insured; (ii) may not decide if it accepts a particular insured or not; (iii) may not withdraw from a relationship with the insured; (iv) may not decide the amount and due dates of the health insurance levies; and (v) may not force the insured to leave.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6634.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6520.\n\n134.\n\nIn Respondent's view, because the health insurance portfolio represents a mere collection of applications for public health insurance whose composition is mandated by law, it cannot be protected by the BIT.83\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6635.\n\n135.\n\nRespondent also contends, that even if the Tribunal finds that an investment has been made, Article 8(6) of the BIT as well as international arbitral practice require that an investment has been made \"in accordance with\" the laws of the host State.84 Respondent alleges that Claimant has breached three provisions of Slovak law in making its investment, and cannot now invoke the protections of the BIT:85\n\n(a) The Claimant, when establishing Union Healthcare's portfolio by means of recruiting brokers and other intermediary companies, was in breach of its duty not to provide false or misleading information, and harmed the legitimate rights of the insured.\n\n(b) The Claimant, by its aggressive campaign aiming at the acquisition of new insured, harmed the legitimate rights of the other health insurers and was in breach of the rules on fair competition.\n\n(c) The Claimant, when recruiting brokers and other intermediary companies for the acquisition of the insured breached the rules on public procurement, as Union Healthcare is a legal entity pursuing a public function.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6636.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6638 [footnotes omitted].\n\n136.\n\nRespondent first alleges that Claimant disseminated incorrect and misleading information to beneficiaries, bribed prospective beneficiaries and benefited from illegal advantages in contravention of Act No. 581/2004 Coll., an Act making it illegal to use \"untrue or misleading information, conceal important facts and offer advantages that cannot be assured, when promoting its activity.\"86 Respondent contends that in 2006, 5,782 complaints were filed against Union Healthcare in connection with beneficiaries who claimed that Union Healthcare had conducted an \"unauthorised\" transfer of health insurers or that it had offered \"false or misleading information.\" Respondent submits that 69 percent of these complaints were justified and that in connection with Claimant's breach of Section 6(13) of Act No. 581/2004 Coll., Claimant was fined SKK 3,000,000.87\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6641, Exhibit R-71: Section 6(13) of Act No. 581/2004 Coll.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6642.\n\n137.\n\nRespondent argues next that by providing both directly, and through its brokers, \"misleading information about itself and other health insurance companies\" to beneficiaries, Claimant violated the Slovak Republic's competition law, which prohibits health insurance companies from breaching the standards of \"economic competition.\"88 As a consequence, according to Respondent, two privately owned insurance companies filed complaints against Union Healthcare, which Claimant settled. Respondent argues that the fact that Claimant concluded a settlement with the companies reveals that it \"admitted\" its breaches of Slovak law.89 Respondent observes that it \"can hardly imagine any other reason\" why Claimant would have concluded the settlement and notes that Claimant declined the opportunity to provide the terms of the settlement agreement during document production.90\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6646-648; Exhibit R-79: Section 41 of Act No. 513/1991 Coll., Commercial Code.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6649-650.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6220.\n\n138.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that Claimant violated Respondent's mandatory procurement laws.91 According to Respondent, all public entities are required to undergo the public procurement process for purchases exceeding a certain value. Respondent submits that Claimant breached this obligation by concluding contracts with brokers in excess of that value.92 In doing so, Respondent argues that Claimant was able to use brokers' services to attract more beneficiaries than it could have legally obtained had it participated in the procurement process which typically takes eight months.93\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6652-657; Exhibit R-165: Section 9(1) of Act No. 25/2006 Coll., Public Procurement Act.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6655.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6656;\n\n139.\n\nRespondent concludes that because Claimant's investment has not been made in accordance with Slovak law or the principle of good faith, the Tribunal should not hear the dispute.94\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6662.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n140.\n\nClaimant argues that its insurance portfolio is a proper object of ownership and protection under the BIT, to which it \"legitimately acquired\" rights.95 Claimant recalls that the explanatory note to Act 581/2004, upon which Claimant relied in making its investment, stipulated that investors could hold ownership rights in their portfolios:96\n\nGiven that health insurance companies are players in the insurance market, it is possible that insurance portfolio, as a set of executed and valid insurance contracts/policies will be the subject of trading between health insurance companies.\n\nClaimant further points out that the Slovak Constitutional Court has recently reaffirmed that an investment portfolio may be owned by an investor.97\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b676, 258.\n\nExhibit C-19, cited in Claimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b679.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b678; Exhibit C-135, Exhibit C-136, Exhibit C-143.\n\n141.\n\nClaimant argues that it can additionally justify its reasoning that the insurance portfolio is an asset capable of private ownership, by reference to the letter dated 23 November 2009 from the European Commission, in which the EC concluded that the ban on transfer of the insurance portfolios \"constitutes a breach of the freedom of establishment guaranteed by Article 43 EC.\"98\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b680; Exhibit C-131.\n\n142.\n\nClaimant denies that it has offered incorrect and misleading information to prospective beneficiaries.99 First, Claimant points out that even if all 5,782 complaints against it were legitimate, this figure amounts to a marginal percentage, of only 1.25 percent, of Claimant's total portfolio which is comprised of 462,169 beneficiaries. In addition, Claimant contends that its application process rigorously screened for irregularities and that any beneficiary, who complained of the transfer or established that he or she had not applied to join Union, would have had his or her previous insurance restored.100 Claimant further points out that although it was fined in the amount that Respondent contends, the Slovak Supreme Court has recently overturned the imposed fine.101\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6121-126.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6123.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6270, Exhibit C-135, Exhibit C-136, Exhibit C-143, Exhibit C-144.\n\n143.\n\nClaimant also denies that it has violated any competition laws in the Slovak Republic.102 According to Claimant, the settlement with its competitors does not, contrary to Respondent's allegation, \"include or imply any admission of liability on the part of either D\u00f4vera or Union.\"103\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6125.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6126.\n\n144.\n\nClaimant also refutes Respondent's contention that it has violated any laws in its use of brokers. Claimant submits that it had instructed all of its brokers on applicable Slovak law and supplied them with a standard broker's contract that it submitted to the Tribunal and Respondent as an exhibit during the document production phase of these proceedings.104\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6125; Exhibit C-147.\n\n145.\n\nIn any case, Eureko argues that it is the *establishment* of an investment and not its *performance* that is relevant for assessing whether it is in compliance with the law of the host state and the BIT.105 Claimant submits that its investment was established in accordance with the laws of the Slovak Republic, a fact that it claims Respondent has not disputed.106 According to Claimant, the fact that it has a license to operate a health insurance company in the Slovak Republic, which the Slovak Republic has never challenged,107 indicates the Slovak Republic's acceptance of its investment.108 Consequently, Claimant contends that even if any of the allegations advanced by Respondent are true, they would not result in Claimant's loss of protection under the BIT.109\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6256-269.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6259.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6265.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6260.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6262.\n\n146.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to decide that it needs to determine whether the performance of the investment has been legal, Claimant points out that: (i) only breaches of fundamental norms of a legal order, and not minor infractions, may have the effect of depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction; (ii) none of the allegations have caused the Slovak authorities to challenge Union's legality or licence since 2006; (iii) the fine has been overturned by the Supreme Court; (iv) any disputes between Union and other private health insurers are irrelevant; (v) the procurement allegations are entirely unsubstantiated and have never been investigated; (vi) in any event, all of the alleged breaches of Slovak law are subject to a limitation period of three years which would now have lapsed.110\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6267-269.\n\n**B. The Parties' Arguments on Jurisdiction and the Scope of Substantive EU Law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n147.\n\nRespondent raises a further objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction based on the interaction of the BIT with the substantive provisions of EU law. Although Respondent recognises that the Tribunal has ruled that the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU has not terminated the Treaty, Respondent submits that the Tribunal nevertheless lacks jurisdiction as Articles 3, 4, and 5 of the BIT are inapplicable due to the supremacy of EU law.111\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6401.\n\n148.\n\nRespondent bases this objection on the Tribunal's statement, in its Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability, and Suspension that \"[t]he Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to rule on alleged breaches of EU law as such.\"112 In Respondent's view, the Tribunal recognised that the substantive protections of EU law overlap significantly with the protections offered by the BIT, that EU principles (including supremacy) apply where EU law is involved, and that the Tribunal is only entitled under the doctrine of *acte clair* to apply EU law where the application of such law is clear.113 The ECJ, Respondent argues, has clearly ruled that the \"[EEC] Treaty takes precedence over agreements concluded between Member States before its entry into force.\"114 And the application of the *acte clair* doctrine, Respondent submits, follows from the Tribunal's statements in its Award on Jurisdiction that it had the power to apply EU law, but not to rule on breaches of EU law \"as such.\"115\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6405, quoting Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability, and Suspension, \u00b6290. (The full quotation, given that Eureko's claims were and remain based on the BIT, reads materially as follows: \"On the other hand, the Tribunal notes that its jurisdiction is confined to ruling upon alleged breaches of the BIT. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to rule upon alleged breaches of EU law as such...\")\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6406.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6208, quoting *Annunziata Matteucci v. Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise of Belgium* *and Commissariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux relations internationales of the Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise of Belgium* (ECJ, 235/87), Judgement, 27 September 1988, \u00b622.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6210.\n\n149.\n\nWith respect to specific provisions of the BIT, Respondent argues (i) that the provisions on the free movement of capital are duplicated in EU law and the BIT, and the ECJ has not ruled on whether restrictions on the distribution of profits from public health insurance would breach EU law;116 (ii) that the BIT's protection of \"assets and investments\" from expropriation overlaps with EU law's narrower protection of \"possessions and property,\" but that shares in a joint stock company fall within the narrower category and are covered by EU law;117 (iii) that the BIT's provisions on fair and equitable treatment are covered by the EU law concepts of free movement of capital, non-discrimination, freedom of establishment, and protection of legitimate expectations;118 and (iv) that the BIT's provision on \"full protection and security is partly afforded by provisions on the freedom of establishment under EU law.\"119 In sum, Respondent submits that \"the subject matter of the dispute is governed by EU law,\" which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to invoke due to insufficient clarity as to the manner of its application.120\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6409-10.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6411-14.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6415-20.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6422.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6399.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n150.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent has mischaracterised the relationship between EU law and the substantive provisions of the BIT; in Claimant's view, the Tribunal retains jurisdiction to rule on claims brought pursuant to the BIT.121 According to Claimant, the issue is not whether EU law overlaps with the protections of the BIT, but whether it is \"incompatible\" with the BIT under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.122 Such \"incompatibility arises *only* when one treaty prescribes or mandates conduct that, if executed, breaches the terms of a second treaty\";123 and \"While EU law is superior to national law,\" Claimant notes, \"it is not superior to other (instruments of) international law.\"124 Moreover, incompatibility as a matter of treaty law is only relevant when it pertains to the actual circumstances of a dispute. According to Claimant, \"[t]he mere existence of a theoretical incompatibility that is unconnected to the specific facts and circumstances at hand\" will not prevent the applicability of both treaties.125 This stems from the basic principle that \"states should honour their treaty obligations to the largest extent possible.\"126\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6173-75.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6304-05.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6310.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6178.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6311.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6312.\n\n151.\n\nIn Claimant's view, Respondent has not only failed to demonstrate actual incompatibility between the BIT and provisions of EU law in the circumstances of this case, but ignores the Tribunal's decision in its Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension that the protections of the BIT are not incompatible with EU law.127 Claimant further notes the Tribunal's recognition that \"[f]ar from being precluded from considering EU law the Tribunal is bound to apply it to the extent that it is part of the applicable law(s)...\"128 Respondent's attempt to invoke the *acte clair* doctrine, Claimant argues, is an inapposite attempt to apply a doctrine developed solely to govern when national courts are required to refer questions of EU law to the ECJ, a power not granted to arbitral tribunals in any event.129\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6180-81.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6177, quoting Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, \u00b6281.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6185.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal's jurisdiction is based upon the BIT, namely the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Republic, which was signed on 29 April 1991 and entered into force on 1 October 1992. It is common ground that the Slovak Republic became a Party to that Treaty upon the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, in accordance with the joint declaration made by the Netherlands and the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic, and that as a matter of international law the Treaty was thereafter in force at all material times.\n\n153.\n\nRespondent challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on a number of grounds, set out in its Statement of Defence dated 30 October 2009. In summary, the grounds were (i) that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the dispute because of the dispute's intra-EU character, which rendered it subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the EU, and (ii) that Eureko had not presented sufficient facts to establish that the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae*.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed the first, \u2018intra-EU', objection to jurisdiction in its Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, dated 26 October 2010. That Award is final and binding upon the Parties, in accordance with Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules and the *lex loci arbitri*. The Tribunal accordingly rejects Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on the applicability of EU law.\n\n155.\n\nAs to the second objection to jurisdiction, in its Statement of Defence, Respondent disputed that Eureko had standing or has made an investment in the territory of the Slovak Republic.130 Provision was made in Procedural Order No. 2, dated 3 December 2009,131 for the disclosure of documents relating to this jurisdictional objection. Various documents were produced in accordance with these provisions.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6125, 126.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, \u00b63.\n\n156.\n\nIn the telephone conference on 8 April 2010, Respondent confirmed that it had no *ratione personae* jurisdictional objections.132\n\nSummary of Teleconference of 8 April 2010, \u00b64.\n\n157.\n\nRespondent's *ratione materiae* objection has two elements. The first element relates to the question of what may be counted as an investment. Respondent says that \"The alleged investment made by the Claimant relates not only to the ownership of its subsidiary, Union Healthcare, but also, according to Claimant's own statements to Union Healthcare's portfolio,\"133 and that \"[T]he health insurance portfolio cannot be considered as an \"asset\" in the sense of Article 1(a) of the BIT.\"134\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6633.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6634.\n\n158.\n\nArticle 1(a) of the Treaty defines \"investments\" as:\n\nevery kind of asset invested either directly or indirectly through an investor of a third State and more particularly, though not exclusively:\n\ni. movable and immovable property and all related property rights;\n\nii. shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures, as well as rights derived therefrom;\n\niii. title to money and other assets and to any performance having an economic value;\n\niv. rights in the field of intellectual property, also including technical processes, goodwill and know-how;\n\nv. concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Eureko clearly made an investment in the Slovak Republic within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the Treaty. It did so by incorporating its subsidiary company, Union Healthcare, in the Slovak Republic on 9 March 2006, in which Eureko held, and still holds, 100% of the shares.135 That is an investment within the meaning of Article 1(a)(ii) of the Treaty. That shareholding (as well as rights derived therefrom) is a sufficient basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* ; and it follows that the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Article 8 of the Treaty exists in respect of that shareholding.\n\nSee paragraph 90 above.\n\n160.\n\nHaving determined that Eureko made an investment in the form of its shareholding in Union Healthcare it is, strictly speaking, unnecessary to consider whether Union Healthcare's portfolio is in itself capable of constituting an \"asset\" for the purposes of Article 1(a) of the Treaty. As Respondent explicitly recognised, the shares of Union Healthcare were, at least from one perspective, a vehicle for the possession of the insurance portfolio.136 Whatever value the portfolio might have had will be taken into account by assessing the value of Union Healthcare, which was both the investment made by Claimant and the addressee of the measures of which Claimant complains.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6214.\n\n161.\n\nIn any event, the insurance portfolio is an asset akin to goodwill, which is included in the non-exclusive list of assets in Article 1(a)(iv) of the Treaty. Both goodwill and the insurance portfolio are commercial assets that result from an investment in the cultivation of the loyalty of a pool of customers; and the very fact of the adoption of the ban on transfers indicates that as a matter of Slovak law an insurance portfolio could in principle have been sold by one insurer to another.137\n\nSee paragraph 99 above.\n\n162.\n\nThe second element of Respondent's jurisdictional objection *ratione materiae* is the argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the investment was made in violation of the law of the Slovak Republic. More specifically, it says that Union Healthcare's insurance portfolio was acquired in breach of Slovak law,138 and that Claimant therefore cannot claim any breach of the Treaty that would relate to the portfolio and is not entitled to any damages regarding the alleged value of the portfolio.139\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6636-664; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6214-220.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6640.\n\n163.\n\nRespondent says that in order to acquire a large client portfolio Union Healthcare engaged in (i) the dissemination of incorrect and misleading information about other health insurers; (ii) bribing the insured; (iii) offering illegal advantages in connection with public health insurance, all contrary to Act No. 581/2004 Coll.140 It cites in this regard the imposition by the Slovak Republic's Health Care Surveillance Authority of a number of fines on Union Healthcare,141 in connection with reported malpractice by brokers soliciting applications for insurance on behalf of Union Healthcare,142 and the number of complaints received by the Heath Care Surveillance Authority concerning Union Healthcare.143\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6642.\n\nCertain fines were cancelled on appeal: see, e.g., the decision of the Supreme Court dated 8 December 2008, Exhibit C-144.\n\nSee Exhibits R-155, R-166, R-167, R-168, R-169.\n\nExhibit R-170; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6643.\n\n164.\n\nRespondent also says that Union Healthcare violated the rights of other, competing, health insurers by unfair practices contrary to Section 41 of the Commercial Code, and in 2008 settled a legal action brought against it by other insurers.144 And further, it says that Union Healthcare failed to comply with the requirements of Slovak law concerning public procurement.145\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6646-650.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6652-657.\n\n165.\n\nRespondent argues that the Treaty guarantees protection only to investments that are made in accordance with the host State law. It cites Article 2 of the Treaty, which provides that \"Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall admit such investments in accordance with its provisions of law.\"\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal construes this provision differently. Article 2 of the Treaty is concerned with the duty of each State Party to promote inward investment, and to admit investments in accordance with its law, where those investments are made by investors of the other State Party. Article 2 does not purport to qualify the definition of an investment. That definition is set out in Article 1(a) of the Treaty (set out in paragraph 158, above) which, unlike provisions in certain other bilateral investment treaties, does not contain a requirement that investments be made \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" of the host State.\n\n167.\n\nRespondent has a further argument: that \"extensive and uniform\" international arbitral practice establishes that \"only investments made in full compliance with the laws of the host State\" and made in good faith benefit from protection under a BIT.146 It cites the awards in *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. the Czech Republic*,147 and *Inceysa*  *Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* in support of its argument.148\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6637.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. the Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, \u00b6\u00b6101, 106-107 (hereinafter \" ***Phoenix Action*** \").\n\n*Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006, \u00b6230.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal is not free to rewrite the Treaty: it must interpret and apply the text adopted by the Parties; and it cannot decide their dispute as *amiable compositeur* or *ex aequo et bono* (no such authority having been granted to the Tribunal under Article 33(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules). The questions to be answered here are (i) whether it is proper to read into the definition of an investment in Article 1(a) of the Treaty a requirement that every investment within the meaning of the Treaty be made \u2018in accordance with the laws and regulations' of the host State, or (ii) whether the undoubted principle that the Treaty must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the principle of good faith entails a similar conclusion. That is an exercise that is governed by international law and the law of treaties.\n\n169.\n\nThe rules on treaty interpretation, set out in Articles 31-33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,149 are familiar. The basic rule is that the treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\nBoth the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic were Parties to the Vienna Convention when the Treaty was signed. The Slovak Republic subsequently succeeded to the Vienna Convention.\n\n170.\n\nThe Treaty is intended, as its title and Preamble make clear, to record the agreement of the Parties upon the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments. The definition of an investment in Article 1(a) does not expressly stipulate that the investment must have been made in accordance with the laws of the host State in order that the investment be protected by the Treaty. But in the view of the Tribunal, it is wholly unreasonable to suppose that the Parties could have intended to protect investments that violate, for example, a prohibition on foreign investment in a specified sector of the economy. The terms of the Treaty could not be interpreted in good faith to require such protection.\n\n171.\n\nOn the other hand, it is in the view of the Tribunal entirely reasonable to interpret the terms of Article 1(a) without reading in a requirement that there must be no infraction of the host State's law in the course of the making of the investment, if the investment is to be within the scope of the Treaty protection.\n\n172.\n\nThat distinction, between compliance with laws that limit the scope of permissible investments and compliance with each and every law of the host State, appears to underlie the decisions of other tribunals. In *Phoenix Action* the Tribunal said that:\n\nIf a State, for example, restricts foreign investment in a sector of its economy and a foreign investor disregards such restriction, the investment concerned cannot be protected under the ICSID/BIT system. These are illegal investments according to the national law of the host State and cannot be protected through an ICSID arbitral process. And it is the Tribunal's view that this condition - the conformity of the establishment of the investment with the national laws - is implicit even when not expressly stated in the relevant BIT.150\n\n*Phoenix Action*, \u00b6101.\n\n173.\n\nThat passage makes evident the focus of the *Phoenix Action* tribunal upon circumstances in which foreign investment in a particular sector is prohibited or restricted by the law of the host State. The illegality resulting from the violation of some such prohibition or restriction cannot, however, be equated with the illegality that is common to each and every violation of the host State's law that may occur in the context of the making of an investment. The (hypothetical) fact that a Union Healthcare broker committed a road traffic offence while driving to a client would clearly not render the investment \"illegal\" for the purposes of any implicit requirement of legality, although (as already stated) violation of a prohibition on foreign investment in a particular economic sector would do so.\n\n174.\n\nWhich side of the line are the violations that Union Healthcare was found or said to have committed? There is no suggestion in the present case that it was unlawful *per se* for Eureko to make an investment in the health insurance sector. Respondent's point is that some aspects of the specific manner in which the investment was made constituted violations of Slovak law. While any violation of a State's laws is a matter to be taken seriously, not all violations have or should be given the same legal consequences.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Respondent has fined Union Healthcare for the misconduct of its brokers, that no action appears to have been taken in respect of the alleged breach of the rules on public procurement, and that the legal claims of other insurers arising from alleged violations of the fair competition rules were settled. More particularly, Union Healthcare has since 2006 operated under a licence granted by Respondent, and no attempt has been made to cancel or revoke that licence. It does not appear that the authorities in the Slovak Republic have taken the view that the violations referred to or alleged by Respondent (whose account is challenged by Claimant)151 are of such a kind, or of such a degree of seriousness, as to require the cancellation or termination of the investment.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6267-273.\n\n176.\n\nA tribunal should be very slow indeed to decide that the interpretation in good faith of a definition of an investment, particularly a definition that contains no express \u2018in accordance with the laws and regulations' stipulation, requires that the making of the investment must have involved no infraction (however peripheral or incidental) of the host State's law. The Tribunal finds no warrant for reading any such requirement into Article 1(a). Further, the Tribunal does not consider that the violations of Slovak law alleged in the present case are of a nature that fall into the same category as a violation of a prohibition on foreign investment in a particular sector. The fact that the Slovak Republic has not revoked Union Healthcare's licence is, in the view of the Tribunal, a highly significant indication that it regards the alleged violations as compatible with the continued existence of the investment and also powerful confirmation that a good faith interpretation of Article 1(a) of the Treaty does not require the exclusion of Claimant's investment from its scope.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly rejects Respondent's argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the investment was made in violation of the law of the Slovak Republic. This conclusion goes to the question of the jurisdictional objection. The present Tribunal is aware that in other cases tribunals have considered whether an investment that satisfies the jurisdictional requirements *ratione materiae* of a BIT may yet be denied protection under that BIT because, for example, the investor acted in bad faith by resorting to fraud or corruption in order to make the investment.152 The Tribunal has considered whether the established or alleged violations of Slovak law similarly require the denial of protection to the investor under the Treaty, and it has concluded that they do not. Appropriate remedial steps have been taken by Respondent, according to its own laws, in respect of the violations; no violation of fundamental principles of probity or public policy is alleged, such as exists in cases of material corruption or deceit by an investor; and the Tribunal concludes that there is no basis for the denial of the benefits of protection under the Treaty.\n\n*World Duty Free v. Kenya*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, 4 October 2006; *Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008.\n\n178.\n\nRespondent also argued that \"future investments, which are only planned but were not conducted, are not protected by the BIT.\" It says that \"the BIT does not protect investments which never occurred, and much less still, the profits that these hypothetical investments could have generated.153\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b639.\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this is a question of the existence or quantum of any recoverable loss, rather than of jurisdiction. The question might typically arise in the context of a claim for loss of expected profits; and in that context distinctions might have to be drawn between a continuing investment in the planned development of an existing project and an investment in a new and distinct project. But it is not necessary to consider such questions in the present context, because the Tribunal has already satisfied itself that it has jurisdiction on the basis of the investment made by Claimant. It accordingly rejects this argument in so far as it is raised as an objection to jurisdiction.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly rejects all of Respondent's objections to its jurisdiction.\n\n**VII. THE PARTIES' CHARACTERISATION OF THE FACTUAL RECORD**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nWhile the Parties are in agreement with respect to the basic content of the Slovak legislation introduced in 2004 and 2006/2007 and set forth in the above statement of facts (see above at paragraph 76ff), they differ significantly with respect to the implications of these developments. In particular, they differ as to the degree to which the 2004 Reform marked a departure from the Slovak Republic's previous health insurance framework; the policy underpinnings of the 2004 Reform and the relation between the 2004 Reform and Claimant's decision to invest in Union Healthcare; and the political landscape which led to the reversal of the 2004 legislation in the 2007 Reforms. The following sections summarise their respective accounts.\n\n**A. The Parties' Characterisation of the 2004 Reform**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n182.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the series of legislative reforms enacted in 2004 represented a \"fundamental change\" in the legal framework regulating health insurance in the Slovak Republic, introducing a \"wide ranging\" and \"competitive market place in which profits could be made\" and health insurers would operate as commercial businesses.154 In Claimant's view, this transformation involved (i) permitting companies to use their discretion in the distribution of profits, including in distributing surpluses as dividends; (ii) giving companies the opportunity to make independent decisions regarding the allocations of their budgets, such as the relative amounts to be dedicated to administrative and other fixed costs; and (iii) allowing companies to compete for clients.155 In Claimant's view, the 2004 Reform envisaged the overhaul of a heavily indebted public health insurance system and its replacement with a private and competitive one. Competition within this system was managed through the creation of \"an independent Health Care Authority with a fully independent executive board.\"156\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b620.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6III.16.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b638, 44.\n\n183.\n\nClaimant contends that in light of Respondent's accession on 1 May 2004 to the European Union and its adoption of the Euro on 1 January 2009,157 the changes seemed to represent a \"natural evolution in the development of a health care system\" which Claimant regarded as \"irreversible.\"158 These reforms, Claimant submits, were \"instrumental in making investment in the Slovak health insurance sector attractive to Eureko.\"159\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b619.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b665.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6III.15.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n184.\n\nRespondent disagrees with Claimant's characterisation of both the scope and objective of the 2004 Reform. In Respondent's view, the 2004 Reform was never intended to replace the public health insurance framework of the Slovak Republic with a private, competitive one.160 Rather, Respondent contends that Slovak public health insurance has always operated in accordance with certain \"fundamental principles\"161 which have not significantly changed since 1993 (being the date when Respondent became an independent State).162 In short, this comprises a system in which citizens are mandatorily insured and pay health insurance levies in an amount fixed by statute (with the State paying the levies for a portion of the population). The extent of coverage provided is established by law; insurers are not free to reject applicants; and the relationship between insurer and insured is based on statute, not contract.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6112-115.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b614.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b627.\n\n185.\n\nRather than change these characteristics entirely, Respondent considers that the 2004 Reform aimed to introduce \"a number of limited amendments into the healthcare insurance system to enhance managed competition within the system,\"163 and to redress inefficiencies which had accumulated in its operation over the years, specifically, a large accumulated deficit164 and a lack of transparency.165 In Respondent's view, Claimant greatly exaggerates the magnitude of the changes introduced, as the majority of legislation either amended already existing provisions or introduced minor changes.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b627.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b616.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b617.\n\n186.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant is mistaken in its assumption that the conversion of public health insurance providers into joint stock entities had as its purpose the creation of companies \"capable of generating profit and functioning in a competitive environment.\"166 Instead, Respondent argues, the 2004 Reform had the more modest goal of forcing health insurance companies to improve budget transparency by introducing balance sheet accounting requirements and corporate governance rules.167 In support of its argument, Respondent submits that under Slovak law, the legal difference between a health insurer \"\u2018 *sui generis* ' and a health insurer as a joint stock company, relates to the accounting methods used by joint stock companies and the manner in which they manage the premiums they hold.\"168 In Respondent's view, this is merely a technical difference which does not speak to the fundamental character and purpose of a health insurance company: the Slovak Commercial Code provides that a joint-stock company may function for a purpose other than the generation of profits, with the provision of public health insurance being one such purpose.169 Respondent argues that the \"privatisation of health insurers never occurred, nor should it have occurred.\"170\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6112.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6113.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6116.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6117.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6125.\n\n187.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant also exaggerates the independence of the Health Care Authority. Respondent notes that the Authority had always been responsible to the Ministry of Health, which decides policy, and that the Authority is merely an organ for implementing the policy of the Ministry of Health and \"executing the surveillance of the sector under strict conditions set by law and as such is not independent.\"171 Respondent observes that in light of the backgrounds of the individuals previously appointed to the post, Claimant should have been on notice that the Authority was not politically independent.172\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6128.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6130.\n\n188.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that Claimant makes other errors in its description of the changes introduced by the 2004 Reform. Respondent contends that (i) insurance companies always had the option of selectively contracting with health care providers, as long as the provider was properly licensed;173 (ii) beneficiaries did not gain the right to switch insurance companies once a year with the introduction of the 2004 Reform, because the right had existed in the Slovak system since 1995, and could be exercised once every six months instead of once a year as under the 2004 Reform;174 and (iii) the scope of the mandatory health package was never actually reduced.175\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6131-134.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6135-136.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6139.\n\n**B. Eureko's Investment and the Political Situation in 2004 and 2006**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n189.\n\nClaimant contends that in deciding to invest in the Slovak Republic, it \"acted upon a well thought-out identification of an opportunity to invest,\"176 and the expectation that the 2004 Reform would constitute an enduring change. Claimant submits that this expectation was justified by its experience in other European markets and by statements from the Slovak Health Minister, Mr Rudolf Zajac, made prior to Eureko's investment.177 Claimant refers to the testimony of Mr Willem van Duin, then a member of Eureko's board, that:178\n\nEureko was prepared to further invest in the Slovak Republic because it was confident that it had acquired sufficient knowledge of the country, market and legislative framework to be confident that the making of a long term investment -which is the nature of investments in the insurance industry - would be opportune and pay off. In this respect, Eureko took into account the Slovak Government's statements, the Slovak Republic's EU aspirations and later EU membership, the EU and national legal framework and also the manner in which it would be able to take recourse if the investments would be impaired.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b664.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b664.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b678; Witness Statement by Mr. Willem van Duin (Exhibit CW-1), \u00b611.\n\n190.\n\nClaimant submits that its decision to invest closely followed the adoption of the 2004 Reform.179 According to Claimant, interviews with Slovak officials conducted near the time of its investment shed light on the Slovak Republic's intentions in enacting the 2004 legislation. Claimant recounts a \"specific invitation\" to invest made by Minister Zajac in December 2004, during which he \"made considerable efforts to explain the basis of the new health care legislation.\"180 In public statements in 2005, Minister Zajac further emphasised that the 2004 Reform was intended to \"open doors for private investors into state-owned health insurance companies.\"181\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b670.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b681.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b637.\n\n191.\n\nClaimant concedes that it expected a return on its investment that would be \"marginal in terms of percentage of premium income,\" but argues that this was nonetheless an appealing prospect insofar as premium amounts were generally substantial.182 Although cross-selling the products of Union Insurance was an element of Eureko's anticipated business model, Claimant submits that it had planned for Union Healthcare to provide \"independent profit generation.\"183 According to Claimant, the yearly profits attributable to cross-selling never exceeded \u20ac105,000.184\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b681; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6108-110.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b684; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6131-134.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b684; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6131-134.\n\n192.\n\nClaimant filed for registration with the Slovak Healthcare Authority in 2005, before \"the elections and any announcement thereof\"185 and further maintains that the prospect of elections in 2006 did not upset its calculations.186 The outcome of an election is never certain187 and, according to Claimant, \"SMER itself focused on the abolishment of user fees\" during its campaign, rather than more fundamental changes.188 Most of SMER's potential coalition partners did not oppose at least the core provisions of the 2004 Reform189 and a majority of the ultimate coalition was comprised of parties that had supported the 2004 Reform.190 It was not until December 2006, Claimant argues\u2014 after it had established Union Healthcare and made a substantial investment\u2014that Eureko could have appreciated the extent of the changes being contemplated.191 On 9 December 2006, the Chairman of the Slovak Parliament, Mr Paska, publicly expressed the position that \"all public funds should be under public control.\"192 Prior to that point, Claimant observes, the coalition manifesto stated that the Government would not fundamentally alter the legal framework established by the 2004 Reform;193 and, upon request by Eureko, the acting Slovak Minister of Health, Mr Valentovi\u010d, confirmed that \"no systemic changes were imminent that would be at odds with Eureko's interests as an investor in the Slovak health insurance sector.\"194\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b690.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b636.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b634.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b693; Claimant's Reply on the Merits \u00b637.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b694.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b694; Claimant's Reply on the Merits \u00b637.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6III.37; Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6102; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b635.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6III.38.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b694;. Claimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6I.23-24; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b637, 42.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b694; Claimant's Reply on the Merits \u00b642.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n193.\n\nRespondent submits that, in light of all the circumstances, Claimant could not reasonably have believed that the 2004 Reform would remain in effect and that any such belief indicates a lack of due diligence.195 The 2004 Reform, Respondent notes, was extremely unpopular196 and by the time of the 2006 election, political parties opposing the 2004 Reform had a \"20% lead over parties who had supported the 2004 Acts.\"197 In Respondent's view, Claimant understates the predictability of the changes that were made with the 2007 Reforms and overstates the importance of the reassurances it claims to have received from the Respondent as regards the 2004 Reform. According to Respondent, \"Union Healthcare could have, and should have terminated its activities to avoid the consequences of expected regulation.\"198\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b650.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b649.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6369.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6365.\n\n194.\n\nFirst, Respondent contests the timeline of Claimant's investment. Although Claimant may have contemplated investing in 2004 and 2005, Respondent argues that Claimant did not in fact establish any investment before it obtained the \"licence to perform public health insurance\" on 13 February 2006.199 Union Healthcare, in turn, was registered only on 9 March 2006;200 and Claimant did not insure beneficiaries until September 2006, a date significantly later than the call for early elections which had been made on 9 February 2006.201\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6360.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6361.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6367.\n\n195.\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that Claimant misconstrues the significance of comments made by Mr Zajac, as well as the importance of Mr Zajac's presentations on the 2004 Reform.202 Mr Zajac's presentations, Respondent contends, were nothing more than a public description of how the new system would function and were not an attempt to induce foreign investors into the Slovak market.203 Respondent similarly discounts the importance of the January 2007 Letter from the former Minister of Health Mr Valentovi\u010d, insofar as it was written significantly after Claimant had made its investment.204\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6126; Reply on the Merits \u00b629.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6126.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6390.\n\n196.\n\nThird, Respondent submits that changes were to be expected in light of the Slovak political landscape. Respondent disagrees with Claimant's assessment that the main coalition partners of the new Government \"were in favour of a stability [sic] of at least the key pillars of the 2004 Liberalisation.\"205 The final coalition, Respondent contends, included 85 members out of 150 in Parliament who were against the 2004 Reform.206 In Respondent's view, \"only a blind businessman would have believed that such a coalition would allow public health insurers to retain the ability to distribute dividends from insurance levies.\"207\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6374.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6375.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6376.\n\n197.\n\nAll of these assessments, Respondent argues, are confirmed by Claimant's March 2006 Business Plan, which reveals an awareness of impending changes in the investment climate.208 Respondent cites the following excerpts from Claimant's 2006 plan:209\n\nOne could argue that due to the parliamentary elections in June 2006 it would be better to wait and see what changes a new government would introduce to the healthcare system before deciding whether to enter or not.\n\n[...]\n\nPolitical intervention after June 2006 elections could make the health insurance market less attractive and in the extreme see a renationalisation.\n\nOn the basis of this excerpt, Respondent argues that Eureko's assertion that it did not anticipate a changed legislative framework is \"at best, disingenuous.\"210\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b696.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b630; Exhibit C-14, pp. 1, 9.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b630.\n\n**C. Characterising the 2007 Reforms**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n198.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the 2007 Reforms represent a \"comprehensive policy with the ultimate aim to drive private investors out of the Slovak health insurance sector.\"211 The measures represented a \"turning of the tide\" and revealed a \"new attitude towards health insurance.\"212 In enacting these measures, Claimant contends the Government intended to re-concentrate control of the health insurance sector with the state,213 ultimately by establishing a single, public health insurance provider.214 Claimant points in particular to the rhetoric of Prime Minister Fico, to his statements that it is \"not normal\" for health insurance companies to make a profit,215 and to his professed intention to \"drive out private health insurance companies.\"216\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6103.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6III.32.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6III.36.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6III.44 and III.48.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6III.39.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6105.\n\n199.\n\nClaimant disputes that this shift in the investment climate from \"highly favourable\" to \"extremely hostile\" was underpinned by any economic rationale.217 In general, Claimant submits that Respondent's policy explanation for the change amounts to \"unsupported assertions about cost overruns and escalation in the health care system, destabilising effects of the 2004 Reforms and various forms of illegal conduct and misbehaviour by private parties active in the Slovak Health Insurance Market.\"218 Respondent further, in Claimant's view, resorts to \"discrediting Eureko's general economic and business understanding\" through assertions that are themselves \"defamatory.\"219 Rather than engage with what it considers to be speculative arguments, Claimant submits that it is \"not necessary to debate the economic rationale of the health care system at length.\"220 According to Claimant, the Parties are in agreement that consideration of the policy rationale for the 2007 Reforms is unnecessary to the matter before the Tribunal.221\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6III.56.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6138.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6168.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6163.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6163.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n200.\n\nRespondent disputes both Claimant's characterisation of the 2007 Reforms and the assertion that the Tribunal need not examine the policy rationale behind the Reforms. The reasonableness of the changes, Respondent argues, relates directly to the question of Claimant's expectations and Respondent's contention that the measures fall within the ambit of Respondent's regulatory discretion. In Respondent's words, \"[a] proper and legitimate health insurance policy outlines what is commonly acceptable in a country that has a public health insurance system and on which a reasonable investor should count.\"222\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b651.\n\n201.\n\nThe 2007 Reforms, Respondent argues, were crafted to address problems arising from the 2004 Reform \"that jeopardised the whole system.\"223 The effort took place against the background of what remained after 2004 a *public* health care system\u2014not a privatised one\u2014insofar as health insurance remained the subject of a mandatory government levy. The Slovak Republic, accordingly, remained responsible for the system. According to Respondent, \"[t]he fact that the health insurance system continued to exist as a public health insurance system during the period of effectiveness of the 2004 Acts is of enormous importance in deciding what changes Respondent is entitled to make in this field.\"224\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6183.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b659.\n\n202.\n\nRespondent submits that the 2004 Reform attempted to introduce a system of managed competition, yet failed to appreciate the need for managed competition in health insurance \"to be heavily regulated to avoid adverse risks,\" in particular the risk that \"a health insurer will maximise its efforts to cut costs at the expense of the quality of health care.\"225 Among the defects of the 2004 Reform identified by Respondent was the introduction of a profit provision into an underfinanced system in which the generation of profits was structurally impossible without adverse effects.226 Because health insurance levies were fixed by law, insurers' only options to reduce expenditures were to lower the prices paid to health care providers, limit the provision of health care by providers, or employ marketing to acquire a healthier portfolio of insurees.227 Respondent takes particular issue with the contracts entered into with health insurance providers, which imposed annual limits on the amount of care that would be covered and employed a \"degressive rate,\" reimbursing providers at a lower marginal rate as additional patients were cared for. Respondent characterises these practices as \"unsafe,\" leading to the generation of profits \"to the detriment of patients who are not provided with care despite having paid their levies\" or to health care providers who may go uncompensated for duly provided care.228 The ban on profits was introduced in 2007 in response to the failure of elements in the 2004 Reform to enforce a duty to provide continuous care.229 Notably, Respondent observes, comparable systems (in which multiple health insurers are permitted, but prevented from generating profits) are found in other European countries.230\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6148-49.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6153-58.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6174.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6175-78.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6196-98; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b694.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b678.\n\n203.\n\nRespondent further draws attention to the amended network requirements of the 2004 Reform, which gave insurers greater flexibility in contracting with health providers. The effect of this provision, Respondent argues, was to give insurers a \"disproportionately strong bargaining position\" vis-\u00e0-vis providers.231 This weakened the position of providers to the extent that they had no choice but to accept disadvantageous contracts that drove up debts among providers. Respondent emphasises that the 2004 network requirements were based on specialisation, rather than facility, making it difficult for providers to offer coordinated care; while an insurer's network would include a full range of specialists, they would be scattered at different facilities throughout a region and unable to work together.232 Additionally, Respondent submits that insurers prioritised cost over quality in placing contracts with health providers.233 The amended network requirements, in Respondent's view, were created to address these problems.234 However, while health insurance companies were obliged to contract with a specific \"minimum network\" of health care providers under the 2007 Reforms, Respondent notes that this did not prevent them from recommending doctors and specialists outside the minimum network to their insured.235\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6202\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6205.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6202.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6279-83.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6286.\n\n204.\n\nOther aspects of the 2007 Reforms, Respondent argues, were equally in the public interest and directed at identified problems stemming from the 2004 Reform. The cap on operating expenses was intended to halt a \"wasteful drain of public resources from the public health insurance system\" and address a situation in which the private insurers all indicated substantially higher operating costs than the State-owned insurance companies.236 The ban on brokers sought to remedy what Respondent characterises as the large number of complaints concerning the unfair or illegal practices of brokers.237 Adjusting the percentage of health insurance levies subject to redistribution, Respondent argues, was an appropriate response to the efforts of insurers to attract a healthier (and accordingly, more profitable) portfolio, notwithstanding their obligation to accept any applicant. Redistribution rates in the Slovak Republic have changed many times previously, and a number of European states in fact redistribute 100 percent of health insurance levies. Finally, according to Respondent, the ban on transferring insurance portfolios was justifiably intended to protect patients' rights, preventing the situation in which an individual might be transferred involuntarily from one insurer to another and forced in the process to change doctors to those in the network of the new insurer.238 The ban does not, Respondent emphasises, prevent the transfer of an insurer's interest in other ways that preserve established relationships between patients and their doctors.239\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6213, 289.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6302-04.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6310.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6311-12.\n\n205.\n\nFor a further group of the 2007 Reforms, Respondent denies that they in fact represent significant changes. In Respondent's view, the office of the Chairman of the Health Care Authority was not politicised by the 2007 Reforms; Respondent notes that the Regulator was at all times a political appointee and submits Claimant exaggerates the independence of the Regulator under the 2004 Reform.240 Similarly, Respondent contends that enhancing budget scrutiny over insurance companies did not significantly change Claimant's existing legal obligations to report on its business241 and amounted to nothing more than an additional \"administrative duty\" on Claimant.242 Even before the 2007 Reforms, Claimant had been required to send an annual \"[r]eport on the fulfilment of the budget for the other subjects of public administration\" to the State Treasury.243 Finally, Respondent notes, the solvency requirements of the 2007 Reforms \"merely serve[] to confirm the fulfilment of the Claimant's previously existing obligation to cover its due liabilities.\"244 Only in the event that Claimant neither challenges nor pays an invoice is the mechanism for solvency sanctions triggered.245\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6330.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6333-337.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6337.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6336.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6345.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6347.\n\n**D. The Significance of the Slovak Constitutional Court Decision**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n206.\n\nIn striking down the ban on profits, Claimant submits that the Constitutional Court's decision of 26 January 2011 effectively established a breach of the BIT.246 Equally important, Claimant argues, the Constitutional Court confirms three aspects of the factual record: (i) that the 2004 Reform was intended to establish a competitive environment in which health insurers would act as entrepreneurs on a profit basis; (ii) that this constituted a significant change in the nature of the Slovak healthcare framework;247 and (iii) that the 2007 Reforms were not carried out in a legitimate fashion within the margin of appreciation for regulatory measures.248\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b662.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b662.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6205.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n207.\n\nRespondent submits that the Constitutional Court decision striking down the ban on profits is only significant insofar as the ban on profits is no longer applicable. The standard of protection under the BIT, however, \"differs from the protection of the Constitution applied by the Court\" and no conclusions with respect to the BIT follow automatically from the decision.249 The difference stems, in Respondent's view, from the fact that the Constitutional Court approached the matter from the perspective of protecting the Slovak legal order, whereas this Tribunal is asked to consider more specifically \"whether the Claimant's investment was impaired by the conduct of the state in breach of the BIT.\"250 The Constitutional Court, Respondent notes, did not consider the facts of the present case, and its finding of a restriction of property rights is, in Respondent's view, more limited than expropriation and without an analogue under the BIT.251\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6119.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6120.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6122, 125.\n\n208.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Constitutional Court's decision further establishes the constitutionality of other measures of which Claimant complains - in particular the cap on operating expenses, the solvency requirements, and the changes in the percentage of insurance premiums subject to redistribution.252\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6118.\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S OBSERVATIONS ON THE WITNESS TESTIMONY**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nIn witness statements submitted with the Parties' pleadings and during the hearings held in December 2011 and January 2012, the Tribunal received the testimony of a number of individuals involved in the events underlying the Parties' dispute in this arbitration.\n\n210.\n\nThe following witnesses appeared at the hearing on behalf of Claimant: Mr Willem van Duin, Chairman of the Executive Board of Eureko; Mr Fred Hoogerbrug, Director of European Affairs of Eureko, and former member of Union Insurance's Supervisory Board; Mr Tibor B\u00f4rik, Chairman of the Managing Board of Union Healthcare; Mr Bjarne Slorup, who served as a board member of Union Insurance, and by Government invitation as a board member of state-owned insurance company VZP, and on the managing board of Union Healthcare during the \"hibernation\"; Mr Peter Pazitn\u00fd a former advisor to the Slovak Health Minister during the design and implementation of the 2004 Reforms, presented as an expert witness on the Slovak health insurance sector; and Mr Richard Indge, of Ernst & Young, presented as an expert witness on damages. The following witnesses appeared at the hearing on behalf of Respondent: Professor Dr Dr Thomas Gerlinger, an expert witness in international comparative health care systems; and Mr Michael Peer and Ms Zuzana Kepkov\u00e1 of KPMG, who provided expert witness testimony on damages. The Tribunal is grateful to all of these witnesses for their participation. The following section will address one aspect of the witness testimony that the Tribunal found particularly helpful.\n\n211.\n\nEureko's CEO, Mr Willem van Duin, testified before the Tribunal on 14 December 2011. He started working for Eureko in 1987, and was appointed to the Executive Board in 2004, becoming its Vice-Chairman on 1 October 2008 and Chairman on 10 February 2009. Prior to taking on this overall responsibility for Eureko he was supervisory director of a number of Eureko entities, including Union Insurance and Union Healthcare. The Tribunal considered him to be a candid and impressive witness, who was clearly knowledgeable and experienced in health insurance, and also well qualified to explain decisions taken by Eureko during the relevant period. His testimony, in his witness statement and particularly before the Tribunal, put the documentary evidence in the case into much clearer perspective.253 The Tribunal records that much of Mr Van Duin's testimony was not specifically challenged by Respondent, which limited itself (from its own choice) to a very short crossexamination at the hearing in December 2011. The Tribunal accepts, as factually accurate and credible, the testimony of Mr Van Duin.\n\nWitness Statement, 15 July 2010; Hearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 1-56.\n\n212.\n\nIn his testimony, Mr Van Duin explained that it was the knowledge (known to him personally at the time) that Slovakia was moving to a private health insurance system, of a kind with which Eureko was familiar, that was the key to Eureko's decision to enter into concrete discussions regarding its entry into the Slovakian market.254\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 8-13.\n\n213.\n\nAt around this time Eureko was also considering entry into certain other east European markets, but concluded that the regimes in those countries, and the future developments that the respective Governments had in mind, were not such as to make investment in those markets attractive.255\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 7-11.\n\n214.\n\nEureko was aware of the unpopularity of the Slovak reforms and of the risk of a change of policy following the elections in the Slovak Republic, which were known at the time to be imminent. Eureko considered that those risks were not so great as to require postponement of its entry into the market. The point was made in Eureko's March 2006 Business Plan:256\n\nit is our judgement that even a social-democratic lead government would not undo the unpopular, but necessary health reform. It is our judgement that they would change the most unpopular elements, but leave the basic structures in place.\n\nExhibit C-14, p. 1.\n\n215.\n\nMr Van Duin was asked about the basis on which, at the time when Eureko made its investments in the Slovak Republic, he was satisfied that there was no significant chance of a reversal of the health insurance policy of the Government of the Slovak Republic over the life of the investment. He replied as follows:257\n\nIt's hard to explain why I did not think what I didn't think. But we made an assessment. And in those days when the changes were implemented, and based on the meetings we had, we were confident that that would be the way to go forward. So there was no reason for us to think that that would change so dramatically at such a short time.\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 30.\n\n216.\n\nAnswering questions from the Tribunal, Mr Van Duin stated that Eureko would have been able to modify its operations so as to work with the reforms regarding the cap on administrative expenses,258 the ban on brokers,259 the network requirements,260 and the solvency requirements.261 Similarly, Eureko could have accommodated the obligation to submit its budgets to the Government.262\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 12-14, 16.\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 12, 14, 16.\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 16, 17.\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 17.\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 17, 18.\n\n217.\n\nOn the other hand, asked if Eureko could have worked with the ban on profits, Mr Van Duin said \"No. If we would have known in advance I would not have made any proposals to invest in Slovakia.\"263 He took the same view of the ban on transfers of insurance portfolios.264 The combined effect of those measures was that Eureko could neither remain active and making profits in the Slovak Republic, nor sell its business and withdraw from the Slovak Republic.\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 19; cf., Hearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 20-22.\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 3), 14 December 2011 at 22.\n\n218.\n\nIn practical terms, after the 2007 Reforms Eureko's only possibility of earning income from its operations in Slovakia arose from its right to take out operating expenses up to the permitted maximum, and the possibility of extracting further value from its investment in Slovakia by using its reputation there to sell other forms of insurance.\n\n219.\n\nEureko accordingly had to decide whether to try to expand its health insurance business despite the 2007 Reforms (and if so, how) along the lines that it had planned, or to put its operations into some sort of suspension, servicing existing clients but not seeking to expand its client base.\n\n**IX. LIABILITY AND THE MERITS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. The Parties' Arguments on Liability and the Merits**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n220.\n\nArticle 5 of the BIT provides as follows:265\n\nNeither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments, unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\n(b) the measures are not discriminatory;\n\n(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.\n\nAgreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, Art. 5 (Exhibit C-10).\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n221.\n\nEureko submits that the definition of expropriation under the BIT is broad and encompasses \"indirect expropriation\" that does not require a finding that legal title has been transferred to others.266 Whether governmental action qualifies as indirect expropriation depends, according to Claimant, on the \"intensity of interference,\" and whether such action extends beyond \"normal regulatory influence\" and affects \"the core of the of essential attributes of property.\"267 Arbitral tribunals evaluating this question in other matters, Claimant submits, have generally applied three tests.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6IV.16-17; Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6147.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6IV.26, IV.29; Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6147.\n\n222.\n\nFirst, Claimant notes, tribunals have examined \"whether events demonstrate that the owner was deprived of fundamental rights of ownership.\"268 This standard was applied by the tribunals constituted in *Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v.

Additionally, Claimant submits that the \"effect of all measures that form part of the 2007 Reversal\" collectively constitutes expropriation.296\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6IV.24-29.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6IV.24; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6210-211.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6143.\n\n227.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the ban on profits meets all three commonly-used tests for expropriation. The ban \"constitutes a manifest deprivation of a fundamental ownership right,\" thereby meeting the first standard for expropriation.297 The ability to distribute profits as dividends, Claimant notes, along with supervision of the company through its boards, is one of the two fundamental rights deriving from shareholding in a Slovak joint-stock company.298 Equally, Claimant argues, the ban on profits has met the second standard by neutralising \"the benefit and enjoyment of shares in Union Healthcare.\"299 The right to receive a dividend is a principal benefit of holding shares and the ban on profits has rendered such share unmarketable, removing shareholders' \"ability to convert the investment into cash.\"300 Respondent's actions, Claimant contends, have made it inconceivable that a \"commercial entity considering a presence in the Slovak health insurance market\" would purchase Union Healthcare.301 Claimant rejects the relevance of the sale of shares in another insurance company during the summer of 2009, noting it may rather reflect speculation that the ban on profits would be reversed, rather than the existence of a market.302 Claimant also discounts the relevance of its continued ability to cross-sell other insurance products from Union Insurance, arguing that this was never a major element of its business plan or source of profit.303 Finally, Claimant notes that, in impeding the distribution of dividends to shareholders, the ban on profits falls squarely in the \"catalogue of measures\" that other tribunals have considered to constitute indirect expropriation.304\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6169.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6169.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6173.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6173-74.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6IV.25\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6175-80.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6183-186.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6187.\n\n228.\n\nIn the alternative, Claimant submits that the ban on portfolio transfer also constitutes expropriation.305 An insurance portfolio is by far the most \"precious asset\" of a health insurance company and a \"primary determinant for its profitability.\"306 Union's portfolio was acquired at significant effort and expense, Claimant argues, and its value has been \"wiped out,\" constituting a \"gross interference with ownership rights.\"307\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6190; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6214.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6190-92.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6193-94.\n\n229.\n\nFinally, Claimant asserts that the actions taken by Respondent in the 2007 Reforms collectively amount to \"creeping expropriation\". The net effect of these measures is to reinforce the ban on profits and the prohibition on the sale of portfolios and to further restrict \"Union Healthcare's ability to generate and distribute profits.\"308 Although expropriatory intent is not required for a finding of expropriation, Claimant concurs with the position of the tribunal in *Vivendi* that such intent is relevant.309 Here, Claimant notes, Respondent's course of action was motivated by the goal of \"creat[ing] such conditions in public health insurance which will not be interesting for private health insurance companies.\"310 Claimant references the Slovak Republic's Government Resolution 462/2007, arguing that it demonstrates that the Slovak Republic deliberately aimed at reducing the value of investment in private insurance companies.311 In addition, Claimant relies on statements made by members of the Slovak Government, in particular the Government's promise that it would \"drive out private health insurance companies\" from the market.312\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6197.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6158.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6196.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6IV.31-35.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6199.\n\n230.\n\nHaving argued that its interest in Union Healthcare was expropriated within the meaning of Article 5 of the BIT, Claimant further submits that this expropriation was unlawful. Eureko received no compensation as required by Article 5(c) and, accordingly, Claimant submits that it need not establish that the taking was not in the public interest or was discriminatory. Claimant notes, in any event, that members of the Slovak Parliament (including members of the Government between June 2010 and April 2012) argued successfully before the Slovak Constitutional Court that elements of the 2007 Reforms were unconnected to the public interest and discriminatory.313 The Constitutional Court's decision, Claimant submits, also reaffirmed that the distribution of dividends is \"undoubtedly one of the fundamental rights of shareholders\"314 and deemed the ban on the distribution of profits to be expropriatory, unconstitutional, and a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.315\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6210.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6210.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6197.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n231.\n\nRespondent objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over this claim on the grounds that Article 5 of the BIT is superseded by or inapplicable under EU law (see above at paragraph 147ff).\n\n232.\n\nWith respect to the standard applicable to claims of indirect expropriation under the BIT, Respondent submits that expropriation can only occur if the adopted measure is (i) \"not within the regulatory powers of the state\" and (ii) \"constitutes an effective neutralisation of the investment.\"316 According to Respondent, whether an investment has been \"effectively neutralised\" depends upon whether it has been subjected to a \"substantial deprivation.\"317 In support of this standard, Respondent notes the decisions of arbitral tribunals in *Methanex v. United States* ;318*Saluka v. Czech Republic*,319 and *CMS Gas Transmission Co.*320\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6496.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6497.\n\n*Methanex Corporation v.

United* *Mexican States* ;322*Marvin Feldman v. Mexico* ;323*Azurix v. Argentine Republic* ;324*CMS* *Gas Transmission Co.* ;325*LG&E* ;326 and *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Canada*.327 In Respondent's view, Claimant understates the severity of the interference that must have occurred to support a finding of expropriation. In relying on a series of arbitrations involving Argentina, Respondent notes, Claimant neglects the critical fact that none of the tribunals in *Sempra*, *CMS Gas Transmission Co.*, *Enron*, *Azurix*, or *LG&E* actually found expropriation to have occurred, notwithstanding the \"sudden, drastic and comprehensive dismantling of the legal and regulatory framework... resulting from the 2001 economic crisis in Argentina.\"328 Respondent further notes the high threshold for expropriation identified by the European Court of Human Rights in its decision in *Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden*, declining to find expropriation where the ability to make use of the property in question remained, even though the right had \"lost some of its substance.\"329\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b627.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v.

Sweden* (ECHR, Application nos. 7151/75, 7152/75), Judgment, 23 September 1982, \u00b663.\n\n234.\n\nTurning to the breaches alleged by Claimant, Respondent denies that it has expropriated Eureko's investment.330 In Respondent's view, Claimant cannot establish that its investment was subject to a substantial deprivation and neutralised insofar as:331\n\n(a) the Claimant is still successfully providing public health insurance;\n\n(b) the Claimant conducts business in the area of supplementary health insurance;\n\n(c) the Claimant benefits from cross-selling effects;\n\n(d) the Claimant has never met the conditions for the application of the Profit Provision; and;\n\n(e) the Profit Provision is no longer effective.\n\nRespondent considers allegations of expropriatory intent and Claimant's reliance on *Vivendi* to be inapposite, arguing instead that the actions of the Slovak Republic comprised \"general, non-discriminatory legislative measures.\"332\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b656-80\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6500.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b666.\n\n235.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the restriction on profits cannot form the basis for a claim of expropriation because the provision has since been repealed and because Claimant, during the time it was in effect, never generated sufficient profits for it to have legally distributed a dividend pursuant to the Slovak Commercial Code.333 Expropriation, Respondent asserts, \"must always concern existing property\"\u2014not a hypothetical right to distribute dividends.334 In any event, Respondent argues, the decision in *LG&E* establishes that \"expropriation must be permanent,\"335 and *Azurix* makes clear that a \"substantial deprivation occurs only when an investor has been deprived of *all* *attributes* of the ownership of its investment.\"336 In turn, *Feldman* establishes that no expropriation will occur where \"[t]he Claimant is free to pursue other continuing lines of business activity.\"337 Even if effective, the restriction on profits never removed Claimant's ownership of Union Healthcare, which continued to operate throughout the relevant period, nor restricted its ability to market supplementary insurance or to engage in cross-selling.338\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6509-13\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6510.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b633, quoting *LG&E*, \u00b6193.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6508 (emphasis in original).\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b667.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6508.\n\n236.\n\nSimilarly, Respondent submits that the restriction on the transfer of insurance portfolios cannot be considered to have restricted fundamental ownership rights or to have effectively neutralised Claimant's investment. In particular, Respondent notes that restricting the sale of insurance portfolios did not prevent Claimant from transferring its portfolio through other means that would have included the transfer of contractual obligations entered into with healthcare providers, thereby maintaining continuity and protecting the rights of the insurees. Claimant could have effected such a transfer, Respondent submits, \"by means of a (i) transfer of undertaking; (ii) transfer of shares; or (iii) transformation.\"339 Further, Respondent contends that a health insurance portfolio is not capable of being the subject of ownership and that, in any event, Claimant's portfolio was acquired in violation of Slovak law (see above at paragraph 131ff).340\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6518.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6519-20.\n\n237.\n\nFinally, Respondent is of the view that Claimant's argument that actions taken by the Slovak Republic collectively amount to expropriation is undeveloped. According to Respondent, Claimant fails to explain \"which fundamental rights of ownership it was supposedly deprived of.\"341 In Respondent's view, Claimant only elaborated on the restriction on the use of brokers, which is insufficient insofar as the possibility of using other marketing practices remained.342\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6523.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6525.\n\n238.\n\nAlthough Respondent denies that any substantial deprivation of Claimant's investment occurred, Respondent further argues that a finding to the contrary would still fall short of expropriation because the Slovak Republic's actions were \"adopted within the ambit of the Respondent's regulatory powers.\"343 As set forth previously in the Parties' characterisation of the factual record (see above at paragraph 201ff), Respondent contends that the measures taken by the Slovak Republic in 2006 and 2007 were broadly in the public interest and were intended to remedy genuine problems within the Slovak health care sector. Viewed in the context of alleged expropriation, Respondent quotes the arbitral tribunal in *Saluka* for the proposition that:344\n\nIt is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner *bona fide* regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.\n\nArbitral tribunals in *Feldman*,345*LG&E*,346*Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v.* *Republic of Hungary*,347 and *Too v. Greater Modesto Insurance Associates*,348 Respondent notes, have reached the same conclusion.349 Accordingly, Respondent argues, the Slovak Republic is \"entitled and obliged to regulate its public health insurance system and to freely choose from the commonly acceptable public health insurance system models.\"350\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b626.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6433, quoting *Saluka*, \u00b6255.\n\n*Feldman*, \u00b6112.\n\n*LG&E*, \u00b6195.\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v.

Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment to the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those investors.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n241.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment is broad and overarching, encompassing the obligation that the host State \"honour legitimate expectations,\" \"act transparently,\" and abstain from \"arbitrary treatment of investments.\"355 Claimant does not accept Respondent's contention that the content of fair and equitable treatment is determined by customary international law and the international minimum standard.356 In the context of these proceedings, Claimant invokes two elements that it identifies as part of the fair and equitable treatment standard: (i) the obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework, and (ii) the obligation to act in good faith with respect to investments of investors.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6212.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6224.\n\n242.\n\nDrawing on the decisions of arbitral tribunals in *Metalclad Corporation v.

Mexico*,362 Claimant submits that the obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework is a standard element of fair and equitable treatment.363 In the words of the *Metalclad* tribunal, this requirement forbids State action \"which entirely transforms or alters the legal or business environment\" in which the investment was made.364 The standard, Claimant contends, is encompassed within the understanding of fair and equitable treatment irrespective of the precise wording of the treaty in question.365 According to Claimant, the obligation imposed on the host State is also linked to legitimate expectations. Although a State is not barred from introducing any change to its laws and regulations, it may not \"by amending its legal framework exceed what the investor justifiably expected at the time of making its investment.\"366\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v.

The central features of this framework were the ability to dispose of profits, in particular to shareholders; the development of insurance portfolios through brokers, creative marketing, and portfolio trading; limited governmental involvement in the market through an independent Health Care Authority; and market determination of contracts with healthcare providers and the efficient level of operating expenses.367 In 2006 and 2007, Claimant submits, each element of this framework was significantly changed by new legislation, introducing legal uncertainty and removing its ability to generate a return on investments in the health insurance sector.368 Not only was this a fundamental change, Claimant argues, but it exceeded what Claimant justifiably could have expected at the time. Eureko should not, Claimant asserts, have expected measures in contravention of the Slovak Constitution, EU law, or the BIT; nor should it have assumed that an election would lead to fundamental reforms \"for the purpose of removing all private capital from the [health insurance] sector.\"369 Claimant points to its March 2006 Business Plan and the testimony of Eureko's witnesses for evidence of its actual expectations at the time, and to the Slovak Government's August 2006 Manifesto and the statements of Mr Valentinovi\u010d in November 2006 and January 2007 for \"explicit assurances from the Slovak Republic that it would not enact fundamental changes to the health insurance system.\"370\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6227-31.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6236-39.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6246-47, 249.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6242-43, 248.\n\n244.\n\nTurning to the obligation to act in good faith, Claimant draws on the decisions in *Tecmed*,371*Siemens A.G. v.

According to Claimant, the Slovak Republic sought a single, publicly-owned health insurance company, but could not directly expropriate private health insurers.377 Accordingly, Respondent sought to \"make the lives of privately-owned health insurance companies so miserable that they would exit the market \u2018voluntarily'.\"378 These objectives, Claimant submits, are evident from the statements made by members of the Slovak Government at the time of the 2007 Reforms and by the position taken by members of the Slovak Parliament in their 2008 petition to the Slovak Constitutional Court.379 Even in the face of repeated complaints and legal action, Claimant submits, the Slovak Republic has \"not even paused to seriously discuss the intrusion of Eureko's rights or even acknowledged the consequences of its policies.\"380\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6253-54.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6257.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6254-59.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6IV.76.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n246.\n\nRespondent objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over this claim on the grounds that Article 3(1) of the BIT is superseded by or inapplicable under EU law (see above at paragraph 147ff).\n\n247.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal has jurisdiction, Respondent contends that the standard of fair and equitable treatment required by Article 3(1) of the BIT is limited to the international minimum standard required by customary international law.381 Drawing on the decisions in *Saluka* and *Genin et. al. v. Estonia*,382 Respondent submits that evaluating governmental conduct under this standard involves a process of \"weighing of the Claimant's legitimate and reasonable expectations on the one hand and the Respondent's legitimate regulatory interests on the other.\"383 As set forth in the discussion of expropriation (see above at paragraph 238ff), Respondent considers the 2007 Reforms to fall well within the ambit of the Slovak Republic's regulatory powers.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6535.\n\n*Genin and others v.

The arbitral decisions relied upon by Claimant, Respondent notes, arose from investment treaties that specifically provided for the maintenance of a stable framework and are, accordingly, inapposite to the BIT at issue in this arbitration.384 On the contrary, Respondent argues, the Slovak Republic has a sovereign right to develop its legal framework and, as noted by the Tribunal in *AES v. Hungary*, \"a legal framework is by definition subject to change as it adapts to new circumstances day by day.\"385 The BIT, in Respondent's view, \"is not a shield against any risks resulting from changes of the legal and business framework of the host state,\" and Respondent denies that it made any more specific commitment to refrain from changing its laws.386 In the absence of such a commitment, the expectation that laws can and will evolve should be within the expectation of \"any reasonably informed business person.\"387\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6537.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6540, quoting *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v.

The assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the investment, but also *the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions prevailing in the host State*. In addition, such expectations *must arise from the conditions that the State offered the investor and the latter must have relied upon* them when deciding to invest.\n\nLegitimate expectations, Respondent emphasises \"cannot be solely the subjective expectations of the investor,\" but must be reasonable and based on an objective assessment of the circumstances.391\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6574.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6544-46.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b690 quoting *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v.

According to Respondent, Eureko's March 2006 Business Plan cannot evidence legitimate expectations as it was not prepared at the time Claimant established Union Healthcare.393 Indeed, Respondent argues, Claimant has not submitted any contemporaneous analysis of the 2004 Reform, or evidence that it conducted such analysis.394 Moreover, by the time Claimant began incurring expenses in developing Union's insurance portfolio in May 2006, Respondent submits that the publicly available information made clear that \"SMER would win the 2006 elections and that public health insurance policy would be changed.\"395\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b693-94.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6547.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6549-53.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6560.\n\n251.\n\nTurning to Claimant's allegations of bad faith, Respondent submits that the factual record establishes that Respondent's intent was solely \"to regulate the existing public health insurance system\" and that the measures taken were legitimately within the scope of its regulatory discretion.396 In Respondent's view, the individual statements upon which Claimant relies for its narrative of bad faith \"are misquoted and largely taken out of context\" and \"constitute standard political proclamations that are used in the Slovak media.\"397 Such statements are insufficient to overcome the policy record of a series of measures aiming to address genuine problems with the outflow of funds from the health care system, the increasing indebtedness of health care providers, and infringements on patients' rights.398\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6582.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6441, 443.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6447-64.\n\n**3. Unreasonable and Discriminatory Treatment**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nIn addition to ensuring fair and equitable treatment, Article 3(1) of the BIT provides that the Parties \"shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those investors.\"\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n253.\n\nClaimant submits that its investment was impaired by both discriminatory and unreasonable measures. Claimant identifies five measures that it considers to have been discriminatory and thereby prohibited by the BIT. First, Claimant submits that the restrictions on operating expenses as a percentage of premium incomes disproportionately favoured large insurance companies, such as the State-owned VZP.399 Second, Claimant argues that the increase in the percentage of premium income that was subject to redistribution was discriminatory in that it favoured those insurance companies that were net beneficiaries of the redistribution system, in particular VZP.400 Third, Claimant contends that the prohibition on the use of brokers disproportionately affected new entrants to the health insurance market.401 Fourth, Claimant notes that the Slovak Republic provided VZP with a capital injection of \u20ac65.1 million, and financed this by lowering premiums for those individuals covered by the State, to the detriment of other insurers.402 Fifth, Claimant submits that the ban on profits was discriminatory in favour of State-owned health insurers that are not profit-motivated.403 In assessing the effects of these five measures, Claimant emphasises that \"although measures may formally apply to all parties, the effects and intended application of the measures can be discriminatory.\"404 In Claimant's view, such discriminatory effect is a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.405\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6283-84.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6285.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6286.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6287.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6288.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6239.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6239.\n\n254.\n\nIn addition to discriminatory measures, Claimant contends that its investment was subjected to unreasonable measures. In Claimant's view, the intent to \"drive privately-owned insurers out of the market\" was both egregious and unquestionably unreasonable.406 Claimant also submits that the ban on profits was unreasonable, both because it \"completely destroys private investors' most basic rationale for making an investment\" and because it limited the ability of insurers to earn profits from what the Slovak Republic has insisted were \"public\" funds while permitting health care providers and other actors to continue to do so.407\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6291.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6292.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n255.\n\nRespondent objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over this claim on the grounds that Article 3(1) of the BIT is superseded by or inapplicable under EU law (see above at paragraph 147ff).\n\n256.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal has jurisdiction, Respondent denies that it acted in a discriminatory or unreasonable manner. In Respondent's view, \"[t]he state is entitled to adopt... measures resulting in different treatment, if such different treatment is justified by legitimate public policy and pursued in a reasonable manner.\"408 Respondent looks to the tribunal decisions in *Genin*,409*S.D. Myers*,410 and *Saluka*411 in support of this standard.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6589.\n\n*Genin*, \u00b6368.\n\n*S.D. Myers,* \u00b6246.\n\n*Saluka*, \u00b6460.\n\n257.\n\nTurning to the measures themselves, Respondent notes that \"[a]ll measures contested by the Claimant apply in the same manner to all health insurers.\"412 The redistribution provision, for instance, operates identically with respect to all insurers, and \"merely requires that every health insurer obtains a reasonable amount of the whole sum of collected health insurance levies.\"413 The effect of restrictions on brokers and profits, Respondent emphasises, is the same for all health insurers. With respect to the limitation of operating expenses, Respondent denies that this favours larger insurers; the State-owned SZP was able to maintain the limit with a portfolio of insured similar to that held by Union. Finally, Respondent asserts that as the owner of VZP, it is entitled to support it financially, just as Claimant may raise capital on behalf of Union. Quoting *Saluka*, Respondent contends that \"[t]he \u2018fair and equitable treatment' standard cannot easily be assumed to include a general prohibition of State aid.\"414\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6590.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6592.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6660, quoting *Saluka*, \u00b6445.\n\n258.\n\nAs regards the measures Claimant alleges to be unreasonable, Respondent argues, citing *Saluka*, that the relevant question is whether the measures \"bear a reasonable relationship to some rational policy.\"415 In Respondent's view, the factual record establishes a reasonable connection between the 2007 Reforms and the Slovak Republic's efforts to address inefficiencies in the provision of health care to the public.416 Respondent also recalls its arguments (see above at paragraph 239ff) regarding the proportionality of the 2007 Reforms in relation to the public interest.417\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6597, quoting\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6597-600.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6600.\n\n**4. Full Protection and Security**\n-----------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nArticle 3(2) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\nMore particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full security and protection which in any case shall not be less than accorded either to investments of its own investors or to investments of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n260.\n\nClaimant submits that its investment was denied full protection and security by the Slovak Republic. In interpreting this standard, Claimant contends that full protection and security is not limited to physical security.418 In Claimant's view, this interpretation is supported in the jurisprudence of other arbitral tribunals, notably in *Azurix* ;419*Biwater Gauff* ;420*National Grid, plc v. The Argentine Republic* ;421 and *Vivendi*.422 It also follows logically, for Claimant, from the interpretation of the treaty itself. The treaty, Claimant notes, extends full protection and security to all covered investments, including several non-physical categories that clearly cannot be protected by the provision of physical security.423 Equally, Claimant notes that the BIT employs encompassing language\u2014 *full* protection and security\u2014that would be at odds with a significant implicit limitation.424 Following the reasoning adopted in *Biwater Gauff*, Claimant submits that there is \"no rationale for limiting the application of a substantive protection of the Treaty to a category of assets\u2014physical assets\u2014when it was not restricted in that fashion by the Contracting Parties.\"425\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6264.\n\n*Azurix*, \u00b6408.\n\n*Biwater Gauff*, \u00b6729.\n\n*National Grid plc v.

The Authority has the power to terminate Union's business, impose \"crippling fines,\" and intrude on its operations through on-site inspections.426 Such threats are not hypothetical, Claimant contends, given the actual use of government influence in the replacement of the heads of the Authority's boards, which has \"critically undermined the credibility of the Health Care Authority.\"427 Claimant further submits that the harassment it faced from high officials of the Slovak Government in the form of disparaging press statements would \"fatally poison any due diligence\" by a party considering investment in the health insurance sector and \"is irreconcilable with the duty to provide a secure investment environment.\"428\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6275.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6274-75.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6279-80.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n262.\n\nIn interpreting Article 3(2) of the BIT, Respondent relies upon the holding reached in *Saluka*, and asserts that full protection and security guarantees \"more specifically the physical integrity of an investment against interference by use of force.\"429 Even if the standard might sometimes reach beyond physical security, Respondent emphasises that it \"does not represent an absolute protection against physical or legal interventions\"430 and urges the Tribunal to follow the approach adopted in *AES v. Hungary*, limiting protection where a State's right to regulate is exercised in a reasonable manner in pursuit of rational public policy goals.431 In the event the Tribunal interprets Article 3(2) to extend beyond physical security, however, Respondent argues that it would be covered by the provisions of EU law on freedom of establishment and that accordingly the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction over this claim (see above at paragraph 147ff).432\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6604.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6605.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6603, quoting *AES v. Hungary*, \u00b613.3.2.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6423-24.\n\n263.\n\nTurning to Claimant's contentions, Respondent notes that Claimant has not alleged any physical interference with its investment. Respondent further argues that Claimant has not shown that its investment was actually impacted by the conduct of which it complains. According to Respondent, \"Claimant did not substantiate any actions that were taken by the Health Care Authority against its investment.\"433 Moreover, Respondent notes, many competencies of the Health Care Authority existed prior to the 2007 Reforms and, even afterwards, Claimant retained recourse to appeal the decisions of the Authority to the Slovak courts.434 In Respondent's view, the structure of the Health Care Authority was within the Slovak Republic's discretion to organise at it saw fit, provided that the results where not discriminatory or arbitrary, and Claimant has failed to establish such an occurrence.435 Similarly, with respect to statements in the press, Respondent submits that Claimant has not identified any insured whose departure from Union Healthcare followed from the media portrayal of private health insurers, or that any sale was actually thwarted. \"Unfounded and speculative assertions,\" Respondent submits, are insufficient.436\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6608.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6610.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6611 n. 440, citing *Genin*, \u00b6370; *Lauder*, \u00b6242.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6614-15.\n\n**5. Restrictions on Transfer**\n-------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nArticle 4 of the BIT provides as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall guarantee that payments related to an investment may be transferred. The transfers shall be made in a freely convertible currency, without undue restriction or delay. Such transfers include in particular though not exclusively:\n\n(a) profits, interests, dividends, royalties, fees and other current income;\n\n(b) funds necessary\n\ni. for the acquisition of raw or auxiliary materials, semi-fabricated or finished products, or\n\nii. for the development of an investment or to replace capital assets in order to safeguard the continuity of an investment;\n\n(c) funds in repayment of loans;\n\n(d) earnings of natural persons;\n\n(e) the proceeds of sale or liquidation of the investment.\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n265.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent has unequivocally violated Article 4 of the BIT as a result of the introduction of the ban on the distribution of profits.437 In interpreting this provision, Claimant points to the Explanatory Note of the BIT, which explains that Article 4 is intended to guarantee the \"completely free transfer of funds,\"438 which is obviously contravened by restrictions on transfer. This breach has occurred, Claimant argues, irrespective of whether the investment in Union Healthcare has actually generated profits.439 Nor is it relevant, in Claimant's view, that the Slovak Constitutional Court has struck down the ban on profits, as damages remain from the period in which the restriction remained in force.440\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6IV.109; Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6292-300; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6244-252.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6IV.112; *see also* Exhibit C-11, p. 4.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Claim, \u00b6IV.117.\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, \u00b6249.\n\n266.\n\nIn Claimant's view, Respondent's defence\u2014that insurance premiums represent \"public monies\" and are therefore not \"payments related to an investment\"\u2014is \"incomprehensible.\"441 Claimant notes that insurance premiums are private before they are paid by employees and private once they are paid to health care providers and suggests that Respondent's scenario would consider premiums to be public monies only during the time they are held by an insurance company.442 Claimant considers this argument to be \"obviously irrational\" and submits that, in any event, premiums were clearly not considered public funds under the legislation in place when Eureko made its investment.443\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6296.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6299.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6301-302.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n267.\n\nRespondent objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over this claim on the grounds that Article 4 of the BIT is superseded by or inapplicable under EU law (see above at paragraph 147ff).\n\n268.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal has jurisdiction, Respondent submits that a restriction on issuing dividends cannot \"be recharacterised by Eureko as a restriction on transfer.\"444 Claimant has always been free to transfer any asset that may be distributable to shareholders. In Respondent's view, \"[w]hile Eureko may disagree with the regulatory standard that limits Union Healthcare's ability to declare dividend payments, that standard is unrelated to the very different issue addressed by Article 4 of the BIT.\"445\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6110-11.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, \u00b6110.\n\n269.\n\nFurther, Respondent submits that health insurance premiums are to be considered public monies insofar as they are levied as a tax in an amount determined by the State. Because the collection of health insurance premiums is governed by public law, so too is their distribution.446 Respondent could and did regulate the uses to which such public monies could be put during the time they were held by insurers. The determination that the \"remainder of the public health insurance levies would be used to cover health care, the original purpose for which these funds were levied,\" was well within the legitimate scope of Respondent's regulatory authority.447\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6621-22.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6623.\n\n270.\n\nIn any event, Respondent argues, Eureko was never in a position to distribute a dividend from insurance levies, and thus cannot have been harmed within the scope of this portion of the BIT.448\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6626.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Decision on Liability and the Merits**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Investment**\n---------------------\n\n271.\n\nAs is apparent from the paragraphs above, the Tribunal has concluded that Eureko's investment in the Slovak Republic consists of its 100% shareholding in Union Healthcare (as well as rights derived therefrom).449\n\nSee paragraphs 90, 157-161, above.\n\n**2. The Applicable Law**\n-------------------------\n\n272.\n\nArticle 8 (6) of the Treaty provides that\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively:\n\n\u2022 the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n\u2022 the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n\u2022 the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;\n\n\u2022 the general principles of international law.\"\n\n273.\n\nIn the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration the relevance of EU law was considered. In its Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension dated 26 October 2010, at paragraphs 287-290, the Tribunal decided that questions of the applicability of EU law would be addressed at the merits stage. The Tribunal reaffirms its analysis in that award of the relationship between EU law, the Treaty, and the role and jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered whether there are any issues of EU law that bear upon its decision or its reasoning in relation to claims that Respondent has acted in violation of its obligations under the Treaty. Respondent maintained its position that the Treaty is inapplicable because of the operation of EU law.450 Its reasoning, in essence, was that:451\n\nif the same subject is regulated by both EU law and national law (the BIT), EU law prevails. Therefore, the Tribunal would be actually deciding on a breach of EU law by the Slovak Republic.\n\nSee *part D.1 Statement of Defence; part D.2 Counter-Memorial on the Merits; part H Rejoinder on Merits.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6409.\n\n275.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept this analysis. Neither Party in the present case argued that any specific provision of EU law bore upon the case in a manner that would affect the decision or reasoning of the Tribunal under this particular BIT. Having considered the position, the Tribunal is satisfied that no such question of EU law arises, and that it may apply the terms of the Treaty without exceeding its jurisdiction and without misapplying the applicable law.452\n\nThe closest that the argument comes to EU Law appears to be the point at which the Respondent argues that the duty of fair and equitable treatment does not extend to questions concerning State aid: see paragraph 257 above. The Tribunal does not need to address that question.\n\n276.\n\nIn the present case, the Treaty sets out standards of treatment that the Contracting Parties have expressly agreed to apply to investors of the other Contracting Party. Insofar as they are applicable to the facts in the present case, nothing in those Treaty standards is in conflict with any provision of EU law. Nothing in this Award amounts to, or implies, a decision that Respondent or Claimant has acted in conformity with EU law or contrary to EU law in any respect. This Award has no bearing upon any question of EU law. This Award relates only to the compliance by Respondent with the terms of the obligations it has assumed under the agreement that it made in the Treaty in relation to its treatment of a class of persons of which Claimant is a member; and this Award is rendered pursuant to a procedure to which the Contracting Parties agreed in Article 8 of the Treaty, and which Claimant accepted in its Notice of Arbitration dated 1 October 2008.\n\n277.\n\nClaimant alleges violations by Respondent of Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Treaty.\n\n**3. Fair and Equitable Treatment and Article 3 of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nClaimant alleges a violation of its rights under Article 3(1) of the Treaty, which reads as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment to the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those investors.\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the removal of the right to generate profits, coupled with a ban on the transfer of the portfolio, effectively deprived Claimant of access to the commercial value of its investment. The investment could neither be maintained so as to generate profits nor be sold. There was no way in which Claimant could recover the commercial value of its investment.\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the ability to distribute profits (and even more, the ability to distribute profits coupled with the ability to transfer a client portfolio for value) was as a matter of fact an essential precondition of Eureko's decision to invest in the Slovak Republic. It accepts the evidence of Mr Van Duin that, had Eureko's management been aware of a real possibility that a ban on profits (and subsequently a ban on transfers) was about to be introduced by the Government, the investment in the Slovak Republic would not have been made at all. It accepts also that, while Eureko's management were aware of the possibility of far-reaching reforms being introduced in the organisation of health insurance in the Slovak Republic after the 2007 election, they were not aware that such reforms would include a ban on profits and a ban on transfers that would prevent the realisation of any profits from their investment.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied that the imposition of the ban on profits and the ban on transfer of the portfolio were measures that self-evidently and unequivocally put Eureko's investment into a situation that was incompatible with the most basic notions of what an investment is meant to be, and that the imposition of those measures upon the investment after it had been made was incompatible with the obligation to accord the investment fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty. To characterise expenditure on the establishment of a business operation in another State as an \u2018investment' necessarily implies the right to enjoy the possibility of a return on the investment, if it proves profitable. Locking in accrued profit is incompatible with that right. The Tribunal returns below to the question of the consequences of this incompatibility.\n\n282.\n\nThis decision by the Tribunal fixes the date at which the violation occurred as 25 October 2007. That is the date on which the ban on profits was introduced by law and the date on which it became necessary for Claimant to take steps to protect its position, even though the implementation of the ban on profits followed later, in financial year 2008.453\n\nSee **Act No. 594/2007 Coll.**, adopted on 28 November 2007; Exhibit C-61.\n\n283.\n\nClaimant argued that Respondent had acted in breach of the duty not to impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, use, enjoyment or disposal of the investment. The Tribunal has found that the adoption of the ban on profits on 25 October 2007 was a violation of the fair and equitable treatment provision in Article 3(1) of the Treaty. It also finds that the ban on transfers in Act No. 192/2009 Coll.,454 consolidated that violation, although it is not clear that Claimant could in practice have recovered any of its investment by transferring its portfolio after the ban on profits - it is difficult to see why any other investor would have paid to put itself into Claimant's shoes. The Tribunal, having regard to the evidence of Mr Van Duin, does not find that the other measures adopted by Respondent as part of the 2007 Reforms constituted separate violations of Article 3(1), as Mr Van Duin had indicated that Eureko could work with those measures.455\n\nExhibit C-72.\n\nSee paragraphs 216 and 217 above.\n\n284.\n\nClaimant argued that there was also a violation of Article 3(2) of the Treaty, which requires each Contracting Party to accord \"full protection and security\" to the investment. Where, as here, the complaint is essentially that the investment was not protected against government policies, the question whether there has been a breach of the Treaty is inseparable from the question whether the policies in question were fair and equitable. The Tribunal sees no need in the circumstances of this case to consider the claim under Article 3(2) separately from the claim under Article 3(1). It regards its decision in respect of the claim under Article 3(1) as disposing of both claims.\n\n**4. The Free Transfer of Payments and Article 4 of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nClaimant also alleges that Article 4 of the Treaty was breached. Article 4 reads as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall guarantee that payments related to an investment may be transferred. The transfers shall be made in a freely convertible currency, without undue restriction or delay. Such transfers include in particular though not exclusively:\n\n(a) profits, interests, dividends, royalties, fees and other current income;\n\n(b) funds necessary\n\ni. for the acquisition of raw or auxiliary materials, semi-fabricated or finished products, or\n\nii. for the development of an investment or to replace capital assets in order to safeguard the continuity of an investment;\n\n(c) funds in repayment of loans;\n\n(d) earnings of natural persons;\n\n(e) the proceeds of sale or liquidation of the investment.\"\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the ban on profits was inconsistent with Respondent's obligations under this Article. In principle, any losses arising from the application of that ban to Claimant would be recoverable in damages. In the present case, however, the facts are such that the violation and the injury arising from the temporary adoption of the ban on profits are subsumed within the violation and the injury arising from the breach of the \u2018fair and equitable treatment' obligation. The Tribunal accordingly records that Respondent was in breach of Article 4, but it is not necessary to consider the question of losses arising from that breach any further.\n\n**5. Expropriation and Article 5 of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nArticle 5 reads as follows:\n\nNeither Contracting party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\n(b) the measures are not discriminatory;\n\n(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.\"\n\n288.\n\nThis provision provides protection against expropriation; but not all provisions against expropriation have the same scope and legal effect. Article 5, for example, protects only against the direct or indirect *deprivation* of an investor of its investment. While some measures that interfere with the enjoyment by an investor of its rights of ownership of an investment may be so severe as to amount in law to such a deprivation, not all measures of interference are capable of doing so. In the present case the ban on profits, if maintained, would have violated Article 5. But the ban was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic.\n\n289.\n\nThis might be argued to amount to a \u2018temporary expropriation'; but this controversial label is particularly unhelpful in this case. There is an important distinction between (i) a \u2018deprivation' for what is from the outset intended to be a limited (and relatively short) period, and (ii) a \u2018deprivation' that is intended at the time of its adoption to be permanent but which, in the event, is in fact reversed after a relatively short period of time. Deprivations of the former kind would not ordinarily amount to an expropriation, although they may amount to interferences with the property-owner's rights that violate other protections under a treaty, such as a provisions protecting against discriminatory treatment or against treatment that is not fair and equitable.456\n\nSee, for example, *LG & E*, \u00b6\u00b6 132-9, 193, 200, 267; *Tecmed*, \u00b6\u00b6 116, 151, 174, 201.\n\n290.\n\nIn the present case, however, the \u2018deprivation' was temporary because of a reversal of a policy that had been enshrined in law and was intended to operate indefinitely. The imposition of the ban on profits was reversed by the Constitutional Court as a result of an application, made on 15 October 2008 and supplemented on 13 February 2009, by a group of Deputies of the National Council of the Slovak Republic (the Parliament of the Slovak Republic). That application was made about 12 months after the ban on profits, and in the wake of internal Governmental memoranda that questioned the legality of the ban on profits.457\n\nSee the memorandum of the Ministry of Justice, 12 June 2007, Exhibit C-63, and the memorandum of the Legislative Board, 10 July 2007, Exhibit C-64.\n\n291.\n\nHad this present BIT case been decided before the decision of the Constitutional Court and the declaration that the ban on profits was unconstitutional, it is likely that this Tribunal would have held that there was a \u2018permanent' deprivation that could amount to an expropriation in violation of Article 5 of the Treaty. The question is, therefore, whether such a temporary deprivation should be treated differently now that the Constitutional Court has given its decision.\n\n292.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the facts must be taken as they exist at the time of the hearing. The declaration of unconstitutionality by the Constitutional Court cannot be ignored. While there is no duty to exhaust local remedies under the Treaty, there is no reason to ignore such remedies as have in fact been obtained. Although the episode did constitute a temporary interference with the investment and cause injury to the investor, it is not to be regarded as having resulted in a permanent deprivation of the investor of its investment. It was a wrong corrected by the proper operation of checks and balances within the Slovak legal system. This analysis is consistent with the approach adopted by other tribunals to the question of the necessary characteristics of an expropriation and the significance of the permanence of interference with property rights.458\n\nSee, for example, *LG & E*, \u00b6\u00b6 193, 200; *Tecmed*, \u00b6 116.\n\n293.\n\nIn the circumstances of the present case, therefore, the Tribunal finds that there is no violation of Article 5 of the Treaty. Losses arising from the 2007 Reforms prior to their reversal are fully, and appropriately, accommodated within the finding that there was a violation of the \u2018fair and equitable treatment' provision in Article 3(1) of the Treaty arising from the ban on profits.\n\n294.\n\nNothing in these findings of the Tribunal should be taken to suggest that the Treaty is hostile towards particular policies on the provision of healthcare facilities. The Contracting Parties are free to adopt the policies that they choose. The Treaty focuses on the manner in which policies may be changed and implemented, not on the policies themselves. The decision in a case such as the present could be very different if, for example, reforms had been introduced in a phased manner together with provision for the compensation of any private health insurance providers who were caused loss by the reforms. Indeed, the Contracting Parties could go further, and exclude health care altogether from the coverage of the BIT if they so wish. But as long as the provisions of the Treaty remain in force and applicable, they must be respected. That is what the Governments of the Contracting Party intended when they chose to conclude the Treaty, for what they judged to be the benefit of their States and their nationals.\n\n295.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal has determined that Respondent has breached Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty. Accordingly, Claimant is entitled to damages. This subject will be discussed below.\n\n**X. THE CALCULATION OF DAMAGES**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. The Parties' Arguments on Damages**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**1. Causation, Mitigation and Eureko's \"Hibernation\" Strategy**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n296.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the damages incurred by Eureko were caused by the Slovak Republic's introduction of the 2007 Reforms. The Slovak Republic sought to drive private health insurers from the Slovak market and amended its legislation to do so.459 In response, Claimant states that it adopted a \"hibernation strategy,\" based upon \"(i) a strong reduction in marketing efforts and expenses, (ii) a reduction in benefits offered to insured above the statutory minimum coverage and (iii) a reduction in operating costs, for instance, by decreasing IT expenses.\"460\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6II.2-3.\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6II.6.\n\n297.\n\nIn Claimant's view, hibernation was a reasonable mitigation strategy that reduced the damages Eureko would otherwise have suffered by leaving the Slovak Republic and abandoning its investment.461 Contrary to Respondent's argument, Claimant does not consider hibernation to have been part of the cause of the damages inflicted on it, but rather a response on Eureko's part to harm that was fully manifest once the 2007 Reforms were introduced.462\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6II.3.\n\nHearing Tr. (Day 1), 12 December 2011 at 73:11 to 74:16.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n298.\n\nRespondent contests both the existence of the alleged hibernation strategy and any alleged causal link between the 2007 Reforms, any alleged hibernation, and any harm allegedly inflicted on Eureko.463 Respondent notes that the hibernation strategy was described only late in the proceedings, in the additional witness statement of Mr Bjarne Jorgen Slorup, and the alleged decision is not supported by any contemporaneous documentary evidence.464 On the contrary, Respondent argues, Union Healthcare's annual reports from this period state that the company had not changed its long term strategy, and Union Healthcare attempted to purchase the insurance portfolio of EZP in mid-2008. Moreover, Respondent outlines, Claimant continued to introduce benefits above the statutory minimum level of coverage,465 increased its marketing budget in 2008,466 and continued to increase IT expenditures throughout the relevant period.467 In the face of this contrary evidence, Respondent submits, Claimant has offered only highly general assertions of the cost reductions allegedly comprising the hibernation.468\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b634.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b644.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b6\u00b647-49.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b6\u00b650-54.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b6\u00b655-56.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b6\u00b639-40.\n\n299.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Eureko's alleged hibernation forms part of the causal chain between the 2007 Reforms and any harm suffered by Eureko. Relying on the jurisprudence of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal and the decisions of tribunals in *Biwater* *Gauff469* and *S.D. Myers*,470 Respondent argues that Claimant has failed to establish the requisite degree of proximate causation.471 Even if a decision to place Union Healthcare in hibernation was taken and carried out, Respondent submits, Claimant has failed to draw a link between the legislative actions of the Slovak Republic and that decision. The cap on operating expenses, the ban on brokers, and the repositioning of the Regulator all took place significantly before, and do not appear to have triggered, the alleged decision to hibernate.472 In contrast, the amended solvency requirements, amended redistribution rate, and ban on transfers were all introduced after the decision to hibernate was allegedly taken.473 Claimant, Respondent notes, identifies the ban on profits as the trigger for its decision to hibernate,474 but in Respondent's view, Claimant was legally obliged by the cap on operating expenses to lower its expenditures in any event.475 Not only is the causal link not proven, Respondent submits, but there were \"many other reasons\" why Claimant may have sought to reduce its expenses, including general attention to efficiency, economic crisis, losses by Claimant's holding company outside the Slovak Republic, and ordinary business decision-making.476\n\n*Biwater Gauff*, \u00b6779.\n\n*S.D. Myers*, \u00b6316.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b6\u00b657-60.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b665.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b670.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b664.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b673.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b679.\n\n**2. \"Duty\" to Mitigate**\n-------------------------\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n300.\n\nClaimant contends that its hibernation strategy was intended to mitigate the damages caused by the 2007 Reforms, but notes Respondent's position that Eureko should have terminated its operations prior to 30 September 2006 in anticipation of coming legislative changes.477 In Claimant's view, this argument \"makes no sense\" as Eureko would then been entitled to the full value of its investment, or \u20ac144.9 million\u2014more than it now seeks.478 Claimant further submits as a factual matter that it could not have anticipated the 2007 Reforms and should not have had to anticipate a breach of the BIT.479\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6III.7.\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6III.8.\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6III.8.\n\n301.\n\nIn any event, Claimant argues, the duty to prove a failure to mitigate lies with the Party raising the defence. Citing the holdings of the tribunals in *AIG v. Kazakhstan*,480 and *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*,481 Claimant contends that this burden is a high one: not every failure to accurately assess risks gives rise to a mitigation defence and a plausible explanation for a claimant's actions will suffice.482\n\n*AIG Capital Partners, Inc. and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/6, Award, 7 October 2003, \u00b610.6.5 (3).\n\n*Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6, Award, 12 April 2002, \u00b6170.\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6III.13-14.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n302.\n\nRespondent submits that the 2007 Reforms were predictable\u2014and were, in fact, anticipated by Claimant\u2014well before Eureko made its investment in Union Healthcare (see above at paragraph 193). Early elections had already been called in February 2006, before the incorporation of Union, and \"[a]t any point prior to 30 September 2006, Union Healthcare could have, and should have terminated its activities, to avoid the consequences of the expected regulation.\"483\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6365.\n\n**3. The Calculation of Damages**\n---------------------------------\n\n*Claimant's Position*\n---------------------\n\n303.\n\nClaimant submits that the standard for calculating damages in international law is set out generally in the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice in its *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* decision as follows:484\n\nReparation must, so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if the act had not been committed.\n\nThis standard, Claimant argues, has been subsequently incorporated into the Articles on State Responsibility developed by the International Law Commission485 and applied by arbitral tribunals in cases such as *Vivendi*.486\n\n*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Merits)*, Judgment of 13 September 1928, P.C.I.J. Series A, No. 17 at p. 47.\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6III.2\n\n*Vivendi*, \u00a78.2.7.\n\n304.\n\nRelying on the Expert Report of Mr Richard Indge (of Ernst & Young), Claimant outlines two calculation methods, both based upon a discounted dividend model (a form of discounted cash flow modelling), and a third method as a \u2018reasonableness check'. Claimant submits that discounted cash flow represents the approach to damages adopted in most investment treaty arbitrations.487\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6III.6.\n\n305.\n\n*Methodology 1*. The first method offered by Claimant is based on a comparison between the dividends that Eureko would have received in the absence of the 2007 Reforms (\" **Model E** \") and the dividends that it anticipates receiving now that the 2007 Reforms have been both enacted and reversed (\" **Model A** \"). For the purposes of this calculation, Claimant dates the 2007 Reforms to 25 October 2007, the date of the ban on profits, notwithstanding that certain measures were introduced before that date.488 Claimant treats the 2007 Reforms as having ended on 1 August 2011, the date on which the further reforms adopted in July 2011 entered into force.489 Claimant's first methodology assesses the damages suffered by Eureko to be \u20ac47 million.490\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6IV.6.\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6IV.3.\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6IV.5.\n\n306.\n\n*Methodology 2.* Claimant's second method is based on a comparison between the value of Eureko's investment before the 2007 Reforms and its value at 1 August 2011. Claimant's 1 August 2011 valuation is based upon dividends anticipated in the Model A calculation and amounts to \u20ac138.7 million. Claimant's pre-2007 Reforms valuation is based on a model prepared by Union's Management Board and Eureko's Group Strategy and Performance Group to reflect Claimant's legitimate expectations at 24 October 2007 (\" **Model 2007** \"). Although both models are based upon a scenario in which the 2007 Reforms did not take place, Model 2007 differs from Model E in that it reflects assumptions for other factors as at October 2007, rather than actual events and the revised assumptions forecast in 2011 in Model E.491 Model 2007 assesses the value of Claimant's investment in October 2007 at \u20ac144.9 million, an amount that is then uplifted to reflect anticipated returns between October 2007 and August 2011. Applying three possible rates, this results in a value of \u20ac203.4 to \u20ac189.5 million and a resulting loss, as a result of the 2007 Reforms of \u20ac64.7 to \u20ac50.8 million.492\n\nExpert Report of Richard Indge, \u00b67.8.\n\nExpert Report of Richard Indge, \u00b67.21-25.\n\n307.\n\n*Methodology 3.* Claimant verifies the reasonableness of its two methodologies against a simplified methodology representing the borrowing cost of the \u20ac72 million which Eureko invested in Union Healthcare. Although not reflective of actual damages, Claimant submits that at the 7,375 to 8,375 percent rate allegedly applicable to Eureko's debts, its damages should amount to no less than its borrowing cost of \u20ac22.1 to \u20ac25.5 million.493\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6IV.16.\n\n308.\n\nClaimant identifies a discount factor of 9.4 percent and claims compound interest at that rate, irrespective of the method adopted.494 Claimant further notes that it may be subject to taxes on damages that would not have been applicable to dividends and requests an order that Respondent bear any taxes owed as a result of awarded damages.495\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6IV.18.\n\nClaimant's Damages Memorial, \u00b6IV.20.\n\n309.\n\nEvaluating its models, Claimant rejects the points of disagreement raised by Respondent (see below at paragraph 312). Specifically, Claimant contends that its models do account for the lapse of newly acquired policyholders496 and that its prediction of gradually decreasing broker commissions reflects Union Healthcare's decreasing reliance on brokers at it gained market share and recognition.497 Claimant similarly defends its ratio of premium income to claims, noting that Respondent seeks to apply the average rate among Slovak health insurers. In effect, Claimant argues, this negates the very efficiencies Eureko entered the market in order to create and takes as a starting point that no greater efficiency was possible.498 Next, Claimant defends the omission of a small company premium in calculating discount rates, arguing that Union Healthcare is not, in fact, a small company, but is backed by the much larger Eureko group.499 Finally, Claimant defends its use of a single date\u20142024\u2014for calculating the terminal value in Models A and E. As a \"matter of pure logic,\" Claimant argues, terminal value, being the \"value of the company beyond a point that can reasonably be estimated\" should end at the same year for both models.500 Moreover, Claimant submits, its first calculation method requires the use of a single terminal value for both models to avoid capturing growth relating only to the underlying economic assumptions of the models.501\n\nJoint Expert Report, pp. 9-10.\n\nJoint Expert Report, pp. 13-14; Hearing Tr., 30 January 2012 at 23:24 to 24:6.\n\nHearing Tr., 30 January 2012 at 21:9 to 22:15.\n\nHearing Tr., 30 January 2012 at 20:20 to 21:8.\n\nHearing Tr., 30 January 2012 at 19:19 to 20:5.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b670-73.\n\n310.\n\nOn the whole, Claimant considers the outcome reached by Respondent's expert witnesses on damages to be \"simply not credible.\"502 Claimant notes that Respondent's methods would value Union Healthcare at negative \u20ac96.1 million in October 2007 and would treat the effect of the 2007 Reforms as beneficial to Claimant, preventing it from losing still further amounts of money.503 This amounts, in Claimant's view, to a statement that Union Healthcare was financially doomed, a position Claimant considers irreconcilable with the factual record. Moreover, Claimant notes, KPMG\u2014the same accounting firm preparing Respondent's expert report\u2014had previously audited Claimant, treated it as a going concern, and never raised concerns regarding its viability.504\n\nHearing Tr., 30 January 2012 at 10:20.\n\nHearing Tr., 30 January 2012 at 10:18 to 13:12.\n\nHearing Tr., 30 January 2012 at 17:21 to 18:22.\n\n*Respondent's Position*\n-----------------------\n\n311.\n\nRespondent objects to the damages methodology employed by Claimant and its expert. In Respondent's view, the use of the discounted dividend model is inappropriate in light of the short period of Claimant's investment prior to the alleged breach and its lack of a track record of profitability. Respondent notes that arbitral tribunals in *Metalclad*,505*Wena Hotels Ltd*.,506 and *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East)*  *Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*507 all declined to apply a discounted cashflow method where the claimant in those matters lacked a record of past performance.508 According to Respondent, this is \"exactly the case of Union Healthcare,\" and Claimant itself bases its claim on models, rather than any established track record. Of the arbitrations noted by Claimant, Respondent observes that the *Vivendi* tribunal ultimately declined to apply a discounted cashflow model on the grounds that future profitability was insufficiently established.509 Respondent submits that the same situation prevails here and that Claimant has not established a likelihood of profitability.510\n\n*Metalclad*, \u00b6\u00b6120-21.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd*., \u00b6123.\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, Award, 20 May 1990, \u00b6188.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6132-33.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6138-39, citing *Vivendi*, \u00b6\u00b68.3.4, 8.3.5, 8.3.8.\n\nRespondent's Damages Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6140-42.\n\n312.\n\nExamining Claimant's models, Respondent notes a number of points of disagreement, the most significant of which are recounted here. First, Respondent argues that Claimant's second method and its use of Model 2007 are inappropriate insofar as Model 2007 does not take into account the 2008 financial crisis.511 Accordingly, the second method compensates Claimant for events not related to legislative or other actions by the Slovak Republic.512 Respondent further questions the fact that all three models were prepared with the involvement of Claimant's personnel and objects particularly to the fact that Claimant's expert witness (Mr Indge) did not \"carry out a full verification of the assumptions\" underlying Model 2007.513\n\nExpert Report of Michael Peer and Zuzana Kepkov\u00e1, \u00b65.1.6.\n\nJoint Expert Report, p. 3.\n\nJoint Expert Report, p. 3.\n\n313.\n\nSecond, Respondent believes that Claimant's models overstate the projected growth of Union Healthcare's portfolio, in particular by understating the lapse rates of new policyholders. Respondent submits that the structure of Model 2007 omits lapse rates entirely from the calculation thereby omitting the costs of acquiring replacement policyholders and invalidating the results.514 Respondent also considers the lapse rates used in Model E to be low in light of the use of brokers projected therein, as broker-acquired policy holders lapse at a significantly higher rate than individuals acquired through an insurer's own network.515\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b664; Joint Expert Report, p. 9-10.\n\nExpert Report of Michael Peer and Zuzana Kepkov\u00e1, \u00b6\u00b66.2.14 to 6.2.19.\n\n314.\n\nThird, Respondent disagrees with the estimate employed in Model E that average broker commissions per policyholder acquired would have decreased significantly over time. Respondent considers that, had brokers remained permitted, new entrants to the market and the use of brokers by Union Healthcare's competitors would have maintained broker fees at a stable level.516\n\nExpert Report of Michael Peer and Zuzana Kepkov\u00e1, \u00b6\u00b66.5.1 to 6.5.6; Joint Expert Report, p. 13.\n\n315.\n\nFourth, Respondent does not consider Claimant's projected ratio between its income from insurance premiums and its expenditures on health care to be reasonable. In Respondent's view, the primary driver of the claims ratio in the long term is the ageing of the Slovak population, which would not support a decreasing rate.517 Moreover, Respondent argues, the poor state of the Slovak health sector would not suggest that significant reductions in expenditures, if achievable, would be sustainable in the long term.518\n\nExpert Report of Michael Peer and Zuzana Kepkov\u00e1, \u00b66.7.3.\n\nExpert Report of Michael Peer and Zuzana Kepkov\u00e1, \u00b66.7.6; Joint Expert Report, pp. 12-13.\n\n316.\n\nFifth, Respondent disagrees with the discount rate of 9.4 percent applied by Claimant. In particular, Respondent disagrees with the use of a single discount rate in all three models, notwithstanding the differing circumstances prevailing in 2007 and 2011,519 and the omission of a small company premium reflecting the scope of Union Healthcare's operations. Respondent considers a small company premium to be standard in valuation in the Slovak Republic.520\n\nJoint Expert Report, p. 5.\n\nExpert Report of Michael Peer and Zuzana Kepkov\u00e1, \u00b6\u00b66.10.14 to 6.10.15; Joint Expert Report, p. 4.\n\n317.\n\nFinally, Respondent rejects the approach to terminal value adopted in Claimant's models. According to Respondent's experts, Claimant applies a terminal value, ending the model, at the point where a stable number of policyholders is reached in the case of Model A and Model 2007 (in the years 2024 and 2016, respectively), but continues Model E for six additional years after reaching a stable number of policyholders. In Respondent's view, Model E should end in 2018, rather than 2024, reducing the ultimate loss under the first calculation method by \u20ac44.5 million.521\n\nJoint Expert Report, pp. 5-6.\n\n318.\n\nRespondent did not expressly challenge Methodology 3 except insofar as it was affected by the challenges raised to Methodologies 1 and 2.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Decision on Damages**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**1. The \"Hibernation\" and Mitigation of Damages**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nThe question of the extent of the loss caused by Respondent's breach of its Treaty obligations, for which Respondent is liable, remains. Respondent argued that no losses were caused by measures taken by Respondent. In essence, it claimed that it was Claimant's own choice to put its operations into \u2018hibernation'.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Respondent's view of the matter. The Tribunal accepts that Claimant reasonably regarded the 2007 Reforms (and particularly the cap on operating costs, the ban on profits and the ban on transfers) as putting it in a position in which it might be unable to recover its existing investment and any further sums invested in its business plans in Slovakia. The suspension (or \"hibernation\") of its operations in Slovakia was a reasonable response to that situation, and one that does not break the chain of causation and responsibility in this case. The suspension was a reasonable defensive measure, intended to minimise the risk of further losses. The Tribunal takes this view both from the perspective of questions of liability and causation, and from the perspective of the determination of compensation payable.522 The Tribunal rejects Respondent's submission that Claimant failed to mitigate its loss.\n\nSee Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\n\n**2. Calculation of Compensation**\n----------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the 2007 Reforms violated Article 3(1) of the Treaty. It has found that the 2007 Reforms violated Article 4 of the Treaty, but that the violation and the injury are subsumed within the violation and the injury arising from the breach of the \u2018fair and equitable treatment' obligation in Article 3, and that it is not necessary to consider them further. It has also found that there was no violation of Article 5 of the Treaty. Accordingly, the task is to quantify the losses for which compensation is due under Article 3(1) of the Treaty.\n\n322.\n\nIn principle, according to the well-established approach reflected in the *Chorz\u00f3w* *Factory* case523 and in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,524 Respondent is under an obligation \"to compensate for the damage caused\"525 by its breach of the Treaty.\n\n(1928) PCIJ, Series A, No. 17, p. 47.\n\nArticles 35, 36, 39.\n\nArticle 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\n\n323.\n\nIt is for Claimant to prove its case regarding the \u2018damage caused'. That said, the requirement of proof must not be impossible to discharge. Nor must the requirement for reasonable precision in the assessment of the quantum be carried so far that the search for exactness in the quantification of losses becomes disproportionately onerous when compared with the margin of error.\n\n324.\n\nIn the present case, Claimant put forward a number of different methodologies. Two were based upon calculations of the value of the business and the estimated impact upon that value of the 2007 Reforms.\n\n325.\n\nThat approach is often used in the case of an expropriation, to put a value on that which has been taken. Here, there is no \u2018deprivation' or expropriation. Further, the investment was in its early stages, in years that saw the very considerable disruption caused by various global economic crises. With a very short track record it is difficult to extrapolate to a robust estimate of the probable future value of Claimant's investment. It is also difficult to separate out the effect of the ban on profits and the ban on transfers from the effect of other measures, which the Tribunal has not found to constitute breaches of the Treaty.\n\n326.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, since Claimant's losses were the costs of defending its position against what proved to be temporary measures in breach of the Treaty, it is right to focus upon what those costs were.\n\n327.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant said:\n\nClaimant's Methodology 3, which assesses Eureko's damages from a conservative borrowing cost perspective and estimates damages in the amount of EUR 22.1M -22.5M, has been left uncontested by Respondent. It calculates solely Eureko's costs for funding Union during the time that its business was delayed as a consequence of the 2007 Reversal, and does not account for the return that Eureko - like any other investor - would require over and above the funding cost.526\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b614.\n\n328.\n\nThe rationale of this methodology, used by Claimant as a \"reasonableness check\" on the results gained from its methodologies based upon the valuation of the business, was that the sum represents the borrowing cost of the capital tied up in Eureko during the time that the ban on profits was in force.527 Claimant set that period as from 25 October 2007 to 1 August 2011, the date when new legislation on health insurance entered into force.\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial on Damages, \u00b6\u00b6IV.15, IV.16.\n\n329.\n\nClaimant may recover lost ground, and at some point in the future reach the same position on the market that it would have reached in the absence of the \u2018hibernation' that it adopted during the ban on profits. That possibility cannot be predicted with sufficient certainty. Moreover, profits ploughed back into healthcare are not profits dissipated or seized by the State without benefit flowing to Claimant. But in any event, some losses will not be recovered within the foreseeable future; and even if they are recovered in the future that recovery will not compensate for the loss of the present value of the monies.\n\n330.\n\nFaced with a freeze imposed by law, locking its investment in the Slovak Republic into that country, and without the possibility of being able to transfer any profits out of the State, the investment became essentially \u2018lost'. Hibernation was an entirely reasonable response by Claimant; and the cost of that hibernation is the loss that it suffered as a result of Respondent's failure to comply with its Treaty obligations. It is that cost that should be the quantum of compensation.\n\n331.\n\nAs to what that cost was, Claimant has calculated that the borrowing cost of the invested capital was not less than \u20ac22.1 million.528 The sum is derived from the application of a borrowing rate achieved by Eureko on a senior debt issue of \u20ac750m in 2009 of 7,375%.529 The actual calculation was not contested by Respondent.\n\nExhibit CE-2, \u00a7 8.10.\n\nExhibit CE-2, \u00a7 7.22.\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal regards that sum as a reasonable approximation to the cost of the \u2018standstill' that was triggered by the 2007 Reforms and specifically by the ban on profits.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly awards Claimant damages in the sum of \u20ac22.1 million, to be paid by Respondent net of any taxes that might be due to be paid by Claimant to Respondent on that sum.\n\n334.\n\nAs is common practice in the present type of investment arbitration, interest, compounded quarterly, will be payable on that sum as from 1 August 2011, up to the date of payment, to ensure full reparation.530 The German Arbitration Act is also silent with respect to interest. The Treaty itself contains no specific provision on interest, but the applicable law provision in Article 8(5) refers to \"the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned\" and \"principles of international law.\" Claimant requested pre-award and post-award interest \"at a rate to be determined by the arbitral tribunal.\"531 In its Memorial on Damages Claimant suggested \"compound interest at a rate of 9.4% per year as of 1 August 2011\" (based on what Mr. Indge had assessed as the time value of money in the context of determining a discount rate) or \"any lower or higher interest that the Tribunal considers appropriate.\"532 Respondent did not comment on interest rates. In these circumstances, the Tribunal has the power under international law to award interest, and discretion to determine a reasonable rate of interest, in order to ensure full reparation. The Tribunal has considered a range of interest rates including Euribor, Eurozone official and market rates, and the statutory rates for unpaid debts under German, Slovak and Netherlands law, and has decided that interest shall be applied at the Eurozone official rate for \"main refinancing operations\" (as published on the website of the European Central Bank www.ecb.int) plus 2%, compounded quarterly.\n\nSee, for example, Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility; *Azurix,* \u00b6440; *LG&E,* \u00b6\u00b6 54-56, 103-105; *MTD v. Chile,* \u00b6251; and *Wena Hotels Ltd.* \u00b6\u00b6128-129.\n\nSee paragraphs 126-128, above.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on Damages, \u00b6IV.17-19.\n\n**3. Other Relief**\n-------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal declares that the Slovak Republic breached its obligations under Article 3(1) and Article 4 of the BIT by adopting the ban on profits, and later by adopting also the ban on transfers. The Tribunal declines to make an order as requested by Claimant533 concerning future compliance with the Treaty by Respondent. It is not for the Tribunal to grant relief on the basis of speculations about the future conduct of the Parties. Nonetheless, the Tribunal notes that the Treaty remains in force.\n\nSee paragraphs 126-128, above.\n\n336.\n\nThe requests for relief made by Respondent are dismissed.\n\n**XI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Treaty contains no provisions on the allocation of the costs of arbitration arising out of an \"investment dispute\" (as opposed to a dispute concerning the Treaty's interpretation or application). The provisions regarding the Tribunal's decision in the matter of costs are instead to be found in Articles 38 to 40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules defines the \"costs of arbitration\" as follows:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n*(a)* The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n*(b)* The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n*(c)* The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n*(d)* The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n*(e)* The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n*(f)* Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\n338.\n\nMeanwhile, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provide the criteria to be applied by the Tribunal in awarding costs:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n339.\n\nThe Parties deposited with the PCA a total of \u20ac800,000.00 (\u20ac400,000.00 by Claimant; \u20ac400,000.00 by Respondent) to cover the costs of arbitration.\n\n340.\n\nThe fees of Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, the arbitrator appointed by Claimant, amount to \u20ac205,583.33 (\u20ac78,750.00 for the period up to the issuance of the Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension (the \" **Jurisdiction Phase** \"); and \u20ac126,833.33 for the subsequent period up until the issuance of this Final Award (the \" **Merits Phase** \"). His expenses amount to \u20ac6,800.08 (\u20ac2,287.17 for the Jurisdiction Phase and \u20ac4,512.91 for the Merits Phase, reflecting in particular travel to and accommodation in London for hearings and deliberations).\n\n341.\n\nThe fees of Judge Peter Tomka, the arbitrator originally appointed by Respondent, amount to \u20ac5,000.00 (for the Jurisdiction Phase only). Judge Tomka incurred no expenses. The fees of Mr V.V. Veeder, the arbitrator appointed by Respondent following the resignation of Judge Tomka, amount to \u20ac100,250.00 (\u20ac25,000.00 for the Jurisdiction Phase and \u20ac75,250.00 for the Merits Phase). Mr. Veeder's expenses amount to \u20ac434.65 (\u20ac22.00 for the Jurisdiction Phase and \u20ac412.65 for the Merits Phase).\n\n342.\n\nThe fees of Professor Vaughan Lowe, the Presiding Arbitrator, amount to \u20ac209,567.50 (\u20ac79,437.50 for the Jurisdiction Phase and \u20ac130,130.00 for the Merits Phase). His expenses amount to \u20ac1,328.86 (\u20ac1,193.86 for the Jurisdiction Phase and \u20ac135.00 for the Merits Phase).\n\n343.\n\nPursuant to the Terms of Appointment and the agreement of the Parties, the International Bureau of the PCA was designated to act as Registry in this arbitration. The PCA's fees for registry services amount to \u20ac79,470.00 (\u20ac33,877.50 for the Jurisdiction Phase and \u20ac45,592.50 for the Merits Phase).\n\n344.\n\nOther tribunal costs, including court reporters, hearing rooms, meeting facilities, travel, bank charges, and all other expenses relating to the arbitration proceedings, amount to \u20ac70,742.67 (\u20ac12,063.59 for the Jurisdiction Phase and \u20ac58,679.08 for the Merits Phase).\n\n345.\n\nBased on the above figures, the combined tribunal costs, comprising the items covered in Articles 38(a) to (c) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, total \u20ac679,177.09 (\u20ac237,631.62 for the Jurisdiction Phase and \u20ac441,545.47 for the Merits phase).\n\n346.\n\nThese tribunal costs are deducted from the deposit, and any unexpended balance shall be returned to the Parties in accordance with Article 41(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n347.\n\nThe principle governing the awarding of the costs of arbitration, according to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, is that an arbitral tribunal shall determine that the costs shall be borne by the unsuccessful party, unless it finds an apportionment of the costs between the parties to be reasonable under the circumstances of the case. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance (Article 38(e)), Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides that the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, is free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable. Articles 40(1) and (2) grant wide discretion to an arbitration tribunal in awarding the costs of arbitration.\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of a certain practice in investment treaty arbitration that each party bears its own costs and that the parties divide tribunal costs equally. That practice is not binding on this Tribunal, which prefers the more recent practice in investment arbitration of applying the general principle of \"costs follow the event,\" save for exceptional circumstances, such as when concerns regarding access to justice are raised. That approach is the more compelling one in the present case which is governed by the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules that expressly contemplate the rule of \"costs follow the event\" in Article 40(1) by its emphasis on \"success\" or lack thereof. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that both sides in this case indeed argue that the unsuccessful side in this arbitration should have to bear the full amount of tribunal costs as well as the other side's costs of legal representation. Further, Section 1057 of the German Arbitration Act provides for an arbitral tribunal to \"allocate costs, including those incurred by the parties necessary for the proper pursuit of their claim or defence,\" and that an arbitral tribunal shall do so \"at its discretion and take into consideration the circumstances of the case, in particular the outcome of the proceedings.\"534\n\nGerman Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung, or \" **ZPO** \"), Book 10.\n\n349.\n\nIn the present case, Claimant has succeeded in a substantial part of its claim on the merits. Moreover, it has done so on the basis that the ban on profits, which had been found unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic in January 2011, was a violation of the Treaty. As these costs concerning liability and damages in the Merits Phase have been incurred in order to recover losses arising from the violation of the Treaty, the Tribunal considers that they should in principle be paid by Respondent. The same is true in respect of the Tribunal and administrative costs for the Merits Phase.\n\n350.\n\nThe Jurisdiction Phase, in contrast, raised a difficult and novel question in the form of the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection. In respect of that phase, each Party should bear its own costs and one-half of the Tribunal costs.\n\n351.\n\nOn the basis of the figures set out in the Revised Costs Submissions of 12 March 2012, Respondent is accordingly directed to pay to Claimant the sum of \u20ac2,905,350.94. This amount represents Claimant's fees and expenses of legal representatives and experts for the liability and quantum phases of the case. The Tribunal considers such costs to have been reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount.\n\n**XII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n352.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DISMISSES each of the remaining jurisdictional objections advanced by Respondent and decides that it has jurisdiction over the dispute;\n\n(b) DECLARES Respondent to have breached Article 3 and Article 4 of the Treaty by adopting the ban on profits and the ban on transfers;\n\n(c) ORDERS Respondent to pay to Claimant damages in the sum of \u20ac22.1 million, net of any taxes that might be due to be paid by Claimant to Respondent on that sum;\n\n(d) ORDERS Respondent to pay to Claimant interest on the amount of \u20ac22.1 million, as from 1 August 2011 up to the date of payment, at the Eurozone official rate for \"main refinancing operations\" (as published on the website of the European Central Bank www.ecb.int) plus 2%, compounded quarterly;\n\n(e) ORDERS Respondent to pay to Claimant the amount of \u20ac220,772.74 to reimburse Claimant for costs of this Merits Phase of the arbitration; and\n\n(f) ORDERS Respondent to pay to Claimant the amount of \u20ac2,905,350.94 for its legal representation and assistance in the Merits Phase of this arbitration."}]}
