INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed on 4 November 2005 and in force on 1 November 2006 (the \"Treaty\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Italba Corporation (\"Italba\" or the \"Claimant\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida, United States of America.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (\"Uruguay\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\" The Parties\u2019 representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis decision concerns Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief, dated 10 November 2016.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 16 February 2016, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration dated 16 February 2016 from Italba against Uruguay (the \"Request\"). The Request was supplemented by Claimant\u2019s letters dated 10 and 20 March 2016.\n\n7.\n\nOn 24 March 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible, in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nIn accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, and pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, the Tribunal was to be constituted by three arbitrators to be appointed as follows: one by each Party and the third, the presiding arbitrator, by agreement of the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal was composed of Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno, a national of Costa Rica, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. John Beechey, a national of the United Kingdom, appointed by Claimant; and Professor Zachary Douglas, a national of Australia, appointed by Respondent.\n\n10.\n\nOn 27 May 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that the three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was deemed constituted on that date. Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 26 July 2016, by teleconference.\n\n12.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 29 July 2016, the President of the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provided, *inter alia,* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006; that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish; and that the place of the proceeding would be Washington, DC. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out a schedule for the proceeding.\n\n13.\n\nOn 28 July 2016, the Tribunal and the Parties were informed that the Secretary of the Tribunal would be taking temporary leave, and that Ms. Luisa Fernanda Torres would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal during her absence.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on 16 September 2016, Claimant filed a Memorial on the Merits, together with witness statements by Mr. Gustavo Alberelli and Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n; an expert report by Mr. Santiago Dellepiane Avellaneda of Compass Lexecon; Exhibits C-001 to C-136 and Legal Authorities CL-001 to CL-085.\n\n15.\n\nOn 14 October 2016, Respondent advised that it did not intend to request the bifurcation of the proceeding, and that it would file its objections to jurisdiction with its Counter-Memorial.\n\n16.\n\nOn 31 October 2016, Claimant informed the Tribunal that, one of its witnesses, Mr. Herb\u00f3n, had received a notice to appear before a criminal court in Montevideo, Uruguay, in connection with the Investigation associated with his and Mr. Alberrelli\u2019s testimony in this arbitration. Claimant noted that it understood that the Investigation concerned an allegation that certain documents submitted in this arbitration were not authentic, and argued that the Investigation represented an \"abuse of the filings in this arbitration and an attempt to harass and intimidate\"1 its witnesses. Italba invited Respondent to confirm that it would terminate these criminal proceedings.\n\nCl. Letter (31 October 2016) at 2.\n\n17.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, Respondent replied to Claimant\u2019s communication of 31 October 2016. In that letter, *inter alia,* Uruguay expanded on the background facts underlying the Investigation, and denied that its purpose was to attack the Claimant\u2019s witnesses in this arbitration. Respondent emphasized the separation of powers between the Executive and Judicial branches in Uruguay, and defended the independence of its judiciary citing reports by international organizations.2 In summary, Uruguay explained that based on inquiries made by officials in the Office of the President (including the Secretary of the Presidency), there was \"reason to believe that Mr. Herb\u00f3n and/or Dr. Alberelli might have committed the crime of forgery or fraud\" in falsifying the signature of an individual (Dr. Fernando Garcia) in two exhibits submitted in this arbitration (Ex. C-056 and C-057).3 Referring to obligations imposed on public officials by Article 177 of the Uruguay Criminal Code,4 Respondent added that the Office of the President had reported \"what could be a serious criminal offense\" to \"fulfil a well-established legal obligation to report such circumstances to the appropriate authorities, and to avoid the commission of a separate criminal offense by failing to do so.\"5 Respondent submitted that Uruguay could not be precluded from its sovereign right of \"evaluating, in good faith\" evidence relevant to the commission of a crime, when it had reason to believe that one might have been committed in its territory.6\n\nResp. Letter (8 November 2016) at 1-2.\n\n*Id.,* at 3.\n\n*Id..* at 2.\n\n*Id.,* at 5.\n\n*Id.,* at 5.\n\n18.\n\nOn 10 November 2016, Claimant filed an Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief (\"Claimant\u2019s Application\") pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(1) of the Arbitration Rules. The Claimant\u2019s Application sought, *inter alia,* to enjoin the criminal prosecution in Uruguay of Mr. Alberelli and Mr. Herb\u00f3n pending the resolution of this arbitration. In addition, Claimant requested temporary relief to preserve the *status quo* while the Claimant\u2019s Application was pending, noting that Mr. Herb\u00f3n was scheduled to appear for a hearing on 1 December 2016. Lastly, Claimant invited the Tribunal to set a schedule for Respondent\u2019s response and Claimant\u2019s reply, and to inform the Parties of its availability for a hearing on this issue in December 2016 or January 2017. The Claimant\u2019s Application is further discussed at Section III *infra.*\n\n19.\n\nOn 14 November 2016, the Tribunal invited Respondent to provide its observations on Claimant\u2019s Application by Thursday, 17 November 2016.\n\n20.\n\nOn that same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, amending certain requirements of Procedural Order No. 1 relating to the submission of hard copies of pleadings and accompanying documents.\n\n21.\n\nOn 15 November 2016, Respondent applied to the Tribunal for an extension of time until 21 November 2016 to provide its observations on Claimant\u2019s Application.\n\n22.\n\nOn 16 November 2016, the Tribunal granted the extension requested by Respondent.\n\n23.\n\nOn that same day, Claimant wrote to the Tribunal advising that, while it did not oppose the extension granted to Respondent, it relied on that extension in order to renew its request for temporary relief. Claimant argued, *inter alia* that \"[g]ranting a temporary order would allow the parties sufficient time to brief this issue fully and the Tribunal sufficient time to deliberate and decide it without the deadline of Mr. Herb\u00f3n\u2019s hearing on December 1, 2016 looming in the background.\"\n\n24.\n\nOn 17 November 2016, Respondent replied to Claimant\u2019s communication of 16 November 2016. It requested the Tribunal to decline Claimant\u2019s request for temporary relief, arguing that there was no urgency, as the next event in the Investigation in Uruguay was not scheduled until 1 December 2016. Respondent indicated that no developments were expected before then, let alone before the filing of Uruguay\u2019s observations due on 21 November 2016. The Respondent\u2019s position is further summarized at Section III *infra.*\n\n25.\n\nOn 21 November 2016, Respondent submitted its Response to Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief (\"Respondent\u2019s Response\"). The Respondent\u2019s position is summarized in Section III *infra.* As further discussed below, in this response Uruguay stated *inter alia* that it was \"prepared to guarantee that its investigation into the circumstances of the apparently forged signatures and fraudulent documents, regardless of its course, will not prevent either Dr. Alberelli or Mr. Herb\u00f3n from participating in the preparation or presentation of the remainder of Claimant\u2019s case.\"7\n\nResp. Res. Prov. Meas., \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 54.\n\n26.\n\nOn 22 November 2016, the Tribunal invited Claimant to provide its observations on Respondent\u2019s Response by Thursday, 24 November 2016.\n\n27.\n\nOn 24 November 2016, Claimant submitted its Reply in Further Support of Its Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief (\"Claimant\u2019s Reply\"). The Claimant\u2019s position is summarized in Section III *infra.*\n\n28.\n\nOn 25 November 2016, Respondent inquired whether the Tribunal would invite Respondent\u2019s further observations on Claimant\u2019s Reply of 24 November 2016. On that same day, the President of the Tribunal, on behalf of the Tribunal, responded that the Tribunal considered that both Parties had had ample opportunity to present their views, and announced that an additional communication from the Tribunal would follow shortly.\n\n29.\n\nThereafter, also on 25 November 2016, the President of the Tribunal sent the following communication to the Parties, in Spanish, on behalf of the Tribunal:\n\n\"1. Independently from the eventual decision concerning the Claimant\u2019s pending application, the Tribunal understands that the testimony of Messrs. Herbon and Alberelli are central to support the Claimant\u2019s claims and, therefore, their eventual detention would be extremely prejudicial to the interests of that party.\n\n2. During the briefing of this Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief, Respondent has put forward its view and, in connection with the various matters in dispute, it has also stated:\n\n'Uruguay recognizes that these witnesses might also be called upon by Claimant to assist in the preparation of its Reply (due in April 2017) or testify at the oral hearings (expected in November 2017). In that regard, and to avoid prejudice to Claimant, Uruguay is prepared to guarantee that its investigation into the circumstances of the apparently forged signatures and fraudulent documents, regardless of its course, will not prevent either Dr. Alberelli or Mr. Herb\u00f3n from participating in the preparation or presentation of the remainder of Claimant\u2019s case.'\n\n3. In order to concretize the Respondent\u2019s guarantee, the Tribunal requests that, no later than 28 November 2016, Respondent confirm such guarantee to the Tribunal and communicate the concrete steps that it will take to provide certainty to Mr. Herbon and Mr. Alberelli that they will not be detained in the criminal investigation that [Respondent] is conducting, or in any other proceeding that the Respondent might initiate. The Tribunal also asks the Republic of Uruguay to ensure that it will not take any measure that will prevent those gentlemen from freely providing, without any limitation, the testimony that Claimant has requested.\n\nAlthough in this proceeding, in normal circumstances, the Tribunal\u2019s communication with the Parties should be made through the ICSID Secretariat, in light of the existing urgency, the Tribunal decided to communicate directly with the Parties.\" (Tribunal\u2019s translation.)\n\n30.\n\nOn 28 November 2016, Respondent filed observations in response to the President of the Tribunal\u2019s communication of 25 November 2016, confirming the above-mentioned guarantee. This communication is further described at Section III *infra.*\n\n31.\n\nOn 30 November 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties inviting Claimant to:\n\n\"[...] confirm, on or before Monday, 5 December 2016, whether or not it accepts that the guarantees set out in the Respondent\u2019s letter of 28 November, 2016 are sufficient to protect its ability to present witness evidence from Mr. Herbon and Mr. Alberelli in these proceedings. If the Claimant does not accept the adequacy of these guarantees, the Claimant is invited to provide reasons for the same.\"\n\n32.\n\nOn 5 December 2016, Claimant filed observations in response to the Tribunal\u2019s communication of 30 November 2016. In short, Claimant argued that the Respondent\u2019s \"guarantee\" was a \"vague promise\", \"inadequate\" and \"effectively worthless.\" This communication is further described at Section III *infra.*\n\n33.\n\nOn 6 December 2016, Respondent filed a further communication addressing certain allegations in Claimant\u2019s communication of 5 December 2016. On that same day, Claimant sent a further communication in response. These communications are further described at Section III *infra.*\n\n34.\n\nOn 9 December 2016, the President of the Tribunal wrote on behalf of the Tribunal, inviting the Parties to provide an update on whether \"Mr. Herbon had, in fact, appeared before the Uruguayan Criminal Court [on 1 December 2016] and, if so, what were the circumstances of his appearance.\"\n\n35.\n\nOn 13 December 2016, Respondent informed the Tribunal that \"Mr. Herb\u00f3n did not appear in court on 1 December 2016, as required by his summons\" adding that \"[n]o reason for his failure to appear was given to the Court or the Prosecutor by Mr. Herb\u00f3n or his counsel.\" Uruguay added, however, that \"the guarantee that Uruguay has given \u2014 in its Response to Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (filed on 21 November 2016) and its correspondence with the Tribunal of 28 November 2016 \u2014 remains in place.\"8\n\nResp. Letter (13 December 2016) at. 1.\n\n36.\n\nAlso on 13 December 2016, Claimant reported that \"[b]ecause the Tribunal did not rule on the application before the December 1 hearing date, Mr. Herb\u00f3n retained independent counsel to assist him in the criminal proceedings [...]\", adding that such \"[...] counsel has now appeared for Mr. Herb\u00f3n and was successful in rescheduling Mr. Herb\u00f3n\u2019s hearing date until February.\" Claimant, however, while reporting that Mr. Herb\u00f3n\u2019s counsel had been able to reschedule his court appearance for a date in February 2017, argued that \"Mr. Herb\u00f3n and Dr. Alberelli remain unable to return to Uruguay to gather evidence and conduct business without the threat of pretrial incarceration.\" Italba went on to argue that \"the investigation will continue to impede Italba\u2019s ability to compile evidence in support of its case and speak to witnesses who could testify on Italba\u2019s behalf', and referred also to \"Uruguay\u2019s attempts to influence or coerce potential witnesses in this arbitration into refusing to provide testimony for Italba.\" Claimant reiterated its request for provisional measures.\n\n37.\n\nOn 5 January 2017, the Tribunal and the Parties were informed that Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero was reassuming her functions as Secretary of the Tribunal in this matter.\n\n38.\n\nOn 30 January 2017, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1 as modified by Procedural Order No. 2, Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with witness statements by Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Cendoya, Ms. Elena Grauert, Ms. Alicia Fern\u00e1ndez, Mr. Fernando Garcia Piriz, Mr. Fernando P\u00e9rez Tab\u00f3, Mr. Gabriel Lombide, Mr. Juan Piaggio, and Mr. Le\u00f3n Lev; expert reports by Prof. Santiago Pereira Campos and by Daniel Flores and Ettore Comi of Econ One Research; Exhibits R-008 to R-080 and Legal Authorities RL-024 to RL-119.\n\n39.\n\nOn 9 February 2017, Claimant filed a further communication informing the Tribunal that Mr. Herb\u00f3n hearing before the Uruguayan Criminal Court was now scheduled for 15 February 2017 and reiterating its request for provisional measures. On 14 February 2017, Respondent filed observations in response to this communication, confirming again the above-mentioned guarantee. These communications are further described at Section III *infra.*\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 respective positions in connection with the present Application are briefly outlined below. The Tribunal notes, however, that in deciding this matter it has considered the full extent of the Parties\u2019 arguments in their written submissions. To the extent that arguments are not referred to expressly in the brief summary below, they should be deemed to be subsumed into the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n\n**A. Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n41.\n\nClaimant contends that Uruguay has initiated criminal proceedings against two of Italba\u2019s witnesses (Mr. Gustavo Alberelli and Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n), based solely on documents and testimony submitted in this arbitration. According to Claimant, the proceedings concern the (false) allegation that certain documents presented with Claimant\u2019s Memorial are forgeries.9\n\nCl. App. Prov. Meas., \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n\n42.\n\nItalba remarks that these witnesses are the target of the Investigation based on a high-ranking Government official\u2019s accusation that \"the forged document was submitted *in this arbitration* for the purpose of defrauding *this Tribunal* and embarrassing Uruguay.\"10 According to Claimant, the Investigation \"clearly arises out of and relates to conduct that is within the jurisdiction and competence of this Tribunal.\"11\n\nCl. Reply Prov. Meas., \u00b6 7(b).\n\nId., \u00b6 7(b).\n\n43.\n\nClaimant contends that these criminal proceedings \"(a) thwart Italba\u2019s ability to proceed with this arbitration by incarcerating its principals and chilling assistance from relevant witnesses; (b) aggravate the *status quo,* and (c) usurp the functions of this Tribunal.\"12 According to Italba, \"Uruguay clearly hopes to litigate the authenticity of these documents in its home court, in the chilling context of a criminal prosecution, and present to this Tribunal the 'findings of fact' that court renders as a *fait accompli.\"* The proceedings are, \"[i]n essence, [...] an attempt by Uruguay to usurp the Tribunal\u2019s factfinding role in evaluating the evidence before it.\"13\n\nCl. App. Prov. Meas., \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 5.\n\n*Id..* \u00b6 5.\n\n**(1) On the Request for Provisional Measures**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nClaimant argues that it is entitled to provisional measures enjoining Respondent from continuing with the criminal prosecution of Mr. Alberelli and Mr. Herb\u00f3n.14 It explains that \"[it] does not seek to quash the criminal prosecution\", but rather \"only a temporary stay of the prosecution until the end of the arbitration [...].\"15\n\n*Id.,* \u00a7 III (A)\n\nCl. Reply Prov. Meas., \u00b6 8.\n\n**a. The Tribunal Has** ***Prima Fade*** **Jurisdiction to Grant Provisional Measures**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nClaimant argues that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction and can grant the relief requested.16 In particular, Italba posits that:\n\n\u2022 \"[T]here is no doctrine of jurisdictional restraint with respect to applications or provisional measures, and tribunals have granted requests for such measures even where they have yet to decide on jurisdictional objections raised by respondents.\"17\n\n\u2022 In any event, the Memorial and accompanying evidence have already showed that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction \"including because Italba is a U.S. national and the owner of its Uruguayan subsidiary, Trigosul.\"18\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 36.\n\nId., \u00b6 35.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 35 (*citing* Claimant\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 90, 93 n. 196).\n\n46.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(1) of the Arbitration Rules \"specifically authorize ICSID tribunals to order provisional measures to preserve the rights of the parties.\"19\n\nCl. App. Prov. Meas., \u00b6 19.\n\n**b. The Requirements for the Granting of Provisional Measures are Satisfied**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nClaimant notes that it is \"widely accepted\" that a petitioner seeking provisional measures must show that \"(a) it holds rights deserving protection, (b) those rights are in urgent need of protection, (c) the requested provisional measures are necessary, and (d) the requested provisional measures are proportional.\"20 Italba contends that all four requirements are satisfied in the present case.\n\nCl. App. Prov. Meas., \u00b6 21.\n\n48.\n\n*Protected Rights.* Italba argues that its rights to the procedural integrity of the arbitral process, preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute deserve protection.21 Claimant maintains that the criminal prosecution against its witnesses threatens and upsets those rights.22 In particular, Italba argues that:\n\n\u2022 As the criminal proceedings against Mr. Alberelli and Mr. Herb\u00f3n are based solely on Claimant\u2019s filings in this arbitration, it would undermine the integrity of this arbitral proceeding, were the criminal investigation to be allowed to continue and to take place concurrently with this arbitration.23\n\n\u2022 The criminal investigation will \"irremediably disrupt the arbitral process\", because it will divert Claimant\u2019s time, effort and resources from this arbitration whilst it deals with the criminal proceedings; and it will have a chilling effect on Italba\u2019s witnesses.24\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 22-27.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 28-31.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 29.\n\n77, \u00b6 30.\n\n49.\n\n*Urgency.* Claimant contends that the measures are urgent by definition when the procedural integrity of the arbitration is threatened or when, as it alleges is the case here, a State has taken, or is threatening to take, measures aggravating the dispute.25 In particular, Claimant argues that there is an urgent need for provisional relief in this case, as the criminal proceedings have already begun, and they will likely continue and be completed before a final award is rendered in this case.26\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 32.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 33.\n\n50.\n\nDuring the briefing process, Claimant emphasized that Mr. Herb\u00f3n was scheduled to appear before the criminal court on 1 December 2016. It noted that there was a \"significant risk\" that at such time, or shortly thereafter, he might be indicted, arrested and put in pre-trial detention, thereby destroying Italba\u2019s access to one of its key witnesses and compromising its ability to present its case.27 Italba argues that \"pre-trial detention is the *norm* for individuals charged with fraud.\"28\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 33. *See also,* Cl. Reply Prov. Meas., \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19 and Cl. Letter (9 February 2017) at 2 (informing the Tribunal that Mr. Herb\u00f3n\u2019s hearing before the Uruguayan Criminal Court was now scheduled for 15 February 2017 and adding that \"Counsel to Mr. Herbon has confirmed that if Mr. Herb\u00f3n appears at the hearing, as he is required to do, he will likely be indicted and imprisoned pending a criminal trial.\")\n\nCl. Reply Prov. Meas., \u00b6 14. *See also, id.,* \u00b6 7(c).\n\n51.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s Reply, Italba also took issue with Respondent\u2019s contention that there was no imminent harm to Claimant resulting from Mr. Herb\u00f3n\u2019s 1 December 2016 hearing, because he could choose not to attend and the hearing would then be adjourned.29 Claimant referred to the serious consequences that might follow if Mr. Herb\u00f3n failed to appear, including a court order for detention on his return to Uruguay, or a court request for Interpol assistance to arrest him. Italba further remarked that \"if the judiciary in Uruguay is indeed as 'independent' as Uruguay professes, Uruguay cannot guarantee that Mr. Herb\u00f3n would not suffer such consequences.\"30\n\nCl.

Meas., \u00b6 13.\n\n52.\n\n*Necessity.* Italba notes that the measures requested must be necessary to avoid harm or prejudice to the petitioner.31 Observing that tribunals have differed on the degree of harm required, some requiring \"substantial harm\" and others requiring \"irreparable harm\" *(i.e.* harm not reparable by an award of damages), Claimant argues that both standards would be met in the present case.32\n\nCl. App. Prov. Meas., \u00b6 34.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 35.\n\n53.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the testimony of Mr. Alberelli and Mr. Herb\u00f3n is of \"paramount importance.\" The criminal prosecution of either would cause irreparable harm as it would obstruct Italba\u2019s access to these witnesses and their documents, thereby hindering its ability to present its case.33 Italba argues that Mr. Alberelli is unable to return to Uruguay for fear of incarceration and cannot access his documents, while Mr. Herb\u00f3n\u2019s documents would not be accessible if he was incarcerated pending trial.34\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 36.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 36. *See also,* Cl.

Accepting that the Tribunal has \"the exclusive competence to evaluate the evidence [...] for the purpose of ruling on all claims and defences presented in these arbitral proceedings\",94 Respondent states that a finding by a Uruguayan court that the signatures were forgeries would not be binding on this Tribunal.95\n\n*Id...* \u00b6 24.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 24.\n\n87.\n\nSimilarly, Uruguay questions the notion that Respondent should not be allowed to conduct a criminal investigation based on documents it received as part of this arbitration. For Respondent, a claimant in an ICSID proceeding \"does not automatically enjoy immunity from the application of the host State\u2019s criminal law.\"96\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 25.\n\n88.\n\nRecognizing that a State may not abuse its sovereign right to enforce criminal laws \"[...] by exercising them in bad faith, including for the purpose of obtaining unfair advantage in an arbitration\", Uruguay argues that no such bad faith is present here.97\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 27.\n\n89.\n\nIn response to Claimant\u2019s allegations that the Secretary of the Presidency has been engaged in a campaign to intimidate witnesses, in its communication of 6 December 2016, Respondent stated:\n\n\"Uruguay represents to the Tribunal, categorically and unequivocally, that it has made, and will make, no effort to dissuade any witnesses from cooperating with or testifying on behalf of Claimant. Uruguay has done no more than its due diligence in inquiring of particular individuals in Uruguay whether the actions or comments attributed to them by Dr. Alberelli or Mr. Herbon in their Declarations are as described therein. That is how Uruguay discovered that Dr. Garcia had no communications with either Dr. Alberelli or Mr. Herbon, contradicting what they said in their Declarations, and that his signatures on the documents submitted by them are forgeries.\n\nUruguay has since discovered that Claimant has also falsely reported on its communications with other persons and entities in Uruguay, including Canal 7 and DirecTV. Uruguay has received letters from authorized representatives of these companies, which it will submit with its Counter Memorial on 16 January, denying the truthfulness of the representations made about them in the Declarations of Dr. Alberelli and Mr. Herbon. It appears from Uruguay\u2019s due diligence that Claimant has engaged in a pattern of false representations about its contacts and business dealings in Uruguay. This may be the reason it is falsely accusing Uruguay of witness intimidation \u2014 to discourage Uruguay from exercising its right to ascertain the veracity of the representations Claimant has made in these proceedings.\"98\n\nResp.

Claimant responded also on 6 December 2016, arguing that this submission was an attempt to \"distract the Tribunal from the matter at hand.\" Italba went on to state that \"it would not be at all surprising if the new allegations in Uruguay\u2019s letter portend a widened criminal investigation in Uruguay \u2014 the goal of which is either to force this entire dispute into the Uruguayan criminal courts or, at the very least, to cripple Italba\u2019s ability to respond in this arbitration with live witnesses to any of Uruguay\u2019s forthcoming arguments.\" Claimant also argued \"that Uruguay\u2019s desperate effort to use unsupported and baseless allegations in order to avoid an order of provisional measures only highlights why this arbitration became necessary in the first place: Uruguay will stop at nothing to block Italba from enjoying the fruits of its investments in Uruguay.\"\n\na. **Lack of** ***Prima Facie*** **Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nRespondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s Application must be rejected because Claimant has not established the Tribunal\u2019s *prima facie* jurisdiction.99 For Uruguay, \"[b]efore an ICSID tribunal may consider the recommendation of provisional measures, it must be satisfied that, at a minimum, its *prima facie* jurisdiction has been established.\"100 According to Respondent, the contrary argument is incorrect as a matter of law.101\n\nResp.

Meas., \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 34-37.\n\n94.\n\nAccording to Respondent, tribunals have \"uniformly\" recognized that provisional measures are an \"extraordinary remedy\" subject to a \"high bar\", which is \"particularly high\" when the requested measures would interfere with the sovereign right to investigate criminal offenses in its territory.106\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 38.\n\n95.\n\nUruguay argues that tribunals have \"routinely\" rejected applications similar to the one at issue here \"holding that a respondent State\u2019s sovereign right to investigate criminal activity in its own territory may not be infringed absent a showing of improper motive.\"107 Respondent contends that the cases in which the applications have been granted, on which Claimant relies, are based on findings of a State\u2019s \"bad faith\" in the initiation or conduct of the investigation.108\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8-10.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 9, 39, and 52.\n\n96.\n\nFor Respondent, Claimant has failed to meet this high threshold. In short, in Uruguay\u2019s view: (i) Claimant has no right to insulate witnesses from good faith criminal investigations in Uruguay; (ii) even if such right existed, there is no imminent threat requiring urgent relief; and (iii) the relief sought is not proportionate.109\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 11.\n\n97.\n\n*The Allegedly Impaired Right.* Uruguay contends that Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it has a right threatened with irreparable impairment.110 While Claimant has a right freely to present its case before the Tribunal, such right does not include immunity for its witnesses from Uruguay\u2019s good faith exercise of its sovereign right to conduct a criminal investigation.111\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 55.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\n98.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant\u2019s rights are not impaired by the mere fact of calling witnesses for questioning in a criminal investigation in Uruguay\u2019s territory.112 The Investigation does not infringe on the exclusivity of the arbitral proceeding, nor does it undermine the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Respondent points out that the matter being investigated (forgery of signatures and falsification of documents) is very different from the subject matter of the arbitration (alleged treaty violations arising out of the revocation of Trigosul\u2019s frequencies in 2011 and alleged failure to comply with a 2014 judgment of the *Tribunal Contencioso Administrativo),113*\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 43.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 45.\n\n99.\n\n*Urgency and Proportionality.* In Respondent\u2019s view, absent any threat of irreparable harm, there is no urgent need for protection, and any provisional measures would be disproportionate.114\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 56.\n\n100.\n\nIn addition, Respondent contends that there is no urgency because (i) Mr. Alberelli has not even been served with summons as he lives in the the United States; and (ii) although Mr. Herb\u00f3n has been summoned to appear before the criminal court on 1 December, that fact alone does not deprive Claimant of any of its rights in this arbitration.115\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 57.\n\n101.\n\nBy letter of 14 February 2017, referring to the new date for Mr. Herb\u00f3n\u2019s hearing, noted that \"Mr. Herb\u00f3n, acting through Uruguayan counsel, has successfully rescheduled his hearing on previous occasions. Claimant has provided no reason to believe this time will be any different.\"116\n\nResp. Letter (14 February 2017) at 2.\n\n102.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, there is no proportionality. The measures requested are \"extreme\" and \"grossly disproportionate\" as the remedy sought would cause greater harm to Uruguay\u2019s indisputable sovereign right to conduct criminal investigations for serious offenses in its territory.117\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 58.\n\n**(2) On the Request for Temporary Relief**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s Response of 21 November 2016, Uruguay argued that this request was \"entirely unjustified\".118 Uruguay observed that it was based on the assumption that the Tribunal would not be able to rule on the Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures before 1 December 2016, when Mr. Herb\u00f3n had been summoned to appear. In addition, Respondent contended, the request also failed for the same reasons adduced with respect to the Application for Provisional Measures.119\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 63.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 61-63.\n\n104.\n\nUruguay distinguished the cases on which temporary orders have been issued, observing that in those cases the orders were issued to prevent the State from committing alleged treaty violations, including unlawful expropriation, during the pendency of the arbitration.120 By contrast, in this case the only \"imminent\" event was the appearance of Mr. Herb\u00f3n before the Criminal Court on 1 December 2016.121\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 64.\n\nResp. Res. Prov. Meas., \u00b6 65. As already noted, on 13 December 2016, Respondent informed the Tribunal that Mr. Herb\u00f3n had not appeared in court on 1 December. Resp. Letter (13 December 2016) at 1.\n\n105.\n\nIn its 21 November 2016 submission, Respondent went on to argue that there was no need for the temporary order as Mr. Herb\u00f3n could remain outside of Uruguay until the Tribunal ruled on the Application for Provisional Measures, if he did not wish to testify on 1 December 2016.122\n\nResp. Res. Prov. Meas., \u00b6 66.\n\n106.\n\nFinally, Uruguay took the view that the Claimant\u2019s Application and the Respondent\u2019s Response provided enough elements for the Tribunal to rule on Claimant\u2019s Application before 1 December 2016 (even without a second round of pleadings). It noted, however, that even if this were not possible, the alternatives of Mr. Herb\u00f3n (a) appearing to testify or (b) remaining outside of Uruguay until the Tribunal ruled on Claimant\u2019s Application were \"far less onerous than the extreme measure of ordering Uruguay to refrain from exercising its sovereign rights.\"123\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 67.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nIn order to arrive at this decision, the Tribunal reviewed and considered all the arguments of the Parties and the documents submitted by them in this phase of the proceeding. The fact that the Tribunal does not specifically mention a given argument or reasoning does not mean that it has not considered it. In their submissions, the Parties produced and cited numerous awards and decisions dealing with matters that they consider relevant to these provisional measures. The Tribunal has considered these documents carefully and may take into account the reasoning and findings of these and other tribunals. However, in coming to a decision on the matter of provisional measures and temporary relief requested by Italba, the Tribunal must perform, and in fact has performed, an independent analysis of the ICSID Convention, the Arbitration Rules, and the particular facts of this case.\n\n**A. Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n108.\n\nFor the decision on provisional measures, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules particularly are applicable.\n\n109.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides the following:\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules reads as follows:\n\n\"(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.\n\n(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests.\"\n\n110.\n\nPursuant to Rule 39 (1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the application for provisional measures must include three matters: the rights to be preserved; the measures requested and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n**B. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n111.\n\nBefore it can recommend provisional measures, the Tribunal must be satisfied that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction over the parties and the dispute submitted to it.\n\n112.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent in its Counter-Memorial has raised a jurisdictional objection in relation to the standing of the Claimant to advance a claim in respect of Uruguay\u2019s actions towards the Uruguayan company, Trigosul S.A., which are alleged to be in violation of the BIT.124 According to the Respondent, the Claimant has not furnished evidence that it owns Trigosul S.A. and hence cannot prove, even on a *prima facie* basis, that it has an investment in Uruguay for the purposes of the BIT.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 70-74.; Resp. Letter (28 November 2016) at 2 and 3.\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent has not requested that its aforementioned jurisdictional objection be dealt with in a preliminary phase of this arbitration in accordance with Article 41 of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent has instead agreed that its jurisdictional objection should be determined at the same time as its defences on the merits, in a final award.\n\n114.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has accepted that the Tribunal is vested with the necessary adjudicative powers to conduct this arbitration. Those powers include the power to recommend provisional measures where appropriate, in accordance with Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal in no way prejudges the merits of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection, which will be determined by the Tribunal in accordance with the procedure agreed to by the parties.\n\n**C. Merits**\n-------------\n\n**(1) Italba\u2019s request for Uruguay to end or suspend the investigation**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Uruguay has the sovereign right and duty to investigate alleged criminal actions that have taken place in its territory, in accordance with the rules and procedures established under the laws of Uruguay. That right is recognised and protected by international law. As stated by the Tribunal in *Churchill v. Indonesia.*\n\n\"At the outset, the Tribunal stresses that the right, even the duty, to conduct criminal investigations and prosecutions is a prerogative of any sovereign State.\"125\n\n*Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd. v. the Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14, Procedural Order No. 14 (22 December 2014), \u00b6 72.\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have the power to order or recommend the cessation of a criminal investigation that is being conducted by the relevant organs of Uruguay in relation to an alleged criminal action on its territory. In the words of the Tribunal in *SGS v. Pakistan'.* \"[w]e cannot enjoin a State from conducting the ordinary processes of criminal, administrative and civil justice within its own territory.\"126 This conclusion was confirmed by the Tribunal in *Hamester v. Ghana* (\"A state may obviously exercise its sovereign powers to investigate and prosecute criminal actions.\"127) and in *Teinver v. Argentina* (\"[a]s has been held by a number of arbitral tribunals, Respondent clearly has the sovereign right to conduct criminal investigations and it will usually require exceptional circumstances to justify the granting of provisional measures to suspend criminal proceedings by a State.\")128 Besides the above, there is no evidence on the record to support Claimant\u2019s contention that the criminal investigation in the present case has been brought in bad faith by the Uruguan authorities.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S..I. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Procedural Order No. 2 (16 October 2002), \u00b6 36.\n\n*Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KGv. Republic of Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award (18 June 2010), \u00b6 297.\n\n*Teinver S.A. et al v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Provisional Measures (8 April 2016), \u00b6 190.\n\n117.\n\nClaimant maintains that the investigation will: \"(a) thwart Italba\u2019s ability to proceed with this arbitration by incarcerating its principals and chilling assistance from relevant witnesses; (b) aggravate the *status quo,* and (c) usurp the functions of this Tribunal.\"129 On the basis of its present understanding of the matter based upon the totality of the submissions that it has received, the Tribunal is not persuaded that there is, as yet, substantive and compelling evidence of a serious risk that Claimant\u2019s rights will suffer irreparable harm as a result of the Investigation or that the integrity of these arbitration proceedings will be compromised.\n\nCl. App. Prov. Meas., \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 5.\n\n118.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal is satisfied that its functions will not be usurped by the Investigation. Respondent has accepted, as it must, that the Tribunal is in no way bound by any finding ultimately made by the Uruguayan courts in relation to the authenticity or otherwise of the documents in question.130 The Tribunal does not consider that the Investigation will \"aggravate the *status quo\"* in any relevant sense. As noted above, Uruguay has the right to investigate alleged criminal conduct in its territory. There can be no legitimate expectation on the part of Claimant that the prosecution of an ICSID arbitration against Uruguay confers a blanket immunity upon its principals and witnesses from a criminal investigation in Uruguay.\n\nResp. Res. Prov. Meas., \u00b6 24.\n\n119.\n\nIn relation to Claimant\u2019s ability to present and prove its case in this arbitration, Respondent has given the following undertakings:\n\na) Uruguay\u2019s \"investigation of the apparently forged signatures and fraudulent documents... will not prevent either Dr. Alberelli or Mr. Herb\u00f3n from participating in the preparation or presentation of the remainder of Claimant\u2019s case.\";\n\nb) \"Uruguay will honor its commitment to respect Claimant\u2019s rights in this arbitration, including its rights to gather evidence in Uruguay to present to this Tribunal...\"; and\n\nc) Uruguay will not take any action that will impede the witnesses, Mr. Herb\u00f3n and Dr. Alberelli, from attending the scheduled hearings and freely offering their testimony\".\n\n120.\n\nClaimant\u2019s application is based on the anticipated consequences of the investigation. It has filed no evidence that Dr. Alberelli\u2019s and Mr. Herb\u00f3n\u2019s participation in this proceeding has been affected by such the investigation to date. Under the present circumstances, the Tribunal must accept that Uruguay\u2019s commitment to respect Claimant\u2019s rights in this arbitration has been made in good faith and will be adhered to.\n\n121.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal rejects Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures to end or to suspend the Investigation.\n\n**(2) Temporary Relief**\n------------------------\n\n122.\n\nIt will be recalled that Mr. Herb\u00f3n was summoned to appear on 1 December 2016 before the Criminal Court conducting the investigation. Claimant maintained that: \"By the time of that hearing or shortly thereafter, he will be subject to indictment, arrest and pre-trial detention...\"131\n\nCl. App. Prov. Meas., \u00b6 43.\n\n123.\n\nTo avoid that possibility, on 10 November 2016, Claimant requested the Tribunal to \"issue temporary relief with inmediate effect, ordering Uruguay to suspend the Criminal prosecution of Dr. Alberelli and Mr. Herb\u00f3n until such time as this Tribunal has rendered its decision regarding the provisional measures requested by Italba.\"132\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 44.\n\n124.\n\nIt was Respondent\u2019s position that: \"if Mr. Herb\u00f3n does not wish to testify on 1 December, he can remain outside Uruguay temporarily until the Tribunal rules on the Application for Provisional Measures. That need not be much beyond 1 December.\"133\n\nResp. Res. Prov. Meas., \u00b6 66.\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal has now been fully briefed on the Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures and has decided to reject this Application. Accordingly, the Tribunal need not decide on the Claimant\u2019s request for temporary relief.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n126.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously decides the following:\n\n1) The Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief filed by Italba Corporation is rejected.\n\n2) The Parties are reminded of their duty to act in good faith during this proceeding and to refrain from taking any action that could affect the integrity of the arbitration.\n\n3) To reserve to the final award or decision the matter of the costs of the procedure related to Claimant\u2019s Application."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2019-03-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **T****ABLE OF** **S****ELECTED** **A****BBREVIATIONS****/D****EFINED** **T****ERMS** | |\n| ANTEL | National Telecommunications Administration (*Administraci\u00f3n Nacional de Telecomunicaciones*) |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| c- [#] | Claimant's Exhibit |\n| Claimant's Memorial | Claimant's Memorial on the Merits dated 16 September 2016 |\n| Claimant's Post Hearing Brief | Claimant's Post Hearing Brief dated 16 March 2018 |\n| Claimant's Reply | Claimant's Reply on the Merits and CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction dated 12 May 2017 |\n| CL- [#] | Claimant's Legal Authority |\n| DNC | National Communications Authority (*Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Comunicaciones*) |\n| Firm | Ram\u00edrez, Xavier de Mello & Abal Firm |\n| GIE | Economic Interest Group |\n| Hearing | Hearing on jurisdiction, merits and quantum held from November 13, 2017 to November 20, 2017 |\n| IBA Rules | IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| Judgment | Judgment 579/2014 of 23 October 2014 rendered by the \"Tribunal de lo Contencioso Administrativo\" |\n| MDN | Uruguay Ministry of National Defense (*Ministerio de Defensa Nacional de Uruguay*) |\n| MIEM | Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining (*Ministerio de Industria, Energ\u00eda y Miner\u00eda*) |\n| Request | Request for Arbitration dated 16 February 2016. |\n| R- [#] | Respondent's Exhibit |\n| Respondent's Counter-Memorial | Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 30 January 2017 |\n| Respondent's Post Hearing Brief | Respondent's Post Hearing Brief dated 16 March 2018 |\n| Respondent's Rejoinder | Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction dated 11 August 2017 |\n| RL- [#] | Respondent's Legal Authority |\n| Tr.

(\"**Trigosul**\"), and which allegedly breached provisions of the Treaty.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration and Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 16 February 2016, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration of that same date from Italba against Uruguay (the \"**Request**\"). The Request was supplemented by the Claimant's letters dated 10 and 20 March 2016.\n\n7.\n\nOn 24 March 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible, in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nIn accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, and pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, the Tribunal was to be constituted by three arbitrators to be appointed as follows: one by each Party and the third, the presiding arbitrator, by agreement of the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal was composed of Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno, a national of Costa Rica, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. John Beechey, a national of the United Kingdom, appointed by the Claimant; and Professor Zachary Douglas, a national of Australia, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n10.\n\nOn 27 May 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), notified the Parties that the three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was deemed constituted on that date. Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**B. The First Session**\n------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 26 July 2016, by teleconference.\n\n12.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 29 July 2016, the President of the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provided, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006; that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish; and that the place of the proceeding would be Washington, DC. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out a schedule for the proceeding. Ms. Maria Jose Rojas was appointed as assistant to the President of the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nOn 28 July 2016, the Tribunal and the Parties were informed that the Secretary of the Tribunal would be taking temporary leave, and that Ms. Luisa Fernanda Torres would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal during her absence.\n\n**C. The Parties Written Submissions and Procedural Applications**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on 16 September 2016, the Claimant filed a Memorial on the Merits, together with witness statements by Dr. Gustavo Alberelli1 and Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n;2 an expert report by Mr. Santiago Dellepiane Avellaneda of Compass Lexecon; Exhibits C-001 to C-136 and Legal Authorities CL-001 to CL-085.\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Financial Officer of Italba.\n\nCurrent Legal Representative and previous Director of Trigosul.\n\n15.\n\nOn 14 October 2016, the Respondent advised that it did not intend to request the bifurcation of the proceeding, and that it would file its objections to jurisdiction with its Counter-Memorial.\n\n16.\n\nOn 31 October 2016, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that, one of its witnesses, Mr. Herb\u00f3n, had received a notice to appear before a criminal court in Montevideo, Uruguay, in connection with an investigation associated with his and Dr. Alberelli's testimony in this arbitration (the \"**Investigation**\").\n\n17.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, the Respondent replied to the Claimant's communication of 31 October 2016.\n\n18.\n\nOn 10 November 2016, the Claimant filed an Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Claimant's Application sought, *inter alia*, to enjoin the criminal prosecution in Uruguay of Dr. Alberelli and Mr. Herb\u00f3n pending the resolution of this arbitration. In addition, the Claimant requested temporary relief to preserve the *status quo* while the Claimant's Application was pending, noting that Mr. Herb\u00f3n was scheduled to appear for a hearing before the Uruguayan Criminal Court on 1 December 2016.\n\n19.\n\nOn 14 November 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide its observations on the Claimant's Application by 17 November 2016.\n\n20.\n\nOn that same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, amending certain requirements of Procedural Order No. 1 relating to the submission of hard copies of pleadings and accompanying documents.\n\n21.\n\nOn 15 November 2016, the Respondent applied to the Tribunal for an extension of time until 21 November 2016 to provide its observations on the Claimant's Application.\n\n22.\n\nOn 16 November 2016, the Tribunal granted the extension requested by the Respondent.\n\n23.\n\nOn that same day, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal advising that, while it did not oppose the extension granted to the Respondent, it relied on that extension in order to renew its request for temporary relief.\n\n24.\n\nOn 17 November 2016, the Respondent replied to the Claimant's communication of 16 November 2016. It requested the Tribunal to decline the Claimant's request for temporary relief, arguing that there was no urgency, as the next event in the Investigation was not scheduled until 1 December 2016.\n\n25.\n\nOn 21 November 2016, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Claimant's Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief in which, *inter alia*, it stated that Uruguay was prepared to guarantee that the Investigation would not prevent either Dr. Alberelli or Mr. Herb\u00f3n from participating in the preparation or presentation of the remainder of the Claimant's case (the \"**Guarantee**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 24 November 2016, the Claimant submitted its Reply in Further Support of Its Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief.\n\n27.\n\nOn 25 November 2016, the President of the Tribunal invited the Respondent to confirm the Guarantee. On 28 November 2016, the Respondent confirmed the Guarantee.\n\n28.\n\nOn 30 November 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties inviting the Claimant to confirm whether the Guarantee was sufficient to protect its ability to present witness evidence from Mr. Herb\u00f3n and Dr. Alberelli in these proceedings.\n\n29.\n\nOn 5 December 2016, the Claimant filed observations in response to the Tribunal's communication of 30 November 2016.\n\n30.\n\nOn 6 December 2016, the Respondent filed a communication addressing certain allegations in the Claimant's communication of 5 December 2016. On that same day, the Claimant sent a further communication in response.\n\n31.\n\nOn 9 December 2016, the President of the Tribunal, on behalf of the Tribunal, invited the Parties to provide an update on whether \"Mr. Herb\u00f3n had, in fact, appeared before the Uruguayan Criminal Court [on 1 December 2016] and, if so, what were the circumstances of his appearance.\"\n\n32.\n\nOn 13 December 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that \"Mr. Herb\u00f3n did not appear in court on 1 December 2016, as required by his summons\", adding that \"[n]o reason for his failure to appear was given to the Court or the Prosecutor by Mr. Herb\u00f3n or his counsel.\" Uruguay added, however, that \"the guarantee that Uruguay has given \u2014 in its Response to the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (filed on 21 November 2016) and its correspondence with the Tribunal of 28 November 2016 \u2014 remains in place.\"\n\n33.\n\nAlso on 13 December 2016, the Claimant reported that Mr. Herb\u00f3n's counsel had been able to reschedule his court appearance for a date in February 2017, but that \"Mr. Herb\u00f3n and Dr. Alberelli remain unable to return to Uruguay to gather evidence and conduct business without the threat of pretrial incarceration.\" The Claimant reiterated its request for provisional measures.\n\n34.\n\nOn 5 January 2017, the Tribunal and the Parties were informed that Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero was reassuming her functions as Secretary of the Tribunal in this proceeding.\n\n35.\n\nOn 30 January 2017, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1 as modified by Procedural Order No. 2, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with witness statements by Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Cendoya, Ms. Elena Grauert, Ms. Alicia Fern\u00e1ndez, Mr. Fernando Garc\u00eda Piriz, Mr. Fernando P\u00e9rez Tab\u00f3, Mr. Gabriel Lombide, Mr. Juan Piaggio, and Mr. Le\u00f3n Lev; expert reports by Prof. Santiago Pereira Campos and by Daniel Flores and Ettore Comi of Econ One Research; Exhibits R-008 to R-080 and Legal Authorities RL-024 to RL-119.\n\n36.\n\nOn 9 February 2017, the Claimant filed a further communication informing the Tribunal that Mr. Herb\u00f3n's hearing before the Uruguayan Criminal Court was now scheduled for 15 February 2017 and reiterating its request for provisional measures. On 14 February 2017, the Respondent filed observations in response to this communication, confirming again the Guarantee.\n\n37.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision denying the Claimant's Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief. In doing so, the Tribunal concluded that the Claimant's Application was based on the anticipated consequences of the Investigation, and that the Claimant had failed to file evidence that Dr. Alberelli's and Mr. Herb\u00f3n's participation in this proceeding had been affected to date by their involvement in the Investigation. Furthermore, the Tribunal accepted that Uruguay's commitment to respect the Claimant's rights in this arbitration had been made in good faith and would be adhered to.\n\n38.\n\nOn 14 February 2017, the Parties filed their requests for production of documents. On 15 March 2017, each Party filed observations on the other Party's requests. On 23 March 2017, the Claimant filed a reply to its request for production of documents. On 29 March 2017, the Respondent filed a reply to its request for production of documents. On 4 April 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning its decision on the Claimant's requests for production of documents.\n\n39.\n\nOn 25 April 2017, the Claimant requested an eleven-day extension to the deadline to submit its Reply Memorial originally due on 1 May 2017 and to shift the deadline for the Respondent's Rejoinder from 31 July 2017 to 11 August 2017. On 26 April 2017, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the extension. On the same date, the Respondent agreed to the extension. On 28 April 2017, the Tribunal granted the extension.\n\n40.\n\nOn 13 May 2017, the Claimant filed a Reply Memorial, together with witness statements by Ms. Beatriz Alberelli, Mr. Alejandro Amaro, Mr. Alan Cherp, Mr. Christopher G. Hall, and Mr. Johnathan Alexander Van Arem; Second Witness Statements of Mr. Alejandro Amaro, Dr. Gustavo Alberelli and Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n; an expert report by Mr. John Hargett, Mr. Luis Lapique, Mr. Luis Valle, and a second expert Report by Mr. Santiago Dellepiane Avellaneda of Compass Lexecon; Exhibits C-154 to C-275 and Legal Authorities CL-102 to CL-155.\n\n41.\n\nOn 31 May 2017, the United States of America, the non-disputing Party pursuant to the terms of the Treaty (the \"**Non-Disputing Party**\"), notified the Tribunal that it would decide whether to file a Non-Disputing Party submission once it had received and reviewed the Respondent's Rejoinder due on 11 August 2017.\n\n42.\n\nAfter further submissions from the Parties, on 31 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning its decision on the Respondent's requests for production of documents and setting up a framework for the protection of certain confidential documents to be produced by the Claimant pursuant to that Order.\n\n43.\n\nOn 5 June 2017, the Tribunal proposed a calendar to the Parties for the scenario in which the Non-Disputing Party decided to file a submission in this proceeding. On 13 June 2017, the Parties confirmed that they had no objection to the Tribunal's proposed calendar. On 22 June 2017, the Tribunal invited the Non-Disputing Party to file a submission, if any, by 12 September 2017.\n\n44.\n\nOn 5 July 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed on a Hearing of eight days.\n\n45.\n\nOn 6 July 2017, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that Ms. Maria Jose Rojas would no longer be serving as Assistant to the President of the Tribunal in this case.\n\n46.\n\nOn 11 August 2017, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder Memorial, together with second witness statements of Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Cendoya; Ms. Alicia Fern\u00e1ndez; Mr. Fernando Garc\u00eda Piriz; second expert reports of Prof. Santiago Pereira Campos; Dr. Daniel Flores and Mr. Ettore Comi of Econ One Research, Inc.; expert reports of Mr. Louis T.M. Conti, Esq.; Mr. N\u00e9stor Alejandro Paz Portela; Dr. Eugenio Xavier de Mello Ferrand of Ram\u00edrez, Xavier de Mello & Abal Abogados; Exhibits R-081 to R-125 and Legal Authorities RL-120 to RL-155.\n\n47.\n\nOn 22 August 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to reach an agreement on certain organizational and logistical details of the Hearing by 29 August 2017. On 24 August 2017, the Parties requested an extension. On 25 August 2017, the Tribunal granted the extension requested by the Parties. On 8 September 2017, the Parties submitted a joint statement on the organization of the Hearing.\n\n48.\n\nOn 11 September 2017, the Non-Disputing Party filed a submission (the \"**Non-Disputing Party Submission**\"). On 25 September 2017, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Non-Disputing Party Submission. On 27 September 2017, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had no comments on the Non-Disputing Party Submission.\n\n49.\n\nOn 11 September 2017, the Respondent submitted a list of the Claimant's witnesses and experts whom it wished to cross-examine during the Hearing. On 12 September 2017, the Claimant submitted a list of the Respondent's witnesses and experts whom it wished to cross-examine during the Hearing. On 15 September 2017, the Respondent proposed that it be allowed to produce six (6) of its witnesses for examination by the Claimant via videoconference or, in the alternative, that the Claimant be required to pay in advance for their transport, food and lodging. On 27 September 2017, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's proposal.\n\n50.\n\nOn 12 September 2017, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to submit certain missing pages from the Claimant's Exhibit C-116. On 19 September 2017, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to the Respondent's request. On 20 September 2017, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to introduce the missing pages from the Claimant's Exhibit C-116 into the record.\n\n51.\n\nBy that same letter, the Tribunal requested the Parties' permission to allow Mr. Joao Valerio, Mr. Beechey's colleague and administrative secretary, to attend the Hearing. On 20 September 2017, the Respondent confirmed that they had no objection to Mr. Valerio attending the Hearing. On 21 September 2017, the Claimant confirmed that they had no objection to Mr. Valerio attending the Hearing.\n\n52.\n\nOn 26 September 2017, and pursuant to the Tribunal's invitation of 20 September 2017, the Respondent introduced the missing pages from the Claimant's Exhibit C-116 into the record as Exhibit R-126.\n\n53.\n\nOn 27 September 2017, and pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4, Mr. Valerio submitted a signed declaration of confidentiality.\n\n54.\n\nOn 5 October 2017, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it no longer intended to call Uruguay's technical expert, Dr. Alejandro Paz, for cross-examination during the Hearing.\n\n55.\n\nOn that same date, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent's proposal of 15 September 2017 that it be allowed to produce six (6) of its witnesses for examination by the Claimant during the Hearing via video-conference or, in the alternative, that the Claimant be required to pay in advance for their transport, food and lodging. In doing so, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to carefully consider the need to cross-examine all of the Respondent's witnesses, and to confirm the list of witnesses for cross-examination by 11 October 2017. On that date, the Claimant provided the Tribunal with a revised list of witnesses and experts for cross-examination during the Hearing.\n\n56.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, the Claimant notified the Tribunal that it had terminated its engagement with Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP as its counsel in this proceeding and that it had retained the law firm of Alston & Bird LLP.\n\n57.\n\nOn 25 October 2017, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to introduce a new legal authority into the record. On that same date, the Claimant indicated that it had no objection to the Respondent's request. On 27 October 2017, in view of the Parties' agreement, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to introduce this new legal authority into the record as RL-159.\n\n58.\n\nOn 26 October 2017, the Claimant requested a postponement of the Hearing on the basis of the sudden deterioration of Dr. Alberelli's health, which would \"preclude [him] from participat[ing] in the hearing at this time, while also making it impossible for Italba to prepare effectively for the hearing,\" and suggested that the Tribunal advise the Parties as to possible alternative Hearing dates. On 31 October 2017, Uruguay opposed the Claimant's request arguing, *inter alia*, that a postponement of the Hearing at so late a stage in the proceedings would cause serious prejudice to the Respondent. It informed the Tribunal that, in view of the circumstances, it was willing to \"sacrifice its right to crossexamine Dr. Alberelli.\" On that same date, the Claimant reiterated its request for a postponement of the Hearing. On 2 November 2017, the Respondent reiterated its willingness to forego cross-examination of Dr. Alberelli to avoid a postponement of the Hearing.\n\n59.\n\nOn 3 November 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Tribunal did not wish to question Dr. Alberelli during the Hearing and that, after due consideration, it had decided to deny the Claimant's request for a postponement of the Hearing. On that same date, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to reconsider its decision to deny a postponement of the Hearing. After due consideration, the Tribunal confirmed its decision to deny the Claimant's request. In doing so, the Tribunal reiterated that Italba had failed to provide reasons to justify its claim that Dr. Alberelli's health concerns and the absence in the hearing room of an officer or shareholder of Italba during the Hearing would preclude counsel for the Claimant from being able to present its case during the Hearing.\n\n60.\n\nOn 5 November 2017, the Tribunal proposed, *inter alia*, the adoption of a Protocol for Protection of Confidential Information, aimed at ensuring both the maximum transparency of the Hearing under the transparency regime established by Article 29.2 of the Treaty and the protection of confidential information pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4. On 7 and 8 November 2017, respectively, the Respondent and the Claimant confirmed their agreement with the Tribunal's proposal.\n\n61.\n\nAlso on 7 November 2017, the Non-Disputing Party informed the Tribunal of its intention to attend the Hearing, in accordance with Article 29 of the Treaty. In doing so, the NonDisputing Party made a proposal to the Parties in connection with the procedure envisaged by Procedural Order No. 4 for the protection of confidential information from disclosure during the Hearing. On that same date, the Parties indicated that they had no objection to the proposal made by the Non-Disputing Party.\n\n62.\n\nOn 9 November 2017, the Tribunal informed the Non-Disputing Party that the Tribunal and the Parties welcomed its attendance at the Hearing. Furthermore, the Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 4 and the Protocol for Protection of Confidential Information, the Non-Disputing Party would be invited to leave the hearing room temporarily whenever confidential information was to be brought to the Tribunal's attention at the Hearing. On the same day, the Non-Disputing Party acknowledged receipt of the Tribunal's communication and provided a list of its attendees to the Hearing.\n\n63.\n\nOn that same date, the Claimant sought leave to introduce into the record eight new factual exhibits, and three new legal authorities.\n\n64.\n\nOn 10 November 2017, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's request, with the exception of the three documents that post-dated the Claimant's written pleadings. On that same date, the Claimant reiterated its request of 9 November 2017.\n\n65.\n\nOn 11 November 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would be addressing the Claimant's request of 9 November 2017 at the beginning of the Hearing on 13 November 2017 and issuing a decision thereafter.\n\n**D.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n75.\n\nItalba was incorporated on 10 May 1982, under the laws of the State of Florida, United States of America.4 It was founded by Dr. Gustavo Alberelli (Italian citizen, permanent resident of the United States of America since 1 August 1977),5 owner of 50 shares and Ms. Beatriz Alberelli, (who was born in Cuba and who has held American citizenship since 1967),6 owner of the remaining 50 shares.7\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 12; Italba Articles of Incorporation, C-002.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 12.\n\nStatement of Ms. Beatriz Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 1.\n\nItalba Articles of Incorporation, Article III, C-002.\n\n76.\n\nOn 19 December 1994, Mr. Daniel \u00c1ngel P\u00e9rez Blanco and Ms. Marisa Cristina Gonz\u00e1lez Silvestri established the company named Mareland Sociedad An\u00f3nima in Uruguay. On 29 December 1994, that corporation changed its name and became Trigosul Sociedad An\u00f3nima. On 3 February 1995, the General Tax Authority's Taxpayers Registry of Uruguay approved the Bylaws of that corporation, which are registered in the Public and General Registry of Commerce with number 763 on page 838 of Book 2 of Bylaws, File 11508/95.8\n\nNotarial Certificate issued by the Civil Law Notary Public Bruno Santin Cagnoli on 9 August 1999, C-226; Trigosul Bylaws, C-226.\n\n77.\n\nArticle 3 of Trigosul's Bylaws reads as follows:\n\n*\"The capital consisting of one or more registered common shares with a par value of $U1.00 (one Uruguayan peso) each shall be $U 182,500.00 (one hundred eighty-two thousand five hundred Uruguayan pesos). The stock certificates shall contain the formalities established by Article 300 of Law No. 16,060. The Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting may approve an increase up to the sum of $U 912,500.00 (nine hundred twelve thousand five hundred Uruguayan pesos) on one or more occasions, without the need for an amendment or administrative consent. The Meeting may delegate the time of the issue and the payment method, terms and conditions to the Board of Directors or the Administrator, as the case may be. Share transfers shall be notified to the company and documented as provided in Law No. 16,060.\"*9\n\nTrigosul Bylaws, Article 3, C-226.\n\n78.\n\nOn 6 September 1996, six share certificates of Trigosul were issued. Each one represented 9,125 shares, with a nominal value of one Uruguayan peso each. Three of the certificates were issued in the name of Ms. Carmela Caravetta Durante (Dr. Alberelli's mother), and the other three in the name of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli Caravetta.10\n\nTrigosul's Share Certificates, C-161.\n\n79.\n\nDr. Alberelli represented the following with respect to the dates of the certificates and to the acquisition of Trigosul:\n\n*\"Certain of Trigosul's corporate records indicate that the company was acquired in 1996, not 1999. Trigosul's Share Certificates (C161), at 1-12; Trigosul's Book of Shareholders and Directors Meetings (C-164), at 3-4. The reason for this disparity is that the original owners of Trigosul required, as a condition of the sale of the company, that the corporate records show that the acquisition took place in 1996, and I agreed to that condition.\"*11\n\nStatement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, footnote number 6.\n\n80.\n\nIn addition to the six certificates mentioned in paragraph 78 above, on 30 June 1999, fourteen share certificates of Trigosul were issued; each one representing 9,125 shares, with a nominal value of one Uruguayan peso each, in the name of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli Caravetta,12 to complete the aggregate amount of 182,500 Uruguayan pesos that constituted Trigosul's \"authorized capital\".\n\nTrigosul's Share Certificates, C-161.\n\n81.\n\nOn 17 January 1997, through Resolution 75-219 of the Ministry of National Defense (hereinafter \"**MDN\"**, its Spanish acronym), Dr. Alberelli was \"granted authorization for the provision, on a commercial basis, of dedicated wireless digital lines, without connection to the public telephone system, for the transmission of data between fixed points.\"13\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 16; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 138; Resolution 75-219 of 17 January 1997, from the Ministry of National Defense, C-003 and R-011.\n\n82.\n\nOn 4 August 1997, the National Communications Authority, (hereinafter \"**DNC**\", its Spanish acronym) through Resolution 227-97, allocated Dr. Alberelli, \"the terrestrial fixed service radio channels\", on an \"exclusive, national and secondary basis,\" of the frequencies 1865 to 1870 MHz.

Around 1999, Italba acquired Trigosul as a subsidiary enterprise. Through Trigosul, Italba purchased equipment, hired personnel, obtained a telecommunications license, and began commercial operation in Uruguay in June 2003. Throughout the period of its development and operation of Trigosul, Italba was exposed to market risks in the telecommunications industry. Therefore, Italba's activities in Uruguay qualify as \u2018investments.'\"*61\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 94.\n\n123.\n\nItalba claimed a breach of Article 5 of the Treaty whereby Uruguay had an obligation to accord investors fair and equitable treatment.

EXPERT REPORT OF PROFESSOR DE MELLO**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n130.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Claimant questioned the independence of one of the experts for the Respondent, Professor Eugenio Xavier de Mello Ferrand, a member of the law firm Ram\u00edrez, Xavier de Mello & Abal (the \"**Firm**\"). The Claimant pointed out that members of the Firm are currently representing the Republic of Uruguay in another arbitration proceeding. In its communications of 21 November and 1 December 2017, the Claimant reiterated its objections and questioned the expert's independence.73\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 17 November 2017 (Day 5), 1179-1205; Italba's Letters dated 21 November 2017 and 1 December 2017.\n\n131.\n\nIn the course of the Hearing, Professor de Mello answered the questions posed by the Claimant's counsel, confirmed that he is a member of the Firm, and indicated that he had recently learned that attorneys at the Firm were representing Uruguay in another case. He explained that the Firm is based on a model called an \"economic interest group,\" (hereinafter \"**GIE**\", its Spanish acronym) a French concept, where there is a central services unit, but the relationship between the attorneys and their clients is individual, as each attorney works independently and autonomously from the others.74\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 17 November 2017 (Day 5), 1179: 20-1180: 11; 1181: 17-1182: 3; 1183: 12-1184: 4.\n\n132.\n\nProfessor de Mello stated:\n\n*\"Now, I'd like to add that the economic interest group is a contract which is entered in the national commercial registry. This economic interest group that I'm part of is entered in the national commercial registry, and the text expressly states that each attorney works separately and that we are not partners. We have no joint and several responsibility. We are not responsible or liable for what the other lawyers do. Therefore, I don't think that I need to be involved in any conflict of interest because of any action that my colleagues in the economic interest group may be involved in.\"*75\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 17 November 2017 (Day 5), 1184: 12-1185: 1.\n\n133.\n\nProfessor de Mello reported at the hearing that he had not consulted the other attorneys at the Firm about potential conflicts of interest when Uruguay retained him to issue the report in question, because the said attorneys enjoy autonomy in their professional work, and such GIE is regulated by the Uruguayan Commercial Companies Act (Articles 469 *et seq*).76\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 17 November 2017 (Day 5), 1185: 12-22.\n\n134.\n\nAt the Hearing, counsel for Italba questioned Professor de Mello's independence by stating that he was a \"partner\" of some attorneys at the Firm who are currently representing Uruguay in another case.77\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 17 November 2017 (Day 5), 1195: 7-11.\n\n135.\n\nOn 21 November 2017, Italba questioned Professor de Mello's independence once again, on the basis of Article 5(2) (a) of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (the \"**IBA Rules**\"). Italba pointed out that Professor de Mello had breached the provisions of such Article by failing to disclose in his report that the Firm was representing Uruguay in another proceeding. Italba questioned Professor de Mello's alleged lack of awareness of the mandate of his \"partners\", it being public and common knowledge that \"[m]ore importantly economic relationships similar to the one described by Prof. Xavier de Mello have been held to be insufficient to overcome the conflict created when one member of a law firm or law firm-like entity acts for a client and another member of the same firm proclaims independence from that client. On this point, the tribunal's decision in *Hrvatska v. Republic of Slovenia*78 (\"*Hrvatska*\") is instructive.\"79 For these reasons, by its letter of 21 November 2017, Italba invited the Tribunal to disregard Professor de Mello's report.\n\n*Hrvatska Elecktroprivreda, d.d. v. Republic of Slovenia*. Tribunal's Ruling regarding the participation of David Mildon QC in further stages of the proceedings, 6 May 2008, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/24, CL-159 (\"Hrvatska \").\n\nItalba's Letter, 21 November 2017, page 2.\n\n136.\n\nOn 30 November 2017, Uruguay stated that Article 490 of the Commercial Companies Act (Law No. 16,060) (the \"**Commercial Companies Act**\"), enacted on 4 September 1989, draws a distinction between a GIE and a traditional law firm. According to the Respondent, the members of a GIE are independent from each other; it is a group of people who share facilities and administrative services for convenience. Each member has her/his own clients and receives her/his own fees.80\n\nUruguay's Letter, 30 November 2017, page 2.\n\n137.\n\nRegarding the IBA Rules and experts' independence, Uruguay cited to the \"Commentary on the revised text of the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration\" as follows: \". the rules' references to the independence of party-appointed experts is understood \u2018in the sense that he or she has no financial interest in the outcome or otherwise has relationships that would prevent the expert from providing his or her honest and frank opinion.'\"81\n\nUruguay's Letter, 30 November 2017, page 2; IBA. Commentary on the revised text of the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (2010), p. 19.\n\n138.\n\nIn connection with the reference to \"partners\" on the Firm's website, Uruguay indicated that, in the instant case, such term does not have the same meaning as that attributed to \"partners\" in the context of the members of an American law firm. Uruguay pointed out that another member of the Firm was one of the main experts in another case against Uruguay. It also stated that the *Hrvatska* case cited by Italba does not apply to this case, as it concerned a member of the arbitral tribunal itself rather than an expert.82\n\nUruguay's Letter, 30 November 2017, pages 3 and 4.\n\n139.\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Italba repeated its request that the Tribunal decline to consider the evidence of Professor de Mello. It pointed out that the Firm's agreement to serve as counsel for Uruguay in a separate arbitration was in force when Professor de Mello issued his report in this arbitration proceeding and was still effective at the time of his testimony. It indicated that these facts disqualify Professor de Mello as an independent expert in accordance with Article 5 (2) (c) of the IBA Rules.\n\n140.\n\nItalba pointed out that on its website, the Firm describes itself as \"... (a) a single law firm that (b) shares associates, (c) describes its clients as jointly held, and (d) seeks to share the prestige of each individual member for the benefit of the group and each of its members.\"83 According to the Claimant, such website refers to the Firm's \"partners\" and to the provision of a comprehensive professional service; it also stated that the members of the Firm share a team of associates and offer full legal assistance.84\n\nItalba's Letter, 1 December 2017, page 2.\n\nId.\n\n141.\n\nFor Italba, the Firm owes loyalty to Uruguay, and, when referring to the case in which a member of the Firm acted as an expert against Uruguay in another arbitration proceeding, the Respondent forgets that such proceeding, and, thus, the potential conflict for this case, have concluded. In Italba's opinion, *Hrvatska* is relevant in its analysis of the failure of the persons challenged to disclose their professional relationships.\n\n142.\n\nItalba considered that \"....Mello's undisclosed relationship disqualifies him as an independent expert in this case.\"85\n\nItalba's Letter, 1 December 2017, page 3.\n\n143.\n\nOn 8 December 2017, Uruguay stated that Italba had taken no account of the fact that Professor de Mello obtained no economic benefit from the professional work of the other members of the Firm representing Uruguay or the colleague who issued a report in another case against Uruguay.86\n\nUruguay's Letter, 8 December 2017, page 2.\n\n144.\n\nUruguay considered that the fact that the Firm's website uses the word \"partners\" is irrelevant, as the GIE structure in Uruguay means an entity the members of which are both professionally and financially independent. The reference to \"their clients\" on the website does not support Italba's statement that the members of the Firm share their fees. It also stressed that the members of the firm do not share clients or income or associate attorneys with one another. It asserted that the statement whereby the members of the Firm seek \". to benefit from their association with one another beyond the need to share costs\" does not show how Professor de Mello's independence is compromised. Uruguay disputed the application of the *Hrvatska* case to this proceeding and pointed out that, in response to the Tribunal's questions at the hearing, Professor de Mello answered that he did not, and will not, receive any of the fees to be collected by his Firm colleagues.87\n\nUruguay's Letter, 8 December 2017, pages 3 and 4.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nAs stated above, in the course of the Hearing and in their Post-Hearing Briefs on the matter, counsel for Italba questioned Professor de Mello's independence on the ground that he is a \"partner\" of other attorneys at his Firm representing Uruguay in another case. The Tribunal adds that the word *socio* is often translated into English as \"partner\". However, this translation is not always accurate. According to \"*Diccionario de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola*,\" the first entry of the word \"*socio*\" is \"a person associated with another or others for a purpose.\" In turn, the word \"*asociar*\" has several meanings. The one relevant to the issue in dispute is \"to get together or gather for a purpose.\" That is why there is not necessarily a complete correspondence between the English word \"partner\" and the Spanish word \"*socio.*\"\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, in order to decide this issue, it should examine the rules that lay down the structure of GIE in Uruguay. Article 489 of the Commercial Companies Act provides:\n\n*\"(Concept). Two or more natural or legal persons may form an economic interest group for the purpose of promoting or developing the economic activity of its members, or else improving or increasing the results thereof. By itself, it shall entitle its associates neither to derive nor to be distributed profits, and it may be organized without a capital. It shall be a legal person.\"* [Tribunal's Translation]88\n\nCommercial Companies Act of 4 September 1989, Article 489, EXM-006.\n\n147.\n\nPursuant to the foregoing Article, such an entity may be formed by natural or legal persons in order to promote or develop the economic activity of its members. In the case at issue, the economic activity of the members of the Firm is to offer professional legal services. The rule quoted above also provides that a further purpose of GIEs is to improve or increase the results of such activity. That does not necessarily mean that its members work jointly or seek to derive shared profits. Such Article is crystal clear when stating that the GIE itself entitles its associates neither to derive, nor to be distributed, profits and adds that it may even be formed without any capital contributions, which is not the case of other legal entities, such as corporations.\n\n148.\n\nProfessor de Mello stated at the Hearing:\n\n*\"This economic interest group that I'm part of is entered in the national commercial registry, and the text expressly states that each attorney works separately and that we are not partners. We have no joint and several responsibility. We are not responsible or liable for what the other lawyers do.\"*89\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 17 November 2017 (Day 5), 1184: 12-1185: 1.\n\n149.\n\nItalba questioned neither such registration nor the statements made by Professor de Mello; it particularly referred to the contents of the Firm's website, which describes the Firm as a result of the merger of two firms, able to draw on the experience of its individual members to provide a full range of legal services to its clients. The website also refers to the Firm's \"clients\" and describes its members as \"partners\".90\n\nWebsite of Ram\u00edrez Xavier de Mello Abal, C-287.\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that there are various ways in which legal professionals collaborate to render their services. The most commonly adopted model has been that in which a group of legal professionals owns a law firm, which hires other attorneys to provide services as \"associates\", \"assistants\" or in other capacities which vary depending on the country and the structure of the law firm. Nevertheless, the Tribunal is also aware that, in different countries, and especially in Latin America, it is often the case that attorneys work individually, or a group of legal professionals share expenses, facilities and other services, each of them being completely independent from the others as far as her/his professional work is concerned and obtaining no benefit from the work of her/his colleagues.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the GIE of which Professor de Mello is a member cannot be equated as a law firm in which the members are in partnership and share profits. An GIE in Uruguay is more akin to a barristers' chambers in England and it has long been recognized that there is no automatic disqualification, for example, where a member of a barristers' chambers acts as an arbitrator in a case where another member is acting as counsel. *A fortiori*, there cannot be an automatic disqualification in circumstances where a member acts as an expert either.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimant places particular emphasis upon the fact that Professor de Mello did not disclose, in his report or otherwise, that other colleagues of the GIE of which he is a member, are currently advising Uruguay in another arbitration. Professor de Mello acknowledged at the Hearing that he failed to disclose that Uruguay had retained other members of the Firm in those proceedings; he stated that he failed to make such disclosure because he was not aware of such circumstance when preparing his report for this arbitration proceeding. Italba questions this assertion as hard to believe.\n\n153.\n\nOnce again, the nature of the GIE structure must inform the extent and content of any disclosure obligation upon Professor de Mello. If the members of a GIE do not share profits and are not considered to be in conflict of interest situation when they act on different sides in the same case under Uruguayan law, then there would be no reason for Professor de Mello to disclose that other members of the GIE of which he is part were advising Uruguay in another arbitration. Again, an analogy might be drawn with a barristers' chamber in England where one member has no right to information about the activities of another member and it would be a breach of that member's duty of confidentiality to his/her client to disclose such information. In those circumstances it cannot be appropriate to require the member to disclose information about the activities of other members within the same barristers' chambers. There is no doubt that similar considerations apply to members of a GIE under Uruguayan law.\n\n154.\n\nIn respect of the Claimant's reliance on how the members of the Firm are characterized on the internet, the Tribunal considers that what is important is the legal structure of the Firm rather than how it is described on a website. In this case, the Firm is entered as a GIE in the National Commercial Registry. The contents of a website cannot alter the legal structure or registration of the Firm.\n\n155.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers that the contents of the Firm's website neither warrant Italba's challenge to Professor de Mello's independence nor prove that the professional service he rendered to Uruguay had been affected by the work currently or previously performed by other colleagues for or against Uruguay.\n\n156.\n\nArticle 5 (2) (a) and (c) of the IBA Rules does not require an expert to submit a statement concerning the present or past relationship with the Parties of all the members of her/his law firm, office, corporation or any other legal structure of which the expert is part. Such rule is very specific and refers to the expert's present or past relationship with any of the Parties and other actors in the proceeding (legal advisors and members of the Tribunal).\n\n157.\n\nAn expert's objectivity and independence may be impaired, *inter alia*, by economic and personal factors. From the economic standpoint, it is crystal clear that merely receiving fees for the preparation of a report does not interfere with the expert's independence;91 an expert could not be expected to work *pro bono* as a prerequisite to her/his independence. Objectivity could be impaired if an expert participated in an arbitration proceeding and it was shown that she/he would obtain an economic benefit if the outcome of the proceeding were favorable to the retaining party.\n\nInternational Bar Association. Commentary on the revised text of the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (2010), page 19.\n\n158.\n\nProfessor de Mello made it very clear at the Hearing that he was not aware of the fact that other members of the Firm serve as counsel for Uruguay in a separate arbitration proceeding. He was adamant that neither he nor the GIE of which he is a member obtains any direct economic benefit from the fees that his colleagues will receive in consideration for their work in such case.92\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 17 November 2017 (Day 5), 1269: 11-1270: 3.\n\n159.\n\nAn expert's independence should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In the instant case, Professor de Mello was not proved to have obtained from Uruguay, either directly or otherwise, an economic benefit which may affect his independence.\n\n160.\n\nThe case cited by Italba, *Hrvatska*, does not assist the Tribunal's analysis, because it addressed a fundamentally different issue; namely, the power to exclude a new member of a counsel team in circumstances where the independence and impartiality of an arbitrator could have been brought into question if that new member were permitted to continue to act.\n\n161.\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal rejects Italba's request that the report prepared by Professor de Mello be excluded from the record of this arbitration proceeding.\n\n**VI. JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n162.\n\nUruguay raised jurisdictional objections and defenses on the merits. It considers that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction because Italba neither owns nor controls Trigosul and therefore cannot rely on the protection of the Treaty or the ICSID Convention; in addition, Italba has no substantial economic and business activities in the United States and, moreover, it is controlled by a national of a country that is not a Party to the Treaty, as Dr. Alberelli is Italian. Uruguay also contends that Italba's claims are time-barred, since Italba learned about Uruguay's purported breach and the damage allegedly caused thereby on 29 March 2011, not 2015, as Italba maintains. The Respondent also asserts that the rights arising from Trigosul's authorization to provide services and its allocation of frequencies are not rights protected under domestic law, as required by Article 1 of the Treaty.93\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 45-49; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 3.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarize and analyze the Parties' arguments, and set out its own analysis and conclusions, in the following Section.\n\n**A. Ownership of the investment and control over Trigosul**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Respondent's Counter-Memorial***\n--------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nUruguay submitted that, although Italba bore the burden of proof, it had failed to prove its ownership of Trigosul's shares. Uruguay also indicated that the Claimant's evidence, so far as those matters were concerned, consisted of the statements of Messrs. Alberelli and Herb\u00f3n, both of whom have direct interest in this proceeding, and an Advocacy Questionnaire submitted by Mr. Herb\u00f3n to the Embassy of the United States in Uruguay, in which he indicated that Italba owned Trigosul.94\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 52; Advocacy Questionnaire sent by Trigosul to the U.S. Embassy in Uruguay, 11 June 2001, C-102 and R-8.\n\n165.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, on 9 August 1999, when Dr. Alberelli requested the DNC to transfer to Trigosul the authorization that had been granted to him (see paragraph 83 above), Italba did not own or control Trigosul. On 4 November 1999, Mr. Herb\u00f3n sent the DNC a communication in which he indicated that Trigosul's owners were Mr. Alberelli, with 95% of the shares, and his mother, Ms. Carmela Caravetta Durante, with the remaining 5%.95\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 56; Letter from Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n to DNC, 4 November 1999, R-19; Notarial Certificate No. 603627 of 5 November 1999, R-020.\n\n166.\n\nUruguay also submitted that, according to Article 15 of Decree 115/003, Trigosul, as a license holder, should have obtained prior authorization from the Executive or from URSEC to conduct any shareholding change96 and there is no evidence whatsoever that Trigosul had requested any such authorization.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 57.\n\n167.\n\nIn addition, Uruguay adduced a report by the Director General of Public Registries and another by the Internal Revenue Services, in which those agencies indicated that there was no evidence in their records that Trigosul was a subsidiary of Italba.97\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60; Letter by Lic.

Claimant*****'*****s Reply Memorial***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nItalba asserted that \"at all relevant times,\" it owned Trigosul and, in any event, controlled the company. Furthermore, it submitted that, according to Florida law and Uruguayan law, Italba owns Trigosul.98\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.\n\n169.\n\nItalba submitted the following:..in 2002, when the Alberellis realized that they had not formally transferred Trigosul's shares to Italba, they took action. First, in May 2002, they asked Dr. Alberelli's mother to transfer her shares in Trigosul to Dr. Alberelli, which she did. Second, in August 2002, the shares were transferred to Italba and moved to Miami, Florida and placed in a safety deposit box that Dr. Alberelli and his wife owned for the purpose of maintaining important documentation belonging to Italba. To indicate that the shares now belonged to Italba, Dr. Alberelli noted on the back of the bundle of shares that he was transferring them to Italba.\"99\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 72; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 17; Statement of Ms. Beatriz Alberelli,12 May 2017, \u00b6 6; Share Certificates of Trigosul, C-161.\n\n170.\n\nIn addition to the statements in the preceding paragraph, the Claimant asserted that, since the acquisition of Trigosul, Italba made the investments necessary to provide the company with all of its funds. Italba also pointed out that, on 11 June 2001, it registered with the Embassy of the United States of America as the owner of Trigosul, and that by letter of 9 July 2001 it advised the Uruguayan government that Trigosul was owned by Italba.100 It added that Italba negotiated with different companies, both in the United States and elsewhere, and that in those negotiations it held itself out as the owner of Trigosul.101\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 73; Advocacy Questionnaire sent by Trigosul to the Embassy of the United States in Uruguay, 11 June 2011, C-102; Letter from Albert Jansenson, Vice President and CFO of Italba Telecommunications Group to Ra\u00fal J.

Thus, \u2018[i]t is imperative to resort to the economic reality behind Trigosul' in determining its ownership and to consider evidence of how the company actually operated, including whether the parent company understood itself to be the owner of the subsidiary, acted in a manner consistent with ownership, and held itself out to third parties as the owner.\"*105\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 81; Dr. Luis Lapique's Report, 12 May 2017, page 17.\n\n174.\n\nBased on that theory of economic reality, the Claimant submitted that: (a) Italba made Trigosul's business decisions, developed its business plan, commissioned studies in 1999 for that plan, and sought out, negotiated and contracted with potential partners on behalf of Trigosul;106 (b) Italba contributed to the \"overwhelming majority\" of Trigosul's share capital as follows: \"[i]n early 2001, Italba made a capital contribution to Trigosul of 632,674 Uruguayan pesos\"107 of which a capital increase from 182,500 to 690,000 Uruguayan pesos was subsequently approved; therefore, Italba contributed 92,04% of Trigosul's share capital;108 (c) Italba funded Trigosul's operations and purchased equipment for Trigosul; Mr. Herb\u00f3n informed the DNC in October 2000 that Italba had purchased equipment for Trigosul, and a resolution by the President of Uruguay in September 2002 recognized Italba's purchase of equipment for Trigosul; issued checks for Trigosul's expenses and used a USD 25,000 bond for that company's expenses109; and (d) Italba routinely held itself out to third parties as the owner of Trigosul.110\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 82; Statement of Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 10; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 83; Trigosul's Book of Shareholders and Directors Meetings, C-164, pages 5-6.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 83; Dr. Luis Lapique's Report, 12 May 2017, page 11.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 84; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15 and 19; Statement of Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n, 12 May 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 13 and 15.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 85.\n\n175.\n\nWith respect to the communication sent by Mr. Herb\u00f3n in November 1999, in which he informed the DNC that Trigosul's shareholders were Dr. Alberelli and Ms. Caravetta (see paragraph 165 above), Italba pointed out that, regardless of Mr. Herb\u00f3n's understanding at that time about who Trigosul's shareholders were, the truth was that Ms. Caravetta transferred her shares to Dr. Alberelli in May 2002 and Dr. Alberelli transferred all of his shares to Italba in August 2002.111 As regards the obligation outlined in Decree 115/003 (see paragraph 166 above), to ask for authorization for a change in shareholding in a corporate license holder, Italba explained that such rule post-dated the share transfer carried out by Ms. Caravetta and Mr. Alberelli.112\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 87.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 88.\n\n176.\n\nFor the Claimant, even rejecting the economic reality doctrine in favor of a formalistic approach to ownership, Italba would own 93.36% of Trigosul's shares, because it contributed 92.04% of the share capital, and at least one of Trigosul's shares (amounting to an \"additional 1.33% of the company\") was transferred to Italba via an endorsement on the back of the share certificate.113\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 89; Dr. Luis Lapique's Report, 12 May 2017, page 22.\n\n177.\n\nBased on Dr. Lapique's opinion, the Claimant asserted that, under the Uruguayan legislation, the contribution to the share capital suffices to confer shareholder status, regardless of the formalities. The Claimant pointed out that on 31 October 2001, Trigosul's Shareholders' Meeting agreed on a capital increase from 182,500 to 690,000 Uruguayan pesos and recognized Italba's contribution of 632,674 Uruguayan pesos, (92.04% of the share capital). For Italba, the fact that Trigosul did not formally complete the increase in the authorized capital by recording it with the National Registry of Commerce and failed to issue new shares reflecting Italba's capital contribution does not deprive Italba of its 92.04% ownership of Trigosul.114\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 90; Trigosul's Book of Shareholders and Directors Meetings C-164, pages 5-6; Statement of Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 13; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 16; Dr. Luis Lapique's Report, 12 May 2017, pages 11, 13, 15 and 22.\n\n178.\n\nAccording to Italba, even if the Tribunal were to find that Italba does not own Trigosul, the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the claims brought against Uruguay should still be upheld because Italba controls Trigosul within the meaning of Article 24 of the Treaty.115 Italba submitted that ICSID's case law has analyzed the concept of control flexibly and broadly and with the intention to expand rather than restrict jurisdiction. Among the criteria used, Italba refers to: \"share ownership, decision-making procedures, the exercise of management, and \u2018other economic criteria.'\"116 In particular, Italba states that in *Perenco v. Ecuador* \"...the tribunal found that the claimants' control of the relevant entity was sufficient for jurisdiction, even though the claimants did not hold formal legal title in that entity.\"117\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 93.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 94.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 95, referring to *Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. the Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability, 12 September 2014, CL-111.\n\n179.\n\nItalba also argued the following:\n\n*\"...the Tribunal should not \u2018pierce any corporate veil' to consider whether control over Trigosul was exercised by Dr. Alberelli in his individual capacity or in his capacity as the President of Italba. The case law does not support looking behind the corporate form of the claimant to its individual shareholders to determine which shareholders control the claimant\u2014indeed, the relevant question for jurisdictional purposes is not who controls the claimant, but whether the claimant controls the subsidiary.\"*118\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 97.\n\n***c. Respondent*****'*****s Rejoinder Memorial***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nUruguay submitted that there are \"inconsistencies and discrepancies\" in Italba's account of the share transfer carried out in August 2002. As per Trigosul's books, as at 10 October 2002 and as at 1 November of that same year, the only shareholders registered were Mr. Alberelli and his mother, Ms. Caravetta. According to Uruguay, the fact that Italba is not mentioned in those books is not an error or oversight, but a reflection of the reality of the company at that time. Uruguay strongly criticizes the Claimant's argument that, as Trigosul's records are not reliable, one should rely upon the statements made by Dr. Alberelli, who is an interested party in the outcome of these proceedings, to prove the alleged ownership of Trigosul's shares.119\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 49-53.\n\n181.\n\nUruguay submitted that Trigosul's shares were not validly transferred to Italba. Dr. Alberelli only endorsed one share in the name of Italba; the endorsement by Ms. Caravetta, Dr. Alberelli's mother, fails to mention where it was made.120 Among other reasons, since on the endorsement date (24 May 2002) they were both in Uruguay, Uruguayan law, pursuant to which the transfer should be recorded in the company's books to be valid, must apply.121 Clearly, Trigosul's corporate records do not contain a record of this alleged transfer, and therefore the transfer was necessarily invalid. On this basis, Uruguay submits that Ms. Caravetta is still a shareholder in Trigosul.122\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59 and 60.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 61; Immigration movements of Ms. Carmela Caravetta, R-089 and R-091; Immigration movements of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, R-088.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 61.\n\n182.\n\nWith respect to Dr. Alberelli's alleged transfer of Trigosul's shares by way of a donation to Italba, in August 2002, Uruguay submitted that, although not applicable in this case, according to Florida law, donations require the following: donative intent, delivery of possession and acceptance by the recipient. None of these requirements are met in this case.123\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 62.\n\n183.\n\nRegarding the intent to donate, Uruguay submitted that Dr. Alberelli only endorsed certificate number 4 out of 20 certificates and, on the basis of the report by his expert, Mr. Louis T.M. Conti, asserted that, \". the endorsement of only one stock certificate cannot serve as an endorsement of the others.\"124 According to Uruguay, delivery of the certificates did not take place either, as Dr. Alberelli retained possession of the shares at all times, without transferring his dominion and control, as required by Florida law. Furthermore, according to Mr. Conti, in Florida delivery can also be considered complete if the recipient exercises dominion and control of the donation. Mr. Conti concluded that Italba never exercised this dominion as there is no evidence on the record of Italba's participation in Trigosul's shareholders' meetings.125\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 63; Mr. Louis T.M. Conti's Report, 9 August 2017, page 11.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\n184.\n\nAs regards the acceptance requirement, Uruguay submitted that it was not met, given that what Dr. Alberelli did was to deposit Trigosul's shares in a safety box in the name of himself and his wife, not in the name of Italba. In addition, Italba's records from 2002 to the present date do not show any revenues, losses or contributions related to Trigosul.126\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 67. Mr. Louis T.M. Conti's Report, page 14.\n\n185.\n\nUruguay submitted that Italba recognized that, pursuant to Uruguayan law, it had no ownership of Trigosul's shares through endorsement or delivery of the certificates. Instead, Italba argued that it owned Trigosul by virtue of the theory of economic reality. Uruguay notes that, even Dr. Lapique, Italba's expert, recognizes that this theory is based on the concept of piercing the corporate veil, enshrined in Article 189 of the Commercial Companies Act, for cases of fraudulent evasion of the law and violation of public order and, as such, would not be applicable to the instant case.127 Uruguay pointed out that its expert, Professor de Mello, agree that \"this theory does not apply to the present case.\"128\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 72-73; Dr. Luis Lapique' Report, 12 May 2017, page 18.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 74; Dr. Eugenio Xavier de Mello Ferrand's Report, 31 July 2017, \u00b6 55.\n\n186.\n\nUruguay submitted that, even if the economic reality theory were applicable to the present case, the documents adduced as evidence by the Claimant fail to support its assertion that Italba acted at all times as a shareholder of Trigosul. Some predate Trigosul's license or refer to Trigosul as a strategic partner, but they failed to prove Italba's assertion that it was negotiating business plans on behalf of Trigosul.129 Uruguay also criticized the evidence which Italba relied upon to prove that it was funding Trigosul: these are preliminary or draft documents that make reference to the shipment of equipment to Italba, not to Trigosul. Uruguay also denied Italba's assertion that the President of Uruguay recognized that Italba had paid for Trigosul's equipment (see paragraph 174 above); it argued that the document with which the Claimant seeks to prove this assertion is a claim by Trigosul for the purchase of radios from Italba, which was entitled \"ITALBA invoice: USD 25,964,\" and which would refute the theory that Italba was paying for Trigosul's equipment.130 Uruguay also criticized Italba's attempt to prove its alleged funding of Trigosul during 15 years with nothing more than two checks and a bond purchase.131 Moreover, according to Uruguay, the documents relied upon to prove that Italba held itself out as the owner of Trigosul fail to prove any such assertion: only two of them postdate the alleged transfer of shares to Italba, and none of them refers to the relationship between Italba and Trigosul.132\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 76-77; Proposal for a Banking Communication Network, dated 6 January 1999, C-006; Site Survey Report: Uruguay, of 15 October 2001, C-165; joint venture agreement for the telecommunications project in Uruguay, dated July 1999, C-007; Shareholders' Agreement, of October 1998, C-008; Co-Investment Agreement of 14 June 2002, C-015; Joint Venture Terms Sheet, of February 2007, C-030.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 80.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 81.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 82.\n\n187.\n\nUruguay also submitted that the letter dated 9 July 2001 from Mr. Albert Jansenson to the Secretary of the Presidency (quoted at the footnote 100 of paragraph 170) predates the alleged share transfer of 2002 and, thus, contradicts Italba's argument that it owned Trigosul; moreover, the sender of that letter was not Italba, and the signer thereof is a person who Italba has never mentioned as a director or shareholder of Italba. Finally, in the letter, reference was made to \"majority shareholders\" of Trigosul and, in these proceedings, Italba has claimed to be the sole shareholder of Trigosul.133\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 83.\n\n188.\n\nWith respect to Italba's alleged contributions to Trigosul's share capital, Uruguay submitted that there are no documents on the record supporting this allegation. Additionally, in an attempt to prove those alleged contributions, Italba and its expert witness, Dr. Lapique, relied on Trigosul's books, which they criticized as being \"filed with errors\" and unreliable.134 Uruguay also highlighted the inconsistencies between the date of the alleged transfer and the date of entry in the corporate and statutory books, on which Italba presumably transferred to Trigosul USD 35,000, \"as reimbursement\". Similar doubts were raised in respect of other alleged contributions in the amount of 632,674 Uruguayan pesos, paid by Trigosul to the DNC as an advance on the fees for Trigosul's operation in the spectrum.135 The Respondent also criticized the fact that, according to his own testimony, Dr. Lapique based his report on instructions received from Italba. Uruguay also indicated that Dr. Alberelli recognized that the funds with which he acquired Trigosul in 1999 came partially from his mother and, based on this contribution, 50% of the shares were issued to Mrs. Caravetta, and the other 50% to himself, an acknowledgement that contradicts his assertion that Italba funded Trigosul's acquisition. Uruguay also submitted that the fact that shares were never issued in favor of Italba is inconsistent with Dr. Alberelli's argument that Italba contributed capital in the subsequent years.136\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 88.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 90; Mr. Louis T.M. Conti's Report, 9 August 2017, pages 7 and 8; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 10.\n\n189.\n\nUruguay stated that its expert, Professor de Mello, asserted that Trigosul's accounting records are not clear either regarding the nature and scope of the contributions to Trigosul, or regarding who made them.137 Uruguay also highlighted the fact that Italba did not formally complete the increase in the authorized capital by recording it with the National Registry of Commerce and failed to issue new shares, a defect described as fatal to Italba's claim.138\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 91, Dr. Eugenio Xavier de Mello Ferrand's Report, 31 July 2017, \u00b6 59.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 94.\n\n190.\n\nWith respect to the control that Italba alleged to have over Trigosul, Uruguay repeated that the alleged investment in Trigosul was made, and is owned, by Dr. Alberelli, who is Italian; it is Dr. Alberelli who has control over Trigosul, not Italba.139 According to the corporate records, Dr. Alberelli and his mother are the true shareholders of Trigosul since, according to the Shareholders' Meeting and Board of Directors' Minutes, it was they, who exercised their voting rights (Uruguay cited minutes from 1996 to 2002).140 Uruguay also submitted that on 4 February 2011, Dr. Alberelli took the position of President of Trigosul, which proves that he controlled that company in his personal capacity, and not as Italba's representative, and that he was the one who decided Trigosul's business plan and had control over the financing of Trigosul's operations.141 Uruguay concluded that Italba failed to meet its burden of proof on the alleged control over Trigosul.142\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 97.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 99-104.Trigosul S.A., Minutes of the Shareholders and Board of Directors Meetings, C-164.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 105.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 107.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider the rules applicable to a determination of the first objection raised by the Respondent.\n\n192.\n\nArticle 1 of the Treaty defines the concept of \"investor of a Party\" as follows:\n\n*Investor of a Party means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of the other Party; provided, however, that a natural person who is a dual citizen shall be deemed to be exclusively a citizen of the State of his or her dominant and effective citizenship.\"*\n\n193.\n\nRegarding the definition of \"investment,\" the same Article of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n*\"Investment means every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk. Forms that an investment may take include:*\n\n*(a) an enterprise;*\n\n*(b) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise;*\n\n*(c) bonds, debentures, other debt instruments, and loans;*\n\n*(d) futures, options, and other derivatives;*\n\n*(e) turnkey, construction, management, production, concession, revenue sharing, and other similar contracts;*\n\n*(f) intellectual property rights;*\n\n*(g) licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar rights conferred pursuant to domestic law; and*\n\n*(h) other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable property, and related property rights, such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges\"* (emphasis added).\n\n194.\n\nArticle 1(g) of the Treaty includes two footnotes:\n\n*\"Whether a particular type of license, authorization, permit, or similar instrument (including a concession, to the extent that it has the nature of such an instrument) has the characteristics of an investment depends on such factors as the nature and extent of the rights that the holder has under the law of the Party. Among the licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar instruments that do not have the characteristics of an investment are those that do not create any rights protected under domestic law. For greater certainty, the foregoing is without prejudice to whether any asset associated with the license, authorization, permit, or similar instrument has the characteristics of an investment.\"*\n\n*\"The term \"investment\" does not include an order or judgment entered in a judicial or administrative action.\"*\n\n195.\n\nIn addition, Article 1 of the Treaty defines the concept of a \"covered investment\" as follows:\n\n*\"with respect to a Party, an investment in its territory of an investor of the other Party in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Treaty or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter.\"*\n\n196.\n\nArticle 24 of the Treaty entitled \"Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\" provides the following:\n\n*\"1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:*\n\n*the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim:*\n\n*that the respondent has breached:*\n\n*an obligation under Articles 3 through 10;*\n\n*an investment authorization, or*\n\n*an investment agreement, and*\n\n*that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and*\n\n*the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim*\n\n*that the respondent has breached:*\n\n*an obligation under Articles 3 through 10;*\n\n*an investment authorization, or*\n\n*an investment agreement; and*\n\n*that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.*\n\n*provided that a claimant may submit pursuant to subparagraph (a)(i)(C) or (b)(i)(C) a claim for breach of an investment agreement only if the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages directly relate to the covered investment that was established or acquired, or sought to be established or acquired, in reliance on the relevant investment agreement.*\n\n*2. At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration (\u2018notice of intent'). The notice shall specify:*\n\n*(a)...*\n\n*3. Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, a claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 1:*\n\n*(a) under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and the non-disputing Party are parties to the ICSID Convention;*\n\n*(b) under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either the respondent or the non-disputing Party is a party to the ICSID Convention;*\n\n*(c) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or*\n\n*(d) if the claimant and respondent agree, to any other arbitration institution or under any other arbitration rules.*\n\n*4. A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section when the claimant's notice of or request for arbitration (\u2018notice of arbitration'):*\n\n*(a) referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 36 of the ICSID Convention is received by the Secretary-General;*\n\n*(b) referred to in Article 2 of Schedule C of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules is received by the Secretary-General;*\n\n*(c) referred to in Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, together with the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, are received by the respondent; or*\n\n*(d) referred to under any arbitral institution or arbitral rules selected under paragraph 3(d) is received by the respondent...\"*\n\n197.\n\nThe Parties agreed that the Treaty protects an investor who owns or controls the investment.143 The disagreement between them with respect to this matter is that the Claimant submitted that it owns, and has controlled, Trigosul. On the contrary, the Respondent submitted that Italba does not own or control Trigosul, since, in fact, it is Dr. Alberelli, who owns and controls Trigosul, in his personal capacity.144\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 70; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 47.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29-37, 70-98; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 38, 46-108.\n\n198.\n\nAs stated in the preceding paragraphs, it is crucial to determine whether Italba is indeed a shareholder of Trigosul and, failing that, if Italba controls Trigosul, either directly or indirectly.\n\n199.\n\nAfter resolution of those issues, the Tribunal must next determine whether Italba owned or controlled the investment at the time of the alleged breach of the Treaty by the Respondent.\n\n200.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, the Tribunal will proceed to address the issue concerning the ownership of Trigosul's shares, and, subsequently, the issue regarding control over them.\n\n***a. Does Italba own Trigosul?***\n----------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nArticle 3 of Trigosul's Bylaws provides that the company's share capital is represented by \"registered common shares.\"145\n\nTrigosul's Bylaws, C-226.\n\n202.\n\nOn the record, there are six share certificates of Trigosul dated 6 September 1996. Certificates number 1, 2 and 3 are issued in the name of Ms. Carmela Caravetta Durante and number 4, 5 and 6\u2014in the name of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli.\n\n203.\n\nCertificates 1 to 3 have on their reverse side an endorsement that reads: \"On the date of May 24, 2002, this is transferred to Dr. Gustavo Alberelli\"; the three endorsements are signed by \"Carmela Caravetta\".146 As already stated, certificates 4 to 6 were issued in the name of Dr. Alberelli, on 6 September 1996. Certificates number 7 to 20 dated 30 June 1999 and also issued in the name of Dr. Alberelli, likewise appear on the record.147\n\nTrigosul's Share Certificates, C-161.\n\n*Id*.\n\n204.\n\nAdditionally, a two-page copy (the cover and folio number 2) of the book of Records of Registered Securities belonging to Trigosul appears on the record.148 On folio 2 of the book, there is a description of the certificates numbered 1 to 20, with the specification of the \"amount\" that each of them represents and the certificate's owner's name. As already stated, the first three are in the name of Ms. Caravetta and the rest are in the name of Dr. Alberelli. There is no signature or date of any such entries.\n\nTrigosul's Stock Ledger Book, C-163.\n\n205.\n\nOn the record there are also copies of thirteen folios of the Shareholders' Meeting and Board of Directors' Minutes Book,149 that express the following:\n\n(a) minutes numbered 1 are dated 2 October 1996; on it, there appears a call for an Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting, with an illegible signature;\n\n(b) on the following folio, there appear other minutes (unnumbered) of a Shareholders' Meeting held on 10 October in that same year, which was chaired by Mr. Daniel P\u00e9rez (a founding partner of the company, see paragraph 76 above). In those minutes, Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n was appointed Chairman of the first \"Board of Directors of the Company\" [Tribunal's Translation]; at the end of the minutes, it is stated that shareholders Ms. Caravetta and Dr. Alberelli were in attendance;\n\n(c) on folio 4 of the aforementioned Shareholders' Meeting and Board of Directors' Minutes Book, there appear other minutes dated 10 October 1996, likewise not numbered, in which Mr. Herb\u00f3n accepted his appointment;\n\n(d) on folio 5 there appears a text, handwritten and partially illegible, that apparently refers to the Board of Directors' Minutes of 2001; at the end, it states the authorized share capital and, once again, it mentions Ms. Caravetta and Dr. Alberelli as shareholders of the company;\n\n(e) on folios 5 and 6, there appear the minutes of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on 31 October 2001, which refers to a capital increase. They also cite Dr. Alberelli and Ms. Caravetta as shareholders of the company;\n\n(f) on folio 7, there appear the Board of Directors' Minutes dated 30 September 2002, which refer to a call for an extraordinary shareholders' meeting. On that folio, there also appear the Minutes of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on 10 October 2002; once again it is mentioned that the shareholders are Dr. Alberelli and Ms. Caravetta;\n\n(g) on folio 8, there appear the Board of Directors' Minutes dated 11 October 2002 in which a new Chairman was appointed (in the minutes, his name is illegible). On that folio, there also appears the Board of Directors' Minutes dated 30 October 2002 that refer to a call for a shareholders' meeting;\n\n(h) on folio 9, there appear the Minutes of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on 1 November 2002, in which shareholders Dr. Alberelli and Ms. Caravetta once again appoint Mr. Herb\u00f3n as Chairman;\n\n(i) on folio 10, there appear the minutes of a session of the Board of Directors held on 2 November 2002 in which Mr. Herb\u00f3n's acceptance of his appointment is included;\n\n(j) on folio 11, there appear the minutes of a Board of Directors' meeting held on 4 February 2011 to call for a Shareholders' Meeting;\n\n(k) on folio 12, there appear the Minutes of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on 4 February 2011, in which Dr. Alberelli was appointed as the Board of Directors' Chairman; and\n\n(l) on folio 13, there appear the Minutes of a Board of Directors' meeting of 4 February 2011, in which Mr. Herb\u00f3n resigned his office and Dr. Alberelli accepted appointment in his place.\n\nTrigosul's Book of Shareholders and Directors Meetings, C-164.\n\n206.\n\nFollowing a careful review of the aforementioned minutes, the Tribunal notes that there are only three folios on which shareholders of Trigosul are mentioned, (at letters (b), (d), and (f) of the preceding paragraph) and Dr. Alberelli and Ms. Caravetta are the shareholders so mentioned. Conversely, there is no mention of Italba as a shareholder; no reference to share endorsements or capital increases made by Italba, nor is there any suggestion that Italba made any decisions on the different appointments of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\n207.\n\nHaving analyzed the first three share certificates endorsed to Dr. Alberelli, cited in paragraph 203 above, the Tribunal confirms that none of them states the place of the endorsement. On the date of the endorsement indicated therein (24 May 2002), Ms. Caravetta and her son, Dr. Alberelli, were in Uruguay.150 It follows that the law of Uruguay should apply to determine the validity of the endorsement of shares in this Uruguayan company.\n\nImmigration movements of Ms. Carmela Caravetta, R-89 and R-91; Immigration movements of Mr. Gustavo Alberelli, R-88.\n\n208.\n\nAdditionally, the only certificate containing an endorsement in favor of Italba is number 4. It relates to 9,125 shares out of an aggregate amount of 182,500 and it reads: \"On the date of August 15, 2002, this is transferred to Italba Corp. (Miami FL. 33183 8540 Sw 132 court)\" and below it reads: \"Gustavo Alberelli Caravetta.\"\n\n209.\n\nDuring the Hearing, the Claimant's counsel stressed that Mr. and Mrs. Alberelli are not attorneys, and, for that reason, they failed to keep Italba and Trigosul's documents in the \"best order.\"151 In the Tribunal's view, the fact that these persons were not experienced in managing corporate books does not justify the apparent inconsistencies in Trigosul's certificates and books. Dr. Alberelli is an experienced businessman who established Italba in 1982;152 Mr. Herb\u00f3n presided over Trigosul during several years, he is a Uruguayan national, a holder of a degree in accountancy and he has vast experience in business administration.153 It is not conceivable for this Tribunal to conclude that the lack of legal knowledge on the part of Trigosul's officers was the cause of their failure to record the endorsement allegedly made in May and August 2002 in Trigosul's books. Both Dr. Alberelli and Mr. Herb\u00f3n had enough experience and knowledge to handle the corporate documents appropriately.\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 13 November 2017 (Day 1), 18:22- 19:10 and 114:8-11.\n\nStatement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 16 September 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.\n\nStatement of Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n, dated 16 September 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.\n\n210.\n\nArticle 305 of the Uruguayan Commercial Companies Act provides as follows:\n\n*\"(Transferability). Shares shall be freely transferable.*\n\n*Articles of incorporation may set restrictions to the transferability of registered shares, or book entry shares, provided that no such restriction may amount to a prohibition on transfer. Any restriction shall be stated in the certificate or in the Book-Entry Stock Register, as applicable*\n\n***The corporation shall be given written notice of the transfer of a registered share** or a book entry share or of the creation or transfer of rights in rem over any such shares, **and an entry shall be made in the relevant stock register. These actions shall be enforceable against the corporation and third parties from the time of said registration.***\n\n*Endorsable shares shall be transferred by an uninterrupted chain of endorsements, and endorsees shall request the register to exercise their rights.\"*154 (Emphasis added).\n\nCommercial Companies Act of 4 September 1989, Article 305, C-222 and EXM-006.\n\n211.\n\nBased on Article 305 as set out above, the Tribunal concludes that for Dr. Alberelli to be able to exercise the rights relating to Trigosul's shares represented by certificates number 1, 2 and 3, he should have notified the endorsement to Trigosul and recorded it in the book called the Registered Securities Ledger. Article 305 explicitly provides that \"[t]he transfer of registered shares... shall be enforceable against the corporation and third parties from the time of said registration.\"\n\n212.\n\nConsidering the facts described and the content of the Commercial Companies Act, the Tribunal concludes that, in Trigosul's case, the legal requirements applicable to the endorsement of Trigosul's share certificates number 1, 2 and 3 carried out by Ms. Caravetta in favor of Dr. Alberelli, in May 2002, were not respected. For this reason, the endorsement fails to produce effects concerning Trigosul or third parties.\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the endorsement of certificate number 4, representing 9,125 registered shares out of an aggregate amount of 182,500 of Trigosul's shares, carried out on 15 August 2002 by Dr. Alberelli. In that endorsement, there is no indication whatsoever concerning the place where it was carried out; it was only stated, between parenthesis, the registered address of Italba Corporation, which, as per its Articles of Incorporation, is: \"8540 S.W. 132th Court, Miami, Florida, 33183.\"155 The Tribunal considers that there is no sufficient evidential basis to assert that the endorsement was actually made in Florida, and that, as a consequence, the applicable law is that of the endorser's domicile. The only evidence on record on this matter are the statements made by Dr. Alberelli and his wife. There being no reliable proof of the place in which that endorsement was carried out, the laws of Uruguay, the country in which Trigosul was established and registered and where it operates should apply to the validity of the endorsement. Nonetheless, the Tribunal will also assess the validity of the endorsement by reference to the law of Florida, which is the law that the Claimant maintained is applicable.156\n\nArticles of Incorporation of Italba Corporation, 10 May 1982, C-002.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 80.\n\n214.\n\nAs previously stated, Article 3 of the Trigosul Bylaws reads as follows: \"Share transfers shall be notified to the company and documented as provided in Law No. 16,060\"157 (it refers to Article 305 of the Commercial Companies Act transcribed at paragraph 210 above).\n\nTrigosul's Bylaws, C-226.\n\n215.\n\nUnder Article 316 of the Commercial Companies Act, the same rules applicable to securities apply to share certificates (as Trigosul's certificates), \".to the extent not amended herein.\"158\n\nCommercial Companies Act, of 4 September 1989, Article 316, EXM-006.\n\n216.\n\nLaw No. 14,701, which governs securities (\"*t\u00edtulos valores*\") in Uruguay (the \"**Securities Law**\"), sets forth in Article 1 that \"*t\u00edtulos valores*\" are \"the documents necessary to exercise the literal and autonomous right contained in them.\" [Tribunal's Translation]159 In addition, Article 32 of the aforementioned law provides the following for registered securities:\n\n*\"Registered securities shall be issued in the name of an ascertained person, whose name shall be stated both in the body of the document **and in the entry made in the name of the securities issuer**. Only a person **whose name appears both in the document and in the register shall be recognized as a lawful holder**.*\n\n*The obligation to keep a non-bearer securities register shall not apply in the case of bills of exchange, registered promissory notes and checks.*\n\n*The securities shall be presumed transferable unless the certificate itself or the law provides that they must be recorded in the register entry of issuance.\"* (Emphasis added)\n\nDecree-Law No. 14701 on Securities, enacted on 12 September 1977, EXM-007.\n\n217.\n\nThe quoted rule is very clear: the legitimate holder of a registered certificate is the person whose name appears in the certificate (principle of literalness) and on the records. The register of shares is required to be kept by Article 305 of the Commercial Companies Act, Article 32 of the Securities Law, and Article 3 of Trigosul's Bylaws cited hereinabove.\n\n218.\n\nAs stated in paragraph 216 above, Article 1 of the Securities Law establishes that \"*t\u00edtulos valores*\" are \"the documents necessary to exercise the literal and autonomous right contained in them\". [Tribunal's Translation] \"Literalness\" refers to the securities' characteristic, according to which the content, scope and rules applicable to the exercise of the right incorporated in the document are governed by what the document states.\n\n219.\n\nOn the basis of this principle, the Tribunal considers that the only endorsement Dr. Alberelli made to Italba was that of Trigosul's share certificate number 4. The other certificates contain no endorsement whatsoever; consequently, the exercise of the rights alleged by Italba is contrary to the principle of literalness and, therefore non-existent.\n\n220.\n\nThe Claimant's assertion that endorsement of a certificate implicitly entails endorsement of the remaining share certificates cannot be accepted. It is evident that each certificate may be transferred individually; Dr. Alberelli himself understood as much when in May 2002 he asked his mother, Ms. Caravetta, to endorse in favor of Dr. Alberelli each of the three certificates issued in her name.160\n\nStatement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 17.\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimant stated that there was a transfer of Trigosul's bundle of shares to Italba. That statement is contrary to the provisions in the Uruguayan laws on securities and to the basic principles regarding \"*t\u00edtulos valores*\".\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, on the basis of the aforementioned rules, under Uruguayan law, the endorsement in favor of Italba made by Dr. Gustavo Alberelli on 15 August 2002 of Trigosul's share certificate number 4 was not perfected, since it was not recorded in the book of Records of Registered Securities belonging to Trigosul. Therefore, it is not possible to assert that Italba is the \"lawful holder\" of Trigosul share certificate number 4, either. Much less is it the legitimate holder of Trigosul's remaining share certificates, none of which was endorsed in favor of Italba.\n\n223.\n\nThe Claimant sought to substantiate its position in the following terms: \"Under Uruguayan domestic corporate law, a party can demonstrate ownership in one of three ways: (a) by endorsing a stock certificate with a transfer note, delivering the certificates to the transferee, and/or registering the transfer in the company's stock ledger; (b) in the absence of a formal transfer of shares, by demonstrating that, as a matter of \"economic reality,\" the party owned and acted as the owner of the company; and (c) by making capital contributions to the company. Here, pursuant to the \u2018economic reality' theory, Italba is the sole owner of Trigosul.\"161\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 80.\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the first way to demonstrate ownership under Uruguayan law mentioned in the above paragraph is not applicable to this case. It is not a matter of endorsing \"a share certificate\" with a \"transfer note\" [Tribunal's Translation]. As was stated above, Article 305 of the Commercial Companies Act is very clear: \"The transfer of registered shares.shall be notified to the company in writing **and recorded** in the corresponding stock ledgers. They shall produce effects concerning the company and third parties at the time when so recorded\" (emphasis added). Under Uruguayan law, to transfer a certificate it is imperative to endorse it, hand it over to the acquirer, notify the company in writing **and record** the endorsement in the company's stock ledger.\n\n225.\n\nWhen explaining its position in respect of the second criterion (see paragraph 223 above) Italba stated: \"in the absence of a formal transfer of shares, [a party may demonstrate] that, as a matter of \u2018economic reality,' the party owned and acted as the owner of the company.\" In paragraphs 226 to 235, the Tribunal considers this second criterion; in paragraph 236, it addresses the third.\n\n226.\n\nItalba asserted, on the basis of the opinion of its expert, Dr. Lapique, that formalities in closely held corporations may be more \"relaxed\" and, because of this, the reality should be considered: \"...whether the parent company understood itself to be the owner of the subsidiary, acted in a manner consistent with ownership, and held itself out to third parties as the owner.\"162 According to the Claimant, Italba made all of Trigosul's business decisions, developed its business plan, commissioned studies on potential negotiations, sought out partners, \"contributed the overwhelming majority of Trigosul's share capital,\" funded Trigosul's operations, issued checks on a regular basis to cover Trigosul's expenses and, in addition, routinely represented to third parties that it owned Trigosul.163\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 81; Dr. Luis Lapique's Report, 12 May 2017, pages 4, 14, 17 and 18.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 82-85.\n\n227.\n\nItalba's expert, Dr. Lapique further asserted:\n\n*\"Application of the predominance of reality over form is expressly provided for in corporate matters in Article 189 of the LSC, which enshrines the theory of disregard. Although that theory is for piercing the corporate veil to reach the shareholders behind it in cases of fraudulent evasion of the law, violation of public order, etc. which would not be applicable in this case, it establishes that reality prevails over form.\"*164\n\nDr. Luis Lapique's Report, 12 May 2017, page 18.\n\n228.\n\nUruguay's expert, Professor de Mello, stated: \"...this principle [referring to the theory of disregard mentioned by Dr. Lapique] governs in commercial law, Lapique cites the provisions of the [Commercial Companies Act] on the principle of the \u2018disregard of the legal personality' of commercial companies, without taking into account that it is applied only to reject the legal personality of corporations (not to recognize the status of shareholder), in cases of fraud committed through said personality, and that it has limited scope.\"165\n\nProfessor Eugenio Xavier de Mello's Report, 31 July 2017, \u00b6 48.\n\n229.\n\nArticle 189 of the Commercial Companies Act, found in section XV entitled \"On the Unenforceability of the Legal Personality\", sets forth the following:\n\n*\"(Admissibility). A company's status as a legal person may be rendered unenforceable where it is used in evasion of the law to violate public order, or to defraud and to the detriment of the rights of members, shareholders or third parties.*\n\n*Reliable proof of the actual use of the business company as a legal instrument to achieve said purposes shall be required.*\n\n*Where the unenforceability of the company's legal status is sought through a legal action, ordinary proceedings shall be followed.\"*166\n\nCommercial Companies Act of 4 September 1989, Article 189, EXM-006.\n\n230.\n\nIt is obvious that Article 189 regulates situations that are completely different from those discussed in connection with the ownership of Trigosul's shares. None of the assumptions of fact contained therein arises in this case, which is why this Article may not be relied upon in support of Italba's position that, as Trigosul's shares were neither endorsed nor delivered, the \"predominance of reality\" over form should apply in order to conclude that Italba is the owner of those shares.\n\n231.\n\nItalba adduced judgment 90/2009167 issued by the \"*Tribunal de Apelaciones en lo Civil, Primer Turno*\" into the record of the case. In the explanation in footnote 289 of its Reply, it asserted that the *Tribunal de Apelaciones* \"appl[ies] economic reality doctrine to find standing to sue in plaintiffs' favor, because minutes of meetings established that plaintiffs had participated in shareholders' meetings, despite the fact that plaintiffs were not registered as shareholders in the bank's books and records.\"168 The Tribunal disagrees with this commentary on the judgment.\n\nDecision 90/2009 of the \"*Tribunal de Apelaciones en lo Civil, Primer Turno*\", available at Base de Jurisprudencia Nacional, C-225.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 82, footnote 289.\n\n232.\n\nThe judgment analyses neither Article 189 nor the \"disregard\" or \"economic reality\" theory. It includes none of the criteria upon which Italba purports to rely as a basis for its position in the instant case.\n\n233.\n\nArticle 319 of the Commercial Companies Act sets out the \"fundamental\" and \"essential\" rights of shareholders:\n\n*\"(1) To participate in and vote at shareholders' meetings.*\n\n*(2) To share in corporate profits and the balance of liquidation, in the event of dissolution of the company.*\n\n*(3) To oversee the management of corporate business.*\n\n*(4) To have a preemptive right to subscribe for shares of stock, convertible profit shares, and convertible debentures.*\n\n*(5) To reassign as provided by law.*\n\n*These rights may only be qualified, limited or rendered of no effect when expressly authorized by law.\"* [Tribunal's Translation]\n\n234.\n\nItalba participated in none of the shareholders' meetings held, and, thus, did not exercise its right to vote, as recorded in Trigosul's corporate documents. There is no evidence that it shared in Trigosul's profits or losses. There is no reference to Italba somehow overseeing the management of Trigosul's business.\n\n235.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence that Italba exercised the rights that would have been available to it if it had actually been a shareholder of Trigosul. Nor can the Tribunal apply the principle of disregard of the legal personality set forth in Article 189 of the Commercial Companies Act to completely different situations such as to support Italba's alleged ownership of Trigosul's shares.\n\n236.\n\nThe third criterion mentioned by the Claimant (at paragraph 223 above) is the capital contribution it claims to have made to Trigosul. As evidence of such contribution, Italba submitted that, in early 2001, it contributed to Trigosul the amount of 632,674 Uruguayan pesos.169 Italba stated: \"In recognition of Italba's capital contribution, an extraordinary meeting of Trigosul's shareholders later that year accordingly increased the authorized capital of the company from 182,500 to 690,000 Uruguayan pesos. Thus, Italba contributed 92.04% of Trigosul's share capital.\"170 In its Post-Hearing Brief, Italba relied upon the opinion of Dr. Lapique, who also \"found that Italba contributed 92.04% of Trigosul's share capital.\"171\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 80 and 83. Trigosul's Book of Shareholders and Directors Meetings, pages 5-6, C-164; Trigosul's Diary, pp. 8, 10, C-167; Report of Dr. Lapique, 12 May 2017, pages 7, 11, 12, 14 to 18.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 83.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 36.\n\n237.\n\nThere is no evidence on the record that such contribution was made by Italba. The only conclusion available to the Tribunal is that the capital contribution mentioned in the Book of Shareholders and Directors Meetings was made by Dr. Alberelli and his mother, Ms. Caravetta, as recorded in the books. Nor does the company's accounting book referred to as a \"Diary\" indicate that Italba made capital contributions to Trigosul.\n\n238.\n\nAt the Hearing, Uruguay asserted: \"...the answer to the question who contributed significant capital to Trigosul is no one. Further, these payments to Trigosul were recorded, all of them, as having been made in cash. Thus, there is no documentary record of the source of the funds.\"172 Uruguay also stated that Dr. Lapique had admitted that he had acted on Italba's instructions in connection with its alleged contribution to Trigosul.173\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 13 November 2017 (Day 1), 274: 10-13.\n\nTranscript of the Hearing of 13 November 2017 (Day 1), 281: 11-18.\n\n239.\n\nIndeed, Dr. Lapique admitted acting on the basis of the information provided by Italba relating to the contributions it claimed to have made to Trigosul. He stated:\n\n*\"According to the instructions received:*\n\n*a) All funds received by Trigosul were contributed by Italba Corp.*\n\n*b) Italba Corp. delivered funds to Trigosul's directors so that the directors would deliver them to Trigosul.*\n\n*c) The Company and its directors recognize Italba Corp. as shareholder.*\n\n***According to the instructions received,** the Contributions for future paid-in capital were made by Italba Corp., who is the one that has financed Trigosul's operations from its inception to date.\"*174 (Emphasis added)\n\nReport of Dr. Luis Lapique, 12 May 2017, pages 2 and 7.\n\n240.\n\nThe foregoing was confirmed by the Claimant itself in its Post-Hearing Brief. When commenting on Uruguay's criticism of Dr. Lapique's report, it stated that \"[t]his is a bizarre criticism to make of an expert witness who, by definition, *ought not* to have firsthand knowledge of the facts\" (italics in the original).175\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, page 16, footnote 60.\n\n241.\n\nNor is there any evidence on record (a check, a wire transfer or another commercial instrument) in support of the assertion that Italba contributed the \"overwhelming majority\" of Trigosul's share capital. The truth is that there is no record of any capital contribution from Italba to Trigosul.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, on the basis of the capital contribution criterion, Italba cannot be said to be a shareholder of Trigosul.\n\n243.\n\nAs indicated in paragraph 213, the Tribunal shall now proceed to analyze Italba's arguments on the ownership of the share certificates of Trigosul, in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimant alleged that, since Dr. Alberelli was in Florida when he endorsed Trigosul's shares on 15 August 2002, such transfer is governed by Florida law.176 As stated in paragraph 213, the Tribunal considers that there is no sufficient evidential basis to assert that the endorsement was actually made in Florida, and that, as a consequence, the applicable law is that of the endorser's domicile. The only evidence on record on this matter are the statements made by Dr. Alberelli and his wife.177\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 75; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 27.\n\nStatement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 17; Statement of Ms. Beatriz Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 6.\n\n245.\n\nThe second criterion put forward by the Claimant in support of its argument that Florida law should apply to this case is based on Article 30 of the Treaty, which refers to the applicable rules of international law. In relation to this criterion, Italba cited Article 2398 of the Civil Code of Uruguay, which provides that \"[a]ssets, whatever their nature, are exclusively governed by the law of the place where they are, in terms of their quality, their possession, their absolute or relative transfer, and all *in rem* relationships to which they may be subject.\"178 [Tribunal's Translation]\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 76-78.\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimant submitted: \"Here, the share certificates of Trigosul were located in Florida and the act that transferred ownership of those shares from Dr. Alberelli to Italba occurred in Florida. Thus, Florida law governs Trigosul's ownership.\"179 In addition, based on the law of that State, Italba reiterated that Dr. Alberelli endorsed the bundle of all of Trigosul's stock certificates and deposited them in a safety deposit box, where he typically kept key documents belonging to Italba, in his and his wife's name;180 according to Italba and Dr. Alberelli, the certificates were delivered to Italba, and, thus, the transfer was completed.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 78.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 79; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 27.\n\n247.\n\nItalba concluded that, \"[u]nder Florida law, a transfer of shares is complete when shares are \u2018delivered' to the transferee, *i.e.*, the transferee acquires possession of the stock certificates.\" In the footnote, it cited \"Fla. Stat. \u00a7 678.3011(1)(a) (1997) (C-220) (\"Delivery of a certificated security to a purchaser occurs when... the purchaser acquires possession of the security certificate.\"); *see also, e.g., Tanner v. Robinson*, 411 So. 2d 240, 242 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1982) (C-221) (\"transfer of a gift of stock effective upon actual or constructive delivery of the shares).\"181\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 79 and footnote 283\n\n248.\n\nIn *Tanner v. Robinson*, the District Court of Appeal of Florida stated: \"As such, we hold that an *inter vivos* transfer by gift of any interest in securities is accomplished by either actual or constructive delivery of the same, where donative intent is also present, and where acceptance by the donee may be presumed or is proven directly...\"182\n\n*Tanner v. Robinson*, 411 So. 2d 240, 242, Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1982, page 2, C-221.\n\n249.\n\nMr. Conti, expert for Uruguay, also made reference in his report to the requirements laid down by *Tanner v. Robinson* (delivery, intent and acceptance) although, to him, that case is governed by Florida case law rather than by Florida statute law183; furthermore, according to Mr. Conti, the requirements are \"simultaneous.\"184\n\n\"Alberelli's purported transfer of the Trigosul stock certificates by gift should not be governed under Chapter 678, which is intended to apply to purchases of stock. In my opinion, Florida common law should govern the validity of Alberelli's purported gift of Trigosul stock certificates to Italba\", Report of Mr. Louis T.M. Conti, 9 August 2017, page 12.\n\n\"The requirements for an *inter vivos* gift of corporate stock are simultaneous intent, delivery, and acceptance\", Report of Mr. Louis T.M. Conti, 9 August 2017, page 10-12. Transcript of the Hearing of 17 November 2017 (Day 5), 1283: 1-8.\n\n250.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, no intent to endorse all the share certificates from Trigosul to Italba has been shown. Clearly, the existence of such intent may not be assumed, as the only certificate allegedly endorsed is number 4. Such intent is not recorded in the company's books either. There is, furthermore, no evidence of the delivery of the shares and Italba's subsequent exercise of rights as a shareholder on the record; there is also nothing that shows Italba's exercise of its purported rights as a shareholder and owner of the shares represented by certificate 4, let alone those represented by the other certificates. As stated above, Italba was not shown to have participated in any Shareholders' Meeting or to have shared in Trigosul's profits or losses. Nor was the purported acceptance recorded in Trigosul's and Italba's books, it being merely supported by the statements made by Dr. Alberelli.\n\n251.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Italba referred to a case appended to Mr. Conti's Report (*Estate of Maxcy v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*), and assert that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \"... upheld the validity under Florida law of a gift of shares in a close corporation notwithstanding the U.S. Internal Revenue Service's argument that the gift had not been perfected by physical delivery.Where the government could raise no alternative theory of the donor's intent, the Court dismissed insistence on physical delivery as \u2018tokenism in which we do not think the courts of Florida would indulge' and found \u2018constructive' delivery sufficient.\"185\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 34; *Estate of Maxcy v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, 441 F.2d 192, 194 (5th Cir. 1971), LC-14.\n\n252.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the case cited by Italba refers to circumstances that are totally different from those of the present case. In *Estate of Maxcy*, the donor of the company's shares entered the donation of shares in the corporate records and reported it in its income tax returns; it also issued new share certificates and asked the company secretary to issue such certificates in the name of the donees. One of the certificates was not personally delivered to the donee but kept in a safety deposit box of the company; however, it was shown that the donee had access to the box, both in law and in fact. For these reasons, the Court in that case was able to establish, by reference to cogent evidence, the donor's intent and the acts it performed in order to express it. This Tribunal concludes that there is no such evidence in the present case.\n\n253.\n\nAs stated above (paragraph 213), the Tribunal is certain that this matter should be resolved in accordance with the laws of Uruguay, the only law applicable to this case. Nonetheless, in order to consider the entirety of the Claimant's arguments the Tribunal also analyzed the laws of the State of Florida and concluded that Italba was not the owner of Trigosul under either system of law. The Tribunal thus analyses in the following section Italba's allegation that it controls Trigosul.\n\n***b. Does Italba Corporation control Trigosul?***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe definition of \"investment\" in Article 1 of the Treaty refers to \"every asset that an investor owns or *controls*, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment\". (emphasis added) The term \"control\" is not defined in the Treaty. The omission of a definition for \"control\" accords with long-standing U.S. practice, reflecting the fact that determinations as to whether an investor controls an enterprise will involve factual situations that must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\n255.\n\nItalba argued, for the purposes of Article 1 of the Treaty, that it controls Trigosul and asserted, based on Messrs. Alberelli's and Herb\u00f3n's statements and the documents to be cited below, that: (a) it made business decisions for Trigosul; (b) \"contributed the vast majority of Trigosul's share capital\"; (c) funded Trigosul's operations; and (d) represented to third parties that it was the owner of Trigosul.186\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 34-37; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 8; Statement of Ms. Beatriz Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 5; Statement of Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 10.\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimant submitted several documents in support of its assertion that it made business decisions for Trigosul. The Tribunal addresses each of them and states its conclusion once it has reviewed them all:\n\n(a) Proposal for a Banking Communication Network of 6 January 1999.187 This document makes no reference to Trigosul; moreover, it is a proposal made by ETS and Italba Telecom S.A., and not by Italba Corporation.\n\n(b) \"Site Survey Report: Uruguay, Prime Wave Communication\" of 15 October 2001.188 The Report makes no reference to Trigosul or Italba.\n\n(c) Agreement with WorldStar Communications Corp. for the purpose of creating a Joint Venture for a Telecommunications Project in Uruguay of July 2009.189 This document makes no reference to Trigosul; it concerns a company referred to as Sumitel, which appears to have licenses in Uruguay.\n\n(d) Co-Investment Agreement Among Eastern Pacific Trust and Italba Corporation of 14 June 2002.190 It refers to Trigosul as a \"strategic partner,\" not as Italba's subsidiary; in addition, it makes reference to a project in Ecuador.\n\n(e) Joint Venture Terms Sheet between Phinder Technologies Inc. and Italba Corporation of 14 February 2007.191 It is a document concerning Latin America, Europe (Spain and Portugal) and Africa. It makes no reference to Trigosul or Uruguay.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 34; Proposal for a Banking Communication Network, 6 January 1999, C-006; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 34; Site Survey Report: Uruguay, 15 October 2001, C-165; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 34; Joint Venture Agreement for Telecommunications Project in Uruguay, July 2009, C-007; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 34; Co-Investment Agreement Among Eastern Pacific Trust and Italba Corporation, 14 June 2002, C-015.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 34; Joint Venture Terms Sheet Between Phinder Technologies Inc. and Italba Corporation, 14 February 2007, C-030; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 20.\n\n257.\n\nItalba also claimed to have sought out potential joint ventures \"...that would allow it to realize the full value of its investment in Trigosul\"; Italba \"... acted as the negotiating and contracting party, and its contribution to the joint venture partnerships included the use of Trigosul's license\u2014which Italba was able to contribute because it owned Trigosul.\"192 To such effect, Italba made reference to the following businesses:\n\n(a) Negotiations with Eastern Pacific Trust: letter of intent of 3 February 2002 and Co-Investment Agreement of 14 June 2002 (cited in paragraph 256 (d) above).193 Regarding the letter of intent, the Tribunal notes that it is not signed and mentions Trigosul only once. Furthermore, it is addressed to Italba Telecommunications Group, not Italba Corporation. The Claimant also submitted the statement of Mr. Alan Cherp, director of InterAmerican Telco Systems. He told the Tribunal that he had met Dr. Alberelli in 2002, at a telecommunications event where they discussed business in Uruguay through Trigosul, Italba's subsidiary.194\n\n(b) Negotiations with a representative of Brasil Telecom on the possibility of creating a joint venture involving a U.S.-based investment group named Starborn.195 There is no evidence of this negotiation in the case record.\n\n(c) Potential deal with ANTEL (Uruguay's state-owned telecommunications company). The only evidence of this \"potential deal\" is to be found in the statements of Messrs. Alberelli and Herb\u00f3n.196 The Tribunal cannot, based on these statements alone, deem the alleged control of Italba over Trigosul to be proven.\n\n(d) Negotiations with Phinder Technologies Inc. (a Canadian telecommunications company), in order to execute a Joint Venture for the creation of Zupintra Panam\u00e1 S.A.197 Italba submitted several documents: (i) Italba Corporation's \"Project Structure\" of 21 January 2007,198 whereby the scope of the project includes Central America, South America, and parts of Europe and Africa. The Tribunal finds no reference to Trigosul's license in Uruguay there; (ii) \"Joint Venture Terms Sheet between Phinder Technologies Inc. and Italba Corporation\" of February 2007.199 The document indicates that Italba shall contribute the telecom licenses in the target countries (located in Latin America, Europe (Spain and Portugal) and Africa); based on the contents of the document, the Tribunal cannot conclude that it would include Trigosul's license; (iii) \"Shareholders' Agreement\" between Phinder Technologies Inc. and Italba Corporation of March 2007.200 The document is a draft with handwritten notes, which is not signed and makes no reference to Trigosul; (iv) \"Joint Venture Terms Sheet between Phinder Technologies Inc. and Italba Corporation\" dated 14 February 2007201 (discussed in paragraph 256 (e) above); (v) Certificate of Incorporation of Zupintra dated 8 March 2007.202 This document indicates that Dr. Alberelli appeared before a public notary in order to constitute such corporation in his individual capacity; the document makes no reference to Italba or Trigosul; (vi) Press release entitled \"Zupintra Communications Inc. forms Joint Venture with Italba Corporation\" of 19 March (year not specified).203 It refers to telecommunications opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean, but says nothing about Trigosul; (vii) News report entitled \"Zupintra, Italba create telecoms JV\" of 19 March 2007.204 This news report deals with the association of the two companies mentioned to do business in Latin America and the Caribbean; it makes no reference to Trigosul; (viii) E-mails of 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10 May 2007, and 6, 7, 11 and 12 June 2007.205 Such communications mostly refer to business in Argentina, while some of them deal with the expansion to Uruguay; nonetheless, they make no reference to Trigosul. In their statements, Mr. Christopher G. Hall, Chief Operating Officer of Phinder Technologies Inc., and Mr. John Alexander van Arem, President and Chief Executive Officer thereof, asserted that Trigosul was Italba's subsidiary.206 The Tribunal considers that such statements do not correspond to the contents of the documents submitted and analyzed in this paragraph.\n\n(e) Negotiations with Telmex Uruguay (Telstar S.A.).207 Italba submitted the following documents: Intention and Confidentiality Agreement of 21 June 2007;208 and five e-mails exchanged in December 2007, March 2008, and March and November 2009.209 Both the Agreement and the communications refer to Trigosul only; none of them mentions Italba, which is why it cannot be inferred that Italba was negotiating for Trigosul.\n\n(f) Negotiations with Dr. Fernando Garc\u00eda:210 Italba submitted a letter from Dr. Garc\u00eda to Dr. Alberelli of 4 October 2010, and the Data Transmission and Computer Equipment Trial Loan Contract of December 2010.211 Regardless of the authenticity of Dr. Garc\u00eda's signature, which was questioned, neither of the documents indicates that the negotiation was conducted by Italba or that Italba acted for Trigosul.\n\n(g) Negotiations with DirecTV: The Claimant submitted two e-mails exchanged by Mr. Mart\u00edn Colombo and Dr. Alberelli on 17 March 2011.212 These communications make no reference to Italba such that it would permit an inference to be drawn that Dr. Alberelli was acting for Italba or that Italba was owned or controlled Trigosul.\n\n(h) Negotiation with Grupo Afinidad Mary in order to offer various services to the community of 2,100 retirees: The Claimant submitted a document entitled \"Projection of Income, Investments, and Costs\" (undated and unsigned),213 and a letter from Mr. Richard G. Weber to Dr. Alberelli of 1 May 2012.214 These documents only make reference to Trigosul, not Italba, so that it is impossible to determine who started the alleged negotiation.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 34; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 11-20.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 22-29; Letter from de A.

Weber to Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 1 May 2012, C-065.\n\n258.\n\nThe documents and statements mentioned above cannot support a conclusion that Italba communicated or represented to the interested parties that it was negotiating contracts for its purported subsidiary, Trigosul, or that it controlled it. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that some of the witness statements submitted by Italba are inconsistent with the contents of the documentary evidence filed by that Party.\n\n259.\n\nBy virtue of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to prove that it made business decisions for Trigosul.\n\n260.\n\nAs to Italba's alleged capital contributions to Trigosul, the Claimant submitted the following documents:\n\n(a) Italba's Commercial Checking Bank Account Statement (from 1 to 28 February 2001).215 By means of this document, Italba purported to prove that it wired USD 35,000 to Trigosul as a reimbursement of expenses. The Tribunal notes that the transfer was made by the Claimant to Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n, and that, in footnote 159 of its Reply Memorial, Italba stated: \"The wire transfer was made to Luis Herb\u00f3n's account at Indumex, a Uruguayan financial services company that facilitates international money transfers.\" The purpose of such transfer is not mentioned in the case record, and the Claimant has submitted no evidence that it was actually a capital contribution from Italba to Trigosul.\n\n(b) Contribution of 632,674 Uruguayan pesos that Trigosul paid to DNC as an advance on the first two years of fees for Trigosul's operation in the spectrum.216 The Tribunal has confirmed that Trigosul's accounting book called \"Diary\" makes reference to such amount, but there is no record whatsoever of the source of the contribution necessary to enable Trigosul to make the relevant payment to DNC.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 35; Italba's Commercial Checking Bank Account Statement, 1 February - 28 February 2001, C-166; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 16; Statement of Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 14; Trigosul's Diary, C-167.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 35; Trigosul's Diary, C-167, and Trigosul's Book of Shareholders and Directors Meetings, C164; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 16; Statement of Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 14.\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Italba has submitted no evidence that it made capital contributions to Trigosul.\n\n262.\n\nItalba's third argument is that it funded Trigosul's operations. Accordingly, Italba submitted the following documents on three issues: purchase of equipment, drawing checks, and purchase of bonds:\n\n(a) Equipment: fax to Italba Group (to the attention of Mr. Albert Jansenson) from Mr. Daniel V. de los Santos of L-3 Communications of 8 May 2001; Quotation No. 2501 from Wavelynx International Inc. of 11 January 2000; \"Seller's Agreement\" between Italba Corporation and Wavelynx International Inc. of 27 February 2000; and Invoice No. 107 from StarMesh Technologies to Italba of 12 June 2007217 (according to Italba, the equipment was approved by URSEC).218 The fax includes a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which mentions Trigosul as a subsidiary of Italba, but neither the fax nor the MOU were signed. The quotation refers to equipment for Italba, but it was not shown that Italba purchased such equipment for Trigosul. The \"Seller's Agreement\" makes no reference to Trigosul. Invoice No. 107 indicates that the equipment would be shipped to Miami; there is no evidence of its subsequent shipping to Trigosul. Although Italba stated that such equipment was later approved by URSEC, the Tribunal reviewed the approval submitted, which includes neither a list, nor a description of the equipment, and, thus, does not confirm that it is the same equipment as that mentioned by the Claimant. Italba also cited UMDN-URSEC Resolution of 10 September 2002, which approved the payment for Trigosul's equipment, purchased by Italba.219 Such resolution concerns a settlement agreement reached before the \"*Juzgado de Conciliaci\u00f3n del 2do Turno*\", between Trigosul, the Uruguay Ministry of Defense and URSEC (due to the change of frequencies by means of Decree 282/2000 (see paragraphs 85 and 88 above)). As explained above, Trigosul alleged that, in view of the frequencies it had been allocated prior to such Decree, it purchased equipment it would not be able to use with the new frequencies. A line of the Resolution reads \"ITALBA invoice for the purchase of radios: US $25,964.\" The Tribunal cannot interpret this mere reference to Italba as evidence of a contribution from Italba to Trigosul through delivery of equipment.\n\n(b) Writing of checks: Italba alleges that it regularly drew checks to cover Trigosul's expenses; in support of such assertion, it submitted two checks (dated 7 June 2005 and 13 May 2006 respectively).220 It also made reference to the accounting books of Trigosul where the cash allegedly contributed by Italba would be recorded as \"contribution by directors.\"221 One of the checks mentioned by Italba was drawn to \"Cash\", while the other was drawn in favor of Dr. Alberelli. No relationship between Italba and Trigosul may be derived from such evidence. As to accounting records, the Tribunal cannot construe the expression \"contribution by directors\" as a contribution made by Italba; that would be an unfounded and forced interpretation of the text.\n\n(c) Bonds: Italba contends that, in April 2004, it gave Mr. Herb\u00f3n approximately USD 25,000 to purchase Uruguayan bonds,222 and that, two years later, on Italba's instructions, Mr. Herb\u00f3n sold those bonds and used the money to cover Trigosul's expenses. The Tribunal notes that the two checks mentioned by Italba were written in favor of persons other than Trigosul, and that the only relevant note in Trigosul's Breakdown of Transactions reads \"contribution by directors\" but does not state that the contributions were made by Italba. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot accept that the Claimant has proven that the money related to the checks and bonds was a contribution from Italba to Trigosul. Rather, the evidence mentioned in this paragraph establishes that Dr. Alberelli covered Trigosul's expenses.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 36; Fax from D. Los Santos to A. Jansenson, 8 May 2001, C-168; Quotation No. 2501 from Wavelynx International, Inc., 11 January 2000, C-159; Seller's Agreement between Italba Corporation and Wavelynx International Inc., 27 February 2000, C-160; and Invoice No. 107 from StarMesh Technologies, 12 June 2007, C-169.\n\nCertificate of Approval, 29 June 2007, C-170.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 36; UMDN-URSEC Resolution, 10 September 2002, C-171.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 36; Check of 7 June 2005, C-173, and Check of 13 May 2006, C-174.\n\nTrigosul's Breakdown of Transactions, from1 December 2001 to 30 November 2006, C-175; and Diary of Accounting Records from 1 December 2007 to 30 November 2015, C-176.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 36; Check of 27 April 2004, C-177; Check of 27 April 2004, C-178, Receipt for Purchase of Bonds, 29 April 2004, C-179, Receipts for Sale of Bonds, 18 August 2016 and 30 November 2016, C-180, and Trigosul's Breakdown of Transactions from 1 December 2001 to 30 November 2006, C-175; Statement of Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 15; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, \u00b6 19.\n\n263.\n\nThe evidence submitted by the Claimant having been carefully examined, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence on the record to conclude that Italba was actually controlling Trigosul.\n\n264.\n\nThe Claimant cited several ICSID awards in support of its argument that, in order to analyze the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the notion of control over a company is flexible and broad, rather than strict. The Tribunal considers that, given that there is no evidence of Italba's control over Trigosul in any of the areas mentioned by Italba (negotiation of contracts, capital contributions, and funding of transactions), the discussion and analysis of such awards, though very interesting, would be futile for the purposes of this Award.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal having thoroughly analyzed the Parties' positions and the evidence on which they relied in support thereof, on the basis of the statements made by the Parties and the evidence on record, the next section contains a summary of the Tribunal's findings.\n\n**(3)The Tribunal's Findings**\n------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nIn preparation for the investment to be made in Uruguay, Dr. Alberelli acquired a company which had already been incorporated and which was then named Trigosul (according to Dr. Alberelli, although the first six certificates are dated 1996, he actually acquired Trigosul in 1999). Trigosul's new shareholders (Dr. Alberelli and his mother, Ms. Carmela Caravetta) appointed Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n as Chairman of the Board of Directors (see paragraphs 76, 78 and 79 of this Award; Book of Shareholders and Directors Meetings, page 3, C-164).\n\n267.\n\nIn January 1997, the MDN authorized Dr. Alberelli to provide wireless services in Uruguay (see paragraph 81 above).\n\n268.\n\nIn August 1997, the DNC allocated to Dr. Alberelli the radio channels of some frequencies (see paragraph 82 above).\n\n269.\n\nIn February 2000, and in response to Dr. Alberelli's request to the DNC, the MDN transferred to Trigosul the authorization granted to Dr. Alberelli (paragraph 84 above).\n\n270.\n\nThe Treaty between the United States of America and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment was entered into on 4 November 2005 and came into force on 1 November 2006 (see paragraph 94 above).\n\n271.\n\nOn account of Trigosul's various problems with the Uruguayan telecommunications authorities, in February 2016, Italba filed this claim for arbitration against Uruguay before ICSID (see paragraph 6 above).\n\n272.\n\nDr. Alberelli cannot be considered as an investor under the ICSID Convention or this Treaty as he is a national of Italy, not the United States, which is a fundamental requirement to enjoy the protection of the Treaty. Trigosul being a Uruguayan company, could not qualify as an investor either in the circumstances of this case (see paragraphs 75 and 76 above).\n\n273.\n\nThe Claimant has asserted that Italba Corporation, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida, United States of America, is a qualified investor under the ICSID Convention and the Treaty. However, Trigosul's corporate documents contain no indication that Italba was a shareholder of Trigosul.\n\n274.\n\nItalba retained Dr. Luis Lapique, who issued a report admitting that a detailed analysis of Trigosul's different corporate books and the content of their records, as well as the shares issued by Trigosul,\" evidenced that \"[s]ome records have not been kept and certain shares have not been issued,\" and..[r]ecords have been kept incorrectly and shares have been issued incorrectly.\" Nevertheless, Dr. Lapique, in support of the hypothesis that Italba owned Trigosul, contended that, in \"...closely held corporations, there are cases in which the corporate books and records are relegated to second place and formalities are not observed.\"223\n\nDr. Luis Lapique' Report, 12 May 2017, page 5.\n\n275.\n\nUnable to find support in Trigosul's accounting books and records, the Claimant purported to show that Italba was the owner of Trigosul by means of Trigosul's share certificates.\n\n276.\n\nGiven that only one of Trigosul's share certificates (number 4) was endorsed in favor of Italba, the Claimant asserted the theory that the endorsement of one certificate entailed the endorsement of all others (see paragraph 169 above).\n\n277.\n\nIn order to show that he had delivered the share certificates to Italba, Dr. Alberelli asserted that the transfer occurred when he placed all the certificates of Trigosul in a safety deposit box where, in his own words, he and his wife would keep Italba's documents (see paragraph 169 above). The Claimant thus purported to meet the second fundamental requirement to complete the transfer of Trigosul's share certificates.\n\n278.\n\nAs the Tribunal has noted at paragraph 226 above, the Claimant sought to explain the failure to record the share transfer on the basis of Dr. Lapique's opinion that, in closely held corporations, corporate records were often relegated to second place, and that, in this particular case, such defects were due to \"the lack of knowledge of the legal or accounting advisors of the company.\"224\n\n*Id.*\n\n279.\n\nThis assertion is difficult to accept, as Dr. Alberelli was an experienced businessman, who, moreover, relied on the services of Mr. Herb\u00f3n, a national of Uruguay, who was a Certified Public Accountant with experience in running his own and third-party businesses.225\n\nStatement of Mr. Luis Herb\u00f3n, 16 September 2016, \u00b6 5.\n\n280.\n\nThe transfer of Trigosul's shares (by means of certificate number 4) from Dr. Alberelli to Italba was never made as it did not satisfy the requirements set forth in Article 305 of the Commercial Companies Act.226 It follows that this could not have resulted in the transfer of the other share certificates of Trigosul either, which were not even endorsed to Italba.\n\nCommercial Companies Act of 4 September 1989, Article 305, C-222 and EXM-006.\n\n281.\n\nItalba asserted (based on the report of its expert, Dr. Lapique) that what matters is not form (notwithstanding the express provisions of the laws of Uruguay), but \"economic reality.\" In support of this theory, it relied upon Article 189 of the Commercial Companies Act (see paragraph 227 above), which, in cases of fraud and violation of public order (*e.g.*, tax evasion), provides that legal personality may be disregarded (known as \"piercing the corporate veil\" in other legal systems) so as to determine who actually owns the shares. Pursuant to this Article, the Claimant contended that Italba was the true owner of Trigosul's shares. The Claimant's argument cannot be accepted, as the legal basis on which it relies (Article 189 of the Commercial Companies Act) regulates legal situations other than those of this case, and, thus, does not apply here. Furthermore, this argument is contrary to the Claimant's contention in paragraph 97 of its Reply Memorial that the corporate veil should not be pierced (see paragraph 179 above).\n\n282.\n\nNo matter how much the corporate veil could be pierced or Trigosul's legal personality be disregarded, the truth is that Dr. Alberelli and his family still appeared as the sole owners of Trigosul's shares.\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimant then purported to assert that Italba had provided Trigosul with the funds necessary for its operation (see paragraph 226 above). This argument failed because it was unsupported by any cogent evidence. Instead, the evidence submitted by Italba rather confirmed that it was Dr. Alberelli who had made the capital contributions necessary for Trigosul's operation.\n\n284.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimant argued that it controlled Trigosul even if the Tribunal were to find that it did not own it. For such purposes, Italba submitted letters and other documents, most of which were inapposite or concerned different situations. This evidence simply confirmed that it was Dr. Alberelli who controlled Trigosul and not Italba.\n\n285.\n\nGiven its finding that Italba neither owns, nor controls Trigosul, for the purposes of Articles 1 and 24 of the Treaty and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal declares that it has no jurisdiction to settle the dispute between Italba Corporation and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay and it so states in the *dispositif*.\n\n286.\n\nAs the Tribunal has upheld the Respondent's first objection on jurisdiction, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to rule upon the other jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. Claimant's Cost Submissions**\n----------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nIn its submissions on costs, the Claimant argues that the Respondent should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings. The Claimant's total costs and expenses incurred in connection with this arbitration amount to USD 8,923,882.28227 and are broken down as follows: (a) USD 7,424,562.89 in respect of Italba's counsel fees and expenses, (b) USD 1,022,151.67 in respect of experts' fees and expenses, (c) USD 2,167.72 in respect of representatives' and witnesses' expenses, (d) the ICSID lodging fee of USD 25,000, and (e) USD 450,000 in respect of advances towards the Tribunal's fees and expenses and ICSID's administrative fees. In addition, the Claimant seeks compound interest on any damages and costs calculated annually at a commercial rate from the date of the Award until the date of payment by Uruguay.228\n\nItalba's Submission on Costs.\n\nItalba's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 31.\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimant argues that an award on costs to the Claimant is \"uniquely appropriate\" in this case because Italba was forced to assert its rights under the Treaty only as a result of Uruguay's failure to comply with the \"*Tribunal de lo Contencioso Administrativo*\" judgment, destroying the value of Italba's investment in breach of the Treaty.229 Furthermore, Uruguay's abusive conduct in the context of this dispute \"greatly aggravated the harm inflicted by Uruguay's breaches of the Treaty as well as the costs of this arbitration.\"230\n\nItalba's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 18.\n\nItalba's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 20. Italba's letter dated 10 August 2018.\n\n**B. Respondent's Cost Submissions**\n------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nIn its submissions on costs, the Respondent submits that the Claimant should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings. The Respondent's total costs and expenses incurred in connection with this arbitration amount to USD 6,002,836.75,231 and are broken down as follows: (a) USD 4,151,031.90 in respect of Uruguay's counsel's fees, (b) USD 1,401,804.85 in respect of experts' fees and expenses, and administrative expenses, and (d) USD 450,000 in respect of advances toward the Tribunal's fees and expenses, and ICSID's administrative fees. In addition, the Respondent seeks the Tribunal to order the Claimant to pay interest at the LIBOR rate applicable to one-year deposits in U.S. dollars in effect on the date on which the Award is issued, plus 4%, accruing 60 days after the Parties are served notice of the Award, compounded semi-annually.232\n\nUruguay's Letter dated 7 November 2018.\n\nUruguay's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 49; and Uruguay's Letter dated 7 November 2018.\n\n290.\n\nThe Respondent argues that an award on costs to Uruguay is justified in this case because (a) Italba claimed the existence of jurisdiction without having legal standing to do so,233 (b) Italba presented frivolous claims as to jurisdiction, merits and damages,234 and (c) throughout these proceedings, Italba has acted in bad faith to interfere with the arbitral process, using \"forged and suspect documents as supposed evidence in support of its arguments\" in a \"deliberate attempt to obscure the facts and mislead the Tribunal.\"235\n\nUruguay's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 26.\n\nUruguay's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 28-36.\n\nUruguay's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 40.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nBoth Parties to this arbitration agree that the \"loser pays\" principle (referred to also as \"costs follow the event\") should guide the allocation of costs in this arbitration. Each Party has requested the Tribunal to order that the unsuccessful party reimburse to the successful party its costs in connection with these proceedings, including the advances made to ICSID for the Centre's charges and the fees and expenses of the arbitrators.236\n\nUruguay's Submission on Costs \u00b6 3.\n\n292.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):237\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses\n\nMr. Rodrigo Oreamuno USD 227,392.65\n\nMr. John Beechey USD 84,515.74\n\nProf. Zachary Douglas USD 73,090.67\n\nICSID's administrative fees USD 106,000.00\n\nDirect expenses USD 174,015.77\n\n**Total** **USD 665,014.83**\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account.\n\n293.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.238 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of the arbitration amounts to USD 332,507.42.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n294.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n295.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration between the Parties, including by ordering the losing Party to bear in full the costs of the arbitration and the legal fees and expenses incurred by both Parties.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that it has no jurisdiction over Italba's claims because the Claimant has failed to prove that Italba owns or controls Trigosul.239 As explained above, Dr. Alberelli's endorsement of Trigosul's share certificates in favor of Italba was not in conformity with the applicable legal requirements and, therefore, failed to produce effects concerning Trigosul or third parties.240 Moreover, no evidence was adduced that Italba shared in Trigosul's profits or losses, that Italba was overseeing the management of Trigosul's business, or that Italba exercised the rights that would have been available to it if it had actually been a shareholder of Trigosul.241 Finally, the Claimant failed to prove that Italba communicated or represented to interested parties that it was negotiating contracts for Trigosul or that it controlled it.242\n\nSee supra \u00b6 285.\n\nSee supra \u00b6\u00b6 212-222.\n\nSee supra \u00b6\u00b6 234-235.\n\nSee supra \u00b6\u00b6 241, 257.\n\n297.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal finds that the application of the \u2018loser pays' principle is appropriate. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant shall bear its legal fees and expenses in full, as well as the costs of the arbitration. The Claimant shall also reimburse the Respondent's legal and expert fees and expenses in the amounts requested,243 which the Tribunal finds to be reasonable in view of the Claimant's costs, the duration of the proceeding and the complexity of the issues addressed, regarding not only jurisdiction but also merits and quantum.\n\nUruguay's Submission on Costs.\n\n298.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent the amount of USD 332,507.42 for the expended portion of Uruguay's advances to ICSID and USD 5,552,836.75 to cover Uruguay's legal and expert fees and administrative expenses.\n\n299.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent has requested that it be granted interest on any costs awarded to it. Having considered the circumstances of this arbitration proceeding and the evidence adduced by the Parties, the Tribunal has not found sufficient basis to grant interest on the costs awarded to the Respondent. Accordingly, the Respondent's request for interest on costs is denied.\n\n**VIIl. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n300.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides:\n\n(a) To uphold the objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction raised by the Oriental Republic of Uruguay on the grounds that Italba Corporation neither owns nor controls Trigosul S.A., such that Italba Corporation is not an investor for the purposes of Articles 1 and 24 of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(b) To declare that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to settle the dispute.\n\n(c) To reject the Claimant's request that the Tribunal disregard the expert report of Professor Eugenio Xavier de Mello Ferrand.\n\n(d) To order the Claimant to pay to the Respondent the entirety of the costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, as well as the Respondent's legal and expert fees and expenses incurred in connection with this arbitration, assessed in the amount of USD 5,885,344.17.\n\n(e) All other requests for relief are dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Gabriel Bottini", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2019-10-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Gabriel Bottini\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. OVERVIEW**\n---------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Decision resolves the Applicant\u2019s proposal for disqualification of *ad hoc* Committee Member Mr. Gabriel Bottini pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **\"ICSID Convention\")** and Articles 9 and 53 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **\"Arbitration Rules\"****).**\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n2.\n\nOn 2 July 2019, Italba Corporation (the **\"Applicant\"** or **\"Italba\")** filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** an application for annulment of the Award rendered on 22 March 2019 in *Italba Corporation* v. *the Oriental Republic of Uruguay* (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/9) (the **\"Award\"),** accompanied by annexes 1 through 3 (the **\"Annulment Application\").** The Annulment Application included a request for stay of enforcement of the Award pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules. The Applicant requested the provisional stay of the enforcement of the Award, and that the stay be maintained until a decision in that respect could be rendered by the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n3.\n\nOn 10 July 2019, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Annulment Application and notified the Applicant and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (the **\"Respondent,\"** the **\"State,\"** or **\"Uruguay\")** (and together with the Applicant, the **\"Parties\")** that enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n4.\n\nOn 11 July 2019, Respondent notified ICSID of the names of the individuals and legal advisers authorized to act on its behalf in the Annulment proceedings.\n\n5.\n\nOn 1 August 2019, the Secretary-General notified the parties of its intention to propose to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council the appointment to the *ad hoc* Committee of Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, a national of the Kingdom of Spain, as President of the *ad hoc* Committee, Prof. M\u00f3nica Pinto, a national of the Argentine Republic, and Mr. Gabriel Bottini, a national of the Argentine Republic, as Committee Members.\n\n6.\n\nAfter an exchange of correspondence between the parties and the Secretariat,1 the *ad hoc* Committee (the **\"Committee\")** was constituted on 27 August 2019, in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. All members were appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council. In its letter of 27 August 2019, the Secretariat informed the parties of the Committee\u2019s appointment, that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have commenced in accordance with Rules 6 and 53 of the Arbitration Rules, and that Ms. Celeste E. Salinas Quero, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n*See* the Parties\u2019 communications of 8 August 2019 and the Centre\u2019s conununications of 16 and 19 August 2019.\n\n7.\n\nOn 13 September 2019, Italba submitted a Proposal for Disqualification of *ad hoc* Committee Member Mr. Gabriel Bottini (the **\"Proposal\").** On the same date, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Applicant\u2019s Proposal and informed the parties of the suspension of the proceedings until a decision on the Proposal has been taken in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 9(6) and 53.\n\n8.\n\nOn 16 September 2019, the unchallenged Committee Members, through ICSID, notified the parties of the procedural calendar to provide observations on Italba\u2019s Proposal.\n\n9.\n\nOn 23 September 2019, Respondent submitted a Reply to the Proposal (the **\"Reply\").**\n\n10.\n\nOn 30 September 2019, Mr. Gabriel Bottini submitted explanations on the Proposal (the **\"Explanations\")**\n\n11.\n\nOn 7 October 2019, the parties simultaneously submitted observations on the Explanations (the **\"Additional Observations\").**\n\n**III. THE PROPOSAL FOR DISQUALIFICATION**\n------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe following sections summarize the parties\u2019 arguments on the Proposal and the Explanations furnished by Mr. Bottini.2\n\nMr. Bottini furnished his Explanations in Spanish.\n\n***(1) The Applicant\u2019s position***\n----------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the conduct displayed by Mr. Bottini following a prior disqualification proposal made in another case shows his lack of candor, which is inconsistent with the qualifications required by Article 14 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n14.\n\nThe Applicant refers to the disqualification proposed by the claimant in *Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Europe* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13) **(\"Saint-Gobain\"),** which the Applicant maintains was rejected on reliance of Mr. Bottini\u2019s representations that he (i) had left the Argentine government service; (ii) was no longer acting for Argentina; and (iii) would inform the parties and the Tribunal if those circumstances changed (the **\"Disqualification Decision\").** Italba contends that only after the Disqualification Decision was made, Mr. Bottini disclosed his true role as Argentina\u2019s advisor *and advocate* in other cases.3\n\nProposal, p. 1.\n\n15.\n\nThe Applicant explains that the claimant in *Saint-Gobain* proposed to disqualify Mr. Bottini on the basis, in part, that his role as Argentina\u2019s advisor and counsel in investment disputes made him unsuitable to render independent and impartial decisions on issues very similar to those that he had argued as counsel. The Applicant notes that in rejecting the proposal, the unchallenged arbitrators in *Saint-Gobain* stated that they *\"ha[d] no present information that Mr. Bottini currently is advocating for or advising Argentina in any way [...]\"4* and requested Mr. Bottini to complete a new declaration under Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.5\n\nProposal, p. 1. citing *Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Europe* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13). Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Gabriel Bottini from the Tribunal under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. 27 February 2013 **(\"Disqualification Decision\"),** \u00b6 85.\n\nProposal, p. 1.\n\n16.\n\nThe Applicant notes that the Disqualification Decision was made on 27 February 2013. Two days later, on 1 March 2013, Mr. Bottini disclosed that Argentina had asked him to give advice on issues of international law. After the claimant requested further clarifications, Mr. Bottini admitted that his advice to Argentina included advocacy; that before the Disqualification Decision was issued he had been asked to act as lead counsel in the case *Impregilo S.p.A.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17) **(\"Impregilo\");** and since then, he had been asked to perform advocacy work in other hearings involving Argentina. Following further inquiries from the claimant, Mr. Bottini admitted that he was receiving a monthly fee for his advice to Argentina.6\n\nProposal, p. 2.\n\n17.\n\nThe Applicant also points to Mr. Bottini\u2019s CV, indicating that he was external adviser to Argentina at least until March 2016; and refers to published awards showing that he acted as lead advocate in cases involving Argentina.7\n\nProposal, p. 3.\n\n18.\n\nThe Applicant contends that Mr. Bottini\u2019s Explanations in this case show that he *\"tactically delayed disclosure of facts plainly material to the* [Saint-Gobain] *challenge,\"* and allowed the *Saint-Gobain* challenge to be decided in ignorance of his true role. Such conduct justifies the Applicant\u2019s reasonable doubt as to whether it will receive fair and independent treatment from Mr. Bottini.8\n\nApplicant\u2019s Additional Observations, pp. 1-3.\n\n19.\n\nThe Applicant points out that in his Explanations Mr. Bottini admits that:\n\n- by the time the Disqualification Decision was made on 27 February 2013, Argentina had already in early February 2013 asked him to provide advice, in circumstances that the Disqualification Decision was explicitly made based on the incorrect understanding that Mr. Bottini might provide future advice to Argentina.9\n\n- he disclosed in April 2013, *i.e.* after the Disqualification Decision, that, since early February 2013, *i.e.* before the Disqualification Decision, he had been engaged as advocate for Argentina in *Impregilo.*\n\n- he disclosed in June 2013 that he was receiving a monthly retainer from Argentina.10\n\nApplicant\u2019s Additional Observations, p. 1.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Additional Observations, pp. 1, 2.\n\n20.\n\nThe Applicant disagrees with Mr. Bottini\u2019s Explanations that his disclosure of March 2013 simply confirmed the provision of services which he had expressly announced in his explanations of December 2012. According to the Applicant, Mr. Bottini admitted that he had been advocating for or advising Argentina only after the Disqualification Decision was made.11\n\nApplicant\u2019s Additional Observations, p. 3, citing Mr. Bottini\u2019s Explanations.\n\n21.\n\nThe Applicant also disagrees with the Explanations in that the claimant in *Saint-Gobain* must have understood that the role of advisor can include that of presenting arguments at hearings. The Applicant considers that Mr. Bottini used deliberately vague language in the disclosures, and notes that while an advisor may well be an advocate also, one does not imply the other.12\n\nApplicant's Additional Observations, p. 3.\n\n22.\n\nThe Applicant further contends that the fact that the claimant in *Saint-Gobain* did not bring a renewed challenge is immaterial to the present Proposal. The Tribunal in *Saint-Gobain* was on notice of Mr. Bottini\u2019s associations with Argentina, and the award was subject to annulment proceedings. Here, however, the *ad-hoc* Committee\u2019s annulment decision will not be subject to review. Therefore, the Applicant argues, conflicts should be policed even more carefully.\n\n23.\n\nThe Applicant, thus, proposes to disqualify Mr. Bottini pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and Articles 9 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Alternatively, Mr. Bottini should resign and allow the Secretary-General to appoint a replacement.13\n\nApplicant\u2019s Additional Observations\n\n***(2) The Respondent\u2019s position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Applicant fails to present any facts indicating Mr. Bottini\u2019s manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14 of the ICSID Convention, thereby, failing to meet the standard of Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. The Proposal, the Respondent argues, is based on the subjective opinion of the Applicant\u2019s counsel, said to be derived from his counsel\u2019s \"direct personal experience,\" in mounting an unsuccessful challenge to Mr. Bottini in *Saint-Gobain.*14\n\nReply, pp. 1. 2.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent indicates that the unchallenged arbitrators in *Saint-Gobain* rejected the challenge, finding that *\"Claimant ha[d] presented no facts which cast 'reasonable doubt\u2019 on Mr. Bottini\u2019s impartiality and independence, let alone facts which \u2018make it obvious and highly probable.*\u2019\"15 The Respondent notes that Mr. Bottini\u2019s subsequent disclosures were satisfactory to the arbitrators who requested them, as Mr. Bottini continued to serve on the Tribunal, which ultimately ruled in claimant\u2019s favor.\n\nReply, p. 2. citing *Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Europe* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13), Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Gabriel Bottini from the Tribunal under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. 27 February 2013, \u00b6 78.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent ob serves that \"*Mr. Bottini is an experienced arbitrator who has served with distinction on numerous tribunals; and is unaware of any blemishes on his admirable record. It sees no grounds for his disqualification here.\"16*\n\nReply, p. 2.\n\n***(3) Mr. Bottini\u2019s Explanations***\n------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIn his Explanations, Mr. Bottini gives an account of the events transpired in the *Saint-Gobain* challenge, from the moment of his appointment as arbitrator on 4 October 2012, the fding of the proposal on 29 October 2012, going through the explanations he furnished and disclosures he made from December 2012, up to the Disqualification Decision, and those made after the Disqualification Decision, from March 2013 through August 2015.17\n\nExplanations, pp. 1-4.\n\n28.\n\nMr. Bottini explains that when the *Saint-Gobain* challenge was filed, he still was National Director of International Affairs and Disputes of Argentina\u2019s Treasury Attorney-General\u2019s Office; a position he left in January 2013. Mr. Bottini asserts that in the explanations he furnished in *Saint-Gobain* on 11 December 2012, he clarified that once he resigned, he expected to *\"continue working as an independent advisor, assisting states, which may include Argentina, and investors, in cases unrelated to the dispute at issue here.\"* [Committee\u2019s translation]\n\n29.\n\nMr. Bottini indicates that on 21 December 2012, when the claimant in *Saint-Gobain* commented on his December 2012 explanations, the claimant pointed out that Mr. Bottini had confirmed that he would continue presenting arguments as advocate on behalf of Argentina. Mr. Bottini considers that from those comments it can be inferred that it was clear for the claimant that Mr. Bottini\u2019s role as advisor might include advocacy at hearings.\n\n30.\n\nFurther, Mr. Bottini explains that his disclosure of 1 March 2013 was made immediately after the lifting of the suspension in *Saint-Gobain,* to comply with the request made in the Disqualification Decision. In his March 2013 disclosure, he *\"confirm[ed] the provision of services [...] [he] had expressly announced was possible when furnishing explanations on 11 December 2012.*\"18 [Committee\u2019s translation]\n\nExplanations, p. 4.\n\n31.\n\nMr. Bottini indicates that, on 7 March 2013, when the claimant commented on his March 2013 disclosure, the claimant asked him to notify any new mandates from Argentina and reserved its right to file new objections against him; yet, the claimant did not criticize the content or timeliness of the March 2013 disclosure.19 Mr. Bottini notes that the claimant never requested a review of the Disqualification Decision or the annulment of the *Saint-Gobain* award.20\n\nExplanations, p. 4.\n\nExplanations, p. 6.\n\n32.\n\nMr. Bottini also explains, contrary to the Applicant\u2019s assertion, that since he resigned from his position as National Director, he has never been lead advocate in a hearing involving Argentina, including the annulment hearing in *Impregilo.*21 He also refers to the Applicant\u2019s assertion that only in April 2013 he admitted that Argentina had asked him to act in *Impregilo* before the Disqualification Decision was issued. However, Mr. Bottini explains that already in his March 1, 2013 declaration he confirmed (using past tense) that Argentina had requested his services, making specific reference to the circumstances announced in his December 2012 explanations.22\n\nExplanations, p. 5.\n\nExplanations, p. 5.\n\n33.\n\nMr. Bottini finally notes that when the Applicant objected to his appointment to this *ad hoc* Committee, it did not mention any alleged lack of candor, nor did the Applicant question his disclosures in other cases. The Applicant objected to the appointment of two Committee Members, one of them being Mr. Bottini, but expressly accepted the possibility that either one of them be appointed.23\n\nExplanations, p. 6.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n---------------------------------\n\n***(1) The legal standard***\n----------------------------\n\n34.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n*\"A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\"*\n\n35.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n*\"Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\"*\n\n36.\n\nIn accordance with these articles, the disqualification has to be based on \"any fact\" that shows a \"manifest lack\" of the qualities required to be eligible for an appointment as member of an *ad hoc* committee. Such qualities in turn relate to moral character, competence in the field of law, among others, and reliability to exercise independent judgment. Since the procedural languages of these proceedings may be in English and Spanish, the unchallenged members consider opportune to note that the equally authentic Spanish version of the ICSID Convention refers to impartiality rather than independence in the exercise of judgment. These are two different concepts.24 Nonetheless, since both versions of the ICSID Convention are equally authentic, it is accepted that members of an *ad-hoc* committee need to be impartial and independent.25\n\n*\"[...] independence relates to the lack of relations with a party that might influence an arbitrator\u2019s decision. Impartiality, on the other hand, concerns the absence of a bias or predisposition toward one of the parties.\" Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrales de Agua S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17) and Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi* *Universal S.A* v. *Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB 03/19),* Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal, 22 October 2007 **(\"Suez v. Argentina\"),** \u00b6 *29. See also Disqualification Decision,* \u00b6 *56,* referring, among others, to *Suez* v. *Argentina: \"Independence is characterized bv the absence of external control, in particular of relations between the arbitrator and a party which may influence the arbitrator\u2019s decision. Impartiality, on the other hand, means the absence of bias or predisposition towards one party and requires that the arbitrator hears the parties without any favor and bases his or her decision only on factors related to the merits of the case.\"* (Footnotes omitted)\n\n*See* Disqualification Decision. \u00b6 55 and case law referred therein.\n\n37.\n\nThe meaning of \"manifest\" has not been the subject of discussion between the parties. The unchallenged members are aware that the term \"manifest\" has been interpreted to mean \"obvious\" or relate to the \"seriousness\" of the allegations. The unchallenged members coincide with the view of the unchallenged arbitrators in *Saint-Gobain* that *\"there is no clear-cut guideline as to the degree to which the facts invoked by the challenging party must substantiate the alleged lack of qualification.*\"26 A decision has to be made on facts sufficiently proven for a reasonable person to be convinced that it is possible that the challenged member manifestly lacks the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention\n\nDecision on Disqualification, \u00b6 60.\n\n***(2) The ground for disqualification***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nAs a first observation, the unchallenged members note that the Applicant has not raised any ground for disqualification related to the impartiality, independence or candor of Mr. Bottini based on facts occurred after the *Saint-Gobain* proceedings, including this proceeding.\n\n39.\n\nThe Proposal is based on the alleged failure of Mr. Bottini to disclose facts in two instances that might have been material to the Disqualification Decision in *Saint-Gobain.* In both occasions, the Applicant alleges that Mr. Bottini\u2019s disclosures were at variance with the reality. In the first instance, at the time of the Disqualification Decision, dated 27 February 2013, Mr. Bottini had already been requested by the Attorney General of Argentina to advise on points of international law, but Mr. Bottini declared to the unchallenged arbitrators that he had been asked to advise the Attorney General in the future. In the second instance, since early February 2013 Mr. Bottini had advised Argentina in *Impregilo,* but did not disclose until 13 April 2013 that his role included advocacy and not only advice.\n\n40.\n\nThe issue to be decided by the unchallenged members is whether the alleged lack of candor of Mr. Bottini in the case of *Saint-Gobain* shows a manifest lack of the qualifications required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention to be a member of the *ad-hoc* Committee in the instant case. This question is different from the question decided by the unchallenged arbitrators in *Saint-Gobain.* In that case, the allegations related to concerns raised by the simultaneous role of advocate and arbitrator, a concern not raised here. Although the issues are not germane, they are linked: the alleged lack of candor arises from the disclosures of Mr. Bottini in *Saint-Gobain.*\n\n41.\n\nThe first question for the unchallenged members is whether the Proposal is based on facts. The Respondent argues for dismissal of the Applicant\u2019s Proposal because it is based solely on the Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s subjective experience and not on objective facts. The Proposal is based on the allegation that the unchallenged arbitrators in *Saint-Gobain* were not aware of the professional services that Mr. Bottini was effectively providing to Argentina at the time they decided to deny the disqualification proposal in *Saint-Gobain.*\n\n42.\n\nMr. Bottini disputes that the claimant in *Saint-Gobain* was unaware that his role as advisor included advocacy. Mr. Bottini states: *\"on 21 December 2012, Saint-Gobain contended that, in the explanations furnished on 11 December 2012, I had confirmed that I would continue arguing as an advocate on behalf of the Argentine Republic.\"27* [Committee\u2019s translation] In the explanations of Mr. Bottini of December 11, 2012, he stated that he would *\"continue working as an independent advisor, assisting states, which may include Argentina and investors, in cases unrelated to the dispute at issue here\"* [Committee\u2019s translation]. While the Applicant and Mr. Bottini have exchanged arguments based on the interpretation of Mr. Bottini\u2019s disclosures, it remains unexplained why the unchallenged arbitrators would not have been aware of the meaning given now to the disclosures. Indeed, on the date of the Disqualification Decision, the unchallenged arbitrators considered that the case *Telekom Malaysia Behard* could be distinguished from the case before them precisely because *\"the Arbitral Tribunal has no present information that Mr. Bottini currently is advocating for or advising Argentina in any way.*\"28 Evidently, the unchallenged arbitrators were unaware of Mr. Bottini\u2019s role in respect of Argentina. But Mr. Bottini continued to make disclosures after the date of the Disqualification Decision, including the disclosures made on which the Applicant\u2019s Proposal relies; and the parties in *Saint-Gobain* did not take any action based on them. Which raises the next question, what is the relevance of this inaction from the parties in *Saint-Gobain* ?\n\nExplanations, p. 4.\n\nDisqualification Decision, \u00b6 85.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent assumes that the disclosures after the Disqualification Decision were satisfactory to the unchallenged arbitrators who have called for them since Mr. Bottini continued to serve on the tribunal.29 On the other hand, the Applicant has stated that it is irrelevant that the claimant *Saint-Gobain* did not renew the disqualification proposal. But the disqualification proposal in the instant case is based on events flowing from the disqualification proposal made against the same arbitrator by a different party yet represented by the same counsel. Hence, it is not as irrelevant as stated by the Applicant. In fact, on the basis that the claimant in *Saint-Gobain* did not renew the proposal, the unchallenged members of this Committee can reasonably conclude that the claimant in *Saint-Gobain* had no further doubts about Mr. Bottini\u2019s independence and impartiality arising out of the disclosures made after the Disqualification Decision in that case. The allegations made here on lack of candor could have been made on the basis of the same facts in *Saint-Gobain,* but they were not. It is not for the unchallenged members to take action on more than six-year old facts without more recent evidence to sustain the disqualification and on which the party advised by the same counsel did not take action.\n\nReply, p. 2.\n\n44.\n\nFor these reasons, the unchallenged members conclude that the Applicant has not shown Mr. Bottini\u2019s manifest lack of qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n45.\n\nHaving considered the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the Parties, and for the reasons indicated above, the unchallenged members of the *ad-hoc* Committee:\n\n(i) reject the Applicant\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification of Mr. Bottini; and\n\n(ii) request Mr. Bottini, as he has undertaken in his Declaration and required under the ICSID Rules, to continue to inform about any circumstance which could raise doubts about his ability to exercise independent and impartial judgment."}]}
