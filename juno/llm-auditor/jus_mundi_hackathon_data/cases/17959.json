PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration dated 16 August 2022 (the \"**Notice of Arbitration**\") the Claimant commenced arbitration proceedings against the Respondent pursuant to Chapter 10 of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, ratified by Peru on 28 June 2006, signed by the United States on 14 December 2007, and entered into force on 1 February 2009 (the \"**USPTPA**\" or the \"**Treaty**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 27 June 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, establishing the rules of procedure and the procedural calendar of the arbitration. In accordance with Section 3.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, this arbitration is conducted under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as revised in 2013 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 21 August 2023, the Claimant submitted his Statement of Claim (the \"**Statement of Claim**\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 29 September 2023, the Respondent filed its Notice of Intention to Request Bifurcation, whereby it (i) notified its intention to make preliminary objections pursuant to Article 10.20.4 of the USPTPA; and (ii) requested the Tribunal to order the suspension of the proceedings on the merits and establish a schedule for further briefing on such objections.\n\n5.\n\nOn 10 October 2023, the Parties submitted a joint calendar proposal for the filing of submissions on bifurcation, including two rounds of submissions. The Parties' joint proposal also set out two alternative scenarios for further submissions depending on the outcome of the Tribunal's decision on bifurcation.\n\n6.\n\nOn 30 October 2023, the Tribunal (i) directed the Parties to file one round of written submissions on bifurcation; and (ii) decided that the remainder of the calendar of the arbitration - and, in particular, the need for a second round of submissions on bifurcation - would be discussed on the basis of the Parties' joint calendar proposal at a virtual meeting after the Tribunal and the Claimant had had sight of the Respondent's request for bifurcation.\n\n7.\n\nOn 14 November 2023, the Respondent filed its Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Request for Bifurcation**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn 5 December 2023, the Tribunal held a procedural video conference with the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nOn 6 December 2023, the Tribunal fixed a schedule for the filing of additional submissions on bifurcation.\n\n10.\n\nOn 19 December 2023, the Claimant filed his Opposition to Respondent Peru's Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Opposition to Bifurcation**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn 29 December 2023, the Respondent filed its Reply Statement to Claimant's Opposition to Republic of Peru's Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Reply**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 10 January 2024, the Claimant filed his Rejoinder in Opposition to Respondent Peru's Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n13.\n\nIn this Procedural Order, the Tribunal decides the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation.\n\n**II. BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE**\n---------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nAccording to the Statement of Claim, the present dispute concerns the claim that the Claimant was deprived of his rights under Peruvian law to conduct a Direct Negotiation Process with PeruPetro, S.A. - the government entity responsible for the administration of oil blocks - to obtain a contract to operate oil fields in Blocks III and IV of the Talara Basin in Peru. In particular, the Claimant alleges that his company, Baspetrol S.A.C, was prevented from obtaining a contract due to a bribery scheme involving a company named Grana y Montero and \"the highest Peruvian authorities\", including the former First Lady of Peru, Nadine Heredia.1\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 1-14.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s \"corrupt practices\" are in breach of its fair and equitable treatment obligations under Article 10.5 of the USPTPA.2 He seeks approximately USD 265 million, plus interest, in compensation.3\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 15, 311.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 416(b).\n\n16.\n\nThe present arbitration, PCA Case No. 2023-22, is the second arbitration between the same Parties *(\"**Amorrortu IT**\").* Two awards were issued in the first arbitration between the Parties, PCA Case No. 2020-11(\"***Amorrortu I***\"): (i) a Partial Award on Jurisdiction, dated 5 August 2022, whereby the majority of the tribunal dismissed the Claimant\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction (the \"**Partial Award**\"); and (ii) a Final Award on Costs, dated 25 October 2022, whereby the Tribunal ordered the Claimant to reimburse the Respondent in an amount of USD 1,029,080.18 towards its costs in the arbitration, plus interest (the \"**Final Award**\", and together with the Partial Award, the *\"**Amorrortu I Awards**\").*\n\n**III. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S REQUEST FOR BIFURCATION**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nIn its Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to address three objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in a bifurcated preliminary phase:\n\na. **Objection 1**: The Claimant\u2019s claims fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction because he did not submit these claims within the three-year limitation period established in Article 10.18.1 of the USPTPA;\n\nb. **Objection 2**: The Respondent has not given its consent to arbitrate the dispute under the USPTPA because the Claimant did not comply with the mandatory consultation and negotiation requirement of Articles 10.15 and 10.16 of the Treaty; and\n\nc. **Objection 3**: Even if the Claimant was not required to comply with the mandatory consultation and negotiation requirement, the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration has not been perfected because the Claimant failed to deliver a notice of intent to submit the claims to arbitration, as required under Article 10.16.2 of the USPTPA.4\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, paras 2, 61.\n\n18.\n\nThe grounds for each objection are summarized *seriatim* below, followed by a summary of the grounds for the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation and the Claimant\u2019s Opposition to Bifurcation.\n\n**1. Objection 1 (Time-Bar)**\n-----------------------------\n\n19.\n\nUnder the heading of Objection 1, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s claims are time-barred because they were not submitted to arbitration within the three-year limitation period required under USPTPA Article 10.18.1.5\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, paras 5-6.\n\n20.\n\nFirst, the Respondent observes that the USPTPA limitation period starts to run \"from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1\"6 - knowledge which, according to the Respondent, may be either actual or constructive.7 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the degree of knowledge capable of satisfying this provision does not require that a claimant be in a position fully to particularize its claim;8 rather, it is enough if sufficient alleged facts are in existence to constitute a cause of action so as to bring a claim.9\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 6.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 9.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 9; Reply, para. 20; *Corona Materials LLC v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3 (\"***Corona Materials***\"), Award on the Respondent's Expedited Preliminary Objections in Accordance with Article 10.20.5 of the DR-CAFTA, 31 May 2016, para. 194 (**RLA-28**).\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 9; *Seo Jin Hae v. Republic of Korea,* HKIAC Case No. HKIAC/18117, Concurring Opinion of Dr. Benny Lo, 24 September 2019, para. 37 (**RLA-37**).\n\n21.\n\nFollowing this rationale, the Respondent contends that the USPTPA limitation period started to run in June 2019, when, under the Respondent\u2019s reading of the Statement of Claim, the Claimant recognizes that he first learned of the Respondent\u2019s Treaty breaches.10\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 11; Reply, paras 17-18.\n\n22.\n\nIn turn, according to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s claim was only \"submitted to arbitration\" in accordance with Article 10.16.4 of the USPTPA on 21 August 2023, the date on which both the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration and his Statement of Claim were received by the Respondent11 - that is, more than three years after the Claimant first acquired knowledge of the alleged Treaty breaches in 2019.12\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 7.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 11.\n\n23.\n\nAgainst this background, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Notice of Intent filed in September 2019 (the \"**Notice of Intent**\") suspended the three-year limitation period.13 First, the Respondent observes that Article 10.18.1 of the USTPA is silent on the question of suspension of the time-limit, which has led the United States and other investment tribunals to interpret similar provisions as being \"clear and rigid\", and not subject to any suspension or other qualification.14 Second, in the Respondent\u2019s view, the Notice of Intent and Statement of Claim filed in *Amorrortu I* could not have suspended the limitation period because the Claimant\u2019s defective waiver led to the invalidity of his claims.15\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 12.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 12; *The Renco Group, Inc. v.

United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/99/I, Award, 16 December 2002, para. 63 (**RLA-4**).\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 14.\n\n**2. Objection 2 (Consultation and Negotiation)**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nObjection 2 is based on the proposition that the Claimant failed to comply with the mandatory Consultation and Negotiation requirement in Articles 10.15 and 10.16 of the USPTPA, which, in the Respondent\u2019s submission, is a mandatory precondition for the submission of a claim to arbitration,16 as acknowledged by the Claimant himself.17\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, paras 15, 17.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 17; Letter from Claimant to the PCA, 26 August 2022, p. 1 (**R-1**).\n\n25.\n\nIn this connection, the Respondent recalls that the Claimant did not attempt to settle the present dispute;18 instead, as noted in the Statement of Claim, he claims to have satisfied this requirement before submitting his Notice of Intent in *Amorrortu I.*19\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 19.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 19.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument on two grounds. First, *Amorrortu II* constitutes a new claim against the Respondent requiring a new round of consultations and negotiations independent of those conducted before the initiation of the *Amorrortu I* proceedings.20 Second, the dispute between the Parties has changed significantly since the *Amorrortu I* tribunal declined to hear the dispute, thus casting uncertainty upon the outcome of any negotiations related to that case, which are still ongoing.21 In this respect, the Respondent notes that the Claimant is seeking to set aside the Partial Award and Final Award in *Amorrortu I* and has also failed to honour the latter award.22\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 19.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 19.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 19.\n\n27.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's argument that his alleged meeting with Minister Vera in June 2023 satisfies the negotiation requirement23 because Mr. Vera has no legal authority to settle an arbitration dispute.24\n\nReply, para. 38.\n\nReply, para. 39.\n\n**3. Objection 3 (Notice of Intent)**\n-------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nLastly, the Respondent argues that its consent to arbitrate was never perfected because the Claimant failed to submit a notice of intent before filing his Statement of Claim - which, in the Respondent's submission, is another pre-condition to arbitration under Article 10.16.2 of the USPTPA25 intended to ensure that the State is put on notice of a new claim against it.26\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, paras 22-24.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 25.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Notice of Intent filed in *Amorrortu I* could not have fulfilled the notice-of-intent requirement for *Amorrortu II* because the claims brought in each case are different.27 According to the Respondent, by failing to notify his intent to bring a claim, the Claimant deprived the Respondent of the opportunity to hire external counsel and defend itself at the outset of these arbitration proceedings.28\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 26.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 26.\n\n**4. Request for Bifurcation**\n------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nFlowing from its jurisdictional objections, the Respondent requests that the proceedings be bifurcated pursuant to Article 10.20.4 of the USTPA or, alternatively, under Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules.29\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 3.\n\n31.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the bifurcation of its jurisdictional objections is required under Article 10.20.4 of the USPTPA, pursuant to which \"[w]ithout prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made\".30\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 28.\n\n32.\n\nUnder the Respondent's reading of this provision, it may raise any objection under Article 10.20.4\u00a0as long as such objection (i) can be resolved by the Tribunal as a matter of law, and (ii) is based on the facts as alleged by the Claimant or on undisputed facts.31 By operation of Article 10.20.4, says the Respondent, the facts to be assumed as true for the purposes of an analysis under this provision are \"lock[ed] in\" as those contained in the Notice of Arbitration and the Statement of Claim.32 Accordingly, the Claimant is barred from \"reconstructing\" his factual allegations or introducing new ones \"to artificially create issues of fact\" once USPTPA Article 10.20.4 is invoked.33\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 29.\n\nReply, paras 14, 23-24.\n\nReply, para. 14.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the *Renco I* tribunal\u2019s interpretation of this provision, under which objections as to competence fall outside the scope of the automatic bifurcation mechanism in USPTPA Article 10.20.4 because they constitute \"other objections\" for the purposes of this Article, \"which are different from objections that 'as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made\u2019\".34 According to the Respondent, a tribunal\u2019s obligation to decide objections in a preliminary phase is triggered with respect to \"any\" objection that can be resolved as a matter of law, regardless of whether it touches upon jurisdiction or not.35\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 30; *The Renco Group, Inc. v.

Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on Jurisdiction, 22 November 2002, para. 31 (**RLA-3**).\n\n37.\n\nIn this connection, the Respondent submits that each of its preliminary objections meets the test for bifurcation set out in *Glamis Gold,* under which a tribunal must consider: (i) whether the objection is *prima facie* substantial and not frivolous; (ii) whether the objection is intertwined with the merits; and (iii) whether granting the objection results in a material reduction of the proceedings in the next phase.43 The Respondent observes that other tribunals have relied on this test to bifurcate jurisdictional objections *ratione temporis*44 and *ratione voluntatis*45 such as the ones at issue in this case.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 42; Reply, para. 28; *Glamis Gold, LTD. v.

THE CLAIMANT\u2019S OPPOSITION TO BIFURCATION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent are (i) incapable of triggering the automatic bifurcation mechanism in Article 10.20.4 of the USPTPA; and (ii) in any event, do not warrant bifurcation under Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n43.\n\nFirst, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that its preliminary objections trigger the preliminary question mechanism of Article 10.20.4\u00a0of the Treaty.60 According to the Claimant, this provision requires only the bifurcation of \"failure to state a claim\" objections, while \"other objections\", including jurisdictional objections such as the ones at issue here, may be bifurcated for preliminary consideration at the Tribunal's discretion.61 In the Claimant's view, the cases cited by the Respondent on this point are inapposite62 - in particular, the Claimant notes that the expedited procedure in *Pac Rim* took place under Article 10.20.5 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (\"**CAFTA**\"), which is not equivalent to Article 10.20.4 of the USPTPA.63\n\nOpposition to Bifurcation, para. 31.\n\nOpposition to Bifurcation, paras. 31, 33-34; Rejoinder, para. 13; *Renco I*, Decision as to the Scope of Respondent's Preliminary Objections Under Article 10.20.4, 18 December 2014, para. 192 (**Exhibit 8**).\n\nOpposition to Bifurcation, para. 38; *Pac Rim Cayman v.

In this connection, the Claimant notes that he met the Minister of Energy and Mining of Peru in Lima as recently as 28 June 2023 to \"deliver a proposal for the resolution of this investment dispute\".79\n\nOpposition to Bifurcation, paras 10, 58-65, 68.\n\n52.\n\nObjection 3 (Notice of Intention) is also frivolous and not suited for bifurcation, in the Claimant\u2019s view, because Article 10.16 of the Treaty requires a notice of intent for every claim, not for every arbitration, as wrongly suggested by the Respondent.80 The Claimant states that he properly notified of each of the claims for *Amorrortu I*, which are exactly the same as those for *Amorrortu II.*81\n\nOpposition to Bifurcation, paras 15, 73; Rejoinder, para. 31.\n\nOpposition to Bifurcation, para. 71.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the principal basis for the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation is Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, which provides for the mandatory bifurcation of \"any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.1\". According to the Respondent, all of Objections 1-3 can be resolved as a matter of law and therefore must be bifurcated for consideration in a preliminary phase. In the alternative, the Respondent submits that the bifurcation of its objections is warranted under Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant, in turn, denies that the Respondent's objections are capable of triggering Article 10.20.4 of the USPTPA. He requests that the Tribunal exercise its discretion under Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules to deny bifurcation.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal must first address whether the Respondent's objections fall within the scope of Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty. This provision reads as follows:\n\nWithout prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.1.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the plain text of Article 10.20.4\u00a0refers to two distinct classes of objections. As already noted, the class of objections for which Article 10.20.4 mandates bifurcation is \"any objection by the respondent that ... a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.1\". In other words, where the objection concerns a claim in respect of which an award cannot be made under Article 10.26.1, Article 10.20.4 requires the tribunal to address and decide the objection (i) as a preliminary matter, and (ii) as a matter of law, *i. e.*, without engaging in a factual enquiry.\n\n57.\n\nArticle 10.20.4 then refers to a second class of objections that is residual in nature - \"other objections\" outside those for which bifurcation is required - and identifies a sub-class of objections falling within this broader 'residual' category: \"an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence\".\n\n58.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, all three objections advanced by the Respondent are properly characterized as objections that the present dispute is not within the Tribunal's competence. Objection 1 (Time-Bar) is, in essence, a challenge to the Tribunal's competence *ratione temporis.* Similarly, Objections 2 (Consultation and Negotiation) and 3 (Notice of Intent), as particularized by the Respondent itself, arise from the proposition that the Respondent has not given its consent to arbitrate the dispute under the Treaty82 - a quintessential question of competence of an investment tribunal.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Request for Bifurcation, paras. 15, 22.\n\n59.\n\nOnce this is so, Objections 1-3 are objections as to competence that fall within the 'residual' class of objections defined in Article 10.20.4, and thus bifurcation is not peremptory, but is subject instead to the Tribunal's \"authority to address other objections as a preliminary question\", that is to say, upon an exercise of the Tribunal's discretion as to whether bifurcation is warranted.\n\n60.\n\nIn the exercise of this authority, having considered the Parties' respective views, the Tribunal finds that none of the objections advanced by the Respondent warrant bifurcation.\n\n61.\n\nFirst, Objection 1 (Time-Bar) as pleaded by the Respondent requires the Tribunal to determine the starting date of the three-year limitation period specified under Article 10.18.1 of the USPTPA - *i.e,* the date on which the Claimant \"first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1\". The Respondent's submission is that the limitation period started to run in June 2019, while the Claimant argues that the corruption that allegedly frustrated his investment was only confirmed in or around 31 August 2020. Thus, the factual enquiry that the Tribunal is required to engage in respect of Objection 1 may turn on evidence that is also relevant to the merits of the Claimant\u2019s claims. The Tribunal may also be required to make findings of fact so as to decide Objection 1 that are not without consequence for the adjudication of the merits, should that be reached. These considerations incline the Tribunal to the conclusion that Objection 1 should not be determined in a preliminary proceeding. Though the Tribunal does not consider Objection 1 to be frivolous, we apprehend that the evidential enquiry relevant to its adjudication is unlikely to be sufficiently self-contained so as to save costs and time, and avoid overlap with the merits of the case. The request for bifurcation in respect of Objection 1 must therefore be declined.\n\n62.\n\nSimilarly, Objection 2 (Consultation and Negotiation) raises a mixed question of fact and law requiring, *inter alia,* a factual assessment of the content and significance of the Claimant\u2019s alleged attempts to settle this dispute with the Peruvian Government. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the analysis required in respect of Objection 2 would be better addressed as part of the larger evidentiary exercise engaged with the merits.\n\n63.\n\nLastly, with respect to Objection 3 (Notice of Intent), the Tribunal is again not convinced that bifurcation is warranted. Issues of fact have been raised in respect of Objection 3, in addition to issues of law, including whether the current proceedings involve a \"different dispute\". Therefore, even though Objection 3 is a more narrowly circumscribed, adjudicating Objection 3 separately would still be likely to require the Tribunal to undertake a broader factual inquiry and delve into legal issues that involve the wider merits of the case, without all the relevant context.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal observes, finally, that Objections 1-3 require the Tribunal to address and decide -albeit to varying extents - issues of fact that are in dispute between the Parties. This reinforces the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Objections 1-3 fall outside the scope of Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, as none of them are claims simply \"for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made [*as a matter of law*] under Article 10.26.1\".83\n\nBrackets and emphasis by the Tribunal.\n\n**VI.
