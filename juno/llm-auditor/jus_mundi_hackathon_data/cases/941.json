THE PROCEEDINGS\n------------------\n\nA. *Institution of Proceedings and the Establishment of the Arbitral Tribunal*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nOn 24 May 2001, in accordance with Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which was opened for signature in Washington DC on 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the \"ICSID Convention\"), the Secretary of the ICSID [registered] a request for arbitration submitted by Semos against the Republic of Mali concerning the imposition by the State of Mali of stamp duty on gold export applications.\n\n[2].\n\nIn its request for arbitration, Semos claims to be exempted from payment of stamp duty on its export applications, on the basis of a Mining Convention concerning exploration for and exploitation of gold, silver and related substances on the Sadiola site in Mali, to which the Republic of Mali and Semos are party.\n\n[3].\n\nThis dispute arose at a time when various other disputes of a fiscal and customs nature were under discussion between Semos and the Slate of Mali concerning, in particular, the procedures for the reimbursement of VAT credits and the notion of \"subcontractor\".\n\n[4].\n\nThe attempts to arrive at an amicable settlement of the dispute, as provided for in Article 28.1 of the said Mining Convention, subsequently replaced by Article 31 of Decree No. 91-278/PM-RM of 19 September 1991, proved unsuccessful, at least with regard to stamp duty on export applications.\n\n[5].\n\nWith regard to the agreement between the parties to have recourse to arbitration, the request for arbitration bases the competence of the ICSID on an arbitration clause stipulated in the Convention.\n\n[6].\n\nFurthermore, the request satisfies the requirement of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention that disputes be of a legal nature and that they be between a contracting State and a national of another contracting State. Scmos, a company incorporated under the laws of Mali, may be deemed to be a national of another contracting State in view of the control exercised over it by foreign interests, namely companies the majority of which are incorporated under the laws of the Isle of Man and the Island of Barbados1 and, in consequence, have the nationality of countries which are signatories of the Washington Convention.\n\nSee the paragraph below concerning the objective tacts and the establishment of Semos and its accession to the Mining Convention.\n\n[7].\n\nMoreover, the issue effectively concerns a dispute arising directly out of an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention, as it pertains to the conditions in this case of a fiscal and customs nature - under which the main shareholders of Semos, acting through this joint-venture, operate the Sadiola gold mine, in respect of which they have invested funds in Mali. The fact (hat the matter concern an investment is confirmed by the agreement between the parties. Thus, Article 4 of Addendum No. 1 to the Convention of 5 April 1990 refers to Article 31-3 of Decree No. 91-278/PR-RM of 19 September 1991, which is worded as follows: \"for arbitration purposes, the parties are agreed that the operations to which this convention relates constitute an investment within the meaning of Article 25.1 of the Arbitration Convention\". On this basis, the arbitration proceedings have been conducted by virtue of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules which were adopted by the ICSID on 26 September 1984 and are still in force today.\n\n[8].\n\nThe parties agreed on the establishment of an Arbitral Tribunal consisting of three arbitrators: Professor Ibrahim Fadlallah, of French and Lebanese nationality, the arbitrator designated by Semos on 24 August 2001; Batonnier Robert S. M. Dossou, a national of Benin, the arbitrator designated by the Republic of Mali on 30 August 2001; and Maine Bernardo M. Cremades, Spanish national, who was appointed chairman of the tribunal by mutual agreement of the arbitrators designated by the parties and who accepted his appointment on 21 September 2001. In consequence, this latter date marks the date of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal in accordance with Article 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the beginning of the proceedings.\n\n[9].\n\nThe parties confirmed that the Tribunal was duly constituted at the preliminary hearing held on 17 October 2001, which, in accordance with Article 13(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, took place within a period of 60 days from the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n[10].\n\nThe arbitration clause contained in the Mining Convention concluded between the Government of Mali and Semos stipulates2 that, unless the parties decide otherwise, the arbitration proceedings should take place in Paris. At the hearing of 17 October 2001, it was agreed that the arbitration proceedings would be held in Paris at the premises of the World Bank.\n\nArticle 28.2(a) of the Mining Convention, which was replaced by Article 31.2(a) of Decree No 91-278/PM-RM of 19 September 1991.\n\n[11].\n\nWith regard to language, it was further agreed during the preliminary hearing of 17 October 2001 that, in accordance with Article 31.2-b of the Decree of 19 September 1991, the language of the proceedings would be French.\n\nB. *The Course of the Proceedings*\n----------------------------------\n\n[12].\n\nOn the occasion of the preliminary hearing of 17 October 2001, the Tribunal decided that the claimant should submit its memorial by no later than 17 December 2001 and the respondent its memorial of reply by no later than 17 February 2002. In addition, it was decided that the claimant\u2019s rejoinder should be submitted by no later than 17 March 2002 and the respondent\u2019s rejoinder by no later than 17 April 2002. It will be noted that all the above-mentioned documents were submitted by the parties within the stipulated lime limits. The Tribunal further decided to hold a second hearing on 27 and 28 May 2002.\n\n[13].\n\nOn 13 May 2002, the respondent asked for the date of the second hearing to be deferred, citing material reasons. The arbitral tribunal agreed to postpone the hearing to 5 and 6 September 2002.\n\n[14].\n\nOn 5 and 6 September 2002, the arbitral tribunal held its second hearing in Paris. On that occasion, Semos was represented by Maitre Charles KAPLAN, assisted by Maitre CABROL while the Republic of Mali was represented by Mrs Bah Haoua TOUMAGNON and Mr Sekou Dioro DICKO. Mr Satigui SIDIBE, the Assistant National Director for Taxes, was also present at the hearing. The Tribunal heard the presentations and arguments of each of the parties, who were given the opportunity to express themselves fully and to present their arguments in such manner as they saw fit.\n\n[15].\n\nThe tribunal put various questions to the parties, which responded to them within the stipulated time limits, namely before 15 September 2002 for Semos and before 25 September 2002 for the Republic of Mali. Subsequently, the tribunal put an additional question to the parties on the wording of Article 993 of the Malian General Tax Code at the time of the original Convention and Addendum No. 1. Both parties replied to this question.\n\n[16].\n\nAfter deliberation, the arbitral tribunal came to the following conclusions.\n\nII. THE FACTS AND OBJECT OF THE DISPUTE\n---------------------------------------\n\nA. *The Objective Facts*\n------------------------\n\n[17].\n\nBy an Order dated 13 January 1990,3 Mali\u2019s Ministry of Industry, Water and Energy granted the German company GOLD-SUCH-UND-SCHURFGESELLSCHAFT GmbH (hereinafter referred to as \"AGEM GmbH\") an exclusive licence to prospect for gold, silver and related substances and platinoids on the site of Sadiola, Mali, a village situated in the Kayes region (hereinafter referred to as the \"Exploration Permit\"), in accordance with Mali\u2019s Mining Code of 1970.\n\nOrder No. 90-70/MIHE-CCAM of 13 January 1990.\n\n[18].\n\nArticle 11 of the said Code stipulates that the \"order [granting the exploration permit] shall be accompanied by an establishment convention laying down the conditions under which exploration and exploitation are to be conducted in the event of the discovery of deposits\" and specifies \"the rights and obligations and undertakings of the permit holder\". On 5 April 1990, in accordance with the provisions of this article, AGEM GmbH and the State of Mali concluded an Establishment Convention concerning exploration for and exploitation of gold, silver and related substances and platinoids (hereinafter referred to as the \"Original Convention\") which was approved by Decree4 on 12 May 1990.\n\nDecree No. 90-191/PM-RM of 12 May 1990.\n\n[19].\n\nAGEM GmbH and the State of Mali concluded an Addendum to the Original Convention of 5 April 1990, amending certain of its provisions and thus creating an Amended Establishment Convention (hereinafter referred to as the \"Amended Convention\"). This Addendum No. 1 was approved by the Decree5 of 5 February 1992 and signed on 24 March 1992.\n\nDecree No. 92-043/PM KM approving Addendum No 1 to the Convention of 5 April 1990.\n\n[20].\n\nOn 1 August 1994, in accordance with the provisions of the new Mining Code, AGEM GmbH was granted a permit to exploit gold, silver, related substances and platinoids on the Sadiola site.\n\n[21].\n\nWith regard to the establishment of Semos and its accession to the Establishment Convention, the Canadian company International African Mining Gold Corporation (hereinafter referred to as \"IAMGOLD\") first acquired 100% of the shares of AGEM GmbH. Subsequently, on 12 October 1992, an agreement was concluded between the South African company Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"AAC\") and IAMGOLD, in accordance with which AAC acquired 50% of the IAMGOLD interest in the exploration permit (hereinafter referred to as the \"Option Agreement\"). The Option Agreement was duly approved by the State which, on 8 September 1994, signed a shareholders\u2019 agreement between the following:\n\n- the State of Mali,\n\n- AGEM Ltd, a company established under the laws of Barbados and controlled by IAMGOLD,\n\n- ANMERCOSA MINING (WEST AFRICA) LIMITED (hereinafter referred to as \"ANMIN\"), a company established under the laws of the Isle of Man and controlled by AAC, and\n\n- SOCIETE FINANCIERE INTERNATIONALE, an international financial institution.\n\nAs regards the interests of the majority shareholders, ANMIN and AGEM Ltd each held 38% of the share capital.\n\n[22].\n\nFinally, the Societe d\u2019Exploitation des Mines d\u2019Or de Sadiola - SEMOS SA was established as a *societe anonyme* in accordance with the Commercial Code of Mali on 6 December 1994. The exploration permit was transferred to Semos by Decree6 on 22 December 1994 between ANMIN, AGEM Ltd and the State. Following the transfer, Semos became fully party to the Amended Convention and was vested with the rights and obligations of AGEM GmbH.\n\nDecree No. 94 440/PM-RM of 22 December 1994.\n\nB. *Object of the Dispute*\n--------------------------\n\n[23].\n\nThe dispute between Semos and the Republic of Mali arose when Mali\u2019s Tax Administration and, more particularly, the National Tax Department, decided to impose stamp duty on the gold export applications made by Semos, relying on Article 9.3 of the Amended Convention which stipulates that \"after the first three years of production\", the operating company (i.e. Semos) would be required, inter alia, to pay stamp duty. As the date of the first production was fixed at 4 March 1997, the Administration intended to impose stamp duty on export applications, as stipulated in Article 993 of the General Tax Code, with effect from 4 March 2000.\n\n[24].\n\nOn 6 July 2000, i.e. after the expiry of the exemption period, the Tax Administration of Mali registered the first export application submitted to it by Semos \"free of charge\". Thus, it seemed to have given authorisation, on a temporary basis, for applications for the export of minerals extracted from the Sadiola site to be exempted from payment of stamp duty. Subsequently, in a letter dated 21 July 2000, the Administration demanded payment of this tax, recalling that, in accordance with the provisions of Article 9.3 of the Amended Convention, stamp duty was payable on gold exports at the end of the three year period. Moreover, on 5 October 2000, the Administration sent Semos a first demand for payment of the stamp duty *(titre de perception7),* signed by the Domains Tax Collector.\n\n*Titre de perception* No 3/2000/RDET.\n\n[25].\n\nSemos seeks a definitive exemption from the payment of stamp duty on its gold export applications and argues that the proceedings instituted against it by the Republic of Mali for the collection of the said tax are contrary to its obligations. Thus, Semos claims that all of its gold export applications already submitted or to be submitted in future should be registered free of stamp duty. The company further claims that the State of Mali should, by way of damages, reimburse all sums Semos may have to pay within the framework of proceedings instituted or to be instituted against it for the collection of stamp duty on the gold exports already effected or to be effected in the future. Finally, Semos calls for the Republic of Mali to be ordered to pay all the costs of the proceedings, including its lawyers\u2019 fees.\n\nIII. THE ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES\n---------------------------------\n\nA. *The Arguments of Semos*\n---------------------------\n\n[26].\n\nSemos maintains that the imposition of stamp duty on gold export applications by Article 993 of the General Tax Code introduced in 1999 is new and that, in consequence, by virtue of the stability guarantees stipulated both in the Mining Codes of 1970 and 1991 and in the Original and Amended Conventions, it does not apply to the company.\n\n[27].\n\nIn addition, Semos claims the application of Article 99 of the 1991 Mining Code of Mali, which lays down the general principle of exemption from all indirect internal taxes and others usually due.\n\n[28].\n\nAccording to Semos, the general exemption formulae adopted within the framework of the customs regimes delined under the 1991 Mining Code are consistent with the generally held view that the notion of \"customs regime\" effectively comprises not only customs duty per se but also a number of separate taxes which may be payable on movements of goods,8 as with the matter at issue.\n\nSee; \"Le droit douanier\" by Professor Claude J. Berr and Henri Tremeau, Economica, 1988.\n\n[29].\n\nSemos further claims that Article 9 of the Amended Convention and, in particular, paragraph 3 thereof cannot be considered in isolation from the other applicable provisions but must be interpreted in the light of the other relevant provisions of the Convention, since any restrictive construction of the scope of application of the provisions of the Convention would be incorrect.\n\n[30].\n\nFurthermore, according to Semos, Article 9.3 of the Amended Convention is not applicable to export operations, these being subject to Article 7.3 of the Amended Convention, which regulates the customs regime and establishes the principle of a general exemption from all exit taxes and duties throughout the period of validity of the Convention. It is the view of Semos that the stamp duty on gold exports constitutes an exit duty, from which it is exempt under this article.\n\n[31].\n\nMoreover, Semos considers that, in the event of a contradiction between Article 9.3 and Article 7.3 of the Amended Convention, the decision must be in its favour, in accordance with the principles of the interpretation of contracts under Malian law of obligations applicable to the Amended Convention,9 particularly the rule of *specialia generalibus derogant.*\n\nArticle 74 and Article 75 of the Law of 29 August 1987 laying down the general regime of obligations of the Republic of Mali.\n\n[32].\n\nAccessorily, Semos points out that the headings of Articles 7 and 9 could not justify *per se* a strict separation of the scope of application of the two articles since, under the terms of Article 3.27 of the Amended Convention, the headings are simply indicative: \"The article headings serve exclusively to facilitate the reading of this Convention and do not have any special legal significance.\"\n\n[33].\n\nFinally, Semos points out that, in December 1993, the Republic of Mali was provided with an economic feasibility study of the Sadiola Mine carried out by Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Ltd. The examination of the fiscal and customs regime applicable to the Amended Convention did not envisage any form of export lax on the products and it was on this basis that the economic feasibility of the Sadiola mine was determined, in consultation with the State of Mali.\n\nB. *The Arguments of the Republic of Mali*\n------------------------------------------\n\n[34].\n\nThe Republic of Mali maintains that Article 993 of the General Tax Code was not new and that the imposition of stamp duty on export applications was prior to the reform of 1999.\n\n[35].\n\nThe Republic of Mali argues that Article 7 and Article 9 of the Amended Convention each refer to a perfectly distinct regime, Article 7 regulating the customs regime applicable to the operations of the permit holder and Article 9 specifying the taxes forming part of the domestic taxation of the undertaking.\n\n[36].\n\nWithin this framework. Article 9 lists the taxes and duties payable by Semos, including stamp duty. This list is consistent with Article 96 of the Mining Code of 1991, which provides as follows: \"With regard to taxation, the Establishment Convention (...) lays down the list of the various taxes and duties payable by the holder of the mining permits during their period of validity.\"\n\n[37].\n\nThe Republic of Mali indicates, therefore, that it is the tax regime described in Article 9 of the said Convention which should apply, to the exclusion of any other consideration.\n\n[38].\n\nMore generally, stamp duty is payable on the occasion of a whole variety of operations with no connection between them, save for the fact that the duty is generated by the existence of a written document.\n\n[39].\n\nWith regard to stamp duty on export applications, the Republic of Mali concludes that, in consequence, it is not the export operation which should be taken into account but rather the written document signed by the parties, namely the operator and the National Directorate for Trade and Competition. It is this document which is called an \"export application\" and, for the Republic of Mali, it is the written nature of the document which matters.\n\n[40].\n\nTherefore, according to Mali, the stamp duty payable on gold export applications cannot be legally assimilated to an exit duty within the meaning of Article 7.3 of the Amended Convention, that article relating exclusively to the customs regime applying to the activities of the operator, i.e. Semos. Were this to be the case, stamp duty would be collected at customs and not inside the country by the Tax Administration, as is the case at present.\n\n[41].\n\nThe Republic of Mali further argues that, were stamp duty to be assimilated to customs duty, the structure of the various tariffs adopted in Mali between 1991 and 4 March 2000 would have included stamp duty.\n\n[42].\n\nMoreover, Mali points out that, for the interpretation of legal texts, it is established practice that, in the event of a conflict between general provisions regulating a particular matter (Article 7.3 of the Amended Convention) and specific provisions (Article 9.3 of the Amended Convention), it is the specific provisions which should prevail.\n\n[43].\n\nIn addition, the Republic of Mali recalls that all the conventions concluded between the mining companies and the State of Mali after the coming into force of the 1991 Code expressly provide for the payment of stamp duty after the first three years of production, whereas those concluded before 1991 did not. The Convention binding Semos and the State of Mali, which was signed on 5 April 1990 and amended on 14 March 1992, stipulated the payment of this duty, in the same way as all the other conventions signed subsequently.\n\n[44].\n\nIn support of its arguments, the Republic of Mali invokes the fact that the expression \"export application\" was used before it was taken into account in the fiscal reform of 1999, as evidenced by CMDT (Compagnie Malienne pour le Developpement des Textiles) documents dating from 1997.\n\n[45].\n\nFinally, the Republic of Mali points out that the claimant seems to confuse the Malian and French fiscal administrations. The French customs department, called the \"Direction Generale des Douanes et des Droits Indirects\", is not the equivalent of Mali\u2019s \"Direction Generale des Douanes\". It is this confusion which has led Semos - incorrectly - to equate stamp duty with exit taxes or customs taxes.\n\nIV. THE MERITS\n--------------\n\nA. *The Legal Framework*\n------------------------\n\n1. *Law applicable to the original Convention*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n[46].\n\nWith regard to the lax and customs regulations, in addition to the provisions contained in the Original Convention,10 which itself regulates the exploration and exploitation phase (Articles 7 and 9 and Articles 15 and 16 respectively), AGEM GmbH, the former holder of the rights of Semos, was also subject to the provisions of Mali\u2019s Mining Code of 1970 and the General Tax Code.\n\nDated 5 April 1990.\n\n[47].\n\nAGEM GmbH was guaranteed fiscal and customs stability by the 1970 Mining Code11 (Articles 47 and 49) and by the Original Convention (Articles 17.1 and 10.5).\n\nIntroduced by Order No 34/CMLN of 3 September 1970 enacting the Mining Code of Mali.\n\n[48].\n\nIn practice, with regard to stamp duty, Article 9.1(h) of the Original Convention stipulates that, during the exploration phase, stamp duty was payable only on \"applications for the import of vehicles other than work vehicles and/or other vehicles directly linked to the exploration operations\". With regard to the exploitation phase, stamp duty is payable in principle, save where the exemption indicated for the exploration phase is maintained for \"any other import operation\", which does not apply in the \"case of imports of vehicles other than work vehicles and/or vehicles directly linked to the exploitation operations\" (Article 16.1(h)).\n\n[49].\n\nUnder the general law, the requirement to pay stamp duties on import and export operations derives from Article 993 of the General Tax Code in force when the Original Convention was concluded, which imposed stamp duty on \"import and export licenses and certificates\".\n\n[50].\n\nIn addition, Article 53 of the 1970 Mining Code provided that the export of substances extracted, produced or transformed should be exempt from all indirect internal taxes, exit duties and others usually due.\n\n2. *Modification of the legal and regulatory framework with effect from 1991*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[51].\n\nThe mining regulations in force at the date of signature of the Original Convention were abrogated12 and replaced through the promulgation of a new law, the Mining Code of Mali of 1991, supplemented by the Decree of 19 September 1991, which lays down the modalities for the application of the Code and approves the Standard Establishment Convention for the exploration and exploitation of mining substances in the Republic of Mali.\n\nPursuant to Order No 91- 65/P-CTSP of 19 September 1991.\n\n[52].\n\nArticle 99 of the 1991 Mining Code stipulates as follows: \"[The] exports of substances extracted, produced or transformed by [companies that are parties to the convention] shall be exempt from all indirect internal taxes and others usually due.\"\n\n[53].\n\nThe Standard Establishment Convention also provides for a scries of specific and limited exemptions.\n\n[54].\n\nIn principle, the new mining regulations were not supposed to apply to AGEM GmbH, in view of the rules guaranteeing legal stability referred to earlier and confirmed by the 1991 Mining Code, Article 138 of which stipulates that \"the exploration and exploitation permits [...] in force on the date of the coming into effect of the Code shall remain valid for the duration and for the substances in respect of which the [permits] have been issued\" and that \"the special conventions and rules shall remain valid\".\n\n[55].\n\nNevertheless, on 24 March 1992, AGEM GmbH and the State of Mali concluded an Addendum to the Original Convention, amending certain clauses in order to allow the parties to the Convention to benefit from all the new fiscal and customs regimes which are more favourable to the permit holder. Thus, with effect from the said date, AGEM GmbH became subject to the fiscal and customs regime laid down in Articles 7 and 9 of the Amended Convention, in accordance with the provisions of the 1991 Mining Code and the Standard Convention. The crux of the dispute concerns the respective scope of application of Articles 9.3 and 7.3 of the Amended Convention.\n\n[56].\n\nOn the one hand, stamp duty is provided for in the Amended Convention, Article 9 paragraph 2 of which stipulates an exemption during the first three years of production, save for stamp duty on imports. Paragraph 3 of the same article defines the fiscal regime applicable to the permit holder and stipulates that \"after the first three years of production deriving from a project covered by an exploitation permit, the exploitation company, its affiliated undertakings and subcontractors shall be required to pay. in respect of the said project [...] stamp duty\".\n\n[57].\n\nArticle 9 refers in general to the stamp duty introduced by Title IV of the General Tax Code of the Republic of Mali, which provides that stamp duties apply to certain deeds or other written documents or on the occasion of certain formalities. The duties in question are:\n\n- the size stamp *(timbre de dimension),* where the amount payable is determined on the basis of the size of the document;\n\n- the proportional stamp *(timbre proportionnel),* where the amount payable depends on the sums or values indicated on the stamped documents. This concerns, in particular, bills of exchange, negotiable and non-negotiable securities;\n\n- the receipt stamp *(timbre des quittances),* where the duty is payable on receipts and documents of all kinds;\n\n- the transportation contract stamp *(timbre sur les controls de transport),* where duty is payable on any document or other written instrument evidencing the transportation of goods by road, rail, inland waterways, maritime or air transport;\n\n- the stamp relating to the delivery of certain documents *(timbre afferant a la delivrance de certains documents)* such as a passport, laissez-passer, criminal record extract, import/export certificates and licences. Here, the amount payable is determined on the basis of the amount of the operation and the duly is settled cither by application of mobile stamps or by signature in lieu of stamp given by the registrar of payments *(receveur de l\u2019enregistrement).*\n\n[58].\n\nOn the other hand. Article 7.3 of the Amended Convention lays down the principle of general exemption from all exit duties throughout the duration of the convention: \"Upon export, the products shall be exempt from any exit taxes and duties, from any export sales tax and from any other duties imposed upon exit throughout the term of this Convention.\"\n\n[59].\n\nIn addition. Article 9.6 of the Amended Convention confirms the stability of the fiscal regime granted to AGEM GmbH, by providing that this regime may not be modified by any taxes which might be imposed subsequently.\n\n[60].\n\nFinally, it should be recalled that, on 22 December 1994, the operating permit for the Sadiola gold mine was transferred to Semos by Decree13 between ANMIN, AGEM Ltd and the State of Mali. Following the transfer, Semos became a full party to the Amended Convention and was vested with the rights and obligations of AGEM GmbH.\n\nDecree No 94-440/PM-RM\n\n3. *Subsequent legislative changes*\n-----------------------------------\n\n[61].\n\nThe General Tax Code of the Republic of Mali was amended by the Law of 1 April 1999.14 Then, pursuant to the Order of 19 August 199915 and the Decree of 15 September 1999,16 the 1991 Mining Code and the existing Standard Establishment Convention were abrogated and replaced by the 1999 Mining Code and a new Standard Convention for the mineral prospecting, exploration and exploitation.\n\nLaw No. 99-11 of 1 April 1999 amending the General Tax Code.\n\nOrder No. 99-32/P-RM of 19 August 1999 enacting the Mining Code of the Republic of Mali.\n\nDecree No. 99-255/P-RM of 15 September 1999 approving the Standard Establishment Convention for mineral prospecting, exploration and exploitation.\n\n[62].\n\nThe law of 1 April 1999 amended the General Tax Code and, in particular, Article 993 concerning stamp duty, which now stipulates that gold export applications are subject to stamp duty, whereas the old text provided for stamp duty only on \"import/export licences and certificates\".\n\n[63].\n\nIn a notice dated 29 June 1999, the National Director for Trade and Competition informed importers and exporters of the new regime applicable to stamp duty on import/export applications (Claimant\u2019s exhibit no. 25).\n\n[64].\n\nMoreover, the fiscal regime laid down in Article 109(o) of the 1999 Mining Code and Article 18.8 of the Standard Establishment Convention expressly provided that stamp duty would now be payable on applications for the export of mining products submitted by the holders of operating permits.\n\n[65].\n\nWith regard to the customs regime, the 1999 Customs Code no longer lays down the principle of general exemption from exit taxes granted to the operating permit holders under the previous regulations.\n\n[66].\n\nThus, the new regulations of the 1999 Mining Code appear to be more onerous than those laid down in the 1991 Mining Code and the Amended Convention.\n\nB. *Application of the Law to the Dispute*\n------------------------------------------\n\n1. *The stability of the fiscal and customs regime*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n[67].\n\nThe new wording of Article 993 of the General Tax Code, which derives from the law of 1999, stipulates as follows: \"Export applications relating to gold and cotton, as well as requests for the transfer of funds, shall be subject to stamp duty.\"\n\n[68].\n\nThe previous wording was as follows: \"Import and export licenses and certificates and requests for the transfer of funds shall be subject to stamp duty.\"\n\n[69].\n\nThe parliamentary commissions for Finance, the Economy and Planning (Exhibit 73) and the Malian administration (Exhibit 72) took the view that the replacement of the words \"export licenses and certificates\" by the words \"export applications\" constituted an innovation and the Malian Administration drew the attention of interested parties to this fact.17\n\nNotice of 29 June 1999 by the National Director for Trade and Competition to importers and exporters (Exhibit 25).\n\n[70].\n\nThe export application is a document issued by the exporter whereas the export licence or certificate is the authorization issued by the Administration.\n\n[71].\n\nThus, the 1999 wording of Article 993 of the General Tax Code of Mali constitutes an innovation in relation to the legal texts in force when the Amended Convention was signed. As such, it is not applicable to Semos, in view of the guarantee of the stability of the fiscal and customs regime the company enjoys under the 1970 and 1991 Mining Codes, as well as under the Original and Amended Conventions which are applicable to it.\n\n[72].\n\nMoreover, the new regulations laid down in the 1999 Mining Code, under which stamp duty is now expressly payable on applications for the export of mining products submitted by the operating permit holders, do not apply to Semos in view of the legal stability guarantees referred to earlier and of the 1999 Mining Code, Article 143 of which stipulates that \"the mining permits applying prior to the entry into force of the Code shall remain subject\" to the legal texts to which they relate, with the exception of certain specific matters which do not include fiscal and customs regime.\n\n[73].\n\nIn this connection, it should be recalled that Semos did not exercise the option afforded to it by Article 144 of the 1999 Mining Code, in accordance with which the company could benefit from the new economic, financial, fiscal and customs regime provided for in the new legislation.\n\n[74].\n\nIn consequence, the Tribunal considers that the new Article 993 of the General Tax Code imposes stamp duty on a document which is distinct from the one intended by the previous text. Therefore, the new taxation cannot apply to Semos. However, while it is impossible in fiscal terms to maintain an old tax which no longer exists, the Republic of Mali claims that stamp duty should be imposed on \"export applications\", on the ground that the prior practice already equated the said applications to export licences and that, accordingly, the new law does not contain any material change in this regard.\n\n[75].\n\nThough, as already stated, the Tribunal is of the view that there is a difference between the two texts, it will now proceed to examine, in the light of the Convention, what was the common intention of the parties with respect to the imposition of stamp duty on export operations.\n\n2. *Interpretation of Articles 7.3 and 9.3 of the Amended Convention*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[76].\n\nBy way of introduction, the Tribunal wishes to note that it has omitted from its considerations two of the arguments advanced by the parties.\n\n[77].\n\nThe first argument concerns the headings of Article 7.3 and 9.3, which are respectively entitled \"Customs regime\" and \"Fiscal regime\". In accordance with Article 3.27 of the Original Convention, which was not amended by Addendum No. 1 of 24 March 1992, the headings are exclusively intended to facilitate a reading of the Convention and do not have any special legal significance.\n\n[78].\n\nThe second argument relates to the feasibility study entitled \"Summary of Government revenues from the Sadiola project\" (Exhibit 75). This is a purely technical study, the findings of which are intended to indicate whether or not a company should be established or a project implemented. Its unilateral character excludes It from the contractual domain\n\n[79].\n\nThe Tribunal has come to its conclusions on the basis of the following:\n\n[80].\n\nThe Republic of Mali claims that Article 9 of the Amended Convention (which relates exclusively to domestic taxation and which, in this regard, lists the taxes and charges, payable by Semos, including stamp duty) should apply irrespective of any other consideration.\n\n[81].\n\nThe Republic of Mali argues that Article 9.3 is a special provision in relation to Article 7.3 and so should prevail over the latter. In addition, stamp duty does not form part of the exemption specified in Article 7.3 and is not collected by the Customs Administration. Stamp duty is due on the occasion of a whole variety of operations with generally no connection between them save for the common denominator of the existence of a written document. Thus, it is not the export operation which has to be taken into account but the written document signed by the parties.\n\n[82].\n\nThe view of the Tribunal is that, although stamp duty formally applies to a document, the object of the duty is not, in fact, the document itself but the right which that document represents.\n\n[83].\n\nIt is necessary to determine if, in the common intention of the parties, the exemption provided for in Article 7.3 for export operations did in fact include the stamp duty relating to such operations.\n\n[84].\n\nHowever, it is clear that Article 9.3 refers generally to the applicability of \"stamp duties\", such duties themselves constituting a disparate category. Conversely, Article 7.3 appears clearly to be a special provision, which expresses the will of the parties that Semos should enjoy an exemption in terms of exports. The exemption relates not only to customs duties *per se* but also, and more generally, to the payments effected upon the exit of the exported products. Therefore, the intention of the parties in drafting the Convention was not to effect any payment upon the exit of the exported minerals and, thus, to give full effect to the general exemption laid down in Article 7.3.\n\n[85].\n\nTo argue that Article 9.3 should apply exclusively is tantamount to restricting the scope of the exemption stipulated in Article 7.3 solely to customs duty or to the taxes or duties collected by the Customs Administration. Such a restriction would greatly reduce the effects of the provision laid down in Article 7.3, which would be contrary to the principle of the useful effect of contracts enshrined in the Code of Obligations of Mali which applies to the Amended Convention18 (Article 74.2 of the Law of 29 August 198719). Therefore, the State of Mali cannot refuse to apply the other provisions of the Amended Convention by singling out one provision (Article 9.3) of its fiscal regime.\n\nArticle 28.3 of the Amended Convention\n\nLaw 87-31/AN RM laying down the general regime of obligations in the Republic of Mali. Article 74.2 of which provides dial \"Where a clause can be understood in two ways, it should be interpreted in the meaning which gives it an effect rather than one which annuls it.\"\n\n[86].\n\nArticle 7.3 contains a general exemption of the exported products \"from any exit taxes and duties, from any export sales tax and from any other duties imposed upon exit\". This wording is broader than that for direct or indirect taxes. It expresses the intention of the parties to exempt export operations completely. Il does not contain any reservation with regard to maintaining stamp duty.\n\n[87].\n\nHowever, the stamp duties payable upon export form an integral part of the export procedure. Article 993 of the General Tax Code of Mali, whether in its old or new version, refers to documents necessary for the export operation, i.e. documents which have no object other than to permit such an export operation and which have no relevance outside the export operation itself. The rate of the duty is itself based on the value of the products concerned. In consequence, the stamp duty provided for under Article 993 constitutes a \"duty imposed upon exit\" within the meaning of Article 7.3 of the Convention. It is immaterial whether the duty in question is governed by the General Tax Code or the Customs Code, or whether the generating factor is the presentation of an authorisation request, the delivery of an administrative authorisation or the crossing of the border, or whether it is collected by the registration department of the Tax Administration or by customs. In this connection, the Republic of Mali maintains that the arguments advanced by Semos appear to confuse the structure of the fiscal administrations of Mali with those of France. However, this is an irrelevance, as the solution of the dispute has to do not with the entity which collects the duly at issue but rather with the qualification of that duly under the Convention applying between the parties.\n\n[88].\n\nIt is evidently just as irrelevant to cite the fact that, on 14 April 1987, the Republic of Mali concluded an Establishment Convention with BHP-UTAH Inc. (Exhibit 76), Article 28(j) of which expressly provides for exemption from \"stamp duty on (...) all (...) import and export operations\". Foran exemption to apply, it is not necessary for it to be explicitly stated where it is already sufficiently stipulated in a provision, as is the case with Article 7.3 of the Convention, to the benefit of Semos. Moreover, the BHP-UTAH Convention confirms that, in terms of exports, stamp duty is not a simple duty on an *instrumentum* but rather that it applies to the underlying operation and the right conferred on the exporter.\n\n[89].\n\nThis interpretation is in conformity with the objectives of Mali\u2019s successive mining codes, the aim of which is precisely to encourage investment in the sector and promote subsequent exports. More particularly, Article 99 of the 1991 Mining Code, which is applicable in this case, stipulates that exports of substances extracted, produced or transformed by the permit holders shall be exempt from any indirect internal taxes and others usually due.\n\n[90].\n\nInterpreting the contract in the same spirit, if need be, it may also be pointed out that, within the international framework of fiscal policy with regard to mining, a comparative study of the legislation of a number of developing countries has shown that, in order to encourage foreign investments, these countries have instituted an exemption from exit duties on the mining products.\n\n[91].\n\nA combined reading of Article 9.3 and Article 7.3 of the Amended Convention leads the Tribunal to conclude that the stamp duty laid down in the General Tax Code is payable at the end of the exemption period of three years stipulated in Article 9.3, with the exception of stamp duty on operations concerning the export of minerals such as gold. This applies irrespective of the name given to the documents subject to stamp duty, since payment of the duly constitutes a formality which is essential for the export procedure. Therefore, slump duty must be equaled with a duly imposed upon exit within the meaning, of Article 7.3 of the Amended Convention, payment of which is subject to exemption throughout the term of the Convention.\n\n[93].\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal upholds the claim brought by Semos.\n\nV. ARBITRATION COSTS AND FEES\n-----------------------------\n\n[94].\n\nArticle 31.2(c) of Decree no. 91-278/PM-RM approving the Standard Establishment Convention (which, in accordance with Article 4 of the Addendum of 24 March 1992, replaces Article 28 of the Original Convention) stipulates that \"the arbitration costs shall be borne by the losing party\". In consequence, the Republic of Mali is required to reimburse Semos for all the sums paid by the latter to the ICSID.\n\n[95].\n\nHowever, in view of the seriousness and the difficulty of the issue resolved by this award, the Tribunal has decided to leave Semos to pay the costs and fees of its lawyers.\n\nVI. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL\n----------------------------\n\n[96].\n\nIn view of all of the foregoing, the documents produced and the claims made by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal has decided as follows:\n\n[97].\n\nThe pursuit by the State of Mali of the proceedings instituted with a view to collecting stamp duties on the gold exports made by Semos since 4 March 2000 is contrary to its obligations under the Convention;\n\n[98].\n\nSemos is entitled to be exempt from stamp duty on gold export applications, licences or certificates throughout the term of the Amended Convention;\n\n[99].\n\nIn consequence, the Tribunal:\n\n- orders the Republic of Mali to reimburse to Semos the stamp duty unduly collected on the export applications already submitted by Semos which, as at 13 September 2002, amounted to CFA 1,800,024,000;\n\n- orders the Republic of Mali to pay all the costs and expenses of the arbitration, with the exception of the legal fees incurred by Semos, which shall be borne by the latter;\n\n- dismisses all other claims by the parties."}]}
