BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE**\n---------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nAccording to the Notice of Arbitration, the dispute arises from the enactment and enforcement by the Respondent of the *Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011* and the effect it has on investments in Australia owned or controlled by the Claimant. The Claimant alleges, *inter alia*, that \"[t]he plain packaging legislation bars the use of intellectual property on tobacco products and packaging, transforming [the Claimant's wholly owned subsidiary] from a manufacturer of branded products to a manufacturer of commoditized products with the consequential effect of substantially diminishing the value of [the Claimant's] investments in Australia.\"3\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 1.5.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant seeks declaratory and compensatory relief. In particular, the Claimant seeks an order that the Respondent \"(i) take appropriate steps to suspend enforcement of plain packaging legislation and to compensate [the Claimant] for loss suffered through compliance with plain packaging legislation; or (ii) compensate [the Claimant] for loss suffered as a result of the enactment and continued application of plain packaging legislation.\"4 The amount in dispute is described in the Notice of Arbitration as \"an amount to be quantified but of the order of billions of Australian dollars.\"5\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 1.7.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 8.3.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n5.\n\nIn the Notice of Claim dated 22 June 2011 and the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant proposed Singapore as the place of arbitration.6\n\nClaimant's Notice of Claim, \u00b6 3; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 9.2.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 7 June 2012, the Tribunal enclosed a draft annotated agenda and invited the Parties to submit any comments on the Agenda \u2013 including an agenda item concerning the place of arbitration \u2013 by 25 June 2012.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 25 June 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that \"[d]iscussions between the Parties are ongoing, and each of the Parties anticipates being in a position to inform the Tribunal on 27 June 2012 of the areas in relation to which they have reached agreement and those areas of difference that may require resolution by the Tribunal\".\n\n8.\n\nBy their respective letters dated 27 June 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was still considering its position regarding the place of arbitration, and the Claimant notified the Tribunal that it had requested the Respondent to clarify its position in this respect by 16 July 2012.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 26 July 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had proposed to the Claimant that London be the place of the arbitration, but that the Claimant had indicated that it maintained its position that Singapore be the place of the arbitration.\n\n10.\n\nOn 30 July 2012, the Tribunal held a First Procedural Meeting in Singapore. Present at the Meeting were:\n\n**The Tribunal** :\n\nProfessor Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel\n\nProfessor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler\n\nProfessor Donald M. McRae\n\n**For the Claimant** :\n\nMr. Joe Smouha QC\n\nMr. David Williams QC\n\nMr. Simon Foote\n\nMr. Peter O'Donahoo\n\nMr. Ricardo E.

SUMMARY OF THE CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES REGARDING THE PLACE OF ARBITRATION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1.** ***The Claimant's Position***\n------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant proposes that Singapore be designated as the place of arbitration. The Claimant points to Article 18(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which states that if the parties have not agreed on the place of arbitration, the Tribunal will determine the place of arbitration \"having regard to the circumstances of the case\", submitting that the phrase \"\u2018circumstances of the case' is of the widest import.\"7 The Claimant relies on the 1996 UNCITRAL Notes on Organising Arbitral Proceedings as well as *Ethyl Corporation v. Canada* to set out five relevant factors in deciding on the seat of arbitration and examines how Singapore satisfies each of these factors.8 The five factors are: (a) the suitability of the law on arbitration of the place of arbitration, (b) whether there is a multilateral or bilateral treaty on enforcement of arbitral awards between the State where the arbitration takes place and the State where the award may have to be enforced, (c) convenience of the parties and the arbitrators, including the travel distances, (d) availability and the cost of support services needed, and (e) location of the subject matter in dispute and proximity of the evidence.9\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 37; First Procedural Meeting Transcript, 30 July 2012 (\"Transcript\") p. 9:3-12, citing *Ethyl Corporation v. Canada*, Decision on the Place of Arbitration, 28 November 1997, 7 ICSID Reports (\"*Ethyl*\").\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 37.\n\n15.\n\nRegarding the suitability of the arbitration law of the place of arbitration, the Claimant submits that the International Arbitration Act 1994 as revised in 2010 (\"**IAA**\"), which governs international arbitration in Singapore, is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985 (\"**UNCITRAL Model Law**\") with certain useful modifications.10 The Claimant notes that, since the establishment of Maxwell Chambers, Singapore has hosted investment treaty cases, citing the ICSID arbitration *Deutsche Bank AG v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*.11\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 40.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 40, citing *Deutsche Bank AG v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/02), Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Singapore, 25 August 2011 to 5 September 2011 (\"*Deutsche Bank*\").\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant counters the Respondent's submission that \"London is a well-established seat of investor-State arbitration with a judicial system experienced in such matters\" arguing that, while London is a leading seat for international commercial arbitrations, London is not more prominent than Paris, The Hague, or Stockholm when it comes to investment treaty arbitrations under the UNCITRAL Rules.12 The Claimant notes that it is only aware of three investment treaty cases that have come before the courts of England; there is thus no body of jurisprudence that would make English courts superior to Singapore courts in terms of experience.13 The Claimant takes issue with the impression that the historical experience of English courts in commercial matters makes them qualified to oversee the present proceedings.14 The Claimant notes that in the *Ethyl* case, when looking at the suitability of places in the United States or Canada as a seat for the arbitration, the tribunal held that the fact that New York arbitral law has been in place longer than Canada's Commercial Arbitration Act and was therefore more judicially elaborated did not affect the comparative suitability of both laws.15\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, at \u00b6 41; Transcript, p.10:14-23.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 41; Transcript, pp. 11:1-12:7.\n\nTranscript, pp. 12:14-13:20.\n\nTranscript, p. 13:3-20; Claimant's Supplementary Submissions as to Seat of Arbitration dated 13 August 2012 (\"Claimant's Submission dated 13 August 2012\"), \u00b6 5, citing *Ethyl*, p. 5.\n\n17.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant submits that, to the extent that English case law on investment treaty arbitrations is relevant, the Singapore courts can use that jurisprudence, and that the Singapore courts treat English cases as highly persuasive authority.16 According to the Claimant, \"in the field of arbitration there is an underlying unity between English arbitration law and Singapore arbitration law.\"17 The Claimant cites the Singapore Court of Appeal which stated that since the IAA incorporates provisions from the English Arbitration Act and since both acts are based on the UNCITRAL Model Law, the legislative background to the English Act is \"of some relevance\" to understand the taxonomy of the IAA.18\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 42; Claimant's Submission dated 13 August 2012, \u00b6 6.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 42, citing Merkin & Hjalmarsson, *Singapore Arbitration Legislation Annotated* (2009) pp. 2-3.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 42, citing *Ng Chin Siau and others v. How Kim Chuan* [2007] SGCA 46, p. 38; Transcript, pp.13:21-14:20.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant further alleges that the Singapore judiciary is highly regarded and has demonstrated minimal intervention and a supportive attitude towards arbitration, citing a passage from the Singapore Court of Appeal in *Tjong Very Sumito v. Antig Investments*.19 The Claimant notes that, since 2004, arbitration judges have been specifically designated in the Singapore High Court to deal with any applications under the IAA, and that \"the quality of the jurisprudence which emanates from those three judges is of the highest order\".20\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 43; Transcript, pp.15:8-16:10.\n\nTranscript, p. 16:11-24.\n\n19.\n\nAs to the second relevant factor in deciding on the place of arbitration, the Claimant notes that the IAA gives effect to the 1958 New York Convention.21\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 44; Transcript, p.10:4-6.\n\n20.\n\nRegarding the third factor, the Claimant submits that Singapore is more convenient than London for the parties to travel to since PM Asia is based in Hong Kong, its wholly owned subsidiary Philip Morris Limited (\"**PML**\") and its executives are in Australia, and most of counsel from both sides are based in either Australia or New Zealand (with some counsel holding offices within Maxwell Chambers in Singapore).22 The Claimant concedes that London is closer for the arbitrators but argues that \"Singapore is hardly remote in terms of international flights\".23\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 48.\n\n21.\n\nIn relation to the fourth factor, the Claimant contends that Singapore has established itself as a modern and cost-efficient arbitration centre, with the costs of hotel accommodation and other facilities lower than in London.24 The Claimant further notes that there is a Host Country Agreement between the PCA and Singapore, which allows the Parties to secure a hearing venue at no charge, which is not the case with London.25\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 51.\n\n22.\n\nRegarding the fifth and last factor, the Claimant submits that the subject matter of the dispute is in Australia and that a number of the Claimant's witnesses are in the Asia-Pacific Region which militates in favour of Singapore.26 The Claimant notes that a further factor discussed in leading text books on international arbitration is the neutrality of the venue, and submits that Singapore is a neutral venue as between the Parties.27\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012, \u00b6 54.\n\n23.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant contends that the amendment to Singapore's Legal Profession Act of 1 April 2012 has relaxed the criteria for *ad hoc* admission of Queen's Counsel and equivalent ranks from other jurisdictions before the Singapore courts, and that counsel must demonstrate only \"special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case\" to be admitted.28 The Claimant submits that \"it is highly likely, if not certain, that Queen's Counsel or Senior Counsel for the Respondent (and the Claimant) in this arbitration will meet this criterion and be granted ad hoc admission if necessary.\"29 The Claimant concedes that junior counsel cannot be admitted to Singapore courts but argues that \"it would be surprising and inappropriate for the choice of seat to be informed or determined by the Respondent's decision as to whom it retains as junior counsel\", noting that it \"cannot be the primary consideration, let alone the key consideration.\"30\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 13 August 2012, \u00b6 9; Transcript, p. 17:1-17\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 13 August 2012, \u00b6 9.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 13 August 2012, \u00b6 10; Claimant's Submission dated 27 August 2012, \u00b6 4.\n\n24.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant points out that two of the Respondent's senior counsel and two of the Respondent's three junior counsel are not admitted to practice in England and Wales and therefore choosing London would not allay the concern regarding professional admission for all counsel at the place of arbitration.31 In any event, the Claimant alleges that counsel for a party may change for a number of reasons.32\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 27 August 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 27 August 2012, \u00b6 8.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that possible recourse to Singapore courts under the IAA is limited and therefore the issue of the Parties' representation and the experience of the courts may not arise at all.33 In addition, the Claimant contends that the Respondent can be ably represented in Singapore courts by its senior counsel and that it would not be an unreasonable burden in an arbitration of this importance for the Respondent to retain further counsel experienced in investment arbitration who can appear in Singapore court.34 Finally, the Claimant notes that there is nothing that prevents the Respondent's junior counsel from being physically present in Singapore courts, since court hearings conducted \"not in open court\" would exclude the general public but not the party's representatives such as solicitors and junior counsel.35 In any event, the Claimant contends that the ability of junior counsel to appear in proceedings in the Singapore courts is a matter of little comparative weight when assessing the other \"factors weighing in favour of Singapore as otherwise the obvious choice as seat for an Asia-Pacific arbitration\".36\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 13 August 2012, \u00b6 10.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 13 August 2012, \u00b6 10.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 13 August 2012, \u00b6 10; Claimant's Submission dated 27 August 2012, \u00b6 8.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 13 August 2012, \u00b6 10.\n\n**2.** ***The Respondent's Position***\n--------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent proposes London as the place of arbitration.37\n\nRespondent's letter to the Tribunal dated 26 July 2012, \u00b6 1.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that there is no material difference between the applicable law in Singapore and in London and that its preference for London is \"a marginal preference and is based on two overlapping considerations.\"38 According to the Respondent, the first consideration is that English courts have some experience in dealing with investment treaty arbitration and that the Singapore courts have none.39 The Respondent notes that it is only aware of one investment treaty arbitration seated in Singapore, that of *White Industries Australia Ltd v. The Republic of India,* and that there was no involvement of the Singapore courts in that case.40 The Respondent further notes that *Deutsche Bank*, the case cited by the Claimant as an example of an arbitration taking place in Singapore, was an ICSID case and therefore the Singapore courts had no possibility of entertaining an application in respect of any claim arising from that arbitration.41\n\nTranscript, p. 20:1-7.\n\nTranscript, p. 20:9-20.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 3, citing *White Industries Australia Ltd v. The Republic of India* (Award of 30 November 2011).\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 3.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's list of cases related to investment treaty arbitrations before English courts is incomplete, asserting that applications related to a further two investment treaty arbitrations have come before the English courts, bringing the total number of cases to five.42 The Respondent claims that only the Swedish courts have been seized of more matters in connection with investment treaty arbitrations, with six applications.43 The Respondent disputes the relevance of the Claimant's reliance on *Ethyl*, submitting that in that case the tribunal was considering the suitability of the arbitral procedure at the place of arbitration rather than the experience of courts with investment treaty arbitration.44\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 4.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 4.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 5.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the second consideration pointing to London as the place of arbitration is stronger than the first, which is that counsel retained by the Respondent are admitted to practice in England and are not admitted to practice in Singapore.45 The Respondent argues that \"[t]here is a distinct efficiency in terms of cost and continuity of representation in having the seat of arbitration in a place where counsel retained in the arbitration have a right to practise and have familiarity with the system of practice.\"46 The Respondent points out that according to its understanding only senior counsel can be admitted to practice in Singapore on an *ad hoc* basis and that two members of its team are junior counsel admitted to practice in England.47\n\nTranscript, p. 20:21-25.\n\nTranscript, p. 21:1-6; Respondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 6.\n\nTranscript, p. 21:7-19.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent counters the Claimant's points on the issue of the Respondent's counsel being able to appear in Singapore courts, finding them unconvincing.48 First, the Respondent alleges that if there are no hearings in Singapore courts then there are likely not to be any in English courts either, meaning that the factor is neutral in deciding the seat of arbitration.49 Secondly, for the Respondent to hire additional counsel would be a further expense that would not be necessary if London were selected as the seat of arbitration. To appear in Singapore, the Respondent would have to apply for *ad hoc* admission for its senior counsel and engage a law firm in Singapore to instruct counsel, which is not efficient or cost-effective.50 The Respondent further casts doubt as to whether junior counsel can be physically present in proceedings in Singapore court, pointing to section 22 of the IAA, which provides that proceedings under the IAA are to be heard otherwise than in open court.51 The Respondent also submits that the alleged combined effect of Order 69A, Rule 3(2) and Order 28, Rules 1-2 of the Singapore Rules of Court is that any application under sections 12A or 22 of the IAA would be heard in Chambers.52\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 9.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 9.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 9.\n\n31.\n\nAs to the submissions made by the Claimant on the relative convenience, cost and availability of first-class facilities in Singapore, the Respondent contends that these are only relevant to the issue of where the hearing will be held, which both Parties accept may be Singapore.53 As for the factors of neutrality and the relative connection to a dispute centred in Australia, the Respondent argues that these \"militate equally in favour of either London or Singapore.\"54\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 12.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 12.\n\n32.\n\nFinally, the Respondent notes that the Claimant has not advanced any reason why London would not be a suitable place of arbitration.55\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 17 August 2012, \u00b6 13.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL'S CONSIDERATIONS**\n------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Parties' extensive submissions regarding the place of arbitration have been very helpful. All of them have been taken into account by the Tribunal. In view of the above summaries of the Parties' contentions, the Tribunal hereafter will only focus on those arguments and considerations which it considers as determinative for its decision on the place of arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nIn view of the geographical location of both Parties, it was discussed and agreed at the Procedural Meeting in Singapore that, for convenience, hearings and other meetings with the Parties should normally be held in Singapore. But, as is undisputed, this does not exclude that the legal place or seat of arbitration can be elsewhere.\n\n35.\n\nArt. 18(1) UNCITRAL Rules provides that, without the respective agreement of the Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal shall determine the place of arbitration *\"having regard to the circumstances of the case\".*\n\n36.\n\nThe Parties have indeed listed all circumstances which could be considered relevant in the present case and the Tribunal need not repeat all of them. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the preferences expressed for either Singapore or London are marginal and overlapping.\n\n37.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is aware of the criteria taken into account regarding the place of arbitration in the *Ethyl* decision, it is also aware that this was a NAFTA arbitration where a place had to be chosen in one of the NAFTA States, and also that some of the five factors considered relevant in that decision could be accommodated for this case as long as the factual site of hearings and meetings with the Parties is Singapore, as has already been agreed.\n\n38.\n\nRegarding the suitability of the law, both Singapore and London fulfil the requirements of a place for a BIT arbitration. The arbitration law as well as the judiciary, should it become involved, are well equipped in both States to deal with the present dispute. The considerations discussed by the Parties regarding the possibility of counsel to appear before the respective courts do not, in the view of the Tribunal, reveal relevant differences between the two places.\n\n39.\n\nTherefore, the question is whether some other considerations speak in favour of one of the two places. While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that factors of neutrality \"militate equally in favour of either London or Singapore\", the second factor mentioned by Respondent in that context, i.e.\"the relative connection to a dispute centred in Australia\" does not do so in the view of the Tribunal, at least if the other Party to the dispute is from Asia. Indeed, if the Parties cannot agree, the choice of a place of arbitration in Europe for a dispute between two Parties in Asia and Australia could be seen as implying that no suitable place is available in that region of the world. Both Parties agree that Singapore is such a suitable place, though the Respondent expresses \"a marginal preference\" for London. In such circumstances (Art. 18(1) UNCITRAL Rules), the Tribunal feels that the choice of Singapore is the more natural and logical one.\n\n40.\n\nSome further considerations would seem to confirm this preference. Of the factors listed in the *Ethyl* decision, the location of the subject matter in dispute and proximity of evidence, as well as convenience and travel distances of the parties and costs of support services needed would seem to speak in favour of Singapore over London, as they may not only be relevant for hearings of this Tribunal, but also for subsequent disputes before the domestic courts at the place of arbitration should such disputes arise. Finally, the PCA, which is administering the present arbitration, has concluded a Host Country Agreement with Singapore, but not with the UK or an institution in London.\n\n41.\n\nFor all of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Singapore, rather than London, shall be the place of arbitration.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n**In accordance with Art. 18(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal decides that Singapore is the place of arbitration for the present proceedings.**"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 8 regarding Decision on Bifurcation", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2014-04-14T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 8 regarding Decision on Bifurcation\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE**\n---------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nAccording to the Notice of Arbitration, the dispute arises from the enactment and enforcement by the Respondent of the *Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011* and the effect it has on investments in Australia owned or controlled by the Claimant. The Claimant alleges, *inter alia*, that \"[t]he plain packaging legislation bars the use of intellectual property on tobacco products and packaging, transforming [the Claimant's wholly owned subsidiary] from a manufacturer of branded products to a manufacturer of commoditized products with the consequential effect of substantially diminishing the value of [the Claimant's] investments in Australia.\"4\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, at para. 1.5.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant is a company incorporated in Hong Kong. [REDACTED].5 The Claimant owns 100% of the shares of Philip Morris Australia (\"**PM Australia**\"), a holding company incorporated in Australia, which in turn owns 100% of the shares of Philip Morris Limited (\"**PML**\")\u2014a trading company incorporated in Australia, which engages in the manufacture, import, marketing and distribution of tobacco products for sale within Australia and for export to New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.6 PML has \"rights with respect to certain intellectual property in Australia, including registered and unregistered trademarks, copyright works, registered and unregistered designs, and overall get up of the product packaging.\"7\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, at para. 4.1; Statement of Claim, at para. 20.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, at paras. 4.1 - 4.2.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, at para. 1.3.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant seeks declaratory and compensatory relief. In particular, the Claimant seeks an order that the Respondent \"(i) take appropriate steps to suspend enforcement of plain packaging legislation and to compensate [the Claimant] for loss suffered through compliance with plain packaging legislation; or (ii) compensate [the Claimant] for loss suffered as a result of the enactment and continued application of plain packaging legislation.\"8 The amount in dispute is described in the Notice of Arbitration as \"an amount to be quantified but of the order of billions of Australian dollars.\"9\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, at para. 1.7.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, at para. 8.3.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 15 July 2011, pursuant to Article 10 of the Treaty, the Claimant served on the Respondent a notification of claim. As the Parties were unable to settle their dispute within a three-month period running from the date of the notification of claim, the Claimant served on the Respondent a Notice of Arbitration dated 21 November 2011, submitting the dispute to international arbitration under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Rules as revised in 2010 (\"UNCITRAL Rules\").\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 December 2011, the Respondent served on the Claimant its Response to the Notice of Arbitration, in which it described its jurisdictional objections, and stated that it would \"request that jurisdictional objections be heard in a preliminary phase of the proceedings\".10\n\nAustralia's Response to the Notice of Arbitration, at paras. 29 - 36.\n\n10.\n\nFollowing the constitution of the Tribunal, by letter dated 7 June 2012, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the agenda for a first procedural meeting. The Tribunal drew attention to Section 4 of its draft agenda, which invited the Parties to consult with each other on the timetable for the present arbitration.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 27 June 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it \"propose[d] to continue to consult with the Claimant on the matter of a timetable, including the issue of a bifurcated procedure\". By letter of the same date, the Claimant set out its position that procedural economy and expediency would not favour bifurcation but that \"should the Tribunal not be minded to refuse bifurcation at this point, PM Asia considers that the question of whether there should be bifurcation ought to be argued and determined only following full memorials from each party\".\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 10 July 2012, the Respondent proposed that there be an exchange of brief written submissions on the issue of whether to order bifurcation and that, following such submissions, the issue of bifurcation would be ready for determination at the First Procedural Meeting or shortly thereafter. By letter dated 11 July 2012, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's proposal and submitted that, should the Tribunal not refuse bifurcation at this stage, the question of whether to bifurcate the proceedings should only be argued and determined following the delivery of full Memorials by each Party. By letters dated 16 July 2012, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were unable to agree either on the desirability of bifurcation or on the timing and procedure for the Tribunal to determine the matter; accordingly, each Party set out its proposed timetable.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 16 July 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it \"intend[ed] to discuss the procedure for reaching a decision on bifurcation at the first procedural meeting, to be held in Singapore (\"First Procedural Meeting\"), and that no further submissions on the issue of bifurcation would be required before the Meeting.\n\n14.\n\nOn 30 July 2012, the Tribunal held a First Procedural Meeting, in which the Parties reiterated their views and presented oral argument on the issue of bifurcation and the procedure for determining bifurcation.\n\n15.\n\nOn 3 August 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, inviting the Parties to make further written submissions on, *inter alia*, the issue of bifurcation, and setting out a timetable for such submissions.\n\n16.\n\nOn 13 August 2012, in accordance with the timetable set out in Procedural Order No. 2, the Respondent filed its submission on the issue of bifurcation.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter dated 15 August 2012, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to clarify the scope of the requested submissions on the issue of bifurcation, specifically whether it was limited to the procedure to be followed to determine whether to order bifurcation, and if the scope were so limited, that the Respondent be asked to recast its submission accordingly. By letter dated 16 August 2012, the Respondent explained its understanding that the oral pleadings at the First Procedural Meeting had been directed to the substantive issue of whether the proceedings should be bifurcated or not and that, therefore, its submission should not be recast.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 16 August 2012, the Tribunal clarified that \"the Parties' submissions on the issue of bifurcation are intended to assist the Tribunal in determining the *timing and procedure* for reaching a decision on the bifurcation of the proceedings\" without prejudice to whether bifurcation was appropriate, but that the Tribunal understood that the Respondent's position could require it to describe the content of its jurisdictional objections. The Tribunal therefore allowed the Respondent's submission of 13 August 2012 as received.\n\n19.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable set out in Procedural Order No. 2, on 20 August 2012 the Claimant filed its submission on the issue of bifurcation; on 27 August 2012 the Respondent submitted its reply on the issue of bifurcation; and on 3 September 2012 the Claimant filed its reply to the Respondent's submission of 27 August 2012.\n\n20.\n\nOn 26 October 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which it postponed its decision on bifurcation until the Parties had exchanged submissions on the desirability of bifurcation, and set out a detailed timetable for the filing of the Claimant's Statement of Claim, the Respondent's Statement of Defence, and the Claimant's submissions on aspects of bifurcation not covered in previous submissions.\n\n21.\n\nFollowing a change of the Claimant's counsel of record, by letter dated 3 December 2012, the Claimant requested an extension of the deadline for the filing of the Statement of Claim to 28 March 2013. By letter dated 12 December 2012, the Respondent noted that, if the Claimant's request for an extension were granted, a corresponding extension should also be granted for the filing of the Statement of Defence to 23 October 2013, and acknowledged that corresponding adjustments might also need to be made to the date for the filing of the Claimant's submissions on aspects of bifurcation not covered in previous submissions. By letter dated 14 December 2012, the Claimant similarly acknowledged that it would be necessary to identify a new date for the filing of its submissions on the aspects of bifurcation not covered in previous submissions.\n\n22.\n\nOn 31 December 2012, after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, in which it set out a revised timetable for the filing of the Claimant's Statement of Claim, the Respondent's Statement of Defence, and the Claimant's submissions on aspects of bifurcation not covered in previous submissions. Pursuant to this revised timetable, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim on 28 March 2013; the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence on 23 October 2013; and the Claimant submitted its Opposition to Bifurcation on 26 November 2013.\n\n23.\n\nOn 20 and 21 February 2014, a hearing on bifurcation was held in Toronto (\"Hearing\"). Present at the Hearing were:\n\n**The Tribunal:**\n\nProfessor Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel\n\nProfessor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler\n\nProfessor Donald M. McRae\n\n**For the Claimant:**\n\nMr. Marc Firestone\n\nMr. Kevin Banasik\n\nMr. Joe Smouha QC\n\nDr. Stanimir Alexandrov\n\nMr. James Mendenhall\n\nMr. Aaron Wredberg\n\n**For the Respondent:**\n\nMr. Justin Gleeson SC (appearing via video link)\n\nMr. Simon Daley PSM\n\nMr. John Atwood\n\nMs. Esme Shirlow\n\nMr. Nathan Smyth\n\nMr. Lucas Robson\n\nMr. Tony Payne SC\n\nMr. Sam Wordsworth QC\n\nProfessor Chester Brown\n\n**For the PCA:**\n\nDr. Dirk Pulkowski\n\n24.\n\nThe Agenda of the Hearing was as follows:\n\n**20 February 2014**\n\n09:00 - 11:00 Respondent's opening statement\n\n11:00 - 11:15 Coffee break\n\n11:15 - 13:15 Claimant's opening statement\n\n13:15 - 14:30 Lunch break\n\n14:30 Tribunal questions\n\n**21 February 2014**\n\n09:00 - 10:00 Respondent's closing statement\n\n10:00 - 10:15 Coffee break\n\n10:15 - 11:15 Claimant's closing statement\n\n11:15 Tribunal questions\n\n25.\n\nAfter the opening statements of the Parties, the Tribunal raised a number of questions adding that these were without prejudice to their final relevance for its decision on bifurcation. The Claimant, in its presentation slides for its closing statement, aptly summarized these questions as follows:\n\n\"1. Any need for document disclosure and testimony from witnesses and experts in the first phase of a bifurcated proceeding?\n\n2. If only some objections are dealt with in a bifurcated proceeding, how would that affect the proposed timetables? Faster or stay the same?\n\n3. If agreed that the \"no-investment\" objection is not dispositive of the entire case, why should it, by itself, be a reason for bifurcation?\n\n4. While proposing similar non-bifurcated scenarios, the Parties' calculations for bifurcated scenarios differ greatly. What explains this?\n\n5. What does Respondent's offer to forego a Reply on Jurisdiction mean for the document disclosure process?\n\n6. What would be the extent of the savings in terms of witnesses and experts at a bifurcated hearing on jurisdiction?\n\n7. How do the Parties [deal with] the opposing side's characterization of the dispute under Article 10 of the BIT?\n\n8. Does Claimant plan to contest Respondent's assertions about Australian administrative law in the context of the non-admission objection?\n\n9. Any further clarification on the factual overlap and intertwined nature of jurisdiction and merits?\"11\n\nClaimant's Closing Statement Presentation Slides, slide 2; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 184 - 192.\n\n26.\n\nThe Parties addressed these questions in their closing statements.\n\n27.\n\nBy e-mail correspondence dated 26 February 2014, the Respondent notified the PCA that two arbitral decisions that \"have a direct bearing on the bifurcation issue\" had been made public since the Hearing, and stated that it wished to draw them to the Tribunal's attention. By e-mail correspondence on that same day, the Claimant was invited to comment on the Respondent's request by 28 February 2014.\n\n28.\n\nOn 27 February 2014, the Claimant informed the PCA that it had \"no objections to the submission of [the] two decisions\" and proposed a schedule for the submission of the two decisions and the Parties' subsequent comments.\n\n29.\n\nOn 3 March 2014, the Tribunal directed the Parties that, if the Respondent wished to submit the two decisions in question, it might do so by 17 March 2014, provided that:\n\n\"(i) If the Respondent wishes to submit any comments, it must do so at the time it submits the two decisions;\n\n(ii) The Respondent's comments, if any, shall be limited to no more than five pages;\n\n(iii) Whether or not the Respondent submits any comments in addition to providing the two decisions, the Claimant will be permitted to comment on the decisions and, if necessary, provide additional authorities that relate to the topics addressed in those decisions; and\n\n(iv) The Claimant shall also limit its comments to five pages and provide them, and any additional authorities, within two weeks after the Respondent's submission.\"\n\n30.\n\nOn 17 March 2014, the Respondent submitted the two decisions in question, along with its comments on the decisions (\"Respondent's Comments on the Additional Authorities\").\n\n31.\n\nOn 27 March 2014, the Claimant submitted its comments in reply to the Respondent's Comments on the Additional Authorities (\"Claimant's Reply on the Additional Authorities\").\n\n**IV. THE RESPONDENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent raises three objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which the Tribunal, for ease of reference, will refer to as the **\"First Objection\"** or **\"Non-Admission of Investment Objection**\"; the **\"Second Objection\"** or **\"Temporal Objection\"** ; and the **\"Third Objection\"** or **\"No Investments Objection\"**. These objections will be described in the following sections only to the extent necessary to place the Parties' arguments on bifurcation in context. The Claimant does not accept the Respondent's objections, and the Tribunal takes no position at this stage on the merits of any of the Respondent's objections.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the Claimant's view that one of the Respondent's objections is properly qualified as an objection to admissibility, rather than to the Tribunal's jurisdiction (and the Claimant's position is described in detail below). As a matter of convenience, the Tribunal uses the term \"preliminary objections\" in this Procedural Order, noting that the Parties have adopted that term in their second round of pleadings and at the Hearing.\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, in the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant had made reference to certain alleged breaches of agreements under the auspices of the World Trade Organization and of the Paris Convention on the Protection of Industrial Property (\"WTO and PCPIP Arguments\"). In response, the Respondent, in its Submission dated 13 August 2012, asserted as a fourth preliminary objection that the umbrella clause under Article 2(2) of the Treaty does not extend to obligations owed by Australia to other States under multilateral agreements (\"Umbrella Clause Objection\").12 The Tribunal has taken note of the Respondent statement at the Hearing that, since the Claimant had not reiterated the WTO and PCPIP Arguments in subsequent rounds of pleadings, it would similarly withdraw its Umbrella Clause Objection.13 The Tribunal also observes that this statement was not contradicted by the Claimant.\n\nFirst Procedural Meeting Transcript, at pp. 54:24-55:17; Respondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at paras. 26 - 29.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 9:17-10:2.\n\n**A. The Non-Admission of Investment Objection (First Objection)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s first objection is that the Claimant\u2019s purported \"investment\" - i.e. its acquisition of shares in PM Australia - has not been admitted by the Respondent in accordance with Article 1(e) of the Treaty, which provides that an \"investment\" must be \"admitted by [Australia] subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time\".14 According to the Respondent. Article 1(e) of the Treaty preserves the customary international law position that a State has a sovereign right to determine the terms on which it admits foreign investment.15 The Respondent therefore asserts that the issue of whether a Hong Kong investment is admitted in Australia is ultimately a matter for Australian law and investment policy.16\n\nStatement of Defence.

Volume A. at para. 13; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 45:11-45:15.\n\n36.\n\nTinning to the admission requirements under Australia\u2019s law and investment policy, the Respondent states that, pursuant to its Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act of 1975 **(\"FATA\")**17 and an [REDACTED] the Treasurer can make an order prohibiting an investment if it was satisfied that the investment \"would be contrary to [Australia\u2019s] national interest\".19 fit order for this assessment to be made, foreign investors are required to submit a Statutory Notice and to provide supplementary information stating the reasons for the acquisition and whether the investment could impact Australia\u2019s national interest.20 The Respondent also points out that, in providing the Statutory Notice and supplementary information to the Treasurer, it is a criminal offence for foreign investors to mislead the Treasurer.21\n\nForeign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Ctli) (as at 16 February 2010) (Exhibit RLA-004).\n\nStatement of Defence. Volume A. at paras. 19-22; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 32:5-32:10.\n\nStatement of Defence. Volume A. at paras. 23 - 30; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 12:10-12:17, pp. 31:25-32:4. and p. 34:13-34:19.\n\nStatement of Defence. Volume A. at para. 32. citing S136.1 of Sch 1 of Australia's Criminal Code: Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 35:18-36:5.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that, in the present case, the Claimant\u2019s application for admission of its investment contained \"false and misleading\" assertions [REDACTED].22 The Respondent contends that, in reality, the true purpose of the Claimant's investment was to place itself in a position where it could bring the present claim under the Treaty once the Respondent had enacted the plain packaging legislation.23 The Respondent further asserts that the Philip Morris group was aware that its true purpose for the investment would be directly relevant to assessing whether the investment was contrary to Australia's national interest because the bringing of its claim, if successful, \"could affect Australia's capacity to carry out its announced public policy and/or affect its economy and community.\"24\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 14, 36 and 48 - 55; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 38:15-40:23.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 15 and 49 - 53; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 40:2441:5.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A. at para. 55.\n\n38.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent asserts that the following legal consequences arise from the fact that the Claimant's application for admission of its investment contained false or misleading information. First, its investment fails to be in accordance with Australia's law and investment policy.25 Second, pursuant to sections 26 and 27 of the FATA, the Claimant's Statutory Notice and supplementary information are invalid, and do not have any legal effect.26 Third, the Treasurer's decision not to prohibit the Claimant's investment under s18(2) of the FATA was \"affected by jurisdictional error\" and is therefore \"to be regarded in law as no decision at all\".27 Consequently, the Claimant's investment does not satisfy the requirements of Article 1(e) of the Treaty.28\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A. at para. 56; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript. at p. 12:4-12:8 and p. 43:343:8.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 58; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 13:5-13:10 and p. 43:10-43:24.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 59 - 64; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 13:5-13:10, pp. 43:25-44:14 and p. 46:2-46:7.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 68.\n\n**B. THE TEMPORAL OBJECTION (SECOND OBJECTION)**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent's second objection is that the Claimant's claim falls outside the scope of Article 10 of the Treaty because it relates to a pre-existing dispute (the \"Ratione Temporis Argument\"); or, alternatively, that the Claimant's claim amounts to an abuse of right because the Claimant cannot restructure its investment to gain Treaty protection over a pre-existing or reasonably foreseeable dispute (the \"Abuse of Right Argument\").29\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 14:1-14:6, p. 18:7-18:14 and p. 52:12-52:16.\n\n**1. The Ratione Temporis Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that an investor cannot buy into a dispute by making an investment at the time when a dispute is either existing or highly probable.30 According to the Respondent, this is precisely what the Claimant has done. The Respondent contends that, at the time the Claimant acquired its shares in PM Australia on 23 February 2011, the Government of Australia had already publicly committed (on 29 April 2010) to introduce plain packaging legislation by 2012.31 The Respondent contends that PML as well as the ultimate parent company, Philip Morris International, had opposed the plain packaging legislation by stating their opposition during government consultations in 200932 and in various other communications to Australia's Health Minister and Minister for Trade, and public speeches from 2009 to 2011.33 Hence, in the Respondent's view, at the time the Claimant acquired its shares in PM Australia, and before the plain packaging legislation had been enacted by the Australian Parliament, there was already a dispute between the Philip Morris group and the Government of Australia about the Government's decision to implement the plain packaging legislation.34 As such, the Claimant's acquisition of the shareholding in PM Australia served the sole purpose of positioning itself to make a claim under the Treaty.35\n\nFirst Procedural Meeting Transcript, at pp. 49:12-50:16; Response to the Notice of Arbitration, at para. 7; Respondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at paras. 7 - 13; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 69 - 70.\n\nAustralia's Response to the Notice of Arbitration dated 21 December 2011 (\"Response to the Notice of Arbitration\") at para. 21; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 85 - 87; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 14:10-14:16 and pp. 59:4-60:7.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 7; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 76 - 77.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 80 - 83 and 88 - 106; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 60:8-60:18 and pp. 61:15-63:11.\n\nResponse to the Notice of Arbitration, at para. 27; Respondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 8; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 73; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 108 -109, 135 - 136 and 158; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript. at p. 17:4-17:7 and p. 64:3-64:8.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 64:9-64:24.\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with the Claimant's argument that no dispute had arisen until 21 November 2011, when the plain packaging legislation passed both Houses of Parliament, pointing out that, on the Claimant's theory, there would have been no dispute when the Claimant served its Notification of Claim on 27 June 2011 and when the Claimant engaged with the Respondent with a view to reaching an amicable settlement on 12 September 2011.36 The Respondent asserts that a dispute arose as early as 30 April 2010. the day after the Government of Australia announced its decision to introduce plain packaging legislation, and in any event well before the acquisition by the Claimant of shares in PM Australia.37 Consequently, since the \"dispute\" between the Parties pre-existed the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment under the Treaty, it falls outside the scope of Article 10 of the Treaty.38\n\nFirst Procedural Meeting Transcript, at pp. 50:17 - 52:6; Respondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 13; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript at pp. 69:7-70:5.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 27 August 2012 at para. 7.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at paras. 9 - 10; Statement of Defence.

The Abuse of Right Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent asserts in the alternative that, even if the dispute falls within the scope of Article 10 of the Treaty, the Claimant\u2019s claim constitutes an abuse of the rights otherwise conferred by Article 10 of the Treaty.39 Citing *Phoenix, Mobil, Pac Rim* and *Tidewater.* the Respondent submits that an investor cannot \"restructure investments so as to gain jurisdiction under a BIT for [pre-existing or reasonably foreseeable] disputes as it would constitute an abusive manipulation of the system of investment protection\".40\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 71:7-71:13.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 73:5-73:16.\n\n43.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the present dispute, if not pre-existing the Claimant\u2019s investment, was at the very least reasonably foreseeable with a \"very high degree of probability\" at the time the Claimant restructured its investment.41 The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant\u2019s argument that it already had an investment in Australia [REDACTED]42 The Respondent contends that [REDACTED]43 [REDACTED]44\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 74:22-75:6.\n\nStatement of Defence.

The No Investments Objection (Third Objection)**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s third objection is that neither the shares in PML nor PML\u2019s assets constitute investments for the purposes of the Treaty45 In support of its objection, the Respondent makes reference to Articles 1(e), 1(b)(i) and 13(1) of the Treaty.46 The Respondent argues that the Treaty extends protection to indirect investments only where companies incorporated in a third State qualify as investors under the Treaty,47 and that therefore the assets of PM Australia and PML - two Australian-incorporated companies - do not enjoy protection as investments48 The Respondent submits that, pursuant to Article 13(1) of the Treaty, only the Claimant\u2019s shares in PM Australia would be eligible for protection under the Treaty49 (subject to their being properly admitted in accordance with Australian law and investment policies).50\n\nStatement of Defence. Volume A. at para. 189; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 18:15-18:18.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at paras. 18-19.\n\nStatement of Defence.

Volume A, at paras. 213 and 215: Bifurcation Hearing Transcript at p. 86:17-86:20.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, at the First Procedural Meeting and in the subsequent short brief regarding the timing and procedure for a decision on bifurcation, the Respondent had also argued that, under Article 1(e) of the Treaty, the meaning of \"control\" under the Treaty was to be resolved by the Contracting Parties rather than the Tribunal (First Procedural Meeting Transcript at pp. 58:1-59:7; Respondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at paras. 20-21). That argument does not seem to be repeated in the Respondent\u2019s Statement of Defence.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that, even if the Tribunal is of the view that the definition of \"investment\" under the Treaty does include investments which are owned and controlled indirectly, the Claimant cannot be said to \"own\" or \"control\" its \"investment\"51 within the meaning of Article 1(e) of the Treaty52 (with the exception of the intellectual property associated with the *Peter Jackson* brand family).53 This is because the Claimant does not have any ownership rights in respect of the intellectual property rights at issue, nor is it a party to the licence agreements.54 The Claimant therefore cannot be said to \"control\" any of the relevant intellectual property rights or licences.55 Moreover. PML does not \"control\" the intellectual property rights licensed to it [REDACTED]56 Finally, the Respondent asserts that, under the Australian Trade Marks Act. it is the registered owner\u2014 PML\u2014that is legally required to exercise control over these trade marks and the Claimant therefore cannot purport to control those trade marks.57\n\nAccording to the Respondent in its Statement of Defence Volume A at para 220 the Claimant's purported \"investment\" consists of: [REDACTED] (b) rights under a licence agreement to use intellectual property rights owned by PM Products in respect of the *choice, Wee Willem,* and *Willem II* brand families; and (c) rights of ownership in Australia of intellectual property rights in respect of the *Peter Jackson* brand family.\"\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 219.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 87:1-87:5.\n\nStatement of Defence.

THE PARTIES\u2019 ARGUMENTS REGARDING BIFURCATION**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether the Respondent\u2019s objections should be addressed in a bifurcated procedure. A summary of the Parties\u2019 arguments regarding bifurcation in general and of their arguments on the suitability of bifurcation specifically in relation to each preliminary objection is set out below.\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n**1. General Factors in Support of Bifurcation**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent submits that its objections should be heard in a preliminary phase of the proceedings, in advance of any consideration of the merits.58 According to the Respondent, its objections are serious and substantial and raise discrete issues. The resolution of these preliminary issues could therefore dispose entirely of the Claimant\u2019s claims, or at the very least, confine the scope of these claims, saving time and expense for both Parties.59 Additionally, the Respondent argues that, in light of the [REDACTED] bifurcation will allow \"immediate savings\" because there will only be limited discovery and production of documents, there will not be a second round of written submissions on the merits, and there will be no need to rely on any expert reports.60\n\nStatement of Defence. Volume A. at para. 254.\n\nStatement of Defence. Volume A. at para. 255; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 91:25-92:11.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 91:1-91:10, p. 234:8-234:19 and p. 235:11-235:14.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that non-bifurcated proceedings will be \"demonstrably inefficient\" because both Parties will proceed to develop and present arguments on the merits which may ultimately be unnecessary if the objections are upheld.61 In this regard, the Respondent recalls the Tribunal's observation in Procedural Order No. 4 that, in order for the Tribunal to be sufficiently informed to decide the issue of bifurcation, it was necessary for both Parties to present their factual allegations and legal arguments in relation to the entire case. The Respondent asserts that those first presentations now show that a determination on the merits would require an extensive factual inquiry which includes the consideration of the Parties' numerous expert reports and witness testimonies, as well as the voluminous data regarding the impact of plain packaging in the market.62 In contrast, if the proceedings were bifurcated, the Tribunal would not need to undertake the \"very substantial factual inquiry\" nor examine the \"extensive expert evidence\" as would be required for a determination on the merits.63 Moreover, the substantial effort and expense of disclosure and analysis of documents and expert testimony would be avoided.64\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 256 and 283.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 280.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 256; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 23:8-24:7.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 256 and 281; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 23:8-24:7 and pp. 25:14-26:7.\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that, even if the Respondent's objections turn out to be unsuccessful, an equivalent amount of time will be required regardless of whether a bifurcated or a non-bifurcated procedure is adopted. On the other hand, if the objections are upheld in a bifurcated procedure, this would bring the proceedings to a conclusion by early 2015 or, at the very least, significantly reduce the scope of any remaining claims.65 A bifurcated procedure could therefore potentially save time and expense for both Parties.66 In this regard, the Respondent refers to *Caratube International Oil Company v. Kazakhstan,* where the tribunal observed that, \"[w]ith the wisdom of hindsight, the majority of the costs and expenses of each party and of the dispute, both in duration and expense, would have been avoided had Respondent opted for bifurcation\",67 and asserts that the jurisdictional objection in *Caratube* ultimately concerned the question of ownership and control of the investment, which in the Respondent's view, is the same basic issue as set out in its No Investments Objection.68 Additionally, the Respondent disputes the Claimant's assertion that studies have indicated that bifurcation is only valuable in very limited cases, and asserts that the studies relied on by the Claimant must be treated with caution.69\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 282.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 285.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 283; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 26:8-27:20.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 208:20-208:25.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 204:2-204:3.\n\n50.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that bifurcation would be in the public interest. According to the Respondent, the present dispute has \"produced and is producing a deep and profound regulatory chill across the globe\" because the longer the resolution of this dispute is delayed, the longer every other state that is considering a similar plain packaging regulatory measure (including the 177 parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) will be prevented from enacting such measures.70 The Respondent contends that the Claimant does not want bifurcation because \"bifurcation might thaw that freezer...sooner and faster than it would like\".71 Hence, public policy grounds require bifurcation of the present dispute because Australia and other states \"need to know the answer\" to this \"public health measure\" as soon as possible.72\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 28:17-29:4.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 29:1-29:4.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 79:1-79:8.\n\n**2. The Non-Admission of Investment Objection is Suitable for Bifurcation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nTurning to its specific objections, the Respondent asserts that the Non-Admission of Investment Objection is suitable for bifurcation because it turns on discrete and self-contained questions of fact, Australian and international law, and goes to the foundation of the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the Treaty.73 According to the Respondent, this objection does not raise issues of the operation or effect of plain packaging and merely concerns the Philip Morris group's intention at the time of the relevant acquisition to use PM Asia to make a claim under the Treaty, as well as the circumstances leading to the invalidity of the Claimant's admission of investment under Australian law and investment policy.74 In this regard, limited document discovery and only selected fact witnesses will be required, and none of the Parties' expert evidence relates to this objection.75\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 257 and 268; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 47:2047:24.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 267; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 48:1-48:12.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 267; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 48:20-48:24.\n\n52.\n\nAs to the legal issues that are engaged by this objection, the Respondent submits that the relevant questions of law are limited to the application of Australian law concerning the invalidity of the [REDACTED] decision to admit the investment under the FATA.76 The Respondent further points out that if the Non-Admission of Investment Objection is accepted by the Tribunal, it would dispose of the entire proceedings.77\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 267; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 48:25-49:7\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 257; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript at p. 47:14-47:17.\n\n53.\n\nFinally, in response to the Claimant's argument that the Respondent should be precluded or estopped from raising its Non-Admission of Investment Objection because it was not raised until the Statement of Defence, the Respondent explains that, due to equitable duties of confidence that apply under Australian law to correspondence with Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, the Attorney-General's Department of Australia (which is responsible for defending these proceedings) was not permitted to view the relevant documents until they were supplied as fact exhibits to the Claimant's Statement of Claim.78 Accordingly, there was no delay as alleged by the Claimant.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 10:11-10:25 and pp. 50:22-52:4.\n\n**3. The Temporal Objection is Suitable for Bifurcation**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Temporal Objection is suitable for bifurcation because it constitutes a \"discrete and preliminary issue\" which would fully dispose of the case if upheld.79 Moreover, it is in the very nature of an abuse of right argument that it is to be dealt with as a preliminary issue, since a respondent should not be obligated to participate in arbitral proceedings that were initiated abusively.80 The Respondent cites *Lao Holdings BV v. Lao People's Democratic Republic*81 (\"*Lao Holdings*\") and *ST-AD GmbH (Germany) v. Republic of Bulgaria*82 (\"*ST-AD v. Bulgaria*\") as examples of cases where a tribunal held that bifurcation was appropriate for an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* on the basis that the claimant only became a protected \"investor\" under a BIT after the dispute had crystallized.83\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 14; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 270; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 52:19-52:24 and p. 79:16-79:20.\n\nFirst Procedural Meeting Transcript, at p. 52:7-25; Respondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 14; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 79:9-79:15.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6.\n\nPCA Case No. 2011-06, Award on Jurisdiction of 18 July 2013.\n\nRespondent's Comments on the Additional Authorities at para. 6.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it does not matter whether the Temporal Objection is characterized as going to jurisdiction or admissibility, since, even assuming *arguendo* that Article 23(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules excludes objections going to admissibility, the Tribunal would still have the power to rule on such an objection as a preliminary matter under its general powers in Article 17(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.84 In any event, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's argument that Article 23(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules does not apply to objections of admissibility, referring to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the UNCITRAL Working Group as well as Article 34(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.85 The Respondent argues that the cases relied upon by the Claimant do not support the Claimant's proposition: in *Methanex v. United States*, certain objections by the United States were not truly objections to admissibility even though they were so called, but were in reality applications for summary dismissal. In *Chevron v. Ecuador*, the tribunal did not seek to establish a firm rule that all issues of admissibility should be determined with the merits but intended to address only those objections to admissibility that did not overlap with jurisdictional objections.86\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 14; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 263.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 27 August 2012 at paras. 10 - 11, citing United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, Report of Working Group II (Arbitration and Conciliation) on the work of its fiftieth session (New York, 9-13 February 2009), UN Doc A/Cn.9/669 at para. 39.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 27 August 2012 at para. 11.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent points to *Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, *Mobil v. Venezuela*, and *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. El Salvador* as examples of cases where the issue of abuse of right was treated by the tribunal as going to jurisdiction rather than admissibility.87 The Respondent disputes the Claimant's contention that these decisions are irrelevant because they were rendered by ICSID tribunals under the ICSID Rules, which explicitly allow for objections to admissibility to be heard in a preliminary phase. In the Respondent's view, the overriding consideration for these tribunals was whether it would be procedurally efficient to bifurcate the proceedings.88\n\nFirst Procedural Meeting Transcript, at p. 53:5-15; Respondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at paras. 14 and 17.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 27 August 2012 at para. 9.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent also counters the Claimant's argument that there will be considerable overlap in the evidence relevant to its Temporal Objection and the Claimant's case on the merits regarding legitimate expectations, since the test of whether a dispute has arisen between two parties under Article 10 of the Treaty is in no way similar to the test for determining a party's legitimate expectations.89 In the Respondent's view, the only evidence that would overlap is the development and introduction of plain packaging in Australia, including Philip Morris' engagement in the consultation process.90 In this regard, the Respondent submits that the Statement of Claim and the Statement of Defence support its position that the factual evidence required to rule on the Temporal Objection is limited to the Claimant's knowledge up until 23 February 2011.91 The factual inquiry will focus on the contemporaneous statements by Philip Morris group officials and the group's intentions now disclosed in the witness statement of one of the Claimant's witnesses[REDACTED]. Any later evidence regarding the \"reasonableness or efficacy\" of plain packaging as a public health policy that might be relied on for a claim of breach of fair and equitable treatment would not be relevant.92 Additionally, the Respondent points out that, in respect of many of the issues that the Claimant has claimed to be \"overlapping\", the Claimant has failed to identify any witnesses that it intends to call on those issues.93 Hence, the Respondent asserts that the relevant factual and legal issues to be determined in relation to the Temporal Objection are discrete and can be resolved in isolation from the merits.94\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 15; Respondent's Submission dated 27 August 2012 at para. 13; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 222:10-222:13.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at paras. 15 and 17; Respondent's Submission dated 27 August 2012 at para. 13.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 217:17-218:4.\n\nFirst Procedural Meeting Transcript, at p. 53:16-24; Respondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 15; Respondent's Submission dated 27 August 2012 at para. 13; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 258; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 272.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 85:4-86:7.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at paras. 16 - 17; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 270.\n\n58.\n\nFinally, the Respondent maintains its position that the Temporal Objection, if upheld by the Tribunal, would eliminate the need to proceed to the merits.95 Even if this objection is not resolved in the Respondent's favour, aspects of this determination may serve to reduce the scope of the issues in contention in the merits phase.96 Accordingly, the Respondent submits that, as a matter of fairness, it should not have to participate in a full hearing on the merits before the Tribunal has determined whether the claim is abusive.97\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 223:12-223:18.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 270 and 273.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 258, 270 and 274.\n\n**4. The No Investments Objection is Suitable for Bifurcation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its No Investments Objection is suitable for bifurcation because the issue of whether the Claimant \"own[s] or control[s]\" the purported investment raises a confined legal question on the interpretation of Articles 1(e), 1(b), 6.2 and 13 of the Treaty.98 The Respondent points out that such issues relating to the existence of a qualifying investment are commonly dealt with in a discrete preliminary phase.99 The only factual inquiry that the Tribunal will need to undertake is to identify the actual \"investments\" and the nature of the claimed intellectual property rights.100\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 259 and 278; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 88:2389:6 and p. 227:16-227:17.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 22.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 278; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 88:23-89:6.\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant's characterization of the objection as \"surprising\" since the \"point is apparent on the face of the BIT\".101 While the Respondent concedes that a Tribunal decision on the No Investments Objection would not lead to the dismissal of the entire case, it argues that a decision upholding the Objection would \"considerably narrow the subject matter of these proceedings\" and would result in striking out significant parts of the Claimant's claim.102 In particular, the Respondent asserts that the preliminary resolution of the No Investments Objection will \"significantly confine, or at the very least, clarify\" the scope of the Parties' submissions, evidence and document production in relation to \"(a) the alleged \"deprivation\" of investments under Article 6; (b) the \"impairment\" of investments under Article 2; and (c) the alleged damages occasioned to investments by any breach of the BIT\".103 Moreover, in the Respondent's view, should the No Investments Objection be upheld, the proceedings would be confined to the alleged expropriation of the value of the Claimant's shares in PM Australia.104 In contrast, a non-bifurcated proceeding would be inefficient because the Claimant would have to present its case on the assumption that assets under its alleged control are covered by the Treaty's protections.105\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 27 August 2012 at para. 7.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 24; Statement of Defence, Volume A, at paras. 259 and 277; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 88:3-88:16.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 276; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 88:3-88:16.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 25; Respondent's Submission dated 27 August 2012 at para. 15.\n\nRespondent's Submission dated 13 August 2012 at para. 23.\n\n**B. The Claimant's Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. General Factors Weighing Against Bifurcation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the nature of the issues in dispute, their interrelationship, and the stage which this arbitration has reached, call for a non-bifurcated resolution of all the issues through a single hearing and award.106 The Claimant asserts that, in general, experience and empirical data proves that bifurcation is inefficient and delays resolution of disputes.107 Recent studies have found that, on average, bifurcated cases took longer to reach a final decision as compared to non-bifurcated cases,108 and bifurcation is often used as \"a mere dilatory tactic\".109\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 1.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at p. 9, heading II and para. 19; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 104:4-104:9.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 19, citing Greenwood, Lucy, *Does Bifurcation Really Promote Efficiency?*, 28 J.

The Claimant refers to Article 17(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which requires the Tribunal to conduct the proceedings so as to avoid unnecessary delay and to provide for a fair and efficient process.110 As is illustrated by the change in language from the UNCITRAL Rules 1976 to the UNCITRAL Rules 2010, the UNCITRAL Rules 2010 do not contain a presumption in favour of bifurcation.111 According to the Claimant, in fact, the presumption in favour of bifurcation was removed in the UNCITRAL Rules 2010 precisely because bifurcation is likely to result in unnecessary costs and delays, and potential prejudice to the parties.112 In this regard, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's examples of arbitrations conducted under the UNCITRAL Rules 1976, arguing that all these cases were conducted pursuant to a version of the Rules that still contained a presumption in favour of bifurcation.113 In any event, the Claimant contends that the cases presented do not analyse whether bifurcation in fact turned out to be efficient.114\n\nFirst Procedural Meeting Transcript, at p. 30:8-13; Claimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 3; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 95:8-95:13.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012 at para. 3; First Procedural Meeting Transcript at pp. 30:1321, 31:13-22; Claimant's Submission dated 20 August 2012 at para. 18; Claimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 17, citing *Guarachi America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC v.

First, the Claimant argues that this proceeding is well beyond a stage at which bifurcation would \"avoid unnecessary delay and expense\".116 More than two years have passed since the Notice of Arbitration was submitted, and each Party has already submitted thousands of pages of argumentation on all aspects of the dispute.117 The Claimant points out that in the procedural hearing in July 2012, even the Respondent itself took the position that bifurcation following a first round of written submissions would result \"in minimal efficiencies\" and save \"no cost in the pre-hearing phases\".118 The Claimant agrees with that assessment,119 and asserts that since the Parties' respective arguments have already been presented in chief, a non-bifurcated procedure would allow the argumentation to be completed with only one more round of briefs on the merits, a rejoinder on jurisdiction, and a single, dispositive hearing.120 In contrast, a bifurcated procedure would involve an additional round of briefing, an additional round of document production, an additional hearing, and a separate written finding by the Tribunal to decide on the Respondent's objections.121 Accordingly, the Claimant contends that it is unrealistic for the Respondent to suggest (based on the timetables submitted in its Statement of Defence, Volume A) that a nonbifurcated proceeding will take only 15 weeks longer than a bifurcated one,122 and asserts that a realistic schedule for a bifurcated proceeding could delay final resolution of the dispute by a year or more.123 According to the Claimant, it is also unrealistic for the Respondent to suggest that no experts will be required at the jurisdictional phase.124 Additionally, the Claimant points out that the substantial time and money that the Parties have devoted to developing their arguments and evidence on the merits are sunk costs for both Parties, and cannot be avoided by bifurcation.125 In light of this, the Claimant contends that bifurcation would merely further delay the resolution of the dispute and result in significant additional costs.126\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at p. 12, heading III.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 2; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 97:13-98:2.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 6 and 23, citing First Procedural Meeting Transcript, at p. 49:1-3.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 23.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 5 and 24 - 25; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 98:398:8.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 26.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 5.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 21 and 26.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 267:16-269:10.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 115:12-115:16.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 2.\n\n65.\n\nSecond, the Claimant avers that bifurcation is not suitable because the Respondent's objections involve facts that are inextricably linked to the merits.127 According to the Claimant, a bifurcated procedure would severely prejudice its ability to present its case because it would force the Tribunal to decide facts prematurely even though such facts are \"deeply intertwined with the merits of the Claimant's claims\".128 Hence, since the facts relevant to the objections overlap with the merits, the tribunal should adopt a non-bifurcated proceeding in order to avoid the risk of prejudging the merits or deciding in the absence of sufficient information. Bifurcation would raise the risk of subsequent disagreement as to whether the Tribunal's conclusions on the evidence in the jurisdictional phase should be treated as *res judicata*.129 The Claimant further relies on *Mesa Power Group LLC v. Canada130* for the proposition that a partial overlap is sufficient to justify a denial of bifurcation on this basis.131\n\nClaimant's letter dated 27 June 2012 at p. 3; Claimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 7.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 2; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 108:16-108:22.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 7 - 8, citing *Kardassopoulos v.

The Non-Admission of Investment Objection is Not Suitable for Bifurcation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nAddressing the Respondent's specific objections, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's Non-Admission of Investment Objection does not justify bifurcation because it is not substantial. First, in the Claimant's view, the Respondent has already taken the position, in arguing abuse of right, that the Philip Morris group restructured the ownership of PML to obtain treaty protection of a dispute already existing at the time of the restructuring. It follows that the Respondent had every opportunity to review the Statutory Notice at the time it was submitted, with full knowledge of the broader context. However, the Respondent never raised concerns about the fact that the Claimant's investments would be protected by the Treaty. Accordingly, the Respondent cannot now claim surprise.138\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 72 and 73; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript at p. 174:1174:23 and pp. 176:23-177:4.\n\n69.\n\nSecond, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent has failed to allege the facts necessary to support its objection. The Claimant contends that the Respondent has avoided the question of whether the alleged misstatement in the Statutory Notice had any material bearing on the legality of the restructuring, by \"artfully\" omitting the following critical facts from its Statement of Defence, Volume A:\n\n(a) at no point does Respondent ever actually assert that the restructuring was contrary to Australia's national interest; (b) Respondent has not pointed to anything in Australia's law or investment policy that indicates that seeking to obtain BIT protection for an investment is against Australia's national interest; (c) Respondent has not asserted that the Treasury would have rejected Claimant's Statutory Notice even if the Notice had explicitly stated that one of the motivations for the restructuring was to provide another basis for claiming BIT protection; and (d) Respondent has not asserted that, even if the Statutory Notice were misleading, PM Asia's ownership of PM Australia and PML would be deemed unlawful.139\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 74.\n\n70.\n\nThird, the Claimant points out that, at the time of its acquisition of the investment in February 2011, no legislation had even been introduced in Parliament. Hence, plain packaging could not be described as having been adopted as national policy at that point and there was no adopted national policy that the acquisition in February 2011 would have enabled the Claimant to challenge under the Treaty.140\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 88.\n\n71.\n\nFourth, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent cannot meet its burden of proof because, contrary to what the Respondent suggests, the Claimant's representations were accurate.141 The threshold of proof for such allegations of bad faith, fraud, or criminal conduct is an \"extraordinarily high one\".142 The Claimant asserts that its Statutory Notice was correct in stating that the purpose of its acquisition [REDACTED]143 The fact that the acquisition provided a second basis [REDACTED] for securing the investment protections of the Treaty does not render the Statutory Notice \"false or misleading\". In any event, if the Respondent had concerns it could easily have sought additional information from the Claimant, but it did not.144\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 78; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 175:20-175:23.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 78; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 175:13-175:19.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 82\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 82.\n\n72.\n\nAdditionally, in the Claimant's view, its statement in the Statutory Notice [REDACTED] is accurate [REDACTED]145. Furthermore, the Respondent has not explained why the availability of treaty protection is material to its assessment of whether to approve an investment, and therefore, why the fact that the Claimant did not explicitly state in its Statutory Notice [REDACTED] renders the Claimant's investment illegal.146\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 83; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 177:5-177:22.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 84; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 180:12-180:17.\n\n73.\n\nEven if the Respondent's allegations are correct, any alleged oversight in the Statutory Notice does not rise to the level that would remove the Claimant's investment from the scope of protection in the Treaty.147 The Claimant asserts that the Respondent's Non-Admission of Investment Objection merely relates to the transfer of ownership of PM Australia and PML from one foreign entity (Philip Morris Brands S\u00e1rl) to another foreign entity (PM Asia), and such foreign ownership of assets is entirely legal.148 Furthermore, there is nothing false or misleading in the information contained in the Statutory Notice.149 The Claimant contends that, even assuming that there was a violation of Australian law, the Respondent should have raised the purported illegality of the Claimant's acquisition of its ownership over the Australian assets much earlier, in the context of reviewing the Claimant's application. Instead, the Respondent approved the Claimant's investment with full knowledge of the Claimant's identity and legal rights, and the broader regulatory context in Australia.150 The principles of fairness therefore \"require [the] tribunal to hold [the Respondent] estopped from raising violations of its own law as a jurisdictional defense when it knowingly overlooked them and endorsed an investment which was not in compliance with its law\".151 The Respondent cannot now retroactively invalidate its approval of the Claimant's investment in order to avoid its treaty obligations.152 For these reasons, the Respondent's Non-Admission of Investment Objection is not substantial and cannot support bifurcation.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 79.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 79.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 79.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 81.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 81, citing *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v.

The Temporal Objection is Not Suitable for Bifurcation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent's Ratione Temporis Argument is not substantial and is intertwined with the merits.156 The Claimant contends that it is based on the erroneous premise that a series of acts prior to the February 2011 corporate restructuring violated the BIT\u2014a claim that the Claimant maintains it has never made.157 Rather, the Claimant asserts that the present dispute arises solely out of the enactment of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act and the Tobacco Plain Packaging Regulations 2011, which were promulgated by the Respondent after the date that the Claimant had acquired its investment.158 The Claimant asserts that this distinction between the \"wrongful act\" and \"conduct prior to that act which is of preparatory character\" is confirmed by numerous arbitral decisions.159 Hence, in the Claimant's view, the Respondent, by re-characterizing the claims, has sought to usurp the Claimant's right to define the nature and scope of the dispute that it submits for resolution.160\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at p. 16.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 33.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 31; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 130:3-130:10 and p. 133:7-133:12.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 133:19-138:4, citing *Maffezini*, *Gabcikovo* and *Mondev v.

Czech Republic, Mobil v. Venezuela,* and *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. El Salvador* (adduced by the Respondent), since the ICSID Rules do allow admissibility objections to be determined preliminarily. Moreover, the Claimant alleges that the categorization of jurisdiction or admissibility was not raised in *Phoenix* or *Mobil,* and that the categorization of the objection was not considered to be relevant by the *Pac Rim* tribunal.167 The Claimant also takes issue with the Respondent\u2019s reliance on Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Rules as the basis for a general power under which the Tribunal can rule on objections to admissibility, submitting that the tribunals in *Methanex v. USA* and recently in *Chevron v. Ecuador* dismissed this argument in respect of the equivalent Article 15 of the UNCITRAL Rules 1976.168 In any event, the Claimant contends, the general discretion in Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Rules is subsumed by the requirement of procedural efficiency.169\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 128:4-7 and pp. 143:17-144:3.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012 at para. 18; First Procedural Meeting Transcript, at p. 66:1867:3; Claimant's Submission dated 20 August 2012 at paras. 24 - 25.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 20 August 2012 at para. 25. The *Pac Rim* tribunal ruled that \"the Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on Abuse of Process by the Claimant does not, in legal theory, operate as a bar to the existence of the Tribunal's jurisdiction; but, rather, as a bar to the exercise of that jurisdiction, necessarily assuming jurisdiction to exist. For present purposes, the Tribunal considers this to be a distinction without a difference\" (*Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. The Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, June 1, 2012 at para. 2.10).\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 20 August 2012 at para. 25.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 20 August 2012 at para. 26.\n\n78.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's definition of an abuse of right as well as the Respondent's articulation of the threshold for finding an abuse of right.170 According to the Claimant, the Respondent \"focuses on the high degree of foreseeability of a potential dispute but ignores the main component of an abuse of rights claim, namely whether [the] Claimant engaged in an abuse by taking actions in bad faith\".171 The Claimant further asserts that it is the Respondent that bears the burden of proving the purported abuse of right, and that it has failed to meet its burden.172 According to the Claimant, the plain packaging legislation was neither inevitable nor highly probable at the time of its acquisition of its investment, and draft legislation was not introduced in Parliament until months after the investment was made.173 The Claimant asserts that, unlike in *Phoenix* (which is the only publicly available investor-state claim to dismiss a claim entirely based on abuse of right), this is not a case where a shell company was established for purposes of initiating an arbitration claim.174 Rather, this is a case where an existing operating entity (PM Asia) acquired ownership of companies [REDACTED] that were within the same corporate family.175 Hence, the Claimant's acquisition of its 100% ownership interest in the Australian affiliates in 2011 [REDACTED] merely provided a second basis for asserting investment treaty protection.176 Accordingly, the Respondent's abuse of right objection is baseless and does not warrant bifurcation.177\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 139:16-139:22.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 139:20-140:4.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 39; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 140:4 and 147:11-147:13.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 40.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 42; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript at p. 142:15-142:18.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 142:7-142:21.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 41.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 43.\n\n79.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's Abuse of Right Argument is ill-suited for bifurcation because it necessarily overlaps with the merits. It argues that, in order to assess the Respondent's assertion that the dispute had reached a \"high degree of probability\" in February 2011, the Tribunal would need to consider a broad range of factors and events, including:178\n\n- The level of Parliament's independence and the relevance of the Prime Minister's announcement of support for plain packaging;\n\n- The empirical evidence (or lack thereof) on the effectiveness of plain packaging in reducing tobacco consumption or raising awareness of the health risks of smoking;\n\n- How Australia's previous proposals to enact plain packaging restrictions were abandoned and the reasons therefor;\n\n- Australia's prior practice of adhering to its internal regulatory processes for ensuring that the legislation proposed is evidence-based and fully examined for inconsistency with domestic and international norms prior to introduction;\n\n- The relevance of criticism from Australia's Office of Best Practice Regulation with respect to the evidentiary foundations of the proposed legislation;\n\n- The criticism by IP Australia and officials within other agencies and departments of the Australian government of plain packaging restrictions;\n\n- Historical data showing the rate at which legislative initiatives embraced by the Prime Minister's office: (1) fall short of enactment into law by Parliament, or (2) are substantially revised to address concerns raised by government policy experts, business interests, trade associations, labour unions, and other key stakeholders; and\n\n- The effect of the destabilizing leadership \"coup\" and the ouster of Prime Minister Rudd on the perceived likelihood of Australia's adoption of plain packaging restrictions.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 46; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 151:2-162:16.\n\n80.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, these issues bear directly on the merits of the Claimant's argument that Australia has acted arbitrarily in enacting plain packaging legislation and breached the Treaty.179 Moreover, the evidence relating to the Claimant's knowledge and foresight of a potential dispute overlaps with the assessment of the Claimant's legitimate expectations as well as damages calculation.180 Countering an argument by the Respondent, the Claimant points out that the issue is not whether the same legal test applies to a determination of legitimate expectations in the context of fair and equitable treatment and to a determination of an abuse of right, but whether the evidence relating to the two issues will overlap.181 While the Claimant disputes the applicability of the *Pac Rim* test (which provides that a claim can amount to an abuse of right when a dispute is probable), the Claimant alleges that reliance on that test would require an intensive factual inquiry.182 As an example, the Claimant refers to the issue of the efficacy of plain packaging. Contrary to what the Respondent suggests, this issue pertains to the Temporal Objection as well as to the merits of the case, since PM Asia did not expect Australia to enact a law that had not been credibly linked to the reduction of smoking.183\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 47.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012 at paras. 19 - 24; First Procedural Meeting Transcript, at pp. 37:5-40:25; Claimant's Submission dated 20 August 2012 at paras. 27, 32; Claimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 13; Claimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 47.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission dated 20 August 2012 at paras. 29 - 30.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 20 August 2012 at para. 28.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission dated 20 August 2012 at para. 31.\n\n81.\n\nFinally, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's reliance on *Lao Holdings* and *ST-AD v. Bulgaria* and argues that both these cases do not support and in fact undermine the Respondent's position.184 The Claimant asserts that *Lao Holdings* is an example of how bifurcation can be inefficient. According to the Claimant, bifurcation in *Lao Holdings* \"failed to dispose of the case in whole or in part\", required the parties to prepare four additional written submissions and attend a separate hearing on jurisdiction, and demonstrated that objections relating to a tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* are \"inherently fact-intensive and intertwined with the merits\".185 Additionally, *Lao Holdings* demonstrates that the Claimant's Temporal Objection is not substantial and does not warrant bifurcation because such an objection was rejected by the tribunal even though the facts in that case were \"much more favorable to the respondent than in the present proceeding\".186\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Additional Authorities at p. 1.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Additional Authorities at p. 1-2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Additional Authorities at p. 2-3.\n\n82.\n\nThe Claimant distinguishes *ST-AD v. Bulgaria* from the present proceedings on the basis that in *ST-AD v. Bulgaria*, the parties had agreed to bifurcate and the tribunal therefore had no occasion to weigh the various factors for and against bifurcation.187 The Claimant also asserts that *ST-AD v. Bulgaria* demonstrates that the facts in the present case are not sufficiently \"egregious\" to warrant a finding that the Claimant had engaged in an \"abuse of rights\".188\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Additional Authorities at p. 4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Additional Authorities at p. 4-5.\n\n83.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Claimant submits that the factual and legal issues relating to the Temporal Objection should be examined only when the Tribunal has the benefit of the full evidentiary record, including documents obtained through document production orders and witness evidence, and the Parties' full briefing on the merits.189\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 47.\n\n**4. The No Investments Objection is Not Suitable for Bifurcation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent's objection that the Treaty does not cover indirectly held investments is not substantial and, therefore, cannot be a basis for bifurcation.190 The Claimant asserts that there is established jurisprudence that \"ownership\" and \"control\" cover indirectly held companies and the assets of those companies191 and the Respondent has offered no reason to deviate from such a well-established principle.192 The Claimant also asserts that tribunals have repeatedly rejected arguments \"virtually identical\" to those raised by the Respondent,193 and contends that it would be absurd to suggest that the Contracting Parties can retrospectively exclude investors that would otherwise meet the Treaty's criteria.194 Moreover, in the Claimant's view, Articles 1(b)(i) and 13(1) of the Treaty do not support the Respondent's position that the Treaty does not cover indirectly held investments. Instead, those articles are in fact fully consistent with the Claimant's position that PM Australia, PML and their assets are investments of a Hong Kong Company (PM Asia).195\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 56.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012 at para. 15; Claimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 51 - 53; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 163:24-167:2.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 53; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 167:3-6.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 52 and fn. 68.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 30 July 2012 at para. 15.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 54.\n\n85.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimant observes that the No Investments Objection in general, even if successful, would only serve to reduce the scope of the Claimant's claim but would not dispose of it.196 Even if the proceedings were reduced to determining the impact of the plain packaging legislation on the value of the Claimant's shares in PM Australia, the Tribunal would need to examine evidence concerning the extent and loss of the use of PML's intellectual property rights since this loss will impact on the value of PM Australia's shares.197 The Claimant points out that the Respondent itself concedes that its No Investments Objection will not dispose of the case.198\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 20 August 2012 at para. 37; Claimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 14 and 57.\n\nClaimant's Submission dated 20 August 2012 at para. 37; Claimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 14 and 57; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 169:1-169:12.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 58, citing Statement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 253; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 169:1-169:8.\n\n86.\n\nTurning to the Respondent's argument that PML's trademark licences are not \"investments\" under the Treaty, the Claimant asserts that such an argument is meritless.199 The Claimant contends that these licences are intellectual property rights that constitute protected investments, and points out that the definition of \"investment\" under Article 1(e) of the Treaty includes \"rights with respect to copyright, patents, trademarks, trade names, industrial designs, knowhow and goodwill\", \"licences and other rights conferred by law or under contract\", and even more broadly, \"every kind of asset\".200 Accordingly, the licences in question are assets indirectly owned and controlled by the Claimant by virtue of its indirect ownership of PML, and constitute investments protected under the Treaty.201 Additionally, the Claimant finds \"absurd\" the Respondent's proposition that those licences are controlled by the owners and not by PML or PM Asia, because PML and PM Asia have in fact decided how to deploy the various trademarks in the Australian market for years and that was the purpose of the licences.202\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 167:7-167:10.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 63; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 163:15-163:23 and pp. 167:13-168:7.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 63.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 64.\n\n87.\n\nEven if the Respondent's argument that the Claimant does not own or control the trademark licences were to succeed, this would not dispose of the dispute.203 The Claimant points out that the Respondent has conceded that PML owns the *Peter Jackson* brand and its associated trademarks, and that the Claimant therefore owns and controls the *Peter Jackson* brand by virtue of its indirect ownership and control of PML.204 Accordingly, the Claimant would still be able to claim damages with respect to the *Peter Jackson* brand, and the Tribunal would still be called upon to address all the legal and factual issues described in the Statement of Claim.205\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 66; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 168:19-168:25.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 14 and 66; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 169:13169:23.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at para. 66; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at pp. 169:24-170:6.\n\n88.\n\nFinally, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent's objections relating to the Claimant's lack of ownership and control over its investments factually overlaps with the merits. In the Claimant's view, this is apparent from the similarity of the discussion of the nature of the intellectual property rights at issue in this case in both volumes of the Statement of Defence.206 Accordingly, the Respondent's No Investments Objection cannot justify bifurcation.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 68 - 69.\n\n**VI. THE PROCEDURAL TIMETABLES PROPOSED BY THE PARTIES**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nIn addition to setting out their arguments on the desirability of bifurcation, the Parties have proposed timetables for the subsequent stages of the arbitration for the Tribunal's consideration, both on the assumption that the Tribunal will order a bifurcated procedure and on the assumption that the Tribunal will order a non-bifurcated procedure.\n\n**A.

Neither Party would know what reliance the opposing party places on documents produced in the document disclosure phase, and additional time would be needed to respond or object to new points.210 Additionally, the Claimant contends that replacing pleadings with a round of pre-hearing briefs would remove the responsive element of the timetable and would be unfair and likely to \"lead to difficulties [and] objections\".211\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 295:25-296:13.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 296:14-297:1.\n\n97.\n\nIn the event that a non-bifurcated procedure is ordered, the Claimant proposes the following timetable:\n\na) Within **1 week** after the Tribunal refuses bifurcation of the proceedings, the Parties will confer with the goal of reaching mutual agreement on exact dates for the non-bifurcated schedule based on the framework below, but with reasonable adjustments for national holidays, pre-existing commitments of counsel, and the availability of members of the Tribunal.\n\nb) On a mutually agreed date approximately **2 weeks** after the consultations described in para.

Based on the Respondent's estimated date for the Tribunal's decision on bifurcation of 21 March 2014, this would mean that a single, dispositive hearing would commence around **20 July 2015**.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the extensive factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their written and oral submissions. The Tribunal's use of one Party's terms as opposed to the other's is not a reflection of the Tribunal's legal interpretation of an issue - rather, effort has been made to use consistent terminology through this Order in order to facilitate understanding. Below, the Tribunal discusses the arguments of the Parties most relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal's reasons, without repeating all of the arguments advanced by the Parties, address what the Tribunal considers to be the determinative factors required to decide upon the issue of bifurcation. The Tribunal considers, however, that brief repetition of certain aspects of its conclusions in the context of particular issues is necessary, or at least appropriate, in order to avoid misunderstanding.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal stresses that its considerations and decisions regarding bifurcation should in no way be understood to prejudice the substance of the preliminary objections or the submissions on the merits by the Parties.\n\n**A. General Considerations Regarding Bifurcation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nAs the Parties agree, the issue of bifurcation is subject to Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules of 2010 which provides that the Tribunal \"may\" bifurcate, while the preceding UNCITRAL Rules of 1976 (which are not applicable to this procedure) provided that the Tribunal \"should rule\" for bifurcation. The parties disagree on the question of what impact this change has on the issue of bifurcation in the present proceedings. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the new version can only be interpreted as giving the Tribunal a wider discretion and not providing a presumption in favour of bifurcation.\n\n102.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also clear from the word \"may\" and undisputed between the Parties that the Tribunal has the authority and discretion to order bifurcation on preliminary questions. Hereafter, the Tribunal will therefore consider whether it should use this option in the present case.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the Parties\u2019 references to decisions of other courts and tribunals regarding bifurcation. While the Tribunal agrees that taking into account such other jurisprudence is indeed helpful and appropriate, and will do so in its considerations, the present procedure must be examined in light of its own specific factual and legal circumstances which differ in various ways from the cases addressed by other courts and tribunals. In particular, as both Parties refer to the wording in the award in the *Caratube* case, it should be pointed out that, in the *Caratube* case, the Respondent had been expressly given the choice to request bifurcation and decided not to do so, which then led to the hindsight evaluation that the decision to deny jurisdiction in that case had the effect that the work on the merits proved to be without relevance for the final decision on the case.\n\n104.\n\nA further general consideration relevant for the issue of bifurcation is the fact that, indeed, already a long period of time has passed from the beginning of the present procedure. However, as both the Parties and the Tribunal are aware, this is mainly due to the fact that:\n\n- in view of the importance and complexity of the dispute, both sides agreed on rather long periods for their submissions,\n\n- as had been requested by the Claimant, the Tribunal ruled in Procedural Order No. 4 that the Respondent had to submit a full Statement of Defence, before the Tribunal felt it could address the issue of bifurcation,\n\n- the Claimant, due to its change of legal counsel, in December 2012 requested a postponement of the timetable which was granted by the Tribunal by Procedural Order No. 7 including the setting of the hearing date of 20 February 2014.\n\n105.\n\nIn this context it is also relevant for the issue of bifurcation that, in accordance with the abovementioned ruling, the Respondent has already submitted its full Statement of Defence. Thus, should the proceedings continue without bifurcation, a major part of the submissions is already available and the work involved and the period up to a final hearing would be shorter than in the usual scenario where, after a decision on the preliminary objections, two rounds of memorials on the merits would still have to be exchanged.\n\n106.\n\nOn the other hand, already from the Statement of Claim and the Statement of Defence that have been submitted so far it is obvious that, should the proceedings reach the merits phase, they will be extremely large and complex in the submissions, documents, witness and expert testimonies, and issues to be evaluated. Therefore, should preliminary objections prevail with the result that no procedure on the merits becomes necessary, this would result in a major saving of work and costs.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the Respondent's contention that bifurcation would be in the public interest, because the present dispute has \"produced and is producing a deep and profound regulatory chill across the globe\", and because the longer the resolution of this dispute is delayed, the longer every other state that is considering a similar plain packaging regulatory measure (including the 177 parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) will be prevented from enacting such measures.212 The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument, since that argument presumes that the procedure will end due to the prevailing preliminary objections. Such a presumption is not possible at the present stage of the procedure. And if that presumption proves not correct and the procedure continues on the merits, the bifurcated procedure will be considerably longer and so would be \"the chill\" alleged by the Respondent.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 28:17-29:4.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties that, for the issue of bifurcation, it is relevant whether the Respondent's objections involve facts that are inextricably linked to the merits. The Parties disagree in this regard and the Tribunal will consider this aspect when, hereafter, examining the three objections raised by the Respondent. In that context, it will have to be examined whether, as alleged by the Claimant, a bifurcated procedure would severely prejudice its ability to present its case since the facts relevant to the objections overlap with the merits. The Tribunal is aware that it cannot be excluded that, in case of bifurcation, the Parties in the first phase would submit arguments and evidence which the Tribunal would consider to belong to the merits. In such a case, in so far as the Tribunal considers submissions to exclusively deal with the merits, it will not consider them in a first phase of the procedure. On the other hand, in so far as the Tribunal considers submissions to deal both with preliminary objections and the merits, the Tribunal may use its discretion under Article 17 and 23(3) UNCITRAL Rules to join the objection to the merits in the event there is a merits procedure, in order to ensure that any decision on the preliminary objections neither prejudges the merits nor is taken in the absence of sufficient information. These considerations will be taken into account in the Tribunal's examination of the three objections hereafter.\n\n109.\n\nIn accordance with both Parties' suggestions,213 the Tribunal's examination of the three Objections will be based on the following three criteria:\n\n1) Is the objection *prima facie* serious and substantial?\n\n2) Can the objection be examined without prejudging or entering the merits?\n\n3) Could the objection, if successful, dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised?\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 19:4-19:16 and 101:3-102:6.\n\n**B. Bifurcation Regarding the Non-Admission of Investment Objection (First Objection) ?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondent's First Objection is that the Claimant's purported \"investment\" - i.e. its acquisition of shares in PM Australia - has not been admitted by the Respondent in accordance with Article 1(e) of the Treaty, which provides that an \"investment\" must be \"admitted by [Australia] subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time\".\n\n111.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal does not agree with the Claimant's argument that this Objection is not substantial. While the various reasons put forward by the Claimant as to why this Objection is not justified are indeed serious, so are the reasons submitted by the Respondent for the justification of this Objection. The Tribunal cannot *prima facie* exclude that this Objection might be successful.\n\n112.\n\nRegarding the Claimant's view that there is a significant overlap between the evidence relevant to this objection and the evidence on the merits, the Tribunal is not persuaded that a hearing in a bifurcated procedure dealing with this First Objection would have to include major aspects of the merits. The issues mentioned by the Claimant in this context are an analysis of what Australia's national interest was, whether Australia had a strong BIT program that encouraged foreign investment and investor-State arbitration, whether plain packaging was not supported by empirical evidence, whether there was any basis to believe that plain packaging would advance the government's health objectives, whether plain packaging was against Australia's international obligations, and whether plain packaging could result in increased rather than reduced tobacco consumption and would cause enormous damage to the industry. All of these could be distinguished from the mere admission issue. On the other hand, the Claimant's further question of whether plain packaging legislation had been introduced in Parliament could be examined without entering into any merits issue.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Non-Admission of Investment Objection is suitable for bifurcation because it concerns the foundation of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the Treaty. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it can be considered as a discrete and self-contained question both factually and legally limited to the application of Australian law concerning the invalidity of the [REDACTED] decision to admit the investment under the FATA and its relevance under both Australian and international law.\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that it cannot be excluded that, in case of bifurcation, the Parties in the first phase would submit arguments and evidence which the Tribunal considers to belong to the merits. In such a case, the consequences described in paragraph 108 above may apply.\n\n115.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers, and the Parties seem to agree in this regard, that if the NonAdmission of Investment Objection were upheld by the Tribunal, it would dispose of the entire proceedings.\n\n116.\n\nTherefore the Tribunal, using its discretion under Article 23(3), concludes that bifurcation regarding this First Objection is appropriate.\n\n**C. Bifurcation Regarding the Temporal Objection (Second Objection) ?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s second objection is that the Claimant\u2019s claim falls outside the scope of Article 10 of the Treaty because it relates to a pre-existing dispute (the \"**Ratione Temporis Argument**\"); or, alternatively, that the Claimant\u2019s claim amounts to an abuse of right because, the Claimant cannot restructure its investment to gain Treaty protection over a pre-existing or reasonably foreseeable dispute (the \"**Abuse of Right Argument**\").\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, at least for the issue of bifurcation, it does not matter whether the Temporal Objection is characterized as going to jurisdiction or admissibility, since, even assuming that Article 23(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules addresses only jurisdiction and not admissibility, the Tribunal would still have the power to rule on such an objection as a preliminary matter under its general powers in Article 17(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. In that context, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the general discretion in Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Rules is subsumed by the requirement of procedural efficiency. But this requirement may indeed be used to bifurcate in order to end the procedure at the phase of preliminary objections if that saves the very considerable work and time that would be needed for a procedure on the merits.\n\n119.\n\nMost of the arguments put forward by the Claimant against bifurcation regarding this Second Objection are in fact arguments suggesting that both the Ratione Temporis Argument and the Abuse of Right Argument are unjustified. Again, while the Claimant's various reasons are indeed serious, so are the reasons submitted by the Respondent for the justification of this Objection. The Tribunal cannot *prima facie* exclude that this Objection might be successful.\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimant's argument (*see* particularly the Claimant's summary on Slide 7 presented with its Opening Statement at the Hearing) that, if it were to decide that the dispute arose out of facts other than or earlier in time than the enactment of the plain packaging measures, it will inevitably require extensive argumentation from the Parties on numerous facts that overlap with the merits of the case. In the Tribunal's view, the examination could be restricted to facts showing whether a dispute existed prior to the time the Claimant acquired ownership of the Australian assets in February 2011. Resolving those limited factual issues during a preliminary phase of a bifurcated proceeding would not prejudice the Claimant's ability to present its case on the merits, if a merits procedure follows. This also applies to the Respondent's Abuse of Right Argument in so far as the allegedly abusive conduct may serve to obtain jurisdiction. Such a procedural abuse of rights would indeed be very suitable for bifurcation, since a respondent should not be obligated to participate in arbitral proceedings that were initiated abusively.\n\n121.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal is aware that it cannot be excluded that, in case of bifurcation, the Parties, in the first phase, would submit arguments and evidence which the Tribunal considers as belonging to the merits. And again, in such a case, the consequences described in paragraph 108 above may apply.\n\n122.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers, and the Parties seem to agree in this regard, that if the Temporal Objection is upheld by the Tribunal, it would dispose of the entire proceedings.\n\n123.\n\nTherefore the Tribunal, using its discretion under Article 23(3), concludes that bifurcation regarding this Second Objection is appropriate.\n\n**D. Bifurcation Regarding the No Investments Objection (Third Objection) ?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent's Third Objection is that neither the shares in PML nor PML's assets constitute \"investments\" for the purposes of the BIT under Articles 1(e), 1(b)(i) and 13(1).\n\n125.\n\nMost of the arguments put forward by the Parties on bifurcation regarding this Third Objection are in fact arguments suggesting that the Respondent's arguments are either justified or unjustified in substance. Again, while the Claimant's various reasons are indeed serious, so are the reasons submitted by the Respondent for the justification of this Objection. The Tribunal cannot *prima facie* exclude that this Objection might be successful.\n\n126.\n\nRegarding the question whether this Objection can be distinguished from the merits, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the Respondent's objections relating to the Claimant's lack of ownership and control over its investments factually largely overlaps with the merits. Indeed, this is apparent from the similarity of the discussion of the nature of the intellectual property rights at issue in this case in both volumes of the Statement of Defence.\n\n127.\n\nFinally, regarding the question whether this Third Objection, if found justified, would dispose of the case, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent itself concedes that this Objection will not be able to do so. In its reasoning that the definition of \"investment\" under the Treaty does not include investments which are owned and controlled indirectly, and that the Claimant cannot be said to \"own\" or \"control\" its \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 1(e) of the Treaty,214 the Respondent expressly adds \"(with the exception of the intellectual property associated with the Peter Jackson brand family)\". The Respondent has conceded that PML owns the *Peter Jackson* brand and its associated trademarks, and that the Claimant therefore owns and controls the *Peter Jackson* brand by virtue of its indirect ownership and control of PML.215 Accordingly, the Claimant would still be able to claim damages with respect to the *Peter Jackson* brand, and the Tribunal would still be called upon to address all the respective legal and factual issues described in the Statement of Claim.\n\nStatement of Defence, Volume A, at para. 219.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to Bifurcation, at paras. 14 and 66; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, at p. 169:13169:23.\n\n128.\n\nThus, even if the Respondent's argument that the Claimant does not own or control the trademark licences were to succeed, this would not dispose of the dispute.\n\n129.\n\nTherefore, the two following scenarios are possible:\n\n- First, if either the Respondent's First or Second Objection is upheld by the Tribunal, that decision would dispose of the case with the result that the Third Objection is not relevant any more.\n\n- Second, if both the Respondent's First and Second Objections are *not* upheld, the procedure will have to continue to the merits irrespective of the Tribunal's conclusion regarding the Third Objection, because it alone cannot dispose of the dispute.\n\n130.\n\nIn view of the considerable overlap between this Third Objection and the merits, and as this Objection could not in any event dispose of the case, the Tribunal considers it appropriate not to deal with this Third Objection in the first phase of the bifurcated proceedings, but to join that Third Objection to the merits in the event that the First and Second Objections are not upheld by the Tribunal and the procedure continues to the merits.\n\n**E. Conclusion Regarding Bifurcation and Resulting Timetable**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusions from the above considerations are that:\n\n- The proceedings shall be bifurcated.\n\n- The first phase of the proceedings shall deal with the Respondent\u2019s \"Non-Admission of Investment Objection\" (First Objection) and \"Temporal Objection\" (Second Objection).\n\n- The Respondent\u2019s \"No Investments Objection\" (Third Objection) shall be joined to the merits in the event that the First and Second Objections are not upheld by the Tribunal and the procedure continues to the merits.\n\n132.\n\nRegarding the resulting timetable, the Tribunal has taken note of the Parties\u2019 proposals summarized above in section VI of this Order. The Tribunal points out that the Parties\u2019 submissions and the procedure up to and including the Hearing shall be restricted to the Respondent\u2019s First and Second Objections. Using its discretion granted by Articles 23(3) and 17 UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal sets the Timetable for the First Phase of the Bifurcated Proceedings attached to this Order as **Annex 1**.\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n---------------------------------\n\n**1. The proceedings shall be bifurcated.**\n\n**2. The first phase of the proceedings shall deal with the Respondent's \"Non-Admission of Investment Objection\" (First Objection) and \"Temporal Objection\" (Second Objection).**\n\n**3. The Respondent's \"No Investments Objection\" (Third Objection) shall be joined to the merits in the event that the First and Second Objections are not upheld by the Tribunal and the procedure continues to the merits.**\n\n**4. The Tribunal sets the Timetable attached to this Order as Annex 1.**"}, {"Title": "Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2015-12-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility\n---------------------------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **LIST OF DEFINED TERMS** |\n| **ASoC** | PM Asia's Amended Statement of Claim, dated 8 April 2013 |\n| **Australia** | The Commonwealth of Australia |\n| **BIT** | Bilateral Investment Treaty (also referred to as the \"Treaty\") |\n| **Callinan Report** | Legal opinion of Justice Ian Callinan Q.C. |\n| **Claimant** | Philip Morris Asia Limited, a limited liability company incorporated in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong |\n| **December 2010 Minutes** | Minutes prepared for the Health Minister Nicola Roxon by DoHA on 9 December 2010 |\n| **DFAT** | The Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |\n| **DoHA** | The Australian Department of Health and Ageing |\n| **FATA** | Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 |\n| **FATA notification** | PMI Group's application to the Foreign Investment Review Board made on 21 January 2011 (also referred to as the \"Foreign Investment Application\") |\n| **FATA Regulations** | Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers (Notices) Regulations 1975 |\n| **FCTC** | World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |\n| **Fielding Bill** | The Plain Tobacco Packaging (Removing Branding from Cigarette Packs) Bill 2009 |\n| **FIRB** | Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board |\n| **First Objection** | Respondent's first preliminary objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, also referred to as the Non-Admission of Investment Objection |\n| **First Procedural Meeting** | First procedural meeting held in Singapore on 30 July 2012 |\n| **FITPD** | Foreign Investment and Trade Policy Division |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Foreign Investment Application** | PMI Group's application to the Foreign Investment Review Board made on 21 January 2011 (also referred to as \"FATA notification\") |\n| **Foreign Investment Application Guide** | A policy made by Australia's FIRB and Australia's Department of the Treasury entitled \"How to Apply -

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe investor acting as claimant in the present arbitration is Philip Morris Asia Limited (\"**PM Asia**\" or the \"**Claimant**\"), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong pursuant to the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance on 8 November 1994,1 with its registered address at Level 28, Three Pacific Place, 1 Queen's Road East, Hong Kong.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Claim, para. 21.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Mr. James Mendenhall, Ms. Marinn Carlson, and Mr. David Roney of Sidley Austin LLP; Mr. Joe Smouha Q.C. and Mr. Salim Moollan of Essex Court Chambers; and Mr. Simon W. B. Foote of Bankside Chambers.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT**\n---------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent in this arbitration is the Commonwealth of Australia (\"**Australia**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"), a sovereign State.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented by Mr. Simon Daley P.S.M., Ms. Catherine Kelso, Mr. Simon Sherwood, and Ms. Laura Armstrong of the Australian Government Solicitor; Mr. Justin T. Gleeson S.C., Solicitor-General of Australia, Mr. Bill Campbell Q.C. of the Attorney-General's Department, Mr. Anthony Payne S.C. of Sixth Floor Selborne Wentworth Chambers; Mr. James Hutton of Eleven Wentworth Chambers; Mr. Samuel Wordsworth Q.C. of Essex Court Chambers; and Prof. Chester Brown of 7 Selborne Chambers.\n\n**C. BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE**\n--------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nA dispute has arisen between PM Asia and Australia (together the \"**Parties**\") in respect of the Respondent's enactment and enforcement of the *Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011* (the \"**TPP Act**\") and the implementing regulations known as the *Tobacco Plain Packaging Regulations 2011* (the \"**TPP Regulations**\") (collectively the \"**Plain Packaging Measures**\"). The Claimant commenced arbitration in relation to this dispute pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of Hong Kong and the Government of Australia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 15 September 1993 (the \"**Treaty**\" or \"**BIT**\").\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant describes itself as the regional headquarters for the Asia region of the Philip Morris International group of companies (\"**PMI Group**\").2 PM Asia owns 100% of the shares of Philip Morris (Australia) Limited (\"**PM Australia**\"), a holding company incorporated in Australia, which in turn owns 100% of the shares of Philip Morris Limited (\"**PML**\"). PML is a trading company incorporated in Australia, which engages in the manufacture, import, marketing and distribution of tobacco products for sale within Australia and for export to New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.3 According to the Claimant, PML has rights with respect to certain intellectual property in Australia, including registered and unregistered trademarks, copyright works, registered and unregistered designs, and overall get up of the product packaging.4 It is the Claimant's contention that its entire business, and that of PML and PM Australia, rests on its intellectual property, and in particular on the recognition of its brands.5\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, para. 4.1; Statement of Claim, para. 20.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration, paras 4.1-4.2.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, para. 1.3.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, para. 1.4.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant alleges, *inter alia*, that \"[t]he plain packaging legislation bars the use of intellectual property on tobacco products and packaging, transforming [the Claimant's subsidiary in Australia] from a manufacturer of branded products to a manufacturer of commoditized products with the consequential effect of substantially diminishing the value of [the Claimant's] investments in Australia\".6\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, para. 1.5.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimant seeks declaratory and compensatory relief from the Respondent for breach of its obligations under the Treaty and for causing it significant financial loss. In particular, the Claimant seeks an order that the Respondent \"(i) take[s] appropriate steps to suspend enforcement of plain packaging legislation and to compensate [the Claimant] for loss suffered through compliance with plain packaging legislation; or (ii) compensate[s] [the Claimant] for loss suffered as a result of the enactment and continued application of plain packaging legislation\".7 The amount in dispute is described in the Notice of Arbitration as \"an amount to be quantified but of the order of billions of Australian dollars\".8\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, paras 1.7, 8.2.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, para. 8.3.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's claims on the merits. In addition, the Respondent raises three preliminary objections relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the Claimant's claims. Following a hearing on the question whether the Respondent's preliminary objections were suitable for consideration at an initial stage, before any consideration of the merits, the Tribunal ordered the bifurcation of the proceedings such that only two preliminary objections would be addressed in a first phase: the Respondent's objection that the Claimant's investment was not properly admitted in the host State (\"**Non-Admission of** **Investment Objection**\" or \"**First Objection**\"); and the Respondent's objection that the Tribunal was barred from considering the Claimant's claim because the dispute had arisen before the Claimant had obtained the protection of the Treaty as a result of restructuring its investment in PML or because the Claimant's restructuring constitutes an abuse of right. (\"**Temporal Objection**\" or \"**Second Objection**\").\n\n10.\n\nThe present Award is interim in the sense that the matter of costs has yet to be dealt with, and may be designated \"Interim Award (final save as to costs)\".\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe present case has given rise to sixteen procedural orders, each containing its own recitals of relevant procedural events, which are published on the website of the PCA. This section therefore constitutes an abridged summary of the course of the proceedings.\n\n**A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION AND FIRST PROCEDURAL MEETING**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 22 June 2011, the Claimant served upon the Respondent a Notification of Claim in accordance with Article 10 of the Treaty.\n\n13.\n\nAs the Parties did not reach a settlement of their dispute within the three-month period from the date of the Notification of Claim, the Claimant served a Notice of Arbitration dated 21 November 2011 on the Respondent, submitting the dispute to international arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as revised in 2010 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\") in accordance with Article 10 of the Treaty and pursuant to Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Rules. By its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant informed the Respondent of its appointment of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as the first arbitrator. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's address is L\u00e9vy Kaufmann-Kohler, 3-5, rue du Conseil-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, P.O. Box 552, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.\n\n14.\n\nIn the Notification of Claim dated 22 June 2011 and the Notice of Arbitration dated 21 November 2011, the Claimant proposed Singapore as the place of arbitration.9\n\nClaimant's Notification of Claim, para. 3; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration, para. 9.2.\n\n15.\n\nOn 21 December 2011, the Respondent provided a Response to the Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Article 4 of the UNCITRAL Rules, in which the Respondent described its jurisdictional objections and stated that it would \"request that jurisdictional objections be heard in a preliminary phase of the proceedings\".10\n\nResponse to Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration, paras 29-36.\n\n16.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent informed the Claimant of its appointment of Professor Donald M. McRae as the second arbitrator. Professor McRae's address is 57 Louis Pasteur St., Room 340, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 6N5, Canada.\n\n17.\n\nOn 15 May 2012, in accordance with Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\") appointed Professor Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel as the presiding arbitrator. Professor B\u00f6ckstiegel^ address is Parkstra\u00dfe 38, 51427 Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.\n\n18.\n\nOn 7 June 2012, having received comments from both Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 which sets out, *inter alia*, the applicable procedural rules, Tribunal's fees and expenses, language, and the Tribunal's immunity.\n\n19.\n\nBy letters dated 27 June 2012, responding to the Tribunal's invitation to consult with each other in relation to the standard of confidentiality, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was committed to transparency and did not agree with the Claimant's proposal that the hearings be held *in camera,* and the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties disagreed on the standard of confidentiality applicable to the proceedings but that discussions on the matter were ongoing.\n\n20.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it \"propose[d] to continue to consult with the Claimant on the matter of a timetable, including the issue of a bifurcated procedure\". By letter of the same date, the Claimant set out its position that procedural economy and expediency would not favour bifurcation but that \"should the Tribunal not be minded to refuse bifurcation at this point, PM Asia considers that the question of whether there should be bifurcation ought to be argued and determined only following full memorials from each [P]arty\".\n\n21.\n\nBy letter dated 10 July 2012, the Respondent proposed that there be an exchange of brief written submissions with regard to whether the proceedings should be bifurcated or not, and that, following such submissions, the issue of bifurcation would be ready for determination at the first procedural meeting in Singapore (\"**First Procedural Meeting**\") or shortly thereafter.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated 11 July 2012, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's proposal and reiterated that, should the Tribunal not refuse bifurcation at this stage, the issue of bifurcation should only be argued and determined following the delivery of full Memorials by each Party.\n\n23.\n\nBy letters dated 16 July 2012, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were unable to agree either on the desirability of bifurcation or on the *timing* and *procedure* for the Tribunal to determine this particular issue. Accordingly, each Party set out its proposed timetable. On the same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to discuss the procedure for reaching a decision on bifurcation at the First Procedural Meeting and that no further submissions on the issue of bifurcation would be required before the Meeting.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated 24 July 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that no agreement had been reached between the Parties concerning the standard of confidentiality and requested, in accordance with Article 28(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, that the First Procedural Meeting be held *in camera* and that \"all documents created or held by or on behalf of the Tribunal concerning this proceeding, including any transcript of and any other records concerning the [First] Procedural Meeting, be kept confidential\".\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated 25 July 2012, the Respondent agreed that the First Procedural Meeting be held *in camera* and that all documents held by the Tribunal be kept confidential except for those already in the public domain. This arrangement was approved by the Tribunal the following day.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated 26 July 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had proposed to the Claimant that London be the place of arbitration, and indicated that the Claimant had nonetheless maintained that Singapore be the place of the arbitration.\n\n27.\n\nOn 30 July 2012, the Tribunal held the First Procedural Meeting, during which the Parties reiterated their respective proposals for the place of arbitration and presented oral arguments in support of their proposals. The Tribunal also discussed with the Parties the regime of confidentiality that should apply to the arbitration, the procedure for considering whether certain jurisdictional objections should be considered in a separate, preliminary phase, and various other procedural points.\n\n28.\n\nPresent at the First Procedural Meeting were:\n\n**The Tribunal: For the PCA:**\n\nProf. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel Dr. Dirk Pulkowski\n\nProf. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler Prof. Donald M. McRae\n\n**For the Claimant: For the Respondent:**\n\nMr. Joe Smouha Q.C. Mr. Stephen Gageler S.C.\n\nMr. David Williams Q.C. Mr. Anthony Payne S.C.\n\nMr. Simon Foote Dr. Chester Brown\n\nMr. Peter O\u2019Donahoo Mr. Mark Jennings\n\nMr. Ricardo E. Ugarte Mr. Simon Daley\n\nMr. Marc Firestone Mr. Nathan Smyth\n\nMr. John Fraser Mr. Will Story\n\nMs. Rosemary Morris-Castico\n\n**B. PLACE OF ARBITRATION, CONFIDENTIALITY REGIME AND BIFURCATION OF PROCEEDINGS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nOn 3 August 2012, after consultation with the Parties at the First Procedural Meeting, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 which set out a timetable for the Parties to file further written submissions relating to the place of arbitration, confidentiality, and bifurcation of proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nOn 13 August 2012, 17 August 2012, 27 August 2012, and 3 September 2012, the Parties exchanged submissions on the place of arbitration in accordance with the timetable set out in Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n31.\n\nOn 13 August 2012, the Respondent also filed its submission on the issue of bifurcation in response to the Claimant\u2019s submission dated 30 July 2012. By letter dated 15 August 2012, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to clarify the scope of the Parties\u2019 submissions on the issue of bifurcation and, if needed, to require the Respondent to recast its submission accordingly. On 16 August 2012, the Tribunal confirmed that the Parties\u2019 submissions should be limited to the *timing and procedure* for reaching a decision on the bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n32.\n\nOn 20 August 2012, 27 August 2012 and 3 September 2012, respectively, the Parties exchanged further submissions on the issue of bifurcation.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter dated 12 September 2012, the Parties set out their positions on confidentiality. By letter dated 17 September 2012, the Tribunal invited the Parties to continue their efforts to reach an agreement on the applicable standard of confidentiality and set out a timetable for further submissions in this regard. The Parties, accordingly, submitted their respective proposals for a Procedural Order on confidentiality on 28 September 2012 and provided their comments on the proposal of the other Party on 5 October 2012.\n\n34.\n\nOn 26 October 2012, the Tribunal, in Procedural Order No. 3, decided in accordance with Article 18(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules that Singapore was the place of arbitration.\n\n35.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which it defined the procedure leading up to a decision on bifurcation.\n\n36.\n\nOn 30 November 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 regarding confidentiality. It held, *inter alia*, that the Tribunal's awards, decisions and orders shall be published by the PCA, subject to prior redaction; that all hearings, meetings and conferences shall be held *in camera* and their transcripts be kept in confidence; and that each Party shall be free to render its written submissions public, subject to appropriate redactions where applicable.\n\n37.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 regarding outstanding procedural matters relating to communications and submissions, evidence, hearings, language and translations.\n\n38.\n\nFollowing a change of the Claimant's counsel of record, by letter dated 3 December 2012, the Claimant requested an extension of the deadline for the filing of the Statement of Claim to 28 March 2013.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter dated 12 December 2012, the Respondent noted that, if the Claimant's request for an extension were granted, a corresponding extension should also be granted for the filing of the Statement of Defence.\n\n40.\n\nBy letters dated 12 and 14 December 2012, the Respondent and the Claimant acknowledged that it would be necessary to identify a new date for the filing of the Claimant's submissions on the aspects of bifurcation not covered in previous submissions.\n\n41.\n\nOn 31 December 2012, after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, in which the Tribunal set out a revised timetable for the filing of submissions. Pursuant to this revised timetable, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim on 28 March 2013; the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence on 23 October 2013; and the Claimant submitted its Opposition to Bifurcation on 26 November 2013.\n\n42.\n\nOn 20 and 21 February 2014, a hearing on bifurcation was held in Toronto (\"**Hearing on Bifurcation**\"). Present at the Hearing on Bifurcation were:\n\n**The Tribunal: For the PCA:**\n\nProf. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel Dr. Dirk Pulkowski\n\nProf. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler Prof. Donald M. McRae\n\n**For the Claimant: For the Respondent:**\n\nMr. Joe Smouha Q.C. Mr. Simon Daley P.S.M.\n\nDr. Stanimir Alexandrov Mr. Anthony Payne S.C.\n\nMr. James Mendenhall Mr. Justin Gleeson S.C. (by video link)\n\nMr. Aaron Wredberg Mr. Lucas Robson\n\nMr. Marc Firestone Mr. Nathan Smyth\n\nMr. Kevin Banasik Mr. John Atwood\n\nMs. Esme Shirlow\n\nMr. Sam Wordsworth Q.C.\n\nProf. Chester Brown\n\n43.\n\nOn 14 April 2014, following the Hearing on Bifurcation, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, deciding to bifurcate the proceedings in two phases and that two preliminary objections should be considered in an initial phase of the proceedings. The first phase of the proceedings was to deal with the Respondent\u2019s Non-Admission of Investment Objection and the Temporal Objection. A third objection raised by the Respondent was to be joined to the merits in the event that the first and second objections were not upheld by the Tribunal and the proceedings continued.\n\n**C. DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, SUBMISSIONS AND HEARING ON PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nOn 16 May 2014, after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 regarding the timetable for the first phase of the bifurcated proceedings, and in which the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing on preliminary objections would commence on 16 February 2015 (\"**Hearing on Preliminary Objections**\").\n\n45.\n\nOn 7 July 2014, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, together with accompanying exhibits, witness statements and expert reports.\n\n46.\n\nOn 28 July 2014, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 9, each Party submitted to the other Party a reasoned application for the production of documents (\"**Request to Produce**\"), limited to material relevant to the Non-Admission of Investment Objection and Temporal Objection as set forth by the Respondent in its Statement of Defence.\n\n47.\n\nOn 15 August 2014, after the Parties consulted with each other with a view to amending certain aspects of the process for document production, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to exchange privilege logs listing any documents that a Party wished to withhold on grounds of legal impediment or privilege (\"**LPP**\") or special political or institutional sensitivity (\"**SPIS**\") and informed the Tribunal that the Parties had failed to reach agreement on a timetable for the exchange of such privilege logs. A timetable was proposed for the Tribunal\u2019s consideration.\n\n48.\n\nOn 20 August 2014, the Claimant responded to the Respondent's letter by noting that the Respondent's proposed timetable was unworkable in view of the breadth of the Respondent's document requests. The Claimant therefore proposed an alternative timetable for the Tribunal's consideration.\n\n49.\n\nOn 22 August 2014, the Respondent conveyed to the Tribunal that it was prepared to narrow its document requests and confirmed that, while the Claimant's proposed timetable potentially left little time to incorporate certain documents into the Respondent's Reply, the Respondent was prepared to agree to the Claimant's timetable in order to avoid extended arguments.\n\n50.\n\nOn 26 August 2014, the Tribunal adopted a modified timetable for the proceedings in the form of Procedural Order No. 10, in which the Tribunal decided that the Parties were to \"limit the requests that they will submit in their Redfern Schedules to those documents that are absolutely necessary for the limited purpose of dealing with the preliminary objections to be addressed at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections in February 2015\".\n\n51.\n\nOn 8 September 2014, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 10, the Parties submitted to the Tribunal in the form of two separate Redfern Schedules all Requests to Produce that they maintained despite the other Party's objections.\n\n52.\n\nOn 19 September 2014, the Claimant expressed concerns about what it perceived as an overly broad character of the Respondent's Requests to Produce and presented a proposal to limit the scope of the Parties' Requests to Produce.\n\n53.\n\nIn its reply of 22 September 2014, the Respondent noted that \"[it] does not agree to the Claimant's proposal for the production of documents relating to control\" and requesting \"that the Tribunal... decline to make an order reflecting this proposal\", while expressing its agreement to limit the scope of e-mails that the Parties were required to review, subject to certain qualifications.\n\n54.\n\nOn 23 September 2014, the Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. 11, decided, on a document-bydocument basis on the Parties' Requests to Produce and provided general procedural direction in respect of document production.\n\n55.\n\nOn 20 October 2014, in accordance with the timetable set out in Procedural Order No. 10, the Parties exchanged privilege logs listing any documents that a Party wished to withhold on LPP and SPIS grounds.\n\n56.\n\nOn 27 October 2014, the Parties exchanged objections in respect of the other Party\u2019s privilege claims, and on 31 October 2014, the Parties responded to the other Party\u2019s objections.\n\n57.\n\nBy letter dated 6 November 2014, the Claimant submitted its unresolved objections to the Respondent\u2019s privilege claims to the Tribunal.\n\n58.\n\nSimilarly, on 7 November 2014, the Respondent submitted its unresolved objections to the Claimant\u2019s privilege claims.\n\n59.\n\nOn 10 November 2014, the Claimant objected to redactions of documents which the Respondent had produced on 6 November 2014 based on privilege grounds.\n\n60.\n\nOn 14 November 2014, in Procedural Order No. 12, the Tribunal ruled on these unresolved privilege claims.11\n\nProcedural Order No. 12, paras 4.8-4.9.\n\n61.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, the Respondent filed its Reply on Preliminary Objections together with accompanying exhibits, witness statements and expert reports.\n\n62.\n\nOn 9 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, concerning access by the Claimant to a set of documents that the Respondent considered sensitive.\n\n63.\n\nOn 12 January 2015, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections in rebuttal of the Respondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections together with further evidence upon which the Claimant wished to rely.\n\n64.\n\nOn 16 January 2015, the Tribunal sent a draft procedural order regarding details of the Hearing on Preliminary Objections to the Parties inviting them to comment thereon.\n\n65.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Respondent objected to the admissibility of new expert evidence on Australian law adduced by the Claimant, namely the legal opinion of Justice Ian Callinan Q.C. (\"**Callinan Report**\") addressing the Respondent\u2019s First Objection.12\n\nSee **Exhibit CWS-021**.\n\n66.\n\nBy letter dated 19 January 2015, the Claimant objected to the Respondent\u2019s request to exclude the Callinan Report and requested the Tribunal, as a matter of procedural fairness, to allow it to file the said Report.\n\n67.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Claimant sought leave from the Tribunal to introduce into the record a recent Award in the arbitration, namely, *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v. Republic of Peru*.13\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/11/17, Award, 9 January 2015 (\"*Gremcitel* Award\").\n\n68.\n\nOn 20 January 2015, Procedural Order No. 14 was issued, in which the Tribunal denied the Respondent's request to exclude the Callinan Report from the record and permitted the Claimant to introduce the *Gremcitel* Award.\n\n69.\n\nBy letter dated 22 January 2015, the Claimant submitted the *Gremcitel* Award, along with commentary explaining its relevance. By letter dated 25 January 2015, the Respondent submitted its response to Claimant's arguments in relation to the *Gremcitel* Award.\n\n70.\n\nOn January 26, 2015, the Parties submitted notifications of the witnesses and experts whom they wished to examine at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections. The Parties also submitted a chronological list of all exhibits and their comments on the draft procedural order that had been circulated on 16 January 2015.\n\n71.\n\nBy letter dated 26 January 2015, the Respondent, following the Tribunal's decision in Procedural Order No. 14, sought leave from the Tribunal to file a short expert report by way of rebuttal to the Callinan Report. By letter of the same date, the Tribunal acceded to the Respondent's request and pointed out that the said expert report was to be strictly responsive to the Callinan Report.\n\n72.\n\nBy letter dated 27 January 2015, the Claimant, in response to the Respondent's letter and the Tribunal's decision of 26 January 2015, noted that it regretted that it did not have the opportunity to respond to the Respondent's application in relation to a rebuttal expert report before the Tribunal issued its decision on this matter. The Claimant, therefore, reserved the right to ask the Tribunal to reconsider whether it would allow the Respondent's rebuttal expert report after having reviewed it.\n\n73.\n\nOn 29 January 2015, the Respondent filed the expert report of The Hon. Roger Gyles A.O. Q.C. focusing on questions of Australian law, by rebuttal to the Callinan Report.14\n\nSee **Exhibit RWS-015**.\n\n74.\n\nOn 4 February 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 regarding details of the Hearing on Preliminary Objections.\n\n75.\n\nBy letter dated 5 February 2015, the Claimant sought leave from the Tribunal to further introduce a short statement by Justice Callinan and by letter dated 6 February 2015, the Tribunal granted this request.\n\n76.\n\nOn 9 and 10 February 2015, respectively, the Parties filed with the Tribunal an agreed timeline of relevant facts.\n\n77.\n\nOn 10 February 2015, the Parties provided the PCA with a list of attendees at the hearing, and after consultation with each other, the Parties established a detailed scheduling proposal in relation to the witnesses and experts whom they wished to cross-examine. On the same date, the Claimant submitted a short additional statement by Justice Callinan, strictly limited to replying to the issues raised by The Hon. Roger Gyles A.O. Q.C.\n\n78.\n\nOn 15 February 2015, the Respondent submitted a further statement from The Hon. Roger Gyles A.O. Q.C., strictly limited in response to the additional statement by Justice Callinan, together with additional legal authorities.\n\n79.\n\nThe Hearing on Preliminary Objections was held in Singapore from 16 to 19 February 2015. The hearing was attended by:\n\n**The Tribunal: For the PCA:**\n\nProf. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel Dr. Dirk Pulkowski\n\nProf. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler Prof. Donald M.

United States of America*,15 and *Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*.16\n\nICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/12/1, Award, 25 August 2004 (\"*Apotex* Award\").\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Award, 13 March 2015 (\"*Tidewater* Award\").\n\n82.\n\nOn 26 March 2015, in response to Respondent's letter of 23 March 2015, the Claimant did not oppose the Respondent's request to submit the two legal authorities, namely, the *Apotex* Award and the *Tidewater* Award. By e-mail of the same date, the Tribunal admitted these two awards into the record.\n\n83.\n\nOn 1 April 2015, the Claimant sought leave from the Tribunal to submit an additional legal authority, namely, the Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility in *Bilcon of Delaware v.

STATEMENT OF FACTS**\n--------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe following is a short summary of relevant facts as understood by the Tribunal without prejudice to any legal conclusions by the Tribunal, which will be addressed in later sections of this Award.\n\n**A. THE PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL GROUP OF COMPANIES**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (\"**PMI**\") is a company incorporated and headquartered in New York, United States, which produces seven of the top fifteen cigarette brands in the world including the number one selling brand of cigarettes. *Marlboro.23* PMI owns dozens of subsidiaries and affiliates around the world (referred to as the PMI Group) and manages its business in different regions.24 including in Asia, where the Claimant has its regional headquarters.25\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 22 referring to Philip Morris International. 2011 Annual Report (5 March 2012), p. 87 **(Exhibit C-188).**\n\nSee Philip Morris International, 2011 Anual Report (5 March 2012), (**Exhibit C-188);** [REDACTED]\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 23.\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimant was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1994 and has been doing business in Hong Kong since that tune.26 On 17 March 1954. the PMI Group began operations in Australia through PM Australia.27 Before restructuring, PM Australia was owned by US-based Philip Monis group companies until 1998, followed by Swiss-based Philip Monis group companies for over 12 years.28 Before PML was incorporated in 1967. PM Australia carried on the PMI Group\u2019s business in Australia and had done so since PM Australia was incorporated in 1954. In May 1967, PML was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of PM Australia, after which PM Australia ceased to cany out operational activities in Australia or elsewhere29 PM Australia was, and remains, the owner of PML. In turn, PML operates the PMI Group\u2019s Australian sales of tobacco products in Australia, selling mainly international brands, licensed from other Philip Monis companies located in Switzerland and the United States.30\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 25 referring to the Certificate of Incorporation for PM Asia (8 November 1994) **(Exhibit C-054).**\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 27 referring to the Certificate of Registration for PM Australia (17 March 1954) **(Exhibit C-050);** see also Statement of Defence. Vol. A. para. 6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 97.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 28 referring to the Certificate of Registration for PML (24 May 1967) **(Exhibit** C-051) and the Gledhill Statement at paras 8-9 **(Exhibit CWS-001);** see also Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 6.\n\n97.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that it has controlled and managed all strategic, budgetary and investment decisions of the Australian subsidiaries, namely, PM Australia and PML. since 2001. Until February 2011, both PM Australia and PML were owned by Philip Monis Brands S\u00e0rl **(\"PM** Brands Sarl\"), a Swiss company forming part of the PMI Group.31\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 29 referring to the PMI Management Structure for Segment Reporting (**Exhibit C-223):** Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para.5; [REDACTED]\n\n98.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the PMI Group has been engaged in a group-wide restructuring process \"to reduce costs and improve efficiencies by streamlining its legal entity structure, rationalizing business process, centralising activities, and developing shared services\".32 The restructuring plan also took into account the political risk that PMI was facing in several countries including Australia with the proliferation of new regulations on packaging and marketing of tobacco products.33 Since the possible relationship of steps taken by the PMI Group to restructure its investments in Australia with the introduction of the Plain Packaging Measures forms the basis of two of the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections, these facts will be set out in detail below.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 46 referring to the Pellegrini Statement, para. 34 **(Exhibit CWS-002).**\n\n**B. THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH TASKFORCE (NPHT)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nAustralia first considered plain packaging in 1995. However. Australia initially recommended further investigations to be made. The Claimant contends that Australia refrained from adopting any Plain Packaging Measures in light of its treaty obligations and lack of evidence that plain packaging would be effective in reducing tobacco consumption.34\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 230-233.\n\n100.\n\nOn 27 February 2005. the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control **(\"FCTC\")** entered into force for Australia. Under the FCTC, States Parties are under an obligation to develop and implement \"tobacco control measures, including measures to eliminate the propensity of tobacco packaging to mislead consumers about the health effects of smoking and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship\".35\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 15 referring to Articles 5.1, 11 and 13 of the FCTC.\n\n101.\n\nin December 2007, shortly after being elected, the Australian Labor Party Government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd launched the National Preventative Health Taskforce (\"NPHT\").36\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 234 referring to the NPHT Discussion Paper, p. ii (Foreword by Minister of Health and Ageing. The Hon. Nicola Roxon MP) **(Exhibit C-080).**\n\n102.\n\nOn 9 April 2008, Australia\u2019s then Minister of Health and Ageing. The Hon. Nicola Roxon MP. announced the establishment of the NPHT to \"provide evidence-based advice to government and health providers\u2014both public and private\u2014on preventative health programs and strategies, and support the development of a National Preventative Health Strategy\" (\"**NPHS**\").37\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 74; Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para.15(a).\n\n103.\n\nOn 10 October 2008, the NPHT published a discussion paper entitled \"Australia: The Healthiest Country by 2020\". The paper proposed targets for the prevention of obesity, tobacco and alcohol, including in particular the reduction of the prevalence of daily smoking to 9% or less by 2020. To meet this target, the paper suggested to \"[f]urther regulate the tobacco industry with measures such as ending all forms of promotion including point-of-sale display and mandating plain packaging of tobacco products\".38\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 75; Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 15(b).\n\n104.\n\nOn 2 January 2009, PML participated in the NPHT consultation and stated, among other things, that \"plain packaging was unnecessary, unsupported by evidence, and unlawful\". On the same day, the NPHT consultation closed.39\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 76-78 referring to PML's Submission to the NPHT Consultation, \"Australia: The Healthiest Country by 2020\" (2 January 2009) (**Exhibit R-212**).\n\n105.\n\nIn April 2009, shortly before the NPHT delivered its report to the government, Australia's Department of Health and Ageing (\"**DoHA**\") examined the feasibility of a Tobacco Control Act through which plain packaging would be introduced.40 Accordingly, DoHA prepared a draft Regulated Impact Statement (\"**RIS**\") and submitted it for review to the Office of Best Practice Regulations (\"**OBPR**\") which is the independent government agency responsible for ensuring that \"Australian legislation and regulations rest on solid evidentiary foundation\". This proposal together with the Tobacco Control Act, however, failed because the draft RIS lacked \"proper analysis and substantiation for plain packaging\".41\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 210.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 211.\n\n106.\n\nOn 30 June 2009, the NPHT issued a report on the NPHS, listing a series of important actions, including to \"[e]liminate the promotion of tobacco products through design of packaging\",42 and \"[m]andate standard plain packaging of all tobacco products to ensure that design features of the pack in no way reduce the prominence or impact of prescribed government warnings\".43 The NPHT also issued a \"Roadmap for Action\", which underlined that plain packaging was \"justifiable, proportionate and not inconsistent with international trade agreements\",44 and identified a series of key actions in relation to tobacco, such as the need to \"[l]egislate to eliminate all remaining forms of promotion including (...) promotion through packaging (...)\".\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 15(d).\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 78 referring to NPHT, *Australia: The Healthiest Country by 2020, National Preventative Health Strategy - Overview* (30 June 2009), pp. 17-18 (**Exhibit R-193**).\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 79 referring to NPHT, *Australia: The Healthiest Country by 2020,* *National Preventative Health Strategy - the Roadmap for Action* (30 June 2009), pp. 180-182 (**Exhibit** **R-194**).\n\n**C. RESPONSES TO THE NPHT'S WORK AND THE CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nIn August 2009, Senator Steven Fielding introduced the Plain Tobacco Packaging (Removing Branding from Cigarette Packs) Bill 2009 (the \"**Fielding Bill**\") in the Australian Senate, which proposed to remove \"brands, trademarks and logos from tobacco packaging\".45\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 239; Parliamentary Digest, Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 (**Exhibit C-456**).\n\n108.\n\nOn 1 September 2009, Health Minister Roxon launched the NPHS, and released a technical paper on tobacco entitled \"Australia: The Healthiest Country by 2020\", which proposed to \"[r]equire all tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging\".46\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 80; see also Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 15(e) referring to NPHT Tobacco Working Group, *Technical Report 2: Tobacco Control in Australia: Making Smoking History* (2009), p. 21 (**Exhibit R-195**).\n\n109.\n\nBeginning at least on 2 September 2009, the PMI Group received legal advice [REDACTED]47.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 16, 124 referring to RPL doc. 299 (Category 9 document) (**Exhibit R-1058**).\n\n110.\n\nOn 9 October 2009, in response to the Health Minister's launch of the NPHS on 1 September 2009, Allens Arthur Robinson, wrote to Health Minister Roxon to express the PMI Group's concern about the unconstitutionality of plain packaging and the Fielding Bill which sought to introduce a form of plain packaging.48\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 80-81; Letter from AAR to Health Minister Roxon (9 October 2009) (**Exhibit R-007**).\n\n111.\n\nIn January 2010, the PMI Group expressed its opposition to the NPHT's recommendation that Australia introduce Plain Packaging Measures. PMI, the parent company of the PMI Group, referred to the \"lack of evidence that plain packaging will achieve its intended public health objectives\" and described plain packaging as imposing \"restrictions tantamount to expropriation\".49\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 83.\n\n112.\n\nOn 29 January 2010, PM Asia obtained legal advice [REDACTED]50.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 124c referring to RPL doc. 315 (**Exhibit R-1058**).\n\n113.\n\nIn February 2010, the popularity of Prime Minister Rudd's Government (the \"**Rudd Government**\") dropped, as evidenced by several opinion polls in Australia.51\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 243 referring to the Parliament of Australia Research Paper, p. 10 (**Exhibit C-189**).\n\n114.\n\nIn March 2010, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stated that the Fielding Bill \"did not represent government policy and that there was no government plan to introduce plain packaging legislation\".52\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 241 referring to the Letter from Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to Redacted Recipient on Plain Packaging (23 February 2010) (**Exhibit C-100**).\n\n115.\n\nIn April 2010, DoHA prepared another RIS draft and submitted it to the OBPR for review. The OBPR rejected the draft because it failed to provide any credible evidence that plain packaging would be effective in reducing smoking.53\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 212, 249 referring to the OBPR Letter to DoHA Regarding Draft RIS 2010 (**Exhibit C-125**) and the Milliner Report, paras 73-75 (**Exhibit CWS-010**).

THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE RESPONDENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that it has met all the jurisdictional requirements to bring its claim against Australia in this arbitration. First, the Claimant submits that, as a company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong at all relevant times, it is a covered investor under the Treaty.145 Second, the Claimant considers that it satisfies the \"investment\" requirement under Article 1(e) of the Treaty since it owns or controls assets in the form of direct shareholding in PM Australia and indirect shareholding in PML; PML\u2019s brands and its portfolio of brands as a whole; and PML\u2019s ownership and/or licence of intellectual property rights.146 Third, the Claimant asserts that its investments have been admitted by Australia subject to its laws and investment policies, and therefore its investments are legal under the host State\u2019s law.147 Fourth, the Claimant states that there is a dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent in relation to the Plain Packaging Measures, which have substantially diminished the value of the Claimant\u2019s investments in Australia, and that the Claimant has thus satisfied the dispute resolution provisions in the Treaty.148\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 272.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 273-276.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 275.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 277-278, 298.\n\n184.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent advances three preliminary objections, relating to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and to the admissibility of the Claimant\u2019s claim.149 The First Objection is that the Claimant\u2019s purported \"investment\" has not been admitted by the Respondent in accordance with Article 1(e) of the Treaty, which provides that an investment must be admitted by Australia \"subject to its law and investment policies as applicable from time to time\".150 The Second Objection is that the Claimant\u2019s claim falls outside the scope of Article 10 of the Treaty because it relates to a pre-existing dispute, or, alternatively, that the Claimant\u2019s claim amounts to an abuse of right because it has sought to restructure its investment to gain Treaty protection over a pre-existing or reasonably foreseeable dispute.151 The Third Objection is that neither the shares in PML nor PML\u2019s assets constitute investments for the purposes of the Treaty.152\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 3.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 12; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, p. 12:4-8.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript, pp. 14:1-6, 18:7-14, 52:12-26.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 71, 168; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript, p. 18:15-18.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal has deemed the First and Second Objections suitable for consideration in a preliminary phase. The legal arguments presented by both Parties in respect of each objection are summarised in detail in the following sections. Both bifurcated objections centre on the question whether, in the period between Australia\u2019s announcement of a decision to introduce the Plain Packaging Measures and the enactment of these measures into legislation, the Claimant properly became an investor in Australia when it acquired equity in PML in the context of a corporate restructuring in 2011.153\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 1.\n\n186.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant raises an argument that, in its view, \"eliminates every objection raised by the Respondent in this preliminary phase of the arbitration\"154, *i.e.*, it has continuously \"controlled, managed, and supervised PML\u2019s business\" since 2001,155 such that it should qualify as an investor in Australia since that date regardless of the 2011 restructuring. Given the nature of the Claimant\u2019s defence, the Tribunal considers it expedient to address this contention at the outset, before turning to the Parties\u2019 views on the two specific jurisdictional objections.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 75.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 38, 276; Statement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 167, 179.\n\n187.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal summarises the Parties\u2019 positions on the burden of proof in respect of the bifurcated preliminary objections.\n\n**A. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT HAS EXERCISED CONTROL WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE1(e) OF THE TREATY SINCE 2001**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Meaning of \"Controlled\"**\n----------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Parties disagree with respect to the meaning of the term \"controlled\" in Article 1(e) of the Treaty. Whereas the Claimant contends that oversight and management control is sufficient, the Respondent believes that a showing of a legal and economic interest in the investment is required for the purpose of establishing control.\n\nArticle 1(e) of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n\"investment\" means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one Contracting Party and admitted by the other Contracting Party subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time...\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, a physical person or company shall be regarded as controlling a company or an investment if the person or company has a substantial interest in the company or the investment.\n\n***(a) The Meaning of the Term \"Controlled\" in Accordance with Article 31 VCLT***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that Article 1(e) of the Treaty is to be interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\").156 The Article provides as follows:\n\nArticle 31\n\n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, 1155 UNTS 331 (entered into force on 27 January 1980).\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n190.\n\nApplying Article 31 of the VCLT to the Treaty, the Claimant argues that the concept of \"substantial interest\" is not determinative of the meaning of \"control\" under the Treaty. According to the Claimant, \"substantial interest\" is one way, but not the only way, to prove \"control\".157 The Claimant asserts that the Treaty language \"*shall be regarded* as controlling a company or an investment\" does not mean that control can only be found \"in the presence of, or requires a substantial interest\".158 The drafters of this Treaty, in the Claimant\u2019s view, could have chosen a different wording had they intended \"substantial interest\" to be the only way to prove control.159\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 77; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 24; Claimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 51.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 93.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 94; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 30.\n\n191.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant criticises the Respondent\u2019s attempt to \"make 'substantial interest\u2019 the *exclusive* definition of control\" on the basis that the Respondent does not provide a clear definition of substantial interest but simply implies that it means substantial ownership interest.160 Substantial control does not always require ownership, the Claimant explains, because \"the word 'ownership\u2019 does not appear in the wording of the phrase\" and \"control is distinct from ownership under the Treaty\".161 According to the Claimant, as a result of the ordinary meaning of Article 1(e) of the Treaty, in particular the word \"or\", the Treaty provides that \"ownership and control are two distinct and independent bases\" for establishing a protected investment.162 The Claimant maintains that neither dictionary definitions of control nor the ordinary meaning of control in the corporate context link control to ownership.163 Rather, \"the ordinary meaning of 'control\u2019 focuses on the ability of one entity or person to direct the actions of another\".164 The Claimant explains that its \"management control\u2014pursuant to which it managed, directed, superintended, governed and oversaw the Australian subsidiaries\u2014fits this definition\".165 In any event, whether or not \"substantial interest\" is the exclusive definition of \"control\" under Article 1(e), the Claimant maintains that \"[t]he ordinary meaning of 'substantial interest' includes management control\" and that \"if a supervising entity manages every aspect of a business\" then \"that supervising entity has a substantial interest in the business\".166\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 31.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 31-32.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 77, 79, 80; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 24.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 81; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 25.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 81; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 48.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 48.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 52.\n\n192.\n\nFor the purposes of defining Article 1(e) within a particular treaty context, the Claimant disputes the Respondent's reliance on the meaning of \"investment\" as solely referring to economic contributions of a certain duration involving some element of risk. According to the Claimant, \"Article 1(e) of the Treaty defines 'investment' to mean 'every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one Contracting Party and admitted by the other Contracting Party'\".167 Moreover, the definition provided by the Respondent refers to the criteria set out in *Salini v. Morocco* \u2014an ICSID case that was never intended to establish a universal definition of \"investment\" in investment treaties but refers, at most, to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.168\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 19.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 37.\n\n193.\n\nThe Claimant refers to the Holderness Report as stating that, \"in the context of multinational corporations, it is common practice for control\u2014but not necessarily ownership\u2014of certain subsidiaries to be delegated to another subsidiary within the same corporate family\".169 The separation of ownership and control is, according to the Claimant, \"one of the defining features of the corporation that distinguishes it from other organizations\".170 The Claimant cites the Holderness Report as stating that, \"the key feature of control is not financial interest, but rather the existence of performance measurement and evaluation, and incentive and disincentive systems that allow the controlling entity to 'determine the management of corporate resources'\".171\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 82 citing the Holderness Report at paras 34, 38.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 83.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 83.\n\n194.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico*,172 the tribunal defined control in a corporate setting as \"the power to effectively decide and implement the key decisions of the business activity off an enterprise...\".173 Similarly, the tribunal in *Bilcon of Delaware v. Canada* confirmed \"that ownership is not necessary to establish control of an investment\".174 According to the Claimant, in *Bilcon of Delaware v. Canada*, the tribunal was concerned with the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1139 which \"is analogous to Article 1(e) of the [Treaty]\".175 The *Bilcon* Award involved a claimant that \"did 'not formally hold any equity in any relevant entities of the Bilcon group'\".176 According to the Claimant, \"[a]lthough Mr. Clayton did not exercise any formal control of the relevant entities, the tribunal decided to look at evidence of informal control\u2014unrelated to ownership\u2014to establish jurisdiction\".177 The *Bilcon* tribunal stated that \"the evidentiary record does not exclude any reasonable possibility that [the claimant] exercised indirect control in other\u2014less formal\u2014ways\".178\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v.

Mexico* as establishing that control is linked to the expectation to receive an economic return. Contrary to the Respondent's view, the Claimant emphasises that \"the *Thunderbird* tribunal did not conclude that an economic return is a necessary condition to establish control\".179 The Claimant emphasises that in the *Thunderbird* Award, the tribunal reasoned that \"'[c]ontrol can also be achieved by the power to effectively decide and implement the key decisions of the business activity of an enterprise ' without the legal capacity to control\".180 According to the Claimant, \"the nature of [its] control is comparable to that exhibited by the investor in [the] *Thunderbird* [Award]\" on the ground that the Claimant was responsible for the approval of PML's major business decisions and significant investments and was directly involved in the overseeing of the implementation of PML's business plans, the approval of significant expenditures and payment of dividends, as well as the appointment of top level management in the Australian subsidiaries.181 These factors, viewed collectively, support the Claimant's position.182\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 103.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 101; Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 99.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 104.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 100.\n\n196.\n\nIn support of its assertion that oversight and management can suffice to establish control for the purposes of enjoying treaty protections, the Claimant refers to the findings of the tribunal in *S.D. Myers v. Canada*.183 According to the Claimant, the *S.D. Myers* tribunal confirmed that, \"control can exist independently of ownership\".184 In *S.D. Myers v. Canada,* the tribunal was concerned with the relationship between a claimant corporation, SDMI, and the subject of the dispute, a separate company called Myers Canada. SDMI did not own any equity in Myers Canada, but both companies were owned by the same four brothers, one of whom was, according to the Claimant, also the \"CEO\" or \"President\" of SDMI.185 The Claimant asserts that the *S.D. Myers* tribunal \"relied on the testimony of the President of SDMI that he controlled Myers Canada in his role as President of SDMI, even though SDMI did not own equity in Myers Canada and that there was no legal agreement 'set[ting] out the respective responsibilities and obligations' of the companies\".186 When the respondent State sought to set aside the decision, the Federal Court of Canada \"strongly endorsed the [A]ward\" and made a finding that \"[t]he meaning of 'controlled directly or indirectly' is its ordinary meaning. In this case, the tribunal found that SDMI controlled Myers Canada. \"This control was not based on the legal ownership of shares, but on the fact that Mr. Dana Myers controlled every decision, every instrument, every move by Myers Canada, and Mr. Myers did so as chief executive officer of SDMI\".187 The Claimant also refers to the decision in *Perenco v. Ecuador* \u2014a case in which the claimant did not possess legal title to the shares in question on the date of consent to the arbitration. According to the Claimant, the tribunal held that jurisdiction was proper because the treaty covered investments \"owned or controlled\" by French nationals, and the French claimants exerted indirect control over the Ecuadorian investments at issue.188 The tribunal in *Perenco v. Ecuador* stated that it would not take a \"formalistic approach to the question of control\".189\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 86.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 86.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 87.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 88.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 89 referring to *Attorney General of Canada v.

Venezuela* did not disregard treaty practice as such but merely mentioned that \"looking at prior treaty-making practice requires caution\".207 The Claimant notes that the tribunals in *Churchill Mining v. Indonesia* and *Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan* found that a contracting party's treaty practice can be considered as a \"supplementary means of interpretation\".208 The Claimant points to the Respondent's investment treaties with Argentina and India as well as the Model Bilateral Investment Treaty at that time, which demonstrate a consistent approach in favour of the Claimant's interpretation of control.209\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 95-96; Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 72.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 72-73.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 74.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 75.\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n201.\n\nReferring to the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 1(e) of the Treaty, the Respondent contends that, \"Article 1(e) partly states that an investor ' *shall be regarded* as controlling. a company or an investment *if* the [investor] has a substantial interest in the company or the investment'\".210 As drafted, this mandatory language in Article 1(e) defines the meaning of control exclusively by reference to \"substantial interest\".211 No other activity will, according to the Respondent, establish control.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 139.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 139; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20.\n\n202.\n\nHaving a \"substantial interest\" means, according to the Respondent, \"that the putative investor must have a right or power over an asset which is sourced in a legal arrangement, and which is capable of being exercised in some significant way that affects the economic returns from and disposition of the asset\".212 The meaning of substantial interest as an economic interest can, according to the Respondent, be derived from the \"context of the term 'control'\" in the Treaty.213 Thus, \"[t]he context provided by the term 'investment' militates against the interpretation of 'control' contended for by PM Asia\u2014namely that of management and oversight\u2014\"[because] 'investments' are understood as an economic contribution of a certain duration which involves some element of risk\".214 The Respondent refers to Articles 2(2), 3(1) and 8(1) of the Treaty which \"apply to 'investments and returns' of investors\" where the term \"returns\" means \"the amounts yielded or derived from an investment\" such as profits or dividends.215 The Respondent also refers to Article 6(1) of the Treaty, which provides that investors should be compensated for any loss suffered.216 According to the Respondent, in the absence of any substantial economic interest in the investment, the Claimant \"could not have suffered any financial loss\" and thus \"would not be entitled to any compensatory damages\".217 Therefore, in light of the context of the provisions of the Treaty, control over an investment must entail an economic relationship. The Respondent recalls that, \"in the period 2001-2011, PM Asia did not have any expectation of 'an economic return' from its asserted 'control' of PM Australia and PML\".218\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 146.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary objections, para. 146.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 173.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 174.\n\n203.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the determinations of other tribunals support its assertions regarding the need for an economic relationship. Thus, the tribunal in *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico* \"linked ' *de facto* control' with 'the expectation to receive an economic return'\".219 Similarly, in *Romak SA v. Uzbekistan,* the tribunal stated that, \"the term 'investments' under the treaty has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk\".220\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 174.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 147.\n\n204.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the definition of \"control\" suggested by the Claimant \"is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the [Treaty]\".221 The Respondent argues that oversight and management control would not require assets, funds or technology transfer between Hong Kong and Australia. This would frustrate the purpose of the Treaty to \"promote investment, economic co-operation and mutual prosperity 'between the Contracting Parties'\".222 The Claimant's contention that protecting actors who actually make investment decisions would promote investments, is, in the Respondent's view, not supported by the text of the Treaty.223 Similar to its assertions with respect to the context provided by Articles 2(2), 3(1), 6(1) and 8(1) of the Treaty, the Respondent submits that the purpose of the Treaty does not allow actors who do not suffer any economic loss to bring a claim.224\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 150; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 151-153.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 154-161.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 162.\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimant's interpretation of control would, the Respondent emphasizes, \"lead to a multiplication of possible claimants in respect of the same investment\", including at least FTR Holding SA, PMI and PM Asia.225 According to the Respondent, the very risk of creating uncertainty as to which entity may be considered an \"investor\" and what constitutes an \"investment\" under the treaty led the tribunal in *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia* to reject the test of \"control\" based on the exercise of management functions alone.226 Similarly, the Respondent stresses that \"information about the detail of management practices within a corporate group is generally not available publicly\" and that the Claimant's interpretation of \"control\" as equivalent to such internal management practices would expose the Respondent to \"obligations [owed] to an unknowable class of investors\".227\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 163-166.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 164.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 164, 167.\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* as \"clearly demonstrat[ing] that Australia and Hong Kong regarded the need for a 'substantial interest' as the sole criterion of control\".228 According to the Respondent, Hong Kong was initially unwilling to agree to the inclusion of \"control\" but agreed on the basis that it was defined by reference to the concept of \"substantial interest\".229 The Respondent asserts that the discussion of \"substantial interest\" by the Treaty drafters was not, as the Claimant asserts, by reference to direct or indirect ownership, but rather in order to distinguish \"full\" ownership and having a \"substantial interest\" which nonetheless confers control.230\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 170-177; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with the Claimant's reference to other Australian investment treaties in support of its interpretation of Article 1(e) on the grounds that the text of other treaties is irrelevant to the interpretation of this Treaty and that \"prior treaty-making practice\" is also irrelevant as \"supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32\" of the VCLT, as confirmed by the tribunal in *Nova Scotia Power Incorporated v. Venezuela*.231 Furthermore, the Respondent notes that in any event the Claimant \"has failed to establish a consistent [Treaty] practice\" by Australia.232\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 178-179.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 179.\n\n208.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the relevance of *S.D. Myers v. Canada* for establishing that \"'control' can exist separately from 'ownership'\".233 According to the Respondent, the decision in *S.D. Myers v. Canada* turned on the fact that the NAFTA defines \"investment of an investor\" as an \"investment owned or controlled *directly or indirectly* by an investor\".234 The Respondent also highlights that, unlike in the Treaty, Chapter 11 of NAFTA does not contain any clarification on what is meant by the term \"control\", for example by reference to \"substantial interest\".235 According to the Respondent, there are also significant factual differences between *S.D. Myers v. Canada* and the present dispute.236 Specifically, unlike in *S.D. Myers v. Canada*, the Claimant here did not \"direc[t] the actions of PML\", \"derive a profit from PM Australia's/PML's business\", \"contribut[e] to the capital of PML\", \"provid[e] PML with any speciali[s]ed technical know-how\" or \"regularly work together\" with PML.237\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 140.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 140.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 140.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 143.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 143-144.\n\n209.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent disputes the relevance of the *Bilcon* Award for three reasons. First, the *Bilcon of Delaware v. Canada* claim was brought under Chapter 11 of NAFTA \"which does not contain a test for control such as that found in Art 1(e) of the [Treaty]\".238 Second, the *Bilcon* tribunal, according to the Respondent, \"held that the state of the evidentiary record did not permit it to make a determination as to the issue of 'control'\".239 In contrast, in the present dispute, the Claimant \"has had ample opportunity. to make good its assertions\".240 Third, although the claimant in *Bilcon of Delaware v. Canada* \"had no ownership interest in Bilcon of Delaware, it seems there was evidence that he ran the business and had made a financial contribution, and it is possible that there was an agreement conferring rights of control on Mr. Clayton\".241 The Respondent states that none of these factors are present in this case.242\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 74.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 74.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 74.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 74.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 74.\n\n***(b) The Meaning of the Term \"Controlled\" in Light of other Arbitral Awards***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n210.\n\nEven if \"significant interest\" does not exclusively define the meaning of \"control\" under the Treaty, the Respondent refers to a number of cases where the meaning of \"control\" was, in its view, established to mean something more than management practices.243 For example, the Respondent refers to the findings of the arbitral tribunal in *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia* where \"control\" was linked with \"legal capacity to control\", and in turn defined by reference to \"the percentage of shares held\".244 The Respondent cites the *Aguas del Tunari* tribunal as stating that \"the word 'controlled' is not intended as an alternative to ownership since control without an ownership interest would define a group of entities not necessarily possessing an interest which could be the subject of a claim. *In this sense 'controlled' indicates a quality of the ownership interest*\".245\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 135; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 52.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 174.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 190.\n\n211.\n\nIn *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana*, the ICSID tribunal determined that \"a total absence of foreign shareholding would virtually preclude the existence of [foreign] control\".246 The Respondent acknowledges that the fact pattern in *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* was different to the present case since, in *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana*, the tribunal was concerned with determining whether a Ghanaian company was controlled by an individual.247 However, the Respondent asserts that the relevance of *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* is that \"the tribunal *rejected* an assertion of control in circumstances where the supposed controller exercised a far *greater* level of influence over a corporate entity than PM Asia supposedly exercised over PM Australia or PML\".248 The Respondent recalls that the Claimant \"held no shares in PM Australia or PML\" nor any \"legal rights conveyed in instruments or agreements\" in the period between 2001 and 2011.249\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 174.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 192.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 192.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 174.\n\n212.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico* in which the tribunal held that a number of factors, viewed collectively, justified the finding that the claimant controlled the relevant minority-owned subsidiaries. These factors, according to the Respondent, were: (i) that the claimant held more than 30% of the share capital in the subsidiaries; (ii) the claimant \"expected an economic return on its investment in the subsidiaries\"; (iii) the \"key officers of [the claimant] and [the subsidiaries] were one and the same\"; and (iv) \"the initial expenditures, the knowhow of the machines, the selection of suppliers, and the expected return on the investment were provided or determined by [the claimant].\"250 The Respondent submits that \"[i]n contrast, none of these factors were present in the relationship between PM Asia and PM Australia/PML prior to February 2011\".251\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 186.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 187.\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that \"control\" may be established in certain other circumstances, for example, where there is a formal agreement to this effect\u2014as was the case in *AIG Capital Partners, Inc. v. Kazakhstan*.252 The Respondent emphasises, however, that no equivalent formal agreement exists in the present case.253 Nevertheless, although *AIG Capital Partners, Inc. v. Kazakhstan* entailed a different fact pattern to that which characterises the present dispute, the Respondent maintains that the case \"nonetheless provides an example of what is necessary in order to establish 'control' [and that t]he existence of certain management practices is not enough\".254\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 174.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 174.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 194.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the cases cited by the Respondent do not support its assertion that there is a generally accepted meaning of \"control\". \"Nothing in the decisions does or could supersede the plain text of the Treaty, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, and arbitral jurisprudence, all of which align on the core point: management control is an independent basis for jurisdiction, distinct from ownership, under Article 1(e) [of the Hong Kong-Australia BIT]\".255\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 106.\n\n215.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the relevance of the decision in *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia* on the basis that the relevant treaty in that case did not contain \"owned or\" as an alternative to \"controlled\".256 In contrast to the present case, the Claimant notes that the tribunal in *Aguas del Tunari* focused on the question of whether the actual exercise of control was a necessary element *in addition to* the legal capacity to control.257 In the Claimant's view, the tribunal found only that legal capacity to control is sufficient to establish control; the tribunal therefore \"did not find that actual control by itself is insufficient to meet the standard of control\" as suggested by the Respondent.258 The Claimant emphasises that the *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia* case also contradicts the Respondent's argument that the Claimant did not control the Australian subsidiaries pursuant to Article 1(e) of the Treaty because \"PMI ultimately controlled the Claimant\". According to the Claimant, the finding of the *Aguas del Tunari* tribunal found that\n\n\"*[t]he BIT does not limit the scope of eligible claimants to only the 'ultimate controller* '\".259\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 105-106; Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 52, 94.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 107-109.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 109.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 96.\n\n216.\n\nThe Claimant also explains that *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* does not help the Respondent because it addresses issues that are very different from the present case, such as the meaning of \"foreign controlled\" under the ICSID Convention and the involvement of \"an individual's person property, not an investment within a corporate family\".260 The Claimant points to the tribunal's finding that, for the purpose of establishing control, \"a tribunal. may regard any criterion based on *management*, voting rights, shareholding *or any other reasonable theory* as being reasonable for the purpose\".261 The Claimant stresses that in *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana*, the claimant presented \"exceedingly thin\" evidence in support of its assertion of control, and the *Vacuum Salt* tribunal therefore asserted that \"[i]t is significant that nowhere does there appear to be any material evidence that [the claimant] either acted or was materially influenced in a truly managerial rather than technical or supervisory vein. Nowhere in these proceedings is it suggested that [the claimant]. was in a position to steer, through either positive or negative action, the fortunes of Vacuum Salt\".262 The Claimant maintains that, unlike the investor in *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana*, it \"has exercised significant 'control' over the investment within the plain meaning of that term\", that the evidentiary record in this case is \"bursting with evidence of Claimant's control of the Australian subsidiaries\" and that the relevance of *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* should therefore be rejected.263\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 113.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 114.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 103.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 115-116; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 102-104.\n\n217.\n\nThe Claimant reiterates that *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico* in fact supports the Claimant's position.264 In the *Thunderbird* Award, the tribunal interpreted the term control \"in accordance with its ordinary meaning\" and held that \"[c]ontrol can also be achieved by the power to effectively decide and implement the key decisions of the business activity of an enterprise\" absent legal capacity to control.265 The *Thunderbird* tribunal then examined the facts and determined that the claimant exercised *de facto* control over the investment and therefore \"controlled\" the investment for the purposes of jurisdiction under NAFTA.266 The Claimant agrees with the Respondent that there were a series of factors that led the *Thunderbird* tribunal to its conclusions.267 The Claimant emphasises that both Parties agreed these factors are to be \"viewed collectively\u2014 *i.e*. that no individual factor is dispositive or necessary\".268 This is significant for the Claimant's position in this case since, \"on any 'collective' view of the evidence, Claimant's exercise of control of PML is undeniable\". Thus, according to the Claimant, the evidence in the present case satisfies the *Thunderbird* tribunal's formulation of \"control\".269\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 99.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 99.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 99.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 100.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 100.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 100.\n\n218.\n\nAs regards the *AIG Capital Partners, Inc. v.

Evidence of Management Oversight for the Purposes of Establishing \"Control\"**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n219.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, \"[e]ven if PM Asia's assertion that \"oversight and management control' qualifies as 'control' under Article 1(e) of the Treaty is correct (which it is not), PM Asia has failed to demonstrate that it did in fact exercise such 'control' over PM Australia and PML before the restructur[ing]\".272 The Respondent supports this assertion on the following basis: (i) the evidence demonstrates that any control over PM Australia and PML was exercised regionally by PMI; (ii) Mr. Pellegrini's responsibilities in respect of PM Australia and PML were limited and insufficient to amount to \"control\"; (iii) there was no delegation of control from PMI to PM Asia; and (iv) PM Asia's asserted \"control\" is inconsistent with the PMI Group's application to FIRB.273 These assertions are set out in more detail below.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 204.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 204.\n\n220.\n\nWith respect to whether PM Asia or PMI controlled PM Australia and PML before the restructuring, the Respondent asserts that the documentary evidence provided by the Claimant is \"sparse, incomplete and inadequate\" and argues that any control over PM Australia and PML was in fact exercised by \"the ultimate parent company, PMI\".274 According to the Respondent, PMI assigned specific individuals to Hong Kong to oversee decisions concerning the Australian subsidiaries who \"acted in their capacity as part of a PMI structure, not in their capacity as officers of PM Asia\".275\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 206-207.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 207-208.\n\n221.\n\nTo elaborate on its arguments, the Respondent disputes that one of the Claimant\u2019s primary functions has been the oversight of PMI affiliates in Asia on the grounds that the PMI Annual Report for 2008 does not even mention PM Asia and that Mr. Pellegrini is described therein as the President of the \"Asia Region\", consistently with his profile on the PMI website.276 The \"only contemporaneous document\" provided by the Claimant, the Respondent notes, does not suggest that PM Asia personnel has anything to do with the restructuring process.277 The Respondent also contests the Claimant\u2019s alleged \"various appointments of PML\u2019s senior management\", arguing that, \"the documentary evidence establishes no link between such appointments and PM Asia officeholders acting in that capacity\".278\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 210.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 211.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 212-214.\n\n222.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s evidence only indicates that various officers at PML reported to \"individuals holding positions in the PMI 'Asia Pacific Region\u2019, and not to PM Asia\".279 The Respondent emphasises that, \"documentary evidence, witness testimony and [the Claimant\u2019s] own organizational structure\" establish that \"what was important for the personnel at the Australian subsidiaries in their reporting lines was the 'region\u2019\".280 Thus, the Respondent points out that the Claimant \"has not established that the actions undertaken by Mr. Pellegrini with respect to the Australian subsidiaries were done either in the capacity of *President of PM Asia* (which he was not), or as a *director of PM Asia* (which he was). The documentary evidence is consistent with him exercising powers as President of the *Asia Region of PMI*\".281 While the Claimant refers to PM Asia as a \"team of managers\" that assisted Mr. Pellegrini, the Respondent stresses that this does not alter the fact that \"those managers and directors are working either as part of the *PMI Asia Region* or within a *PMI central function*\".282\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 215-219.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 55.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 56.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n223.\n\nThe Respondent points to further documentary evidence to support its assertion that PM Asia did not provide oversight of the Australian subsidiaries. As regards PML's financial performance and budget, the Respondent emphasizes that the documents produced by the Claimant concern a market strategy review meeting in 2003 and only show that \"PM Asia was responsible for organizing, and providing feedback from, that meeting\" but not control of PML.283 The Respondent points to Mr. Pellegrini's own admission that it is the CEO of PMI who finalises PML's budget and concludes that, \"ultimate decision-making power rested with PMI\".284 Addressing the approval of PML's capital expenditures, the Respondent emphasises that, contrary to the Claimant's assertion, Mr. Pellegrini gave his approval in his role within PMI and the expenditures were approved in accordance with a PMI policy.285 Furthermore, the person \"who gave the ultimate approval for PML's payment of dividends\", the Respondent notes, was \"a PMI officer\".286\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n224.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Pellegrini's responsibilities, the Respondent submits that the limited responsibilities of individuals like Mr. Pellegrini \"would still not amount to 'control' by PM Asia\".287 The Respondent relies on Professor Lys's expert report to argue that, \"the *final* *decision* was often made by [Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s] supervisors within PMI\".288 The Respondent cites several examples to demonstrate Mr. Pellegrini's limited responsibilities.289 Where the Claimant insists that it controlled PML\u2019s major business initiatives and budgets through reviewing and approving PML's OB/LRP since 2001, the Respondent asserts that Mr. Pellegrini's evidence was in fact that \"PMI 'finalised the numbers\u2019 on PML\u2019s [OB/LRP]... [and that] Mr. Pellegrini would review the budgets against a standard provided to him by PMI\".290 As to the Claimant's assertion that it \"directed PML\u2019s branding and marketing strategy\", the Respondent asserts that \"Mr. Pellegrini agreed that decisions concerning international brands had to be approved by PMI in Lausanne\".291 As to the Claimant\u2019s assertion that PML managing directors reported to and worked under the supervision of the Claimant\u2019s President, Mr. Pellegrini, the Respondent asserts that \"the evidence shows that much of the reporting was directly to 'central function\u2019 personnel in Lausanne, and only indirectly to Mr. Pellegrini on a 'dotted line\u2019 basis\".292 According to the Respondent, this ''in no sense... establishes] 'control\u2019 of those departments of the Australian subsidiaries\".293 The Respondent states further that \"PMI\u2019s RACI tables294 make it clear that Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s ability to approve [capital] expenditure was restricted, and even in those limited cases in which Mr. Pellegrini was involved in approvals, anything above USD 25 million also required approval from someone higher up in PMI\".295 Finally, the Respondent notes that any approval of the Australian subsidiaries\u2019 dividend payments had to be approved by the \"director Treasury PMI\".296\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 226.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 226.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n225.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the facts in *S.D. Myers* v. *Canada* to emphasise its position that \"control\" cannot be established through an *\"intermediate* company\". According to the Respondent, in *S.D. Myers* v. *Canada,* \"the CEO of SD Myers was the 'authoritative voice\u2019 and 'directing mind and controller\u2019 of both companies, who 'directed and controlled every decision of Myers Canada\u2019, in the present case, there are manifest limitations on Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s ability to make decisions in respect of the Australian subsidiaries\".297\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 58.\n\n226.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that delegated control is not protected under any investment treaty when the delegator does not qualify as an investor, because \"any control being exercised is not that of PM Asia as the delegate, but that of the delegator\".298 The Respondent explains that \"delegated control\u2014which is revocable at will by the company exercising actual control\u2014cannot be sufficient to establish \"control\" for the purposes of Article 1(e) of the Treaty and is not protected when the delegator is not an \"investor\" under the [Treaty]...[since] PMI [is] an entity not protected by the [Treaty]\".299 The Respondent refers to the evidence of Professor Lys as stating that, \"delegated control is meaningful from an economic point of view only where the delegate is more than a mere caretaker for the delegator\".300\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 234.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 53.\n\nRespondent's

substantial evidence that it has exercised management control over PML since 2001 and has therefore controlled the Australian subsidiaries for purposes of Article 1(e)\".303 The Claimant refers to \"two briefs, four witness statements and abundant documentation [that constitutes] overwhelming evidence\" in its favour.304 In response to the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the evidence on control put forward by the Claimant is \"sparse, incomplete and inadequate\", the Claimant explains that it had \"offered to produce a set of [control-related] documents from 2009\" in respect of the

Pellegrini\u2019s testimony, the Claimant asserts that he \"was and remains the President of PM Asia\".310 The Claimant explains that Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s title refers to \"Asia region\" because \"PM Asia is the headquarters for PMI\u2019s Asia region\" and \"[o]versight and supervision of PMI affiliates in the Asia region is one of PM Asia\u2019s primary functions\".311 The Claimant reiterates that secondments to PM Asia were arranged on the basis that PM Asia had the right to supervise and define the duties and activities of the \"Expatriates\".312 According to the Claimant, \"Respondent has been unable to refute the fact that Mr. Pellegrini *regardless of his title*, works on behalf of PM Asia (as proven by his employment letter and his position as the senior director of PM Asia) and that he had his staff at PM Asia control the Australian subsidiaries (as proven by the documentary evidence of PM Asia\u2019s management control of the Australian subsidiaries covering many years)\".313\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 27.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 28.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 9.\n\nClaimant\u2019s

Australia, and evaluated and approved the evaluations of PML\u2019s key offices\".314 In this regard, the Claimant refers to the witness testimony of its President, Mr. Pellegrini, and that of the Managing Director of PML, Mr. John Gledhill. The Claimant also explains that it exercised control over PML since at least 2001 by overseeing its senior staff; directing its budgeting and business planning processes; requiring PML to secure the Claimant\u2019s approval for certain expenditures, including capital investments; and requiring approval for other business decisions, including developing and launching new products, discontinuing products, changing product packaging, adjusting recommended retail prices, and developing marketing plans.315 The Claimant has also exercised control by virtue of the fact that the Claimant\u2019s President appoints or approves the appointment of the senior managers of PML who then become board members.316\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 39-41, 276.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 121-122.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 121-122.\n\n232.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s responsibilities, the Claimant refers to the \"employment contracts of Messrs. Gledhill and Boissart\" and reiterates that PML managing directors reported to and worked under the supervision of Mr. Pellegrini.317 According to the Claimant, Mr. Pellegrini \"completed the annual performance reviews of the Managing Directors of PML\", \"fixed the salaries of PML employees\" and \"set the annual bonuses of PML staff\".318 Moreover, \"[t]he employment contracts and personnel announcements for other key PML management\", the Claimant argues, indicate its control over PML.319 To further support its position, the Claimant provided what it characterises as \"[i]nternal organizational and reporting line documentation from 2009\".320\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 122-124.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 125.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 126.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 127.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimant insists that it controlled PML\u2019s major business initiatives and budgets through reviewing and approving PML\u2019s OB/LRP since 2001.321 In addressing the Respondent\u2019s concern over the OB/LRP process, the Claimant refers to the agendas for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 regional OB/LRP reviews in Hong Kong and Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s account of the review process for PML\u2019s 2010 OB/LRP.322 The Claimant also points out that \"PML was also required to submit revised budget forecasts to Claimant each month\".323\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 129.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 131-136.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 138-139.\n\n234.\n\nVarious examples of PML initiatives that were approved by the Claimant in 2009 demonstrate, according to the Claimant, that it directed PML\u2019s branding and marketing strategy.324 In the context of approvals of PML\u2019s major expenditures and capital investments, the Claimant considers any distinction between approvals made by the Asia Region and those by PM Asia \"meaningless\".325 According to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s argument concerning the PMI policy for the approval of expenditures is \"unhelpful\" because the fact that the expenditure approval process has been standardised across the company has nothing to do with the Claimant\u2019s approval.326 Similarly, the Claimant maintains that the fact that PMI approval was required for large expenditures does not affect the Claimant\u2019s approval in this context.327 As regards the approval of dividend payments, the Claimant contends that the requirement of multiple approvals does not change the \"critical fact. that PML dividend payments required *Claimant's* approval\".328\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 143.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 145.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 145.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 146.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 147.\n\n235.\n\nThe Claimant counters the Respondent\u2019s assertion that PM Asia\u2019s executives acted on behalf of PMI instead of PM Asia on the grounds that the position of \"President Asia Region\" is a position with PM Asia, and that both employment letters [REDACTED] demonstrate that the relevant executives worked on behalf of PM Asia.329 The Claimant also points out that Mr. Pellegrini was not only seconded to PM Asia in 2003 but also appointed to PM Asia\u2019s board of directors.330 Hence, \"the fact that Mr. Pellegrini was part of PMI\u2019s global management team\", the Claimant suggests, \"is fully consistent with his role as President of PM Asia\".331\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 148-149, 152.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 151.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 154.\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimant states that the legal arguments of the Respondent, namely \"that if Claimant controlled the Australian subsidiaries, then it must have been exercising the powers of a shareholder\", turns on a *\"factual* question \" : \"Did Claimant exercise powers held by PML shareholders?\"332 The Claimant asserts that it did not, and that the Respondent\u2019s legal argument must therefore fall away.333 The Claimant\u2019s arguments are, in summary, that the Respondent \"blurs the distinction\" between the activities of PML employees and members of PML\u2019s board of directors to the effect that it appears as though Mr. Pellegrini acted with the powers of a PML shareholder.334 The Claimant rejects this mischaracterisation of the powers of PML employees. For example, the Claimant refers to Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s First Witness Statement, wherein Mr. Pellegrini confirms that he had no power to remove directors from PML\u2019s board of directors and could not have exercised powers equivalent to a shareholder.335 The Claimant also asserts that while \"Claimant has the authority to approve the appointments of individuals to functional roles such as PML\u2019s *Director* of Finance or *Director* of Marketing\", this does not mean that the Claimant had the power to appoint individuals to PML\u2019s board of directors.336 As set out in Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s Second Witness Statement, \"PML\u2019s board appoints individuals to PM\u2019s board of directors and fills any vacancies\".337 The Claimant also states that while Mr. Pellegrini did fix salaries and bonuses of individuals in their roles as PML personnel, \"[this] says nothing about Claimant\u2019s power to set remuneration for individuals in their capacities as PML board members\".338 The Claimant stresses that it \"did not have the latent power to, and never purported to, set compensation for directors acting in their capacities as board members before February 2011\".339\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 167-168.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 168.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 171.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 169.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 170.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 170.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 171.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 171.\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the relevance of the Respondent\u2019s contention that delegated control is not protected under any Treaty when the delegator does not qualify as an investor because that control can be revoked at will.340 According to the Claimant, the Treaty \"speaks only of 'control\u2019 not 'revocable\u2019 or 'irrevocable\u2019 control\".341 Furthermore, the fact that a higher level entity within the PMI Group *could have* revoked the Claimant\u2019s control over the Australian subsidiaries is irrelevant: \"[t]he undisputed fact is that Claimant\u2019s control *was never* revoked\".342 According to the Claimant, \"[i]f an investor has control when the host [S]tate takes adverse action, that is sufficient for purposes of jurisdiction. It does not matter under Article 1(e) whether that control could have been revoked by a higher entity\".343\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 42.\n\n**3. Notification Requirement under FATA**\n------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n238.\n\nEven assuming that the Claimant\u2019s control over PM Australia and PML from 2001 could be established, the Respondent contends that such an investment by virtue of control has not been admitted under Article 1(e) because the Claimant failed to meet the notification requirement under section 26 of the FATA.344 Based on sections 18(2)(a) and 11(2)(d) of the FATA, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant was exercising or controlling rights \"attached to a share\".345 As a result, the Claimant was required under section 26 of the FATA to notify the Treasurer about the \"agreement by virtue of which he or she acquires a substantial shareholding in an Australian corporation\" in order to \"avoid a criminal offence\".346 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant either did not have control over the investment or had control but failed to satisfy the notification requirement.347\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 179.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 180-181.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 182-183.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 185-186.\n\n239.\n\nThe Respondent counters the Claimant\u2019s argument that it equates the meaning of substantial interest under the Treaty and under Australian law, emphasising that its position is entirely based on sections 26(2), 5(1) and 11(2)(d) of the FATA.348 According to the Respondent, \"[a] person exercises the 'rights attached to a share\u2019 if that person exercises powers that are held by the shareholder\", including the power to \"dismiss a director-level employee\", the power to \"appoint directors at a general meeting\" and the power to \"review the remuneration of directors\".349\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 239.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 239.\n\n240.\n\nAs regards section 38 of the FATA, the Respondent notes that the effect of a failure to notify is that the agreements between the PM entities by virtue of which it is said PM Asia had control of the Australian subsidiaries are not automatically invalidated, which does not \"prevent inquiry into the legal validity of acts purportedly done under the FATA\".350\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 240.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimant contests the Respondent\u2019s position that the Claimant would have been required to file a notification under section 26 of the FATA on the ground that the Respondent\u2019s analysis is based on the premise that a showing of substantial interest is necessary for the purpose of establishing control.351 The Claimant contends that the Respondent also \"incorrectly equates the meaning of 'substantial interest\u2019 under the Treaty and under Australian law\".352\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 125.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 126.\n\n242.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant argues that the notification requirement does not affect the admission of its investment because section 38 of the FATA states that \"[a]n act is not invalidated by the fact that it constitutes an offence against this Act\".353\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 127.\n\n243.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, it did not exercise powers held by PML shareholders as the Respondent suggests. First, the Claimant notes that Mr. Pellegrini did not and \"could not remove directors from PML\u2019s board of directors\".354 Secondly, \"[n]either Claimant nor Mr. Pellegrini ever claimed to have appointed individuals directly to PML\u2019s board of directors before February 2011\".355 Thirdly, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant only reviews the remuneration of PML employees but not directors.356 As far as section 38 of the FATA is concerned, the Claimant maintains that \"FATA violations have no legal effect on the admission of an investment\" as explained in more detail in the Claimant\u2019s arguments regarding the NonAdmission of Investment Objection.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 169.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 170.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 171.\n\n**B. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT'S INVESTMENT HAS BEEN ADMITTED UNDER AUSTRALIAN LAWAND INVESTMENT POLICIES**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nThe Parties differ in respect of the admission of PM Asia\u2019s investment in Australia pursuant to Australian law and investment policies. The Claimant submits that the admission requirement under Article 1(e) of the Treaty is satisfied, whereas the Respondent is of the view that the Claimant\u2019s investment\u2014its acquisition of shares in PM Australia\u2014has not been admitted because the PMI Group\u2019s application to the Australian Government in January 2011 was false or misleading.357 Accordingly, the Respondent contends that PM Asia\u2019s investment enjoys no protection under the Treaty.358\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 11a, 12; Respondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 242.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 17.\n\n**1. Meaning of \"admitted by the other Contracting Party subject to its law and investment policies\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nArticle 1(e) of the Treaty provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n\"investment\" means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one Contracting Party and admitted by the other Contracting Party subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time, and in particular, though not exclusively.\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 1(e) of the Treaty preserves the customary international law position that a State has a sovereign right to determine the terms on which it admits foreign investment. Therefore, the issue of whether a Hong Kong investment is admitted in Australia is ultimately a matter for Australian law and investment policy.359\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 13. See also Claimant\u2019s Amended Statement of Claim, para. 275, where PM Asia accepts that the investment must be \"legal\" under the host State law at the time it is made (Article 1(e) of the Treaty however requires compliance with *both* law and investment policy).\n\n247.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 1(e) of the Treaty effects a *renvoi* to Australian law \"for an assessment of the existence and consequences of the alleged contraventions of local law\". It disagrees with the Claimant that these consequences should *additionally* be assessed by reference to international law. Relying on the Tribunal\u2019s finding in *Fraport v. Philippines*, and on the interpretation of Article 1(e) in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, the Respondent explains that whether the Claimant\u2019s investment is admitted under the Treaty is a question of Australian law and investment policies, and if the *putative* investment is not admitted, the consequence, as a matter of international law, is that the Treaty does not protect it.360 Every technical breach of Australian law, therefore, will invalidate the admission of the investment.361\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 248-252.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 252.\n\n248.\n\nFurther, the Respondent emphasises that Article 1(e) of the Treaty makes admission subject to *both* the \"law\" of the host State and its \"investment policies\". The Respondent explains that Article 1(e) is not limited to some form of illegality or legal invalidity as a matter of Australian law. Otherwise, the words \"investment policies\" would be redundant. Article 1(e) of the Treaty, according to the Respondent, requires the admission to be free from material non-compliance with those policies.362\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 140; Respondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 54.\n\n249.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that Article 1(e) of the Treaty is concerned with establishing access to the protection of the Treaty and Article 10 of the Treaty confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal and mandates it to decide the relevant issues of Australian law and policy. Accordingly, in the Respondent\u2019s view, it is for the domestic decision-maker to decide on admission for the purposes of Australian law and it is for a \"BIT tribunal\" alone to decide on admission issues falling under the Treaty.363\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 119b.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the proper standard against which the admission of its investment in the host State must be determined is international law. The Claimant adds that domestic law of the host State also \"feeds into the inquiry but does not control it\".364 This determination, the Claimant submits, must be made independently of the parties\u2019 choice of law applicable to the merits of the dispute.365 Relying on the decision in *Fraport v. Philippines*, the Claimant construes Article 1(e) of the Treaty such that it effects a *renvoi* to local law \"for an assessment of the existence and consequences of the alleged contraventions of local law, with those consequences then having to be assessed by reference to international law\".366\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 132; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 229.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 139.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 140-141.\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimant, accordingly, argues that the Respondent\u2019s objection to the admission of the Claimant\u2019s investment must be analyzed from a public international law perspective. While Australian law should be taken into account, the Claimant notes that a technical violation of domestic law will not suffice to exclude an investment from the scope of the Treaty\u2019s protection.367 Relying on decisions of the tribunals in *Quiborax v. Bolivia* and *Teinver v. Argentine Republic*, the Claimant submits that it falls to the Respondent to prove that the Treaty\u2019s requirement has not been met.368\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 229.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 142, see fn. 199.\n\n**2. The Alleged False or Misleading Information in the Foreign Investment Application**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Information Required to Be Submitted Pursuant to the FATA***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, for the Claimant\u2019s investment to be admitted in the host State, certain requirements of Australian law and investment policy must be satisfied. In accordance with section 26 of the FATA, the Foreign Investment Application must set out, in accurate and complete fashion, the matters stipulated in FATA, FATA Regulations and the policies and guidelines accompanying FATA.369\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 22.\n\n253.\n\nThe Respondent explains that section 26 of the FATA requires prospective investors to furnish a notice to the Treasurer for certain types of transactions provided it complies with the prescribed form as set out in the FATA Regulations. The form requires basic details about the person acquiring shares, the Australian company and information about the shares being acquired.370\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 23-25.\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the required content of the notice is stipulated in its foreign investment pohcies. in particular. Australia\u2019s Foreign Investment Policy, which provides policy guidance on the application of the national interest test, and the \"How-to-Apply\"\u2014Busmess Proposals guide (\"How-to-Apply Guide\"), should be complied with. The How-to-Apply Guide particularly states that \"in addition to the relevant statutory notice\", applications for acquisitions of shares \"must include\" information on \"parties to the proposal, the type of proposal, the consideration, the *reasons* for the proposal... front viewpoints of the vendor, target and purchaser, and a brief description of the purchaser\u2019s future *intentions* for the business..,\".371\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26a.\n\n255.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that the How-to-Apply Guide leaves no room for a prospective investor to make a self-serving judgment that information it does not want to bring to the attention of the Government can be omitted.372 While rejecting the distinction made by the Claimant as to the terminology of whether the regime is *standard-based* or *disclosure-based.* the Respondent clarifies that the How-to-Apply Guide requires provision of information \"whether or not the investor thinks the Government might already have, or be able to infer, that information\".373\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34 referring to oral testimony of Mr. Callinan during the cross-examination at the hearing; see Transcript. Day 3. p. 121. line 9.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 57c.\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent states that, pursuant to the FATA and an \"Instrument of Authorization\" made by the Treasurer (authorising Treasury officials holding identified positions to approve PM Asia\u2019s investment),374 the Treasurer can make an order prohibiting an investment if he is satisfied that the proposed investment would be contrary to Australia\u2019s national interest.375 hr order for such an assessment to be made, the Claimant was hr effect required to provide a statutory notice and supplementary information stating, *inter alia.* the reasons for the acquisition and how the investment could impact Australia\u2019s national interest.376 The Respondent notes that it is a criminal offence for foreign investors to mislead the Treasurer.377\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 33 referring to [REDACTED]\n\nStatement of Defence. Vol. A. para. 22 referring to section 18(2) of the FATA.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 23-30.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 32 citing section 136.1 of Australia\u2019s Criminal Code.\n\n257.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, the fact that the Foreign Investment Policy and the How-to-Apply Guide are not mandated under FATA does not mean that those policies lack legal status or that noncompliance with those policies bear no consequences. The investment policies, as Mr. Callinan pointed out, impose mandatory non-legislative requirements and are vital in considering whether the Foreign Investment Application was misleading.378 Accordingly, the Respondent submits that misleading information can invalidate the notice even if it was not required by the legislation.379\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 68.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 68 referring to *El Cheikh v. Hurstville City Council* (2002) 121 LGERA 293, para. 31 (**Exhibit RLA-267**).\n\n258.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Foreign Investment Application contained false or misleading information because the Claimant failed to meet the requirements of the FATA.380 According to the Respondent, \"false\" must not be equated with \"intentionally untrue\". Relying on Australian jurisprudence, the Respondent explains that \"misleading conduct\" may be established when objectively conduct as a whole has a tendency to lead a person into error. For example, it may occur when a person tells a half-truth, even if its general conduct may be honest and reasonable; or when a person remains silent with respect to material information; or when the expression of an opinion carries with it a representation that the opinion is held on reasonable grounds and there are no such reasonable grounds.381\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 56-57; Respondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 242.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 468-469; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 28.\n\n259.\n\nTaking into account Mr. Gyles\u2019 first report, the Respondent clarifies that under Australian law, a representation or non-disclosure of information may be misleading even though the recipient (here, a junior agent of the Treasurer) might have been able to find out the truth by making further enquiries.382\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 32 referring to the First Gyles Report, paras 6(c), 7 (**Exhibit RWS-015**).\n\n260.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that its case rests on the disclosure requirements formalised in the Foreign Investment Policy and the How-to-Apply Guide,383 which were well known to the Claimant's experienced Australian foreign investment lawyers and its agent, Allens Arthur Robinson.384\n\nAlternatively referred to as \"How-to-Apply- Business Proposals Guide\" as coined by the FITPD and FIRB and Australia's witnesses.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 270-272.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimant agrees with the Respondent that the required content of the Foreign Investment Application is provided in the FATA and its corresponding regulations. However, the Claimant submits that the required content of the Foreign Investment Application rests on *only* \"basic, objective facts about the identity of the purchaser, the target and the transaction\" and that its form is equally basic and objective. This does not prevent the Treasurer from obliging the investor to furnish further information, but the Respondent did not exercise such power.385 As for the content of the \"notice\", the Claimant notes that section 26(2) of the FATA requests investors to provide a statement of the investor's \"intention to enter into [the] agreement\" by virtue of which the investor would acquire a substantial interest in an Australian corporation.386\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 65 referring to section 36 of the FATA.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 61.\n\n262.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant asserts that the guidance provided in the Foreign Investment Application is \"brief, high-level and generalized\",387 and since the Foreign Investment Policy has no statutory effect, the \"supplementary information\" requirement is not mandatory. In addition, the Claimant notes that the statement in the Foreign Investment Policy is legally inaccurate because, first, the FATA does not require \"applications\" to be made, it merely requires that notice be given to the Treasurer, and, second, the proposals need not be detailed; an investor is only required to provide basic information.388\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 58\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 65.\n\n263.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the Respondent's argument that the How-to-Apply Guide is a mandatory and clear document. In the Claimant's view, the How-to-Apply Guide inaccurately describes the FATA; it uses vague and high-level language, the meaning of its terms is ambiguous, it has no legal effect and it is not binding under Australian law.389 Accordingly, the Claimant submits that the fact that information contained in a foreign investment application does not conform to the How-to-Apply Guide does not make the information provided by an applicant false or misleading.390\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 67.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 70.\n\n264.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the regime established by the FATA and Australia's foreign investment policies is a *statement-based* regime and not a *disclosure* regime. Pointing to alleged contradictions in the Respondent's position as expressed at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections, the Claimant argues that, in these circumstances, an investor that is trying to reasonably interpret what information the Respondent is seeking by its policy cannot be criticised.391\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 69.\n\n265.\n\nFurther, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has changed its argument in relation to the \"false or misleading\" standard imposed by section 136.1 of the Criminal Code in the course of the proceedings and now states that, \"no allegation is made of a contravention of that section\". The Claimant, therefore, argues that the Respondent has invoked different standards including \"misleading or deceptive\", \"truthful and complete\", and \"accurate and complete\", leaving it unclear which of these standards the Claimant allegedly contravened.392\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 72.\n\n266.\n\nThe FATA and the Regulations mandate four conditions that the Claimant submits it has met. First, the Claimant argues that it openly disclosed that the acquirer would be a multinational tobacco company incorporated in Hong Kong and that it might avail itself of the Treaty in the event that Respondent's plain packaging legislation is passed.393 Second, the Claimant notes that its activities are perfectly legal in Australia and that PM Australia and PML's business in the field of manufacture, distribution and sale of tobacco products has continued uninterrupted for the past sixty years, generating substantial tax revenues for the Respondent.394 Third, the Claimant argues that its investments were made openly and it had duly notified the Respondent of its intention to acquire shares of PM Australia,395 with proper notice given to Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, the government body responsible for the Respondent's investment treaties.396 The Claimant directs the Tribunal to Mr. Hinton's expert report, in which Mr. Hinton notes that a proposal made by a foreign investor from a country that has signed a treaty with Australia constitutes a factor in favour of the proposal and not one against it.397 Fourth, the Claimant points out that notice was given in a context where there was much publicity regarding the differences between Philip Morris and the Respondent relating to plain packaging.398\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 146.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 147.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 143.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 148.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 149 referring to the Hinton Report, paras 39-40 (**Exhibit CWS-018**).

As a result, the Foreign Investment Application did not accurately reflect the prospect that the restructuring might enable the Claimant to make claims under the Treaty.\n\n268.\n\nFirst, the Claimant did not disclose that it intended to bring a claim against Australia under the Treaty if the Australian Government implemented the Plain Packaging Measures\u2014a circumstance that the Respondent terms the \"BIT intention\".399 Rather, the Claimant stated only that PM Asia \"does not intend any change in the direction of the business\" of the Australian subsidiaries.400\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 275.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 111 referring to the [REDACTED]\n\n269.\n\nSecond, it was not stated that the true purpose of the Claimant's investment was to \"place the PMI Group in a position where, assuming that Australia proceeded to enact the legislation implementing plain packaging, a member of the group, PM Asia, would be able to bring a claim under the Treaty seeking orders requiring Australia to repeal [P]lain [P]ackaging [Measures] and/or pay substantial damages\".401 Rather, the Claimant stated that the purpose of the restructuring was \"to refine PMI affiliates' corporate structure in the Asian region\".402 The witness statements relied upon by the Respondent evidence that the PMI Group was aware of the political risk it was facing in light of the Plain Packaging Measures and thus took account of the available Treaty protection for its Australian investments dining its restructuring.403 This circumstance is termed the \"BIT reason\".\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 48-49; Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 59.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 111 referring to [REDACTED]\n\nStatement of Defence. Vol. A. paras 50-52 referring to the Pellegrini Statement, para. 34 **(Exhibit CWS-002).**\n\n270.\n\nThird, the Claimant did not reveal that a reason for. or a purpose of. the investment was to allow for \"nationality planning\" and that the BIT intention and BIT reason would be *directly relevant* to assessing whether the investment was contrary to Australia\u2019s national interest because, if the claim were successful, it \"could affect Australia\u2019s capacity to carry out its announced public policy and/or affect its economy and community\".404 Rather, the Claimant stated that \"[f]rom a national interest perspective, we note that the [r]estructur[ing] does not result in any change in ultimate control\" of the Australian subsidiaries, and that \"our client is not aware of any reason why the [r]estructur[ing] would be contrary to the national interest... principally because the [r]estnictur[ing] is an internal restructuifing]\".405 This circumstance is termed the \"BIT impact on national interest\".\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 53-55 referring to Mr. Pellegrini's Witness Statement in the [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 111.\n\n271.\n\nAs a result of the failure to disclose the Claimant\u2019s BIT intention. BIT reason and BIT impact on Australia\u2019s national interest, the Foreign Investment Application was false or misleading as to PM Asia\u2019s intentions and reasons.406\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 276.\n\n272.\n\nThe Respondent also points out that the FIRB letter stipulated that the restructuring would not result in any change in ultimate control of PM Australia or PML. implying that the proposed investment was a \"corporate restructure\" or \"corporate re-organization\" that does not raise national interest issues.407\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 277 referring to the Witness Statement of Mr. Wilson (29 November 2014). paras 73-74. 76-78. 91-92 **(Exhibit RWS-014).**\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the two Treasury officials who processed the Foreign Investment Application conducted an initial examination to identify issues bearing upon Australia\u2019s national interest. The FIRB annual reports stated that such applications were usually decided by way of a \"no-objection letter\" issued by Treasury officials under a limited authority and without any personal consideration by the Treasurer\u2014a process well known to Australian foreign investment professionals regularly acting for prospective investors on FATA applications.408\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 277.\n\n274.\n\nIn the event that the application raised \"special circumstances\" or \"uncertainty\" as to the national interest test at the stage of the initial screening or *triage,* the matter would have been elevated for determination by the Treasurer\u2019s himself (on the advice of FIRB). In such a case, the Treasurer would have prohibited the investment, or approved it subject to conditions that would have prevented the Claimant from bringing a claim under the Treaty in respect of Plain Packaging Measures.409 The fact that the application was not elevated implies that the Respondent was unaware of the misleading statements and could not have inferred their existence, in addition, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument that Australia should have known for itself or that such information was public knowledge because it only came to know about the Claimant\u2019s BIT intention and BIT reason when Mr. Pellegrini admitted them in evidence with the Amended Statement of Claim.410\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 278,281.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 113-115.\n\n275.\n\nThe Respondent rebuts the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the two Treasury officials who processed the Foreign Investment Application were actually aware of the BIT intention and BIT reason and submits that the Respondent only became aware of such information in late March 2013.411 The Respondent adds that neither of the two Treasuiy officials who considered the Foreign Investment Application is available to give evidence. However, the Respondent argues that the minutes prepared by the two Treasury officials evidence that PM Asia\u2019s reason for the proposed investment was \"to simplify the administrative structure of the Asia Pacific region of Philip Morris\" and that the proposal \"did not appeal' to raise any issues which could be considered as contrary to the national interest\".412 The Treasury officials were entitled to assume that the Foreign Investment Application complied with Australia\u2019s detailed and longstanding disclosure requirements because the application was prepared by experienced foreign investment lawyers, who presented the transaction as a \"simple, straightforward corporate restructuring that did not raise national filterest issues\".413\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 155d.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 279 referring to the [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 280 referring to the Witness Statement of Mr. Wilson (29 November 2014). paras 152. 171, 186. 188 (Exhibit RWS-014).\n\n276.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant's argument that it did not need to reveal the BIT reason because the ability to bring a claim against Australia under the Treaty in respect of the announced Plain Packaging Measures was a mere \"motivation\" and not a \"reason\" for the restructuring. In response, the Respondent argues that \"motivations\" for a restructuring should not be treated differently from \"reasons\" since the two are indistinguishable. The Respondent explains that the Claimant put forward as its \"reasons\" the refining of its corporate structure but its \"motivation\" was to put it in a position to make a claim against Australia so as to defeat or neutralise plain packaging legislation once adopted by Parliament. The Respondent submits that, if this were the consequence of the Claimant's argument, then the Tribunal would be compelled to consider whether this was \"a case of sharp practice\". The Respondent infers that the Claimant held back the \"reason\" or \"motivation\" because, if revealed, it would risk the defeat of its strategy under the Treaty.414\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 287-289.\n\n277.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that it was unreasonable to expect the Claimant to reveal its \"BIT strategy\". The Respondent submits that any reasonable person would find it relevant to the national interest if a proposed investment exposes a country to a claim or seeks to defeat a legislative measure. The Respondent further submits that the Claimant cannot ask the Tribunal to find that its answers in the Foreign Investment Application were truthful when it declines to produce those persons who made the underlying decisions. The Respondent infers that the person(s) authorising the Foreign Investment Application either \"did not care to turn their mind to the truth of the statements therein\", or quite deliberately misled the Treasury officials into approving the Foreign Investment Application under their authorisation.415\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 292.\n\n278.\n\nWith regard to the Claimant's assertion that exposing Australia to a BIT claim cannot be considered to be contrary to the national interest, the Respondent submits that this contention fails to take account of the crucial role that admission plays under the Treaty. The Respondent adds that it may, lawfully, adopt the policies on admission that best suit its national interest. In the Respondent's view, it is not obliged to give an investor that opposes a measure that the Australian Government has decided to implement a new basis upon which to bring a claim against it. Non-admission in these circumstances is not illegitimately \"thwarting litigation\", but simply declining to assume a fresh obligation that will lead to an identifiable suit in the future.416\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 293-295.\n\n279.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the evidence of Mr. Hinton should be rejected. Being a senior officer at FIRB many years before the events in question, he never worked with former Treasurer Swan and cannot therefore second-guess what the latter would have done regarding the proposal. Moreover, since he is not an Australian lawyer and cannot give an expert opinion on the application of Australian law to the Foreign Investment Application.417 Instead, the Respondent adduces the testimony of Mr. Wilson, an actual member of the FIRB.\n\nSee Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ss. 76 and 79 (**Exhibit RLA-270**).\n\n280.\n\nIn short, the Respondent points out that (1) BIT issues were not routinely considered as part of the initial examination of proposed investments under the FATA; (2) the existence of a treaty was not considered a factor in favour of the proposed investment against the national interest; (3) Treasury statements contained no BIT issues; (4) although there is a unit within FITPD advising the Treasurer on general investment and trade-related policy matters, it is separate from the two review units that carry out the initial examination of foreign investment applications under FATA and therefore, Mr. Hinton's claim that FITPD has knowledge of the Treaty is true but insignificant; and (5) Treasury officials who carry out initial examinations of proposed investments cannot make their own investigations and must rely on accurate information from prospective investors.418\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 299-300.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimant argues that in order to assess whether its statements were misleading in respect of the prospect of a BIT claim against Australia, one must have regard to the context in which the statements were made.419 In the instant case, the relevant context includes the long-standing and highly-publicised differences between Philip Morris and the Australian Government in relation to plain packaging; Philip Morris' public statement that it would defend its right to use its intellectual property if the plain packaging legislation were to be enacted; a statement from Australia's Minister for Health to the effect that the Respondent would assess the enactment of the plain packaging legislation in light of the Respondent's domestic and international obligations; and the fact that the Treasurer is responsible for both notifications of investments under the FATA and for giving advice on investment agreements.420\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 172.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 172.\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that its statement could not be misleading because the Treasurer had full cognisance of the relevant facts, including the existence of the Treaty and the nationality of the acquirer.421 Importantly, in the Claimant's view, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the Claimant's statement have led the Treasurer to make a decision he would not otherwise have made.422\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 174.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 174(c).\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's contention that it was not aware of the BIT reason at the time the Foreign Investment Application was submitted. The Claimant observes that at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections, the Respondent admitted the Treasury's knowledge that the Claimant's ownership of the Australian subsidiaries would give the Claimant \"the right to access dispute resolution provisions under the BIT\".423\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 4.\n\n284.\n\nRelying on the testimony of Mr. Pellegrini, the Claimant argues that the Respondent was aware of PMI's plans to oppose plain packaging, and establishes that it did not make a decision to pursue a claim under the Treaty until June 2011.424 The Claimant adds that the Respondent must indeed have been unaware of the BIT intention because there was no such intention.425 The Claimant admits that it was well aware of the possibility of a claim in the future if a contingent event would occur over which the Claimant would have no control, but the Respondent at no point in time requested the Claimant to disclose contingent possibilities. The Claimant therefore concludes that the Foreign Investment Application is valid.426\n\nClaimant's First Post-hearing Brief, paras 6-10.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 5.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 78.\n\n285.\n\nThe Claimant also considers that it accurately stated its \"reasons for the proposal\" and that these were in line with Philip Morris' own internal view, that is, to \"refine\" or \"streamline\" the corporate structure of the group in the Asian region.427 The Claimant notes that the reasons stated in its Foreign Investment Application were in line with the contents and level of detail of notifications under FATA generally received by the FITPD.428 The Treasury approved its Foreign Investment Application without suggesting that the reasons were somehow inadequate or too general and without requesting further information from the Claimant.429\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 177.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 194.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 196, 208.\n\n286.\n\nIn line with the reasoning in the *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela v. Venezuela* decision, the Claimant submits that its Foreign Investment Application clearly and accurately stated that Claimant was a tobacco company incorporated in Hong Kong, thus providing the Respondent with all the information required to assess the jurisdictional consequences of the contemplated share transfer. The Claimant also relies on the Callinan Report to argue that the Respondent\u2019s failure to take into account facts that it knew when assessing the Foreign Investment Application does not and cannot make the notification misleading.430\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 198.\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, contrary to the Respondent's contention, it was not required to identify all the motives for its corporate restructuring and that the reason for the proposal should instead focus solely on the transaction.431 The Claimant refers to a Ministerial statement made in the context of the conclusion of the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement 2004 in which Australia's Minister for Trade publicly declared that internal corporate reorganisation gives rise to no concerns under foreign investment policy and that minimising their screening would be desirable.432\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 178-179.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 179, citing Correspondence between Australia and the United States Concerning the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, dated 18 May 2004 (**Exhibit C-382**).\n\n288.\n\nRelying on a letter from [REDACTED] the Claimant notes that Australia's Treasury does not view intra-group restructuring as contrary to national interest as long as there is no change in the ultimate holding company. Hence, the Respondent has not shown that the Claimant's restructuring raised the kind of serious concerns that have led the Treasurer to prohibit foreign investments in the past.433 The Claimant also refers to the Hinton Report to confirm [REDACTED] position and further notes that the onus was on the Respondent to request additional information, which it did not, on the corporate restructuring.434\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 199.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 180.\n\n289.\n\nRelying on findings in the Hinton Report, the Claimant states that it was not incumbent upon the Claimant to make mention in its notification to the Treasury that it might engage provisions of the Treaty in the future.435 This, according to the Claimant, is not relevant to the Treasury's assessment of the national interest and was accordingly not something that needed to be included in the Foreign Investment Application.436\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 182.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 201.\n\n290.\n\nIn fact, the Respondent could not have lawfully prohibited the Claimant's investments with a view to barring the BIT claim. Such conduct would raise serious policy and legal issues and would constitute an abuse of statutory power.437 The Claimant also points to the fact that there has been no divestment of Claimant's investments\u2014an indication that there were no grounds for prohibiting the investment at the time or at present.438\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 183, referring to the Hinton Report paras 80-92 (**Exhibit CWS-018**) and an unreported Australian case law (*Nettheim v. Minister for Planning and Local Gov't* (S. Court of New South Wales, 21 October 1988) (**Exhibit CLA-208**).\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 184.\n\n291.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimant affirms that it truthfully and genuinely stated its view in respect of Australia's national interest.439 The Claimant submits that it is \"nonsensical\" on the part of the Respondent to suggest that the Claimant was required to guess the reason why the investment might or might not be considered to be contrary to national interest.440\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 185.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 186.\n\n292.\n\nThe Claimant also observes that there is no objective definition of national interest. The Claimant notes that Australia purposefully left the meaning of the phrase nebulous such that it might consider investments on a case-by-case basis.441 Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's test for national interest is an imprecise and unpredictable one. To that effect, the Claimant refers to a paper produced by the Financial Services Institute of Australasia which states that \"approaches taken to the national interest test by successive Australian governments reveal that the concept has been stretched into a laundry list of unlegislated policy considerations [which] are often poorly defined [and] far removed from genuinely vital national interests\".442\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 187.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 189, citing Financial Services Institute of Australasia Paper (**Exhibit C-355**).\n\n293.\n\nThe Claimant invites the Tribunal to take into account Article 4 of the Treaty (\"Transparency of Laws\") in order to assess the extent to which the Respondent may seek to evade its obligations by referring to the Claimant's alleged incorrect statements by applying the said vague national interest test. The Claimant notes that Article 4 stipulates that the Respondent shall make laws and policies relating to investments that are publicly and readily available.443 Accordingly, the Claimant states that the legal validity of the admission of its investment cannot hinge on an accurate guess of what the Respondent's Treasurer might deem to be in the national interest.444\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 190; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 223.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 191.\n\n294.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the \"extraordinary\" character of the Respondent's Non-Admission of Investment Objection is revealed when the Respondent argues that its national interest will be affected in the event that the Claimant succeeds with its treaty claim.445\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 194.\n\n295.\n\nFinally, the Claimant points to correspondence between different departments of Australia that followed the Claimant's Notice of Claim. In response to enquiries by the Attorney-General's Department, the FITPD confirmed in September 2011 that no objections had been raised against the Claimant's Foreign Investment Application. Similarly, shortly before the first procedural meeting in the present arbitration in July 2012, the FITPD expressed no different view in this regard. The Claimant argues that this correspondence rebuts the Respondent's contention that it was misled by the Foreign Investment Application.446\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 82-92; see Statement of Facts above.\n\n***(c) Information Regarding the Consideration to Be Paid by PM Asia***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n296.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Foreign Investment Application was also without legal effect for the purposes of sections 26 and 27 of the FATA because the Claimant ultimately implemented a different transaction than that described in the Foreign Investment Application.\n\n297.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the Claimant stated in the FIRB letter that PM Brands S\u00e0rl would contribute all of the issued and outstanding shares of PM Australia held by it to PM Asia \"for no consideration\".447 The Respondent contends that this was not the proposal that the Claimant actually put into effect by PM Asia's Resolutions of 23 February 2011. Philip Morris Group internal e-mails disclosed to Australia on 1 November 2014 show that, on 17 February 2011 (six days after FITPD had issued the No-objection Letter), the PMI Group considered that adverse tax consequences could be avoided if the shares were transferred for value.448 However, the Claimant did not submit a fresh application or otherwise inform FIRB or FITPD of the alteration even though it knew that a statement made by it, on which Australia acted, was false.449\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 334 citing the [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 335.\n\nRepondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 336 referring to the [REDACTED]\n\n298.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the consideration to be paid to acquire an filterest in an Australian corporation forms part of the assessment of an investment proposal under the FATA.450 The Claimant\u2019s failure to update the Foreign Investment Application with this change in consideration was a \"material change in tenus of the transaction [that] had an obvious statutory consequence\", which was that, for purposes of FATA, \"no notice had been given at all\".451\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 337.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 338.\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n299.\n\nin relation to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant failed to disclose that a consideration was paid for the share transfer, the Claimant submits that the Respondent is wrong to allege that the Claimant has not implemented the transaction for which it obtained clearance.452\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 184.\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimant explains that, on 23 February 2011. the Claimant\u2019s Australian counsel discussed the change in consideration paid for the Claimant\u2019s proposed acquisition with [REDACTED] the FITPD case officer who was responsible for the Foreign Investment Application and the author of the No-objection Letter. The Claimant relies on an e-mail by counsel to show that the Respondent exaggerates and distorts information provided in the Foreign Investment Application.453\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 187-191 referring to [REDACTED].\n\n301.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent must have known that \"consideration played no role in assessments of FATA notifications of international reorganisations\" and that the \"Treasury and the FIRB did not take consideration into account when assessing notifications of corporate restructuring\".454\n\nLetter from the Claimant dated 21 January 2015.\n\n***(d) Completeness of the Foreign Investment Application***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n302.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the statutory notices under section 26 of the FATA were ineffective because the Claimant failed to annex to the notices \"all\" documents \"relating to or evidencing\" the agreement to restructuring, as was required under the FATA Regulations.455 This would have included PMI\u2019s internal memorandum dated 2 September 2010, which the Claimant alleges, \"documented the agreement to engage in the restructur[ing]\".456\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 67\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 328-331.\n\n303.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s restrictive interpretation of \"relating to or evidencing the agreement... to which the notice relates\" to mean *\"directly* evidencing or relating to the acquisition itself\" so that only legally binding contractual documents need to be annexed. The Respondent argues that neither were such documents submitted by the Claimant nor does Mr. Callinan\u2019s evidence support such an interpretation.457\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 143.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Foreign Investment Application was invalid because it failed to attach the PMI memorandum of 2 September 2010 is wrong. In response, the Claimant submits that Regulation 6 of the FATA Regulations requires prospective investors to annex documents relating or evidencing the investment \"agreement\" and that this requirement can only be read as a reference to documents directly evidencing or relating to the share acquisition in respect of which a notice was given. It cannot, the Claimant submits, be read as the Respondent does, as a reference to all prior documents evidencing the decision to proceed with a restructuring.458\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 242.\n\n**3. Domestic Law Consequences of the Alleged Violations of the FATA**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s non-compliance with Australia\u2019s law and investment policies has the following legal consequences under its domestic law:459\n\n- The statutory notices provided by the Claimant are invalid pursuant to sections 26 and 27 of the FATA because it contained false or misleading information and failed to annex documents required by the FATA Regulations.460\n\n- The Treasurer\u2019s No-objection Letter dated 11 February 2011, in which the Treasury signaled that it did not object to PMI Group\u2019s application, was affected by \"jurisdictional error\",461 or procured in \"bad faith\" if PM Asia *knew* that the Foreign Investment Application contained false or misleading information; it is thus regarded in law as \"no decision at all\" and as having no legal effect.462\n\n- The Treasurer\u2019s delegate was not in a position to consider the investment and its impact on Australia\u2019s national interest since the PMI Group\u2019s Foreign Investment Application (comprising of the statutory notices and the supplementary information required under Australia\u2019s law and investment policies) did not reflect the transaction that was actually implemented and was incomplete.463\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 316.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 40; Respondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 62b.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 62-23 citing *Craig v. South Australia* (1995) 184 CLR 163, p. 177 per Brennan, Deane, Gaudron, Toohey and McHugh JJ (**Exhibit RLA-013**) to explain the \"jurisdictional error\" concept. See also Respondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 319.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 57-66; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41; Respondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 62c.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 36d, 58.\n\n306.\n\nThe Respondent submits that any one of these consequences is sufficient for its Non-Admission of Investment Objection to succeed. Each of these alleged consequences will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\n307.\n\nThe Claimant on the other hand submits that, even if the Tribunal found that it breached Australian law, as alleged by the Respondent, this would have no legal consequence on the admission of the investments as a matter of Australian law.464\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 197.\n\n***(a) Invalidity of the Foreign Investment Application***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n308.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Foreign Investment Application is legally invalid and the Noobjection Letter in response to such an application is void.465 In addition, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s submission that, even if Australian law was breached, the investment remains \"admitted\" pursuant to section 38 of the FATA.466 Section 38 of the FATA provides that \"[a]n act is not invalidated by the fact that it constitutes an offence against this Act\". The Respondent relies on various Australian court decisions to argue that the term \"act\" in section 38 concerns the \"entry into the agreement\" by which the investment is effected\".467 The effect of section 38 of the FATA is to preserve contractual obligations between the parties to the transaction implementing the investment.468 As such, when a foreign person commits a criminal offence under sections 26 and 26A of the FATA by entering into a contractual agreement without furnishing the required notice, that contractual agreement is not, for that reason, void or unenforceable.469 In the present context, the Respondent explains that section 38 of the FATA \"preserves the validity of the *acts* of the parties that give effect to the transaction, not the legal validity of any administrative *decision*\".470 The Respondent adds that the Claimant cannot point to a single Australian case that supports its interpretation of section 38 to the effect that it preserves the legal validity of statutory notices under the FATA, or the administrative decisions made in response to them.471\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 37.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 302.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 304-306.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 43.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 303 referring to *Miller v. Miller* (2011) 242 CLR 446 (High Court of Australia) (**Exhibit RLA-307**): Under Australian law, a contract that is prohibited by Statute will generally be enforceable but \"[w]hether a Statute prohibits contracts is always a question of construction turning on the particular provisions, the scope and purpose of the Statute\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 37; Respondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 65.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 307, 309 referring to *Yates Security Services v. Keating* (1990) 98 ALR 21 (Wilcox J., Federal Court of Australia) (**Exhibit RLA-265**).\n\n309.\n\nThe Respondent further rejects the Claimant\u2019s related submission that criminal law penalties and divestiture are the exclusive remedies provided by the FATA with respect to false or misleading applications. It submits that the Claimant\u2019s submissions on this issue are contrary to constitutional law, principles of statutory interpretation, and case law under the FATA.472\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 310.\n\n310.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the Claimant\u2019s argument that the statutory notices are effective under sections 25 and 26 of the FATA and that the FIRB letter should be viewed as merely \"supplementary\" and not as forming part of the notices. The Respondent asserts that statutory notices and the FIRB letter constitute a single, compendious supply of all the information required under Australia\u2019s law and investment policies. Thus, the Foreign Investment Application in its entirety constituted the \"notice\" required to be provided under the FATA.473\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 320-321.\n\n311.\n\nRelying on an Australian court decision, the Respondent submits that \"if the notice. does attempt an explanation of what is proposed it must be accurate and complete, either particularly or generally\", and if \"infected by inaccurate or incomplete information\" so as to defeat the \"beneficial effect\", such a notice was not saved because it complied \"with the express requirements of the Act\".474\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 322-323.\n\n312.\n\nApplying these principles to the present case, the Respondent submits that the information in a statutory notice given in purported compliance with sections 25 and 26 of the FATA is intended to allow the Treasurer (informed by FIRB) to assess whether or not a proposal is \"contrary to national interest\" and to allow the Respondent to scrutinise the investment.475 The statutory notices were provided under cover of an application letter that was materially false or misleading. Having provided the FIRB letter, the Claimant did not ensure that it was \"accurate and complete\" or, at least, it negated \"the beneficial effect\" of the statutory notices and \"distort, obscure or minimise\" the information contained in them. By concealing the BIT intention, the BIT reason and the BIT impact on the national interest, the letter gave the impression that the Claimant\u2019s proposal was \"straightforward and raised no national interest issues\", leading to the miscarriage of the assessment process.476\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 144.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 325-326.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n313.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent overlooks section 38 of the FATA, which expressly states that the alleged violations do not invalidate the admission and lawfulness of the investment. The Claimant relies on two Australian court decisions to argue that non-compliance with the FATA does not render an investment illegal, void, or invalid under Australian law, and even criminal offences committed in the course of admission of an investment do not invalidate the investment.477\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 199, 202-204.\n\n314.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the FATA maintains the validity and lawfulness of the investment unless and until a divestment is ordered. Prior to such an order, the Claimant submits that the investor maintains all the rights, obligations, duties and liabilities of the investment.478 In the present case, the Claimant points out that the Treasurer had the power to order divestment but has chosen not to exercise that power. Accordingly, in the absence of an order to divest and in accordance with section 38 of the FATA, the Claimant argues that its investments were at all times lawful and properly admitted in Australia for the purposes of Article 1(e) of the Treaty.479\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 101.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 205-206.\n\n315.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant argues that, even assuming that the information provided was false or misleading, section 18(4) of the FATA distinguishes consequences for the investor from those for the investment. Section 38 of the FATA makes it clear that there are no consequences for the lawfulness or validity of the investment and of the admission thereof under Australian law. A criminal charge, according to the Claimant, does not affect the investment.480\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 201.\n\n316.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the offence under section 136.1 of the Criminal Code does not apply to statements made in, or in connection with, a *notice* under section 26 of FATA. Section 26 of the FATA provides *inter alia* \"made in, or in connection with *an application for*\" and therefore, the Claimant points out, does not apply to a notice of a proposal to invest.481\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 211.\n\n317.\n\nApplying this reasoning, the Claimant challenges the Respondent's argument that, by reason of the alleged provision of false or misleading information, no valid notice was given under section 26 of the FATA. The Claimant submits that the notice was made in accordance with the prescribed form and further clarifies that the alleged false or misleading information was not contained in the notice, but in the accompanying supplementary information. Even if that supplementary information were misleading, the Claimant asserts, that would not infect the validity of the notice itself.482 Hence, under any assumption, section 38 of FATA would still preserve the validity of the investments.483\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 213.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 220.\n\n***(b) Jurisdictional Error***\n------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n318.\n\nFurther, the Respondent submits that the No-objection Letter is legally invalid because it was tainted with \"jurisdictional error\".484 The Respondent sees two such errors:\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 340.\n\n319.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the Treasury officials who made the decision exceeded the terms of their authority.485 The No-objection Letter was issued by two Treasury officials pursuant to a limited authorisation. The officials were induced by PM Asia\u2019s false or misleading Foreign Investment Application to take a decision that went beyond their competence. According to the Respondent, the Foreign Investment Application involved \"special circumstances\" and raised \"uncertainty\" as to the foreign investment policy. Had the Treasury officials not been misled, the Claimant\u2019s case would have been elevated to FIRB and the Treasurer would have been competent to determine it.486\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 342-344.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 345.\n\n320.\n\nSecond, the Respondent, following the reasoning in *Leung v. Minister for Immigration*, submits that the No-objection Letter is invalid because it was vitiated by the Claimant\u2019s misrepresentations. As a matter of Australian law, \"even an innocent misrepresentation, provided that it is sufficiently material, will vitiate an administrative decision\".487 Moreover, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s contention that \"an Australian court would not grant relief for the jurisdictional error because Australia has challenged the validity of the No-objection Letter *collaterally* in this proceeding rather than directly in domestic judicial review proceedings, and because of Australia\u2019s alleged delay, acquiescence and waiver\".488 In response, the Respondent submits that, under Australian law, the validity of an administrative decision can be challenged *incidentally* in the course of seeking other relief.489\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 346-348.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 347.\n\nSee *Aerolineas Argentinas and Ors v. Federal Airports Corporation* (1995) 63 FCR 100, 117-118 (Federal Court of Australia) (**Exhibit RLA-238**): Collateral challenges are always permissible in the case of alleged jurisdictional error and sometimes permissible in relation to non-jurisdictional errors. See also R. Douglas, \"Collateral Attacks on Administrative Decisions: Anomalous but Efficient\" (2006) 51 AIAL Forum 71, p. 76 (**Exhibit RLA-335**).\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Claimant rebuts the Respondent's argument that the No-objection Letter was \"affected by jurisdictional error, and [was] as a result... an invalid decision\".490 In response, it argues that the decision-maker had the power to assess the national interest, and that is what was done.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 214.\n\n322.\n\nAlthough the Respondent might now take the view that its organs made a mistake in assessing the national interest, the Claimant submits that any such mistake would be an error within jurisdiction, not a denial of jurisdiction. The Claimant states that there can be no jurisdictional error only because the Respondent now wishes its Treasurer had made a different decision.491 According to the Claimant, an error must be more fundamental, in the sense that \"the decision maker makes a decision outside the limits of the functions and powers conferred on him or her. By contrast, incorrectly deciding something which the decision maker is authorised to decide is an error within jurisdiction\".492\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 217.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 217.\n\n323.\n\nIn relation to the Respondent's assertion that the Treasury officials who reviewed the Foreign Investment Application did not have authority to issue the No-objection Letter, the Claimant submits that the officials acted as the Treasurer's agent, his *alter ego,* and as such had the power to bind the principal. Therefore, the Claimant submits that the transaction was within the agent's jurisdiction.493\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 240.\n\n324.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant relies on *Leung*,494 which found that under Australian law, a \"decision infected by jurisdictional error may have continuing effect\".495\n\n*Leung v. Minister for Immigration* (1997) 79 FCR 400 at 413 (**Exhibit RLA-015**).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 241.\n\n325.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that even assuming that grounds existed to question the Treasurer's No-objection Letter on the basis of \"jurisdictional error\", the party alleging that the decision is invalid can apply to Court for an order of *certiorari* quashing the decision. The Claimant, relying on the two Australian court decisions, therefore argues that, unless such an order is sought by the Treasurer, the Tribunal can act on the faith of the decision.496\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 221-223.\n\n326.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, were the Tribunal to establish a jurisdictional error, a court might nonetheless refuse the Respondent a remedy, including a *certiorari,* due to \"delay or acquiescence or waiver\". The Claimant argues that the Respondent never sought to have the Treasurer\u2019s decision quashed before an Australian court and even if the Respondent wished to do so, it would have been refused on grounds of waiver and delay. Therefore, the Claimant points out that unless relief is granted by a court there is no obligation to treat the No-objection Letter as legally ineffective.497\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 226.\n\n327.\n\nFinally, the Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s assertion that it can impugn the No-objection Letter before the Tribunal as a collateral challenge. The Claimant explains that, because the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to issue prerogative writs under Australian law, it cannot, in a confidential arbitration proceeding, decide on the validity of the No-objection Letter, as a matter of Australian law.498\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 99.\n\n***(c) \"Admission in Fact\"***\n-----------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument that its investment must be considered \"admitted in fact\" since Australia has, until the present day, failed to prohibit the Claimant\u2019s investment.499 The Treaty does not require the Parties to bring parallel domestic court proceedings before making a claim or defence, nor would a decision of a domestic court bind the Tribunal.500\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 257.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 258-259.\n\n329.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that it was unable to resort to court proceedings since it only became aware of the basis for the Non-Admission of Investment Objection during these proceedings\u2014the FITPD and FIRB protected the confidentiality of the Claimant\u2019s information and did not disclose documents relating to the Foreign Investment Application until 19 August 2013.501\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 262-263 referring to (**Exhibit R-1081**, p. 10) and citing *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v. United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, para. 157) (**Exhibit RLA-246).**\n\n330.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent only discovered the Claimant\u2019s rationale for restructuring when that rationale was exposed by the evidence filed on 28 March 2013. Therefore, the Respondent was not \"plainly on notice\" of Claimant\u2019s false or misleading application from June 2011 when it was served the Notification of Claim.502 The Respondent also notes that it was under an obligation to avoid aggravating the dispute, such that it could not bring parallel proceedings against the Claimant.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 262.\n\n331.\n\nFurther, the Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot benefit from its false or misleading conduct. Following the reasoning in the *Thunderbird* Award, the Respondent argues that an investor who, by misleading information, prevents a State from an informed consideration of the exercise of its powers at the correct time should not be heard later to say \"because you admitted me in fact, the legality of the admission can never be questioned\".503\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 119e.\n\n332.\n\nIn line with the findings in *Fraport v. Philippines*, the Respondent submits that it was precluded from initiating legal action against the Claimant once this arbitration had begun because of the confidentiality regime adopted in the present proceedings.504 Further, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction depends on PM Asia\u2019s investment being \"admitted\" within the meaning of Article 1(e) of the Treaty, and neither a divestiture order (which can only operate prospectively as a matter of Australian law)505 nor a parallel criminal prosecution, nor a refusal of PM Asia\u2019s filings would per se lead to the dismissal of PM Asia\u2019s claims.506\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 152.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 119d.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 265.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n333.\n\nWhile the Claimant takes issue with the Respondent\u2019s characterisation of its position as one based on \"admission in fact\", the Claimant asserts that its \"investments were admitted in fact and in law and that the legal admission is formal and legally binding and remains in place and in full effect\".507\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 180.\n\n334.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Treasurer could have taken a number of steps, such as requesting further information in relation to the acquisition, extending the time taken to render his decision, prohibiting the investment within a 30-day period or imposing additional conditions for the authorisation of the transaction. However, the Treasurer took no such measures:508 the Foreign Investment Application was considered by the Respondent without any additional request for information and, in a legally binding letter dated 11 February 2011 from the FIRB,509 the Respondent officially notified the Claimant that it had no objection to the acquisition of shares.510\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 151.\n\nSee the FIRB Letter to PMI (**Exhibit C-151**).\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 153.\n\n335.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant contends that it has been and remains the \"registered, overt, and legal owner\" of the assets the admission of which the Respondent asserts has been \"nullified\".511 In support of its contention, Claimant points out that PM Brands' transfer of shares to Claimant in February 2011 was and remains valid under Australian law; [REDACTED] and that the Claimant's ownership of PM Australia is reflected in all of PM Australia's filings with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.512\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 157.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 157.\n\n336.\n\nThe Claimant also observes that the Respondent, despite having admitted the investment and having been on notice of the Claimant's present treaty claim, at no time took any steps to annul or reverse admission of the Claimant's investments,513 such as by ordering divestment under its FATA legislation. The Claimant argues that, notwithstanding the validity of the statutory notice under section 26 of the FATA, the Treasurer at all times retained the power of divestment.514 According to the Claimant, the Treasurer has not exercised this power because he was not satisfied that the investment is contrary to national interest.515 The Claimant thus submits that the Respondent's conduct is inconsistent with its present stance on the admission of the Claimant's investments, three years after the Claimant's notice of its treaty claim.516\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 211.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 158.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 159.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 155.\n\n337.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimant submits, the Respondent chose not to prosecute the Claimant for alleged criminal offences relating to the Claimant's investments before the Australian courts, which are the proper forum for the adjudication of \"criminal guilt\".517 In particular, the Claimant notes that the Respondent's privilege log shows that it considered taking legal action against the Foreign Investment Application as early as September 2011 but chose not to do so\u2014in the Claimant's view because the Respondent had no basis for taking action under domestic law.518\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 156, relying on Australian authority in *Chu Keng Lim v. Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs* (1992) 176 CLR 1, 27 (**Exhibit CLA-244**).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 214.\n\n338.\n\nIn relation to the Respondent's attempt to rely on the confidentiality regime applicable in the present proceedings, the Claimant submits that this argument is misconceived because the information relevant to the admission of the Claimant's investments was at all material times in the possession of the Respondent.519 In addition, the Claimant notes that the Respondent has neither made an application to the Tribunal to vary the confidentiality regime nor suggested that the present confidentiality regime inhibited it from taking domestic legal action.520\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 215.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 97.\n\n339.\n\nTherefore, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's failure to prohibit the Claimant's investments or to exercise its power of divestment reflects the Respondent's continuous admission of the Claimant's investments and, correspondingly, affords the Claimant the benefits and protection conferred by the Treaty.521\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 164.\n\n**4. International Law Consequences of the Alleged Violations of the FATA**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nIn addition to addressing the Respondent's arguments under Australian law, the Claimant relies on international law to demonstrate that any violation of Australian law that may have occurred in the context of the admission of the Claimant's investment has no legal consequences under the Treaty. The Respondent responds to these arguments in the alternative, in the event that the Tribunal finds that the concept of \"non-admission\" under Article 1(e) of the Treaty requires the Tribunal to consider international law, in addition to the laws of Australia.\n\n***(a) Whether the Respondent \"Tolerated\" the Claimant's Violations of Australian Law***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n341.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's argument that it is somehow precluded from invoking the invalidity of the Foreign Investment Application or the No-objection Letter because it did not take action against the Claimant in domestic proceedings. In *Fraport v. Philippines*, the Tribunal ruled that the Philippines was not estopped from raising the claimant's violations of Philippine law in the arbitral proceedings on the basis that the Philippines had \"knowingly overlooked\" these violations because the violations were \"covert\". By contrast, in the present arbitration, the Respondent argues that it did not \"tolerate\" the Claimant's violations of Australian law because the Respondent became aware of deficiencies in the Foreign Investment Application and the true reasons of the restructuring only during the present proceedings.522\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 353-356.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n342.\n\nReferring to academic commentary, the Claimant argues that, \"a host State which has for some time tolerated a legal situation is thereafter precluded from insisting later, against the investor, that the situation was unlawful from the beginning\".523 Therefore, the Claimant asserts that, where the host State has failed to take any action against a known alleged illegality, tribunals have dismissed objections based on the said alleged illegality.524 Similarly, following the reasoning in *Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia*, a host State cannot seek to undermine the *prima facie* valid and binding acts of its own authorities which are \"cloaked with the mantle of governmental authority\" on the basis that they were or might be unauthorised or otherwise invalid.525\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 244.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 244.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 245.\n\n***(b) The Impact of \"Technical\" Violations of Australian Law on the Admission of the Investment***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with the Claimant's submission that any inconsistencies in the context of the admission of the investment were \"technical violations\" of domestic law, and that \"minor infraction of host State law, such as missing information on an application\" cannot lead to a denial of investment protection. In the Respondent's view, the Treaty simply provides \"subject to the law and investment policies\" of the host State, without suggesting that only violations of norms of a higher order are relevant. In any event, the Respondent suggests that the Tribunal need not decide if there is an exception for \"technical breaches\" in the admission requirements of the host State because there was nothing technical about the Claimant's violation.526\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 359-362.\n\n344.\n\nWith regard to the pre-establishment provision under Article 2(1) of the Treaty, the Respondent counters the Claimant's argument that \"shall admit\" in Article 2(1) confers upon the host State a mandatory obligation to admit the Claimant's investment, and asserts that there is an express qualification in the form of the phrase: \"subject to its rights to exercise powers conferred by its laws and investment policies\". Further, the Respondent argues that, if there were indeed an obligation to admit investments, this would imply that the onus is all the more on the Claimant not to give false or misleading information so that the exercise of these \"all-important filtering powers is not frustrated\".527\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 120.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n345.\n\nThe Claimant argues that any breaches of Australian law that may have occurred merely amount to \"technical violations\", which are immaterial to an analysis conducted under public international law.528 To be relevant, a breach must be serious or concern a fundamental norm or involve a contravention of the *ordre public* of the host State.529 Minor infractions of host State law, such as missing information on an application, cannot in the Claimant's view lead to a denial of investment protection. Following the reasoning in several investor-State cases, including *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine, Quiborax v. Bolivia* and *Plama v. Bulgaria*, the Claimant submits that minor errors by the investor or a failure to observe bureaucratic formalities are irrelevant. According to the Claimant, tribunals refused to admit investments in accordance with local law only when there was deliberate concealment amounting to a flagrant violation, fraud, a chain of illegal acts, egregious and conscious, intentional and covert conduct.530\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 233.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 142(c)(i).\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 236-237.\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that there must be a direct causal link between the alleged illegality and the admission of the investment. The Claimant submits that in the instant case there can be no such link, as Australia's own investment legislation expressly provides that allegations of the kind argued by the Respondent have no effect on the validity of the investments.531\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 142(c)(ii).\n\n347.\n\nThe Claimant submits that an assumption of the Respondent's argument is that its \"foreign investment regime conferred upon the government an absolute and unfettered discretion to admit or refuse investments by a Hong Kong company\". This, the Claimant notes, is apparent from former Treasurer Swan's statement that he \"would have been more comfortable\" blocking Claimant's investments than admitting them due to the \"realities of Australian politics\".532 In other words, the Respondent's position is that it may act in an entirely arbitrary manner in deciding whether or not to admit investments from Hong Kong.533\n\nSee Swan Statement, para. 47 (**Exhibit RWS-013**).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 220.\n\n348.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent cannot alter the scope of its international obligations under the Treaty and state that Article 1(e) of the Treaty and the FATA regime gives it unfettered discretion to admit or refuse investments at its convenience. This, in the Claimant's view, contradicts Article 2(1) of the Treaty, which provides pre-establishment obligations to the Respondent.534 The only limitation to this pre-establishment obligation is that the investments shall be \"admitted subject to [Respondent's] laws and investment policies\". The Claimant, relying on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty as well as on arbitral jurisprudence, explains that this requirement operates as a control mechanism to screen out illicit investments.535 Therefore, the Claimant submits that it had a pre-establishment right to have its investment admitted pursuant to Article 2(1) of the Treaty, subject to the Respondent's laws and investment policies (which did not give the Respondent's Treasurer unfettered power to refuse admission on the basis that he wished to insulate the Respondent from consequences of its unlawful conduct).536\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 224.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 226.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 227.\n\n349.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its investments have been expressly admitted under Australian law and investment policies by way of the No-objection Letter, and no steps have been taken to unravel that admission. The Claimant therefore requests the Tribunal to recognise and accept the *status quo* under Australian law and investment policies and find that the investments have been accordingly admitted within the meaning of Article 1(e) of the Treaty on the basis of the Treasurer's explicit and unchallenged No-objection Letter, without the need for further enquiry.537 This, the Claimant asserts, is further reinforced by the principle that official acts of the State \"cloaked with the mantle of governmental authority\" are *prima facie* valid and binding on the State on the international plane and by the fact that Australia's investment regime provides that violations of the admission process have no impact on the validity of the admission.538\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 231; Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 231.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 142(a), 231(b).\n\n350.\n\nIn light of all the foregoing, and applying the above principles to the facts of the present case, the Claimant submits that Australia cannot rely on its own domestic law to defeat its international obligations and therefore (1) Australia is bound by its express, official, and continuing admission of the investments; (2) the Tribunal should not make determinations *ex post facto* as to the Australian national interest, but rather accept the *status quo* and recognize the binding nature of Australia's express, official and continuing admission of the investments; (3) any violations of Australian law are immaterial in circumstances where Australian law itself expressly provides that such violations have no impact on the substantive validity of the admission of the investments; and (4) Australia is precluded from relying on the alleged violations in circumstances where it has been in possession of all the relevant information for at least three years and has continuously and bindingly manifested its admission of the investments.539\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 246; Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 219.\n\n**C. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT'S CLAIM RELATES TO A PRE-EXISTING DISPUTE THAT FALLSOUTSIDE THE TRIBUNAL'S JURISDICTION OR OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES AN ABUSE OF RIGHT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe parties disagree as to whether the Claimant's claim falls outside the scope of Article 10 of the Treaty because it relates to a dispute which pre-dates the making of the investment (the \"*Ratione Temporis* Argument\") and/or whether the Claimant's claim amounts to an abuse of right because the Claimant restructured its investment to gain Treaty protection over a pre-existing or reasonably foreseeable dispute (the \"Abuse of Right Argument\").\n\n**1. The** ***Ratione Temporis*** **Argument**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Application of Article 10 of the Treaty to Existing Disputes***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant's claim falls outside the scope of Article 10 of the Treaty because Australia has not consented to the submission of pre-existing disputes to an arbitral tribunal established under this Treaty.540 The Claimant, in turn, contends that the timing of the dispute is irrelevant for the Tribunal's temporal jurisdiction. According to the Claimant, there are only two elements required for temporal jurisdiction: (1) a dispute concerning an investment must have existed at the time that the Claimant initiated the arbitration, and (2) the Treaty's substantive protections apply to any conduct that occurred after these protections have become applicable to that investment.541\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 116-119.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 258-259.\n\n353.\n\nThe Parties' differing views on the Tribunal's jurisdiction reflect their respective interpretations of Article 10 of the Treaty, which provides in relevant part as follows:\n\nA dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the former in the territory of the latter which has not been settled amicably, shall, after a period of three months from written notification of the claim, be submitted to such procedures for settlement as may have been agreed between the parties to the dispute. If no such procedures have been agreed within that three month period, the parties to the dispute shall be bound to submit it to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as then in force.\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n354.\n\nThe Respondent interprets Article 10 as requiring a series of qualifications in order to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction: \"the existence of a 'dispute' concerning an 'investment' or 'an investor of one Contracting Party' which is made 'in the territory of another Contracting Party'\".542 The Respondent considers that under Article 10, the \"other Contracting Party\" does not consent to the \"submission of claims to arbitration where the dispute that is invoked *predates* the making of the investment\".543\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 117.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 117.\n\n355.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, this interpretation of Article 10 of the Treaty derives from the application of Article 31(1) of the VCLT.544 Accordingly, the ordinary meaning of the phrase \"dispute... concerning an investment\" in Article 10 suggests that \"there must first be an 'investment' before there can be a 'dispute'\".545 Put another way, the plain meaning of Article 10 is, according to the Respondent that the Tribunal's jurisdiction does not extend to disputes that pre-date the making of an investment. Similarly, the object and purpose of the Treaty as stated in the preamble, including the creation of favourable conditions for greater investment and the promotion of economic relations, do not support an interpretation of Article 10 as allowing an international company first to engage in a pre-existing dispute involving a subsidiary in one of the Contracting Parties, and then to arbitrate this dispute once ownership of such subsidiary is transferred to a company incorporated in the other Contracting Party.546\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 120.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 121; Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 379.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 122-123.\n\n356.\n\nThe Respondent considers Articles 6(1) and 2(1) of the Treaty as illustrative of the context of the Treaty, which in turn informs the interpretation of Article 10.547 Article 6(1) concerning the prohibition of expropriation provides that compensation for deprivation \"shall amount to the real value of the investment immediately before the deprivation or before the impending deprivation became public knowledge whichever is the earlier\".548 Phrased in this fashion, the Respondent suggests, Article 6(1) clearly indicates that Article 10 does not permit the arbitration of a dispute where the investment post-dates the alleged deprivation by many months.549 Turning to Article 2(1), the Respondent argues that the Treaty does not envisage that the host State is to be placed under a positive BIT obligation \"to 'encourage and create favourable conditions' for putative Hong Kong investors to make investments in Australia in relation to pre-existing disputes\".550\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 380, 381.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 124.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 125.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 126.\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to case law to support its interpretation of Article 10 of the Treaty. Relying on the tribunal's finding in *Amco v. Indonesia*, the Respondent argues that pre-existing disputes can only be submitted to arbitration if the parties to the Treaty are \"considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged\" this result, which is not the case in the present dispute.551 The Respondent also points to *Lao Holdings v. Laos* in which a company restructuring was alleged to have taken place after the given dispute had occurred.552 The *Lao* *Holdings* tribunal referred to Article 28 of the VCLT which provides that \"[u]nless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of the treaty with respect to that part\".553 The *Lao Holdings* tribunal concluded that the silence of the treaty with respect to its temporal limit ought not to be interpreted as contemplating that \"investors could change their nationalities at will by artful corporate restructurings to 'forum shop' after a legal dispute has arisen with the same investor on the same issue and had therefore become. a discrete event in the course of relations [between the Parties] that predated the Treaty\".554 In the Respondent's view, the *Lao Holdings* tribunal's conclusion that the relevant treaty is not to be viewed \"as intending to provide legal weapons to investors for the purpose of re-engaging in a pre-existing legal dispute with the Lao Government\" should apply to the present case.555\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 128-129.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 383.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 383.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 383.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 383-384.\n\n358.\n\nThe Respondent does not consider there to be \"a presumption, let alone an absolute rule, that in cases of doubt[,] jurisdiction in an international agreement embraces *all* disputes, including those disputes that arose before a given treaty entered into force\".556 What matters in any given case is the interpretation of the specific wording of the treaty in light of \"well established principles reflected in Articles 28 and 31 of the VCLT\".557 Turning to the specific cases relied upon by the Claimant, the Respondent considers that *Georgia v. Russia* is not relevant to the present dispute since the International Court of Justice (\"**ICJ**\") was not addressing the question of jurisdiction over disputes that pre-date a treaty's coming into force, or a treaty's application more generally to pre-existing disputes.558 The Respondent also distinguishes the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"**PCIJ**\") in *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions.* In that case, the PCIJ considered whether explicit limitations were required to limit the jurisdictional scope of a treaty as otherwise applying to *all* disputes, including those that arise out of events occurring before the conclusion of the treaty. In the Respondent's view, the PCIJ was concerned with a particular treaty whose essential characteristic was to establish rights in relation to the period prior to its entry into force.559 Consequently, no general rule was established.560\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 389.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 383.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 387.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 389.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 389.\n\n359.\n\nThe Respondent further distinguishes the decisions in *Vivendi v. Argentina (II)* and *Chevron v. Ecuador (I)*, both relied on by the Claimant, on the basis that neither case considered the issue of pre-existing disputes in an analogous factual context. The *Vivendi II* tribunal did not consider the issue of pre-existing disputes at all, and the case is therefore irrelevant to the issue at hand.561*Chevron v. Ecuador (I)* concerned a long-standing investor that was already in dispute with the State prior to the entry into force of a new BIT;562 by way of contrast, the present dispute concerns \"a pre-existing dispute, then a corporate restructuring, and then an attempt to establish a pre-conceived BIT jurisdiction over the pre-existing dispute\".563\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 385.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 391; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Preliminary Objections, para. 131.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 391.\n\n360.\n\nThe Respondent discounts the relevance of the International Law Commission's (\"**ILC**\") 1966 *Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with Commentaries*, cited by the Claimant to suggest that the term \"disputes\", without qualification, covers all disputes existing after entry into force of the agreement. According to the Respondent, the Commentary clearly distinguishes between treaties establishing dispute resolution fora whose jurisdiction extends to all disputes existing after the entry into force of the agreement, and treaties containing a jurisdictional clause that is attached to substantive treaty provisions and to which \"the non-retroactivity principle may operate to limit *ratione temporis* the application of the jurisdictional clause\".564 In the Respondent's view, the Claimant mischaracterises the Australia-Hong Kong BIT as falling into the former category, whereas in fact the second category is more apposite.565\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 392.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 392-393.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n361.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it is not necessary to examine whether Article 10 extends the Tribunal's jurisdiction to considering pre-existing disputes. First, in the Claimant's view, both Parties agree that the dispute existed when the Claimant initiated the arbitration on 21 November 2011, after the entry into force of the Treaty.566 There is therefore no need to consider any disagreement between the Parties before this date. Second, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione temporis* is limited by the date on which the dispute ended, rather than the date on which it commenced. *Continuing* disputes, insofar as they continue to exist at the time of a Notice of Arbitration, are contemplated under Article 10.567 To this end, the Claimant refers to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the VCLT, which states that \"an act or fact or situation which took place or arose prior to the entry into force of a treaty continues to occur or exist after the treaty has come into force, it will be caught by the provision of the treaty\".568 Moreover, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* state that \"[b]y using the word 'disputes' without any qualification, the parties are to be understood as accepting jurisdiction with respect to all disputes *existing* after the entry into force of the agreement\".569\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 259, 267.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 266.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 294.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 294.\n\n362.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal considers it necessary to determine whether Article 10 applies to disputes that pre-date the entry into force of the Treaty, the Claimant contends that nothing in Article 10 or other provisions of the Treaty excludes pre-existing disputes from the scope of dispute settlement.570 According to the Claimant, \"[a]bsent treaty language, there is no basis to assert that the Treaty excludes any dispute that began (but did not end) before the entry into force of the Treaty or before the making of the relevant investment\".571 Consequently, the current Treaty does not exclude pre-existing disputes, whether arising before the entry into force of the Treaty or before a change in the investor's nationality.572 Furthermore, neither Article 2 nor Article 6 of the Treaty implies any limit on the temporal scope of Article 10. According to the Claimant, Article 2 on the encouragement and creation of favorable conditions is a substantive obligation unrelated to the temporal scope of Article 10. Article 6 concerning expropriation might hypothetically be relevant to damages but not to jurisdiction.573\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 262.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 278.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 266.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 262-264.\n\n363.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent's reliance on the analysis of legal principles in *Lao Holdings v. Laos* is misleading because, unlike in the present dispute, the relevant BIT in *Lao Holdings v. Laos* imposed an explicit temporal limitation on the jurisdictional scope of the treaty such that \"any claim. which arose before [the BIT's] entry into force\" was excluded.574 Similarly, the Claimant maintains that the relevant BIT in *Lucchetti v. Peru* expressly defined the scope of disputes so as to exclude \"differences or disputes that arose prior to its entry into force\".575\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 279.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 280.\n\n364.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the PCIJ in *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* established a presumption that absent a specific provision to the contrary, a dispute settlement clause extends to all qualifying disputes *existing* at the time the claimant invokes the clause, regardless of when the dispute arose.576 The Claimant dismisses the Respondent's concern that the finding in *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* \"was limited to arbitration treaties\"; according to the Claimant, the Court gave no such indication and in any case the treaty was also concerned with establishing recourse to arbitration.577 The Claimant cites academic commentators in support of the proposition that the decision in *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* establishes that a tribunal has jurisdiction over disputes that exist when the arbitration commences.578 This principle is, according to the Claimant, further supported by the findings of the ICJ in *Georgia v. Russia*.579 In that case Georgia conceded that a dispute between the parties had existed prior to the entry into force of the relevant treaty. The ICJ did not consider whether by virtue of this 'pre-existing' dispute, it lacked jurisdiction *ratione temporis*. Rather, the ICJ concluded that a \"dispute must in principle *exist* at the time the Application is submitted to the Court\".580\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 283.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 284.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 284-285.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 286.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 286.\n\n365.\n\nThe findings in *Chevron v. Ecuador (I)*, in the Claimant's view, also confirm the broad interpretation of the term \"disputes\".581 In *Chevron v. Ecuador (I)*, the tribunal found that in the absence of a temporal limitation in the treaty's dispute settlement provision, \"the word 'disputes' must simply be given its ordinary meaning'- *i.e.* it must cover all existing disputes\".582 Given that the existence of a dispute is an element of jurisdiction, the dispute must exist on the date the arbitration commences; therefore, according to the Claimant, it does not matter when the dispute began.583 The Claimant cites as further authority the observations of the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina (II)* that \"the determination of whether a party has standing *in an international judicial forum*... is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been instituted\".584\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 281, 283.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 283.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 281.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 281-282.\n\n366.\n\nAbsent specific language to the contrary, the Claimant argues, an agreement that refers \"disputes\" to arbitration covers any disputes that exist when the arbitration clause is invoked, including those disputes that exist after the Treaty becomes applicable through a change in the nationality of the investor.585 To support this position, the Claimant refers to the ILC's 1966 *Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with Commentaries*, which the Claimant cites as stating that \"by using the word 'disputes' without any qualification, the parties [to a treaty] are to be understood to be accepting jurisdiction with respect to all disputes *existing* after entry into force of the agreement\".586\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 265.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 265.\n\n367.\n\nFinally, the Claimant clarifies that it \"is not seeking retroactive application of the Treaty\" as none of the alleged claims arose from \"any actions that preceded the [Treaty's] entry into force\".587\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 289-291.\n\n***(b) Legal Test for Establishing the Existence of a \"Dispute\"***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n368.\n\nThe legal test for establishing whether a dispute has arisen is, according to the Respondent, \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact; a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons\".588 This test has, in the Respondent's view, been established by the PCIJ in *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions*589 and was subsequently affirmed by the ICJ in *Georgia v. Russia*.590 In *Georgia v. Russia*, the ICJ stated further that the existence of a dispute in a given case is a matter for objective determination and that \"[i]t must be shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other\".591 The Respondent also refers to *Murphy v. Ecuador* and *Teinver v. Argentina* in which the tribunals reiterated the *Georgia v. Russia* standard.592 In *Murphy v. Ecuador*, the tribunal noted that \"[i]t is generally admitted that the mere presence of a legal conflict of interests is sufficient to originate a difference of a dispute\".593\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 130.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 123.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 130.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 131.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 132.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 132.\n\n369.\n\nIn light of the *Mavrommatis* test, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's contention that, in order for there to be a dispute, the challenged measure must have passed into law.594 In the Respondent's view, \"[t]he threat to engage in conduct which, it is asserted, would breach an international obligation, can ground a dispute\".595 With respect to the case law cited by the Claimant, the Respondent argues that the decisions in *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* and *Lao Holdings v. Laos* do not \"seek to establish a general rule\" that a measure must become part of the domestic law before a dispute can be deemed to arise.596 According to *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela*, the Respondent notes, \"a decision by a government can indeed give rise to a dispute before it passes into law\".597 The Respondent asserts the proposition established by the tribunal in *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* that \"an announced decision by a government to introduce a measure by legislation, to be considered and enacted by a legislature, can found a dispute\" if that decision has been \"sufficiently clearly opposed and protested by an investor\".598 In the view of the Respondent, the possibility that a government may withdraw the measure before the legislature enacts it, or that the legislature might reject it, are alternative means by which the dispute might be resolved, and not grounds to deny the existence of the dispute in the first place.599 That the *Lao Holdings* tribunal did not find a dispute in that case can be explained by the fact that the parties in *Lao Holdings v. Laos*, in contrast to the facts relevant to the present dispute, \"were still in discussions\" after the restructuring and \"the final position of the. Government was not certain\", which led to the conclusion that \"it could not be said that they were in dispute\".600\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 400.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 401.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 406.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 407.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 407-408.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 408.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 429-430.\n\n370.\n\nThe Respondent also challenges the Claimant's reliance on *Teinver v. Argentina*, arguing that the tribunal found that \"[t]o instigate a dispute, therefore, refers to the time at which the *disagreement* was formed, which can only occur once there has been at least some exchange of views by the parties. [The instigation of a dispute] does not refer to the commission of the act that caused the parties to disagree, for the very simple reason [that] a breach or violation does not become a 'dispute' until the injured party identifies the breach or violation and objects to it\".601 This finding is, in the Respondent's view, \"entirely consistent with Australia's position\".602 As regards the Claimant's reliance on the *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation* case, the Respondent asserts that the case is irrelevant because none of Russia's jurisdictional arguments raised \"the same issue as in the current case\" and RosInvestCo \"was not even arguably in dispute with Russia prior to the making of its investment\".603 The Respondent distinguishes *RDC v. Guatemala* on the ground that, unlike in the present dispute, \"jurisdiction under [the Treaty] is established by reference to the existence of 'measures adopted or maintained by a Party'\".604 Moreover, given that \"the government process leading to the [measure in question] was largely an internal one\", \"there was no opposition of views prior to [its] publication\".605 The Respondent further criticises the Claimant's interpretation of the *Gremcitel* Award. According to the Respondent, \"the facts of *Gremcitel* are materially different\" from the facts here because \"the Peruvian Government had not previously made any public announcement concerning its intentions\" to adopt the measure in question.606 Moreover, in determining the date when the dispute arose, the Respondent notes, \"the *Gremcitel* tribunal applied the *Mavrommatis* test\".607\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 404.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 405.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 431.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 424-426.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 427.\n\nRespondent's Letter to the Tribunal dated 25 January 2015, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Letter to the Tribunal dated 25 January 2015, p. 2; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 124.\n\n371.\n\nThe Respondent dismisses the relevance of *Rights of Passage Over Indian Territory* on the ground that the cited proposition in that case\u2014that a dispute cannot \"arise until all its constituent elements ha[ve] come into existence\"\u2014only concerned that particular dispute and cannot serve as a general rule.608 According to the Respondent's interpretation, this decision \"suggests that disagreement over the existence of Portugal's claimed right of passage could amount to a dispute in the absence of any allegation of a violation of an international obligation\".609\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 402.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 402.\n\n372.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant that the actions taken by both parties in the period prior to the enactment of the plain packaging legislation were solely preparatory acts and conduct that cannot give rise to a legal dispute. Firstly, the Respondent reiterates that the test in *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* for the establishment of a dispute does not make a distinction between disagreements over decisions to enact a law and the actual enactment of that law.610 Secondly, the Respondent disputes the relevance of the Claimant's reliance on *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project* on the basis that in that case the Parties were deemed to be in dispute over the proposal by Czechoslovakia to commence damming works in its territory that would have impacts downstream on Hungary's territory. According to the Respondent, these damming works could have been abandoned at a time when the ICJ deemed the parties to be in dispute.611 Finally, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's assertion that the present dispute is necessarily contingent on the actual enactment of plain packaging legislation such that anything prior to enactment must properly be considered \"preparatory\". According to the Respondent \"the 2011 enactment of the plain packaging legislation cannot meaningfully be divorced from the Australian Government's decision of April 2010 to introduce that very legislation\".612\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 419.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 420.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 421-422.\n\n373.\n\nWhile the Claimant refers to the ILC's *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts\u2014* that a State does not breach its international obligations merely because certain government actors threaten or make preparations for an act that might cause such a violation if enacted\u2014the Respondent asserts that this conflates the existence of a dispute with findings of international responsibility. In this regard, the Respondent points to the decision in *Achmea v. the Slovak Republic (II)* in which the tribunal found that \"[i]t does not follow from the fact that international responsibility can arise only after an internationally wrongful act has occurred, that an internationally wrongful act is required for a legal dispute to exist\".613 Rather, \"the allegation of a breach is. a requirement for liability to arise\" and not a \"constitutive element of the notion of legal dispute\".614\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 417.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 417; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 124.\n\n374.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to *Achmea v. the Slovak Republik (II),* which concerned a measure that had been threatened by the respondent government, but not yet enacted.615 The Respondent quotes the tribunal as having found that a dispute existed when \"the two Parties h[e]ld radically opposing views\" on the proper interpretation of a particular treaty provision.616 The Respondent also disagrees with the Claimant that *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* establishes a \"general principle\" that a dispute must concern a matter that has developed into a concrete legal claim.617 In *Pac Rim v. El Salvador*, the critical factor, according to the Respondent, was that \"the respondent continued to give indications that the mining permits at issue might yet be granted, and the parties remained in negotiation, after the date of the claimant's acquisition of US nationality\".618\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 409.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 409-410.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 411.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 411.\n\n375.\n\nThe Respondent disputes purported limitations introduced by the Claimant into the concept of \"dispute\" as enunciated in *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions.*619 In particular, the manner in which the Claimant formulates its claims (*i.e.* that the claims arise only from the enactment and enforcement of the Plain Packaging Measures) is not, in the view of the Respondent, decisive.620 This position conflates the formulation of a claim with the question of whether a dispute exists.621 The identification of the existence of a dispute remains a \"matter for objective determination by the given court or tribunal. not a matter to be irrevocably determined by a claimant in its litigation strategy\".622\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 394.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 396.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 398.\n\nRespondent's Reply on preliminary Objections, para. 398.\n\n376.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the conclusions of the tribunal in *Urbaser v. Argentina\u2014* that it was for the claimant to state what it considered to be the dispute between the parties\u2014does not suggest otherwise, since the issue of the formulation of a claim \"arose in the discrete context of the difference between a shareholder's claim and a claim on behalf of a company in its own right\".623 The correct test was, in the Respondent's view, set out by the ICJ in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case* : namely that it is for this Tribunal to \"determine the real dispute that has been submitted to it\".624 The Respondent therefore reiterates that \"[a]n exercise of objective determination\" is required, and for that purpose \"the way that PM Asia has chosen to formulate its current BIT claim is relevant but not decisive\".625\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 398.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 398.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 399.\n\n377.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is critical that the Tribunal focuses on \"the substance of the dispute as it developed. [and] to determine whether the facts or considerations that gave rise to the earlier dispute continue to be central to the current claim\".626 In reaching an objective determination of the dispute, the Tribunal ought not, in the Respondent's view, be concerned with whether precisely the same BIT claim could have been made prior to the restructuring of February 2011.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 399.\n\n378.\n\nIn further support of its assertion that the dispute prior to the enactment of the plain packaging legislation is the same as the dispute presently before this Tribunal, the Respondent invites the Tribunal to adopt the finding in *Lucchetti v. Peru* that \"the critical element in determining the existence of one or two separate disputes is whether or not they concern the same subject matter\" and this Tribunal will \"have to determine whether or not the facts or considerations that gave rise to the earlier dispute continued to be central to the later dispute\".627 The Respondent reiterates that \"the fact that the original dispute did not involve, and necessarily could not have involved, any allegation of breach of the BIT did not, in itself, mean that the claim presented under the BIT constituted a distinct dispute\".628\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 413, 476.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 414.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n379.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's position that the PCIJ in *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* endorsed the general principle that \"a mere conflict of views between two parties gives rise to a dispute, even if that conflict of views pertains to a measure that has not been adopted, might never be adopted, and the specific contours of which remain uncertain\".629 The Claimant distinguishes *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* on the basis that in that case the PCIJ did not decide, and was not asked to decide, this principle: the PCIJ, in the view of the Claimant, held only that a dispute existed in that case because Greece had asserted that Britain had taken an action in breach of international law.630 According to the Claimant, the question before the present tribunal\u2014which is one not touched upon by the PCIJ in *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* \u2014is \"whether preparatory activity gives rise to a dispute\".631 In the Claimant's view, the correct interpretation of *Georgia v. Russia* is that the ICJ's analysis focused on the question of whether a dispute about a claim had achieved the \"specific crystallisation\" necessary to invoke the ICJ's jurisdiction over contentious cases and that such crystallisation occurred only subsequent to the allegedly wrongful State conduct.632\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 254.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 254.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 255.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 282.\n\n380.\n\nThe Claimant further distinguishes *Murphy v. Ecuador* on the basis that the position relied upon by the Respondent\u2014that \"the mere presence of a legal conflict of interest is sufficient to originate a difference or dispute\"\u2014is the position of the dissenting arbitrator in that case.633 In any event, according to the Claimant, the conclusion of the relevant dissenting opinion in *Murphy v. Ecuador* was that the dispute arose *after* the measure that the claimant alleged breached the treaty.634 Similarly, in *Teinver v. Argentina*, the tribunal found that a dispute can arise only after \"the injured party identifies the breach or violations and objects to it\".635\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 280.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 280.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 281.\n\n381.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the question that is before this Tribunal\u2014namely, whether a preparatory act gives rise to a dispute\u2014has been conclusively decided in international law.636 In the view of the tribunals in *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* and *Lao Holdings v. Laos*, the Claimant notes, \"the dispute over [specific] measures can only be deemed to have arisen after the measures were taken\".637 The Claimant distinguishes *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* from the present case on the ground that it does not challenge \"an announced but unimplemented government policy\" under the Treaty.638 With regard to *Lao Holdings v. Laos*, the Claimant asserts that the facts of that case are analogous to the matters presently in dispute. In *Lao Holdings v. Laos*, the tribunal was concerned with the compatibility with the applicable treaty of imposing a new tax code on the investor. The tax code was enacted a month before the restructuring of the original Macau company that resulted in the claimant becoming an investor under the applicable treaty.639 The respondent State challenged the tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* on the grounds that the dispute actually arose more than a month before the business restructuring.640 The *Lao Holdings* tribunal reasoned that Laos carried the burden of proving that the dispute arose earlier than the claimant had alleged.641 This in turn required the proof that (1) it was objectively unreasonable for the investor to have believed that the issue was still live; (2) the government's consideration of the matter had come to an end; and (3) that the government's decision was \"completely finalized\".642 The tribunal held that Laos failed to meet this burden of proof, and the dispute arose only \"when the final decision [on the tax code]. was adopted at the highest level\" of the government.643 The Claimant emphasises that the tribunal still \"found no pre-existing dispute\" even though the tax law had already been amended and the investor's application had been rejected by the Minister of Finance \"at the time the investment was made\".644\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 255.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 277; Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 255.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 270.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 297-299.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 301.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 302.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 302.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 302-303.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 266-268.\n\n382.\n\nThe Claimant also refers to *Teinver v. Argentina* and *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation* to further support its position that a measure must pass into law before it can form the subject of a legal dispute. Accordingly, the tribunal's finding in *Teinver v. Argentina* were that \"a breach or violation does not become a 'dispute' until the injured party identifies the breach or violation and objects to it\".645 In *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation*, the tribunal put emphasis on the timing of the specific acts that allegedly breached the BIT, rather than the origin of any broader disagreements. In the view of the tribunal, although Russia's earlier conduct was \"inextricably linked\" to the subsequent acts, the \"major alleged acts of Respondent breaching the [BIT]. all occurred after Claimant was an investor under the [BIT]\".646 In addressing the Respondent's attempts to distinguish *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation*, the Claimant emphasizes that \"[t]he tribunal was focused on when the acts giving rise to the dispute occurred, not whether *RosInvestCo* as opposed to Yukos was involved in an earlier dispute\".647 According to the Claimant, a similar fact pattern arises in *RDC v. Guatemala*, wherein the tribunal determined that the relevant dispute \"crystalli[s]ed\" only subsequent to the entry into force of the relevant *lesivo* resolution said to have violated the applicable BIT.648 Furthermore, the Claimant puts emphasis on the *Gremcitel* Award in which the tribunal considered the critical date of the relevant dispute as the date \"on which the State adopts the disputed measure, even where the measure represents the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may have started years earlier\".649 Lastly, the Claimant points to the decision of the arbitral tribunal in *Cervin v. Costa Rica* in which it was found that even where \"there has existed pre-existing litigation\", such pre-existing litigation \"cannot in itself deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction\".650\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 277.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 307; Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 256.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 257.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 294.\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal dated 22 January 2015, p. 3.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 287.\n\n383.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in *Rights of Passage Over Indian Territory*, the ICJ explained that, \"while '[c]ertain incidents occurred [before 1954]. they did not lead the Parties to adopt clearly-defined positions as against each other. The 'conflict of legal views' between the Parties which the [PCIJ] in [ *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* ] includes in its definition of a dispute had not yet arisen\".651 This case, the Claimant maintains, establishes that a dispute cannot \"arise until all its constituent elements ha[ve] come into existence\", including an act or omission allegedly in breach of the respondent State's international obligations.652 Similarly, in *Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria*, the Claimant adds, the PCIJ rejected Bulgaria's assertions that the Court lacked jurisdiction *ratione temporis* on the basis that the dispute had arisen \"from 'situations or facts' that took place prior to the date of Belgium's acceptance of the Court's compulsory jurisdiction\". According to the Claimant, the Court considered that \"the 'situations or facts' that Bulgaria alleged had given rise to the dispute were not the dispute's 'real cause'\". Rather, the real cause of the dispute was reflected in the \"concrete actions that allegedly breached Bulgaria's international obligations and that were taken by the Bulgarian government after the critical date\".653 In further support of this proposition, the Claimant cites the PCIJ in *Phosphates in Morocco* wherein the PCIJ held that \"a dispute could only arise after the enactment of the challenged measures that were the 'real cause' of the dispute.654\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 260.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 277.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 261.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 262.\n\n384.\n\nAnnouncements of decisions to introduce specific legislation are, in the Claimant's view, better characterised as preparatory acts that, absent a positive obligation to the contrary, do not amount to a breach of international law.655 This is because such statements, in the words of the ICJ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project*, do not \"'predetermine the final decision to be taken' on the issue\".656 To support its argument, the Claimant quotes ILC's *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts*, which makes, in the view of the Claimant, a distinction between \"when a breach of international law occurs\" as opposed to \"being merely apprehended or imminent\".657 The Claimant also points out that, to determine whether a dispute has arisen, the tribunal in *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina* reasoned that, \"what counts is whether the rights of the investor have been affected\". Similarly, the *Pac Rim* tribunal in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* put emphasis on \"at least one specific and identifiable governmental measure that allegedly terminated the rights of the claimants \".658\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 285.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 287-288.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 285.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 286.\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimant further maintains that *Achmea v. the Slovak Republik (II)* supports its position. In *Achmea v. the Slovak Republik (II)*, the respondent State had announced its intent to pursue a unified health insurance system, but it had not yet implemented that measure when the claimant initiated arbitration. The tribunal \"declined jurisdiction because... there could be no legal dispute under the BIT until such time as the [respondent] adopted the measure in question\".659 The Claimant quotes the *Achmea II* tribunal's findings that the host State's \"consent only extends to disputes dealing with alleged breaches of the BIT that have already occurred at the time of the institution of arbitral proceedings\" and that there could be no \"disputes concerning an investment\" under the BIT unless \"on the basis of [the claimant's] claims of fact there could occur a [treaty] violation\". According to the Claimant, the *Achmea II* tribunal noted further that, \"preparatory work. is in any circumstances not unlawful\".660\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 263.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 264.\n\n386.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to find that a dispute can arise on the basis of a threat to enact law that will violate an applicable BIT, the Claimant submits that in order to identify the subject of the dispute, the Tribunal \"must examine Claimant's pleadings to determine which acts or omissions Claimant asserts breached the BIT and form the basis for its claims\".661 The Claimant refers to *Urbaser v. Argentina* in which the tribunal explained that \"it is for Claimants to state the claims they are submitting to this arbitral jurisdiction. It is for them to say what they consider to be the 'dispute arising between them and the [respondent State]\".662 In the present case, the Claimant made it clear that its \"claims arise from the enactment and enforcement of the TPP Act and its effect on investments in Australia owned or controlled by PM Asia\".663\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 271.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 271.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 273.\n\n387.\n\nFinally, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's argument that its claim can be interpreted as referring to a pre-existing dispute concerning the threat of passing plain packaging legislation. Insofar as there was a dispute between PMI and the Respondent prior to the enactment of the plain packaging legislation, the Claimant asserts that this dispute cannot be considered the same as that which is currently before the Tribunal. In this regard, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's test for ascertaining whether two disputes are the same. In order to determine whether two disputes are the same, the Claimant contends, investor-State tribunals \"have applied a 'triple-identity' test that requires an examination of the cause of action, object, and parties to the two disputes\".664 In the Claimant's view, an application of this test reveals that, \"the dispute that Respondent posits and the dispute that is actually at issue in this arbitration are entirely distinct\".665\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 271.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 272.\n\n388.\n\nApplying the *Lucchetti v. Peru* standard as suggested by the Respondent, the Claimant argues, \"leads to the same outcome as the triple-identity test\".666 In *Lucchetti v. Peru*, the tribunal was required to determine whether a dispute that predated the entry into force of the applicable BIT was the same as the dispute that was at that time before the tribunal. Each dispute referred to different decrees, issued by the same Peruvian municipality denying the investor certain construction and operating licenses. The *Lucchetti* tribunal decided that the two disputes were the same, identifying as determinative of the issue the consideration of \"whether and to what extent the subject matter or facts that were the *real cause* of the disputes differ from or are identical to the other\". The fact pattern in *Lucchetti v. Peru*, the Claimant asserts, is distinct from that of the present dispute, since the present dispute concerns only one piece of legislation \"without any predecessor action of equivalent (or any) legal effect on the Claimants investments\".667\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 273.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 274.\n\n***(c) Evidence Concerning the Time When the Parties' Dispute Arose***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n389.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, \"public statements and exchanges\" indicate that Australia's announcement of April 2010 gave rise to \"a disagreement and/or conflict\" between the Parties as required by the *Mavrommatis* test.668 The Respondent points out that in January 2009 the PMI Group (via PML) opposed plain packaging in the NPHT consultation, taking substantially the same position as in this case:669 (a) that the public health benefit of plain packaging is not supported by the evidence; (b) that plain packaging is likely to increase illicit tobacco trade; (c) that that mandating plain packaging would require the Australian Government to compensate trademark owners for expropriating some of the world's most valuable brands; and (d) that eliminating trademarks would violate international treaty obligations.670 The Respondent quotes the 2009 PML submission in the NPHT consultation as stating that \"[m]andating plain packaging or dedicating the entire package to government warnings is extreme and disproportionate, unsupported by the evidence, and would constitute an expropriation for which compensation is due\".671 The Respondent points out that PML reiterated these concerns in 2009 following the announcement by NPHT of a series of \"key action areas\" in relation to tobacco packaging.672 In September 2009, PMI Group (via the solicitors of PML and the Managing Director of PM Australia) contacted the Health Minister and the Trade Minister to make its claim.673\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 419.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol A, para. 76.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 76.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 77.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 79.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 134.\n\n390.\n\nIn April 2010, the Government announced its decision to introduce plain packaging, which, according to the Respondent, signaled the Government's commitment at the highest level to introduce the measures.674 One day after this announcement, PML's Director of Corporate Affairs reiterated PML's opposition to plain packaging in the *Australian Financial Review*, stating that the Plain Packaging Measures were \"an unconstitutional expropriation of our valuable intellectual property and violate[d] a variety of Australian international trade obligations\".675 On the same day, PML provided a submission to the Senate Community Affairs Committee in which it opposed the Plain Tobacco packaging (Removing Branding from Cigarette Packs) Bill 2009.676 Following the Government's publication of its response to the NPHT Report in May 2010, Mr. Pellegrini\u2014the President of PM Asia at the time\u2014stated that \"[w]e oppose plain packaging, which is not supported by evidence of a public health benefit and which will increase illicit trade, harm competition and violate Australian and international trade law\".677\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 70.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 88, 134.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 89.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 91.\n\n391.\n\nThese events, in the Respondent's view, \"manifested, and provide objective evidence of, the conflict of views between the disputants\"678 regarding the legality of the *implementation* of the plain packaging legislation.679 Accordingly, by this point, a dispute had crystallized between Philip Morris and the Australian Government. By this time, PMI and the Australian Government were able to take opposing views on a point of law or fact because the Plain Packaging Measures were sufficiently definite and precise in their formulation, and sufficiently clear in their likely effect on the Philip Morris group, to enable the group to dispute the likely \"*legality* and *efficacy* of a measure that requires tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging\".680\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 71.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 71.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 377; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 69.\n\n392.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the substance of the dispute that crystallised in April 2010 contained three legal strands: \"Australia's obligations under the Australian Constitution, intellectual property or like treaties (such as the WTO TRIPS Agreement) and international investment treaties (*i.e*. BITs or FTAs)\".681 Moreover, \"the same basic claim underpinned all three strands\", which was that the implementation of the plain packaging legislation would expropriate or take away the ability to use trademarks and could not be justified as a legitimate public health measure.682 The dispute remained in substance the same up to the Claimant's initiation of these proceedings and, according to the Respondent, \"continues to underpin PM Asia's claim under the BIT\".683\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 69.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 69.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 377; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 69, 127.\n\n393.\n\nIt is, in the Respondent's view, therefore \"plainly incorrect to characterise the announcement of a government decision to introduce legislation as merely a plan\" or a \"statement of intent\".684 Nor, in the Respondent's view, can the factual record prior to April 2010, be properly described as \"policy debate about a potential act\".685 The Respondent asserts, it was \"patently clear\" that the introduction of plain packaging was a \"significant likelihood\" by September 2010 and \"highly probable\" by January or February 2011, during which time the PMI Group took no different view.686 In particular, the Respondent points to the fact that from April 2008 the NPHT had considered, and from September 2009 had recommended the adoption of plain packaging, and from April 2010 the Australian Government had decided to introduce plain packaging.687 In July of the same year, the Australian Government published a timetable for the implementation of its decision, and \"both the Government and the Philip Morris group subsequently worked on the basis of that timetable\".688 According to the Respondent, therefore, PMI's public statements and internal documents evidence, in the view of the Respondent, its understanding that the government was \"determined to introduce these measures\".689\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 419.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 72.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary objections, para. 411;

This is because \"[a] legal dispute cannot arise simply because someone expressed a view about the 'legality and efficacy' of plain packaging\".699\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 288, 290.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 284; Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 252-253, 269.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 286.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 276.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\n396.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, \"'plain packaging' is not a legal measure giving rise to a legal dispute. It is a regulatory concept that has been debated in Australia at least since the 1990s and on which the PMI Group (or its corporate predecessors) have expressed views for decades\".700 In fact, Prime Minister Rudd had no power to adopt the TPP Act or to ensure the passage of the TPP Act by Parliament701 and, accordingly, \"if the TPP A[ct] never materialized, none of those statements could have given rise to a cognizable investment dispute under the [Treaty]\".702 Any disagreement arising before that time was a political or policy debate703 and better characterised as preparatory acts that, absent a positive obligation to the contrary, do not amount to a breach of international law.704 In the Claimant's view, the Respondent conflates two events that are legally distinct: \"the inchoate policy debate that the Prime Minister's announcement spurred in April 2010 and the legal dispute that crystallized when Parliament enacted plain packaging legislation in 2011 and Claimant initiated the arbitration\".705\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 287.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 289.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 276.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 285; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19.\n\n397.\n\nThe Claimant strongly disputes the contention that the enactment of the TPP Act was highly probable. According to the Claimant, \"[i]rrefutable evidence confirms that, even in the view of the Australian government, the prospects for plain packaging legislation were highly uncertain during and beyond the fall of 2010\".706 The Claimant points to a Parliamentary briefing book that stated in September 2010 that, \"[i]t is difficult to determine the likely fate of the plain packaging proposal given that the position of the [Opposition] Coalition and the independent members is unknown\".707 The Claimant also points out that in the same month, the Australian Government's Health Minister stated that, \"she had not yet even discussed the plain packaging proposal with independent members of Parliament\".708 Similar uncertainty is, according to the Claimant, reflected in PMI's 2010 Annual Report.709 The Claimant asserts that it was only in late May 2011 that it came to believe that there was \"a serious threat that the legislation would pass\" and that accordingly, in June 2011, \"the decision was taken. to send a notice [of claim]\".710\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 25.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 25.\n\nClaimants Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 25.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 27.\n\n398.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"even if the dispute 'pre-existed' the investments (it did not), the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the dispute as long as the dispute continued to exist on the date of the Notice of Arbitration\".711 The Claimant reiterates that both Parties agree that the dispute existed when the Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration on 21 November 2011 since the Respondent has not argued that the dispute ceased to exist before this point.712\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 266.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 267.\n\n399.\n\nFinally, the Claimant counters the Respondent's argument that the dispute arose before the enactment of the TPP Act in November 2011 because the Claimant filed a Written Notification of Claim in June 2011. According to the Claimant, the purpose of the Written Notification was to warn the Respondent that a dispute would arise if the plain packaging legislation were to be enacted, not to acknowledge that a dispute already existed.713 The Written Notification is conditioned on a future and uncertain event (the passage of the plain packaging legislation), as demonstrated by the use of the word \"will\" throughout the text.714 All potential claims identified in the Written Notification depend on this future and uncertain event.715 The Claimant further maintains that the Written Notification is not an indication of the existence of a dispute, because the Notification itself explains the substantial change of the political context and prospects for the legislation between the time when it was introduced to Parliament and the time when the Coalition withdrew its opposition.716\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 309.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 310.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 311.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 312.\n\n**2. The Abuse of Right Argument** ***(a) Content of the Abuse of Right Doctrine***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n400.\n\nThe Respondent argues that even if the claimed investment falls under Article 10 of the Treaty, the doctrine of abuse of rights forbids the Claimant from exercising the right in Article 10.717 Citing academic authority, the Respondent gives the following explanation for the doctrine:\n\nA reasonable and bona fide exercise of a right... is one which is appropriate and necessary for the purpose of the right i.e. in furtherance of the interests which the right is intended to protect). It should at the same time be fair and equitable as between the parties and not one which is calculated to procure for one of them an unfair advantage in the light of the obligation assumed. A reasonable exercise of the right is regarded as compatible with the obligation. But the exercise of the right in such a manner as to prejudice the interests of the other contracting party arising out of the treaty is unreasonable and is considered as inconsistent with the bona fide execution of the treaty obligation, and a breach of the treaty.718\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 137.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 138.\n\n401.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the doctrine has been widely applied in national legal systems, in the legal order of the European Union, as well as by international courts and tribunals,719 including investment tribunals.720 By way of example, the Respondent refers to the decision of the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization in *United States\u2014Standards for Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline* wherein the tribunal described the chapeau of Article XX of the *General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994* as \"animated by the principle that while the exceptions of Article XX may be invoked as a matter of legal right, they should not be so applied as to frustrate or defeat the legal obligations of the holder of the right under the substantive rules of the [GATT]\".721\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 138.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 141.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 139.\n\n402.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the abuse of rights doctrine is neither exceptionally applied, nor applied with a particularly high standard.722 The doctrine \"merely restricts the application of a given treaty to what the treaty parties intended\" thereby bringing the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal within the boundaries of the Parties' consent.723 The Respondent points to a \"body of investment treaty cases where tribunals have considered and applied the doctrine of abuse of rights... precisely in the context of a corporate restructuring] intended in whole or in substantial part to achieve treaty protection\". From this body of case law, it is, according to the Respondent, possible to establish a number of factors that are to be taken into consideration in determining whether there is an abuse of right.724 The two key factors are:\n\na. \"[K]nowledge of the existing or foreseeable dispute\"725 and in particular where \"the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific dispute as a high probability and not merely as a general future controversy\";726 and\n\nb. \"[C]orporate restructur[ing] of an investment such that BIT protection is then obtained with a view to bringing a preconceived BIT claim in respect of that actual or specific future dispute\" (*i.e*. \"[t]he timing of the corporate restructur[ing]\" and \"[t]he purpose of or motivation for the corporate restructur[ing]\").727\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 443, 454.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 443, 448.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 455.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 164; Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 508.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 466.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 455, 508.\n\n403.\n\nOther relevant factors are the timing of the claim, the transparency of the corporate restructuring (for example, where an investment is made without revealing to the host State the true motives behind such an investment728), and whether the corporate restructuring was followed by subsequent economic activity in the host State.729\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 466.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 455, 508.\n\n404.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the doctrine of abuse of rights is based on the principle of good faith, citing the tribunal in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* to the effect that \"[t]he principle of good faith governs the relations between States, but also the legal rights and duties of those seeking to assert an international claim under a treaty. Nobody shall abuse the rights granted by treaties, and more generally, every rule of law includes an implied clause that it should not be abused\".730 This does not, however, mean that there is a presumption that PM Asia has acted in good faith.731 Referring by way of example to the decisions in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* and *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela*, the Respondent asserts that whether a claim brought subsequent to a corporate restructuring amounts to an abuse of right \"depends on the facts and circumstances of the case\" and not any presumption in the claimant's favour.732 The Respondent further asserts that the decisions in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic, Pac Rim v. El Salvador*, *Tidewater v. Venezuela* and *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, all of which deal with corporate restructuring, make \"*no mention at all*. of any [such] presumption\".733 In the Respondent's view, the decision in *Chevron v. Ecuador (I)*, relied upon by the Claimant as establishing a presumption in favour of a claimant's right to bring a claim, was issued in \"a quite different context\".734\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, paras 137, 143.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 450.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 448.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 447-448.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 449.\n\n405.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the foreseeability of the dispute and the motivation of the restructuring establish bad faith and an abuse of right where they result in \"a manipulation of the international system of investment arbitration\" such that rights are exercised in a way that is calculated to procure for the investor an \"unfair advantage in light of the obligation assumed\".735 By way of example, the Respondent refers to *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* wherein the tribunal determined that \"if the sole purpose of an economic transaction is to pursue an ICSID claim, without any intent to perform any economic activity in the host country, such transaction cannot be considered as a protected investment\".736 The *Phoenix Action* tribunal was concerned to ensure that \"the ICSID mechanism does not protect investments that it was not designed for [sic] to protect, because they are in essence domestic investments disguised as international investments for the sole purpose of access to this mechanism\".737\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 466.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 142.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 144.\n\n406.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the \"dozens\" of cases to which the Claimant refers concern allegations of abuse in different circumstances and are therefore irrelevant to the present dispute.738 The Respondent further asserts that there is no case law that supports the Claimant's argument that there is a need to establish \"an additional requirement [of] conduct of some unspecified but egregious level, such as fraud\".739 For example, the Respondent argues that the tribunal in *Cementownia v. Turkey* \"did consider an allegation of abusive treaty shopping\" and that it \"found that a corporate restructur[ing] at a time when the companies were on notice of the potential termination of a concession contract, but prior to the actual termination, would have fallen 'within the category of an artifice'\".740 The Respondent argues that *Cementownia* supports its position that \"a corporate restructur[ing] for the purpose of making a preconceived BIT claim will ordinarily be abusive\".741\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 459.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 456, 460-476.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 461.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 42.\n\n407.\n\nSimilarly, the *Phoenix Action* tribunal did not place emphasis on what the Claimant calls \"egregious conduct\", but rather focused on the \"international principle of good faith\".742 According to the Respondent, the tribunal looked at \"the timing of the investment, the timing of the initial request to the tribunal, the timing of the claim, the substance of the transaction, and the true nature of the investment, including whether the claimant participated in economic activities\". It was, in the Respondent's words, these factors that lead the tribunal to conclude that the investment was not *bona fide*.743 In the Respondent's view, the Claimant cannot differentiate itself from the claimant in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* on the basis of longstanding control over the investment, because whether the Claimant controlled PML before 2011 is being disputed in the present case.744 Nor, in the Respondent's view, can the Claimant distinguish *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* on the basis that the company in Phoenix Action was nothing more than a \"shell\" company, with no pre-existing relationship or role with respect to the investment, since, according to the Respondent, while the claimant in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* had to create a shell company to buy the shares of its Czech affiliates, the Claimant in the present case has \"an almost unlimited array of ready-made entities that could buy the shares of the Australian affiliates\".745\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 463.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 463.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 463.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 463.\n\n408.\n\nThe *ST-AD v. Bulgaria* case, the Respondent notes, did not turn on findings of egregious conduct or fraud, but on \"the timing of the investment and the claim\".746 For the same reasons as in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic,* the Respondent rejects the Claimant's attempts to distinguish *ST-AD v. Bulgaria* by reference to the fact that a shell company had been employed in *ST-AD v. Bulgaria* and because of the absence of a relationship of long-standing control.747 The Respondent further rejects the Claimant's assertions that *ST-AD v. Bulgaria* establishes that a dispute over abuse of rights must be \"internationalised\" such that a domestic dispute is transformed into an international one. The Respondent asserts that there is no relevant distinction between cases where the investment is \"internationalised\" and cases, such as the present one, where the investment is \"renationalised\".748\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 464.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 464.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 464, 480.\n\n409.\n\nThe Respondent further disputes the relevance of the decision in *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* in this context since, according to the Respondent, the *Mobil Corporation* tribunal \"does not use the term bad faith in its reasoning, and does not suggest that some heightened standard akin to fraud must be met\".749\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 465.\n\n410.\n\nIn sum, investment disputes that deal with allegations of abuse of right in the context of corporate restructuring turn, according to the Respondent, on their facts, and not on any general rule that the host State must establish \"compelling evidence of [the investor's] bad faith... involving egregious conduct\".750\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 458.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n411.\n\nThe Claimant considers that the scope and content of the abuse of rights doctrine is uncertain751 and exceptionally applied. The Claimant observes that Australia itself acknowledged such uncertainty in its arguments in the *Case Concerning Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru* before the ICJ, wherein Australia stated that, \"[t]he status and content of the doctrine of abuse of right is uncertain at international law and there has been little agreement amongst writers or arbitral and judicial tribunals concerning it\".752\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 317.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 317.\n\n412.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the doctrine is based on the concept that a party has abused an otherwise lawful right such that \"the objection only comes into play in the present case if the Tribunal has already determined that it has jurisdiction over the dispute and Claimant has a right to arbitrate\".753 Depriving a party of that right on the grounds that the exercise of that right was abusive is, in the view of the Claimant, a serious and exceptional step to take754 and was described by the tribunal in *Chevron v. Ecuador (I)* as an \"extraordinary remedy\".755 The Claimant refers to the decision of the tribunal in *Rompetrol v. Romania* which stated that abuse of rights \"is evidently a proposition of a very-far reaching character; it would entail an ICSID tribunal, after having determined conclusively (or at least *prima facie*) that the parties to an investment dispute had conferred on it by agreement jurisdiction to hear their dispute, deciding nevertheless not to entertain the application to hear the dispute\".756 Similarly in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, the tribunal approached allegations of an abuse of rights \"bearing in mind how rarely courts and tribunals have held that a good faith or other related standard is breached\".757\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 323.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 323.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 307.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 323.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 325.\n\n413.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, a presumption exists in favour of the right to bring a BIT claim: the Respondent must prove that the Claimant lacks a legitimate interest in instituting proceedings and acts in a \"legally reprehensible\" way.758 In support of its position, the Claimant refers to the *Chevron v. Ecuador (I)* decision wherein the tribunal explained that \"[a]ny right leads normally and automatically to a claim for its holder. It is only in very exceptional circumstances that a holder of a right can nevertheless not raise and enforce the resulting claim\". Thus, there is a \"presumption in favour of [Claimant's] right to bring [its] claim under the BIT\".759 When analysing Ecuador's abuse of rights argument, the *Chevron (I)* tribunal found that \"[t]he nature of these defenses as exceptions to a general rule that leads to the reversal of the burden of proof stem from, among other factors, the presumption of good faith. A claimant is not required to prove that its claim is asserted in a non-abusive manner; it is for the respondent to raise and prove an abuse as a defense\".760\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 319-320.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 324.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 321.\n\n414.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that, \"to uphold an abuse of rights objection, this Tribunal must find that the Respondent has proven bad faith. Prior tribunals have found that standard met only in exceedingly rare circumstances involving egregious conduct akin to fraud\".761 The Claimant submits further that in order to rebut the presumption of good faith, the Respondent must come forward with compelling evidence and meet \"a very high evidentiary burden\".762 Thus, the Claimant asserts, in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, the tribunal stated that it must \"bear[] in mind how rarely courts and tribunals have held that a good faith or other related standard is breached. The standard is a high one\".763 The Claimant refers in particular to the decision in *Chevron v. Ecuador (I)*, which it cites as \"the leading investor-[S]tate case on the presumption of good faith in the abuse of rights context and [which] is fully in accord with the Claimant's position\".764 The Claimant cites the *Chevron (I)* tribunal as stating that \"in all legal systems, the doctrines of abuse of rights, estoppel and waiver are subject to a high threshold\".765 This high threshold \"results from the seriousness of a charge of bad faith amounting to abuse of process\".766 Furthermore, \"[t]he threshold must be particularly high in the context of a *prima facie* examination where the Claimant's submissions are to be presumed true\".767 The Claimant also cites the conclusions of the ICJ in its advisory opinion in *Tacna-Arica Question* that \"[a] finding of the existence of bad faith should be supported not by disputable inferences but by clear and convincing evidence which compels such a conclusion\".768\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 336.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 321.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 325.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 324.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 322.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 324.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 324.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 322.\n\n415.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the \"critical point\" in establishing an abuse of rights is the evidence of bad faith.769 According to the Claimant, the case law of tribunals that have examined allegations of abusive treaty shopping provides \"an indication of the types of conduct that might constitute bad faith\".770 These include cases where:\n\na. The claimant lacked any pre-existing connection with the investment or lacked the capability to manage or develop the business post-investment;\n\nb. The claimant company was a mere \"shell\" company that lacked any substantial ties to the jurisdiction in which it was incorporated;\n\nc. The claimant did not provide notice to or obtain consent from the host State for the transfer of ownership to a new company with a different nationality;\n\nd. Where the restructuring resulted in the \"internationalisation\" of a dispute involving purely domestic business interests of concerns.771\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 345.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 347.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 348.\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the purpose of, or motivation for, a corporate restructuring does not amount to bad faith even if a claimant could reasonably foresee a potential future dispute with the host State at the time.772 According to the Claimant, \"any effort to secure BIT protection will be driven, at least to a certain degree, by the fact that an investor can foresee that a host State might engage in future conduct that would unreasonably impair or harm the foreign investment and wishes to guard against the risk that it will\".773\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 337.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 337.\n\n417.\n\nWhile the abuse of rights objections have been considered in a number of cases, the Claimant argues, these objections have been rejected in all but four cases that involved egregious facts giving rise to bad faith.774 Thus, the tribunals in *Cementownia v. Turkey* and *Europe Cement v. Turkey* issued a finding of bad faith and fraud because the respective investors used forged and fraudulent documents as evidence of their purported ownership of the relevant investments.775 In *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* and *ST-AD v. Bulgaria*, the tribunals were concerned with host country nationals that tried to initiate international arbitration against their own governments long after their domestic disputes had arisen. According to the Claimant, the cases involved shell companies without any longstanding, legitimate business relationships with the investments. Consequently, neither case involved facts similar to those that are now before the Tribunal.776\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 326-327.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 328.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 312.\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimant asserts a further distinction between *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic, ST-AD v. Bulgaria* and the present dispute: in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* and *ST-AD v. Bulgaria,* both tribunals found an abuse of rights because \"domestic investors had sought to 'internationalise' claims for damages that had already accrued and were subject to litigation before the host States' courts\" and \"the claimants had established wholly artificial structures that served no purpose other than to create jurisdiction over existing domestic disputes\".777 Contrary to the Respondent's view, the Claimant considers that, \"whether the dispute was 'internationalised' or 'renationalised'\" makes a difference for the Tribunal's analysis and emphasises that the tribunal in *ST-AD v. Bulgaria* found attempts to internationalise a domestic dispute \"particularly troubling\".778 According to the Claimant, \"the [ *ST-AD* ] tribunal stated that the \"system of international investment protection\" was not designed for *\"domestic* investments disguised as international investments or *domestic* investments repackaged as international disputes\".779 Referring in particular to *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela*, *Pac Rim v. El Salvador*, and *Tidewater v. Venezuela*, the Claimant asserts that \"[i]n every other case that Respondent cites. the tribunal refused to apply the abuse of rights doctrine to create... 'an impediment or disentitlement' to otherwise well-founded jurisdiction under an investment treaty\".780\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 332.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 319.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 319.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 333.\n\n419.\n\nFinally, the Claimant challenges the Respondent's reliance on *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* to invoke a presumption in favour of the host State on the ground that the passage cited by the Respondent does not come from the tribunal's discussion on abuse of rights but from the tribunal's discussion of whether Venezuela consented to arbitration in its domestic investment law.781 This, according to the Claimant \"was unrelated to whether the claimant acted in bad faith and thus engaged in an abuse of rights\".782\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 326.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 326.\n\n***(b) The \"Foreseeability\" Criterion***\n----------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n420.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that \"[t]he abuse (*i.e.* the failure to act in good faith/acting in bad faith) resides in the manipulation of corporate nationality at a time when the dispute is in existence or is foreseeable to a sufficient degree\".783\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 137.\n\n421.\n\nIn respect of establishing an *existing* dispute, the Respondent maintains its position that a dispute is established when there is \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact\" and that this may arise after a measure is announced, threatened or decided upon and before its final and definitive implementation.784 What is important, in the view of the Respondent, is that the Tribunal identifies whether prior to the restructuring, the Parties were already in a dispute concerning the same subject matter (per *Tidewater v. Venezuela* and *Lucchetti v. Peru*).785 The Respondent emphasises the need to \"focus. on the prospective claimant's appreciation of the actual dispute [since] [w]hat matters is whether the prospective claimant restructures at a time when it can see a dispute that, in substance, then becomes the BIT dispute\".786\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 474.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 475, 476.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 476.\n\n422.\n\nIn respect of establishing a *foreseeable* dispute, the Respondent emphasises the distinction between the risk of a *specific* future dispute as opposed to a general risk of a future dispute.787 The Respondent submits that in determining whether there is abuse in the current context by reference to a foreseeability test, \"it is appropriate to look at (i) the viewpoint of the putative claimant, albeit (ii) with an element of objectivity, such that the question comes down to what was within the reasonable contemplation of the putative claimant\".788\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 488; Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 48.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 493.\n\n423.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the abuse of right objection has been discussed in cases in which the tribunals expressly applied a foreseeability approach.789 In *Pac Rim v. El Salvador*, the tribunal ruled that, \"if a corporate restructur[ing] affecting a claimant's nationality was made in good faith before the occurrence of any event or measure giving rise to a later dispute, that restructuring should not be considered as an abuse of process\".790 However, the tribunal found that \"*the dividing-line occurs when the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a* *specific future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a possible controversy*\".791 Hence, the tribunal agreed with El Salvador that an abuse of process exists when an investor manipulates the nationality of a shell company \"at a time when the investor is aware that events have occurred *that negatively affect its investment and may lead to arbitration\".*792\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 487-488.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 151.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 151; Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 488.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 152.\n\n424.\n\nIn *Tidewater v. Venezuela*, the tribunal found it legitimate for \"an investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes with a host State\" by restructuring its investment but emphasised that \"the same is not the case in relation to pre-existing disputes between the specific investor and the State\".793 The Respondent stresses that what was important in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* was the extent to which the dispute was \"existing\" or \"foreseeable\" at the time of the corporate restructuring.794\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 155; Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 442.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 155; Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 488.\n\n425.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent refers to the tribunal's finding in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* that no claim \"was in prospect at the times of the restructurings\".795 The Respondent disputes the Claimant's assertions that the *ConocoPhillips* tribunal focused on the date when the claim or cause of action accrued and not when it became foreseeable. The Respondent explains that the facts in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* explain the tribunal's approach: \"(i) at the time of the corporate restructur[ing], no claims had been made and, save for limited exceptions, none were in prospect; and (ii) subsequent to the investment, the claimant had invested massively, which was regarded as a major factor indicating that BIT proceedings were not in prospect at the time of the corporate restructur[ing]\".796 According to the Respondent, it was for these reasons that the *ConocoPhillips* tribunal rejected the abuse of rights claim.797 The Respondent also cites *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia*, in which the tribunal considered whether the events giving arise to the dispute were \"foreseeable\" at the time of restructuring.798\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 157; Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 488.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 484.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 485.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 488.\n\n426.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's assertion that there must be foreseeability to a very high standard of probability: according to the Respondent, the test applied in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* is not to be portrayed as if it were much more stringent than that in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* or *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*.799 Citing the *Gremcitel* Award as authority, the Respondent asserts that all of these tests for foreseeability are analogous800 and that they establish a foreseeability standard that requires that a dispute must be \"in reasonable contemplation of the investor, or whether a claim is in prospect\".801 The rationale for this position is that all of these tribunals \"are seeking to preserve the integrity of the given treaty whilst at the same time identifying and distinguishing the cases where corporate restructuring is aimed\u2014quite permissibly\u2014at possible future disputes\".802\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 137.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 499; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 137; Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 51.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 137.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 137.\n\n427.\n\nThe Respondent further rejects the assertion by the Claimant that the investor \"must have known that a dispute was near-immediate\".803 According to the Respondent, none of the applicable case law has established such a test with regard to foreseeability.804 Insofar as the Claimant is referring to a need for proximity between the restructuring and the adoption of the measure, the Respondent asserts that this is inconsistent with the foreseeability test established by the relevant case law. The Respondent cites the decision in *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* in which the tribunal found there to be an abuse of right notwithstanding the significant time lag between the restructuring and the making of a claim.805\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 52.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 52.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 52.\n\n428.\n\nThe Respondent dismisses the relevance of *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela v. Venezuela* and *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation*.806 In *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela v. Venezuela*, the contract at issue had, according to the Respondent, expressly envisioned a change to foreign ownership and access to ICSID arbitration. As a result, foreseeability was neither argued, nor rejected.807 The Respondent also argues that there was no argument on, or rejection of, a foreseeability analysis in *RosInvestCo*. *v. Russian Federation*. That case, according to the Respondent, did not concern a corporate restructuring motivated in some way by the wish to obtain treaty protection for an existing investment: it was argued that there was no *bona fide* investment, and not that there was an abuse of rights under the offer to arbitrate.808\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 499-501.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 500.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 501.\n\n429.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the critical date with respect to foreseeability is the date on which the restructuring occurred. In support of this argument, the Respondent refers to the tribunal decisions in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* and *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* both of which \"based their assessment of what was foreseen/in prospect on the date of the corporate restructur[ing]\".809 The decision in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* does not, in the Respondent's view, suggest otherwise. In that case \"it was unarguably the date of the restructuring that was taken as the critical date\".810 The Respondent therefore rejects the Claimant's contention that \"foreseeability should be assessed as at the time of a non-binding decision to restructure, with the Tribunal to shut its eyes to any evidence between such decision and the implementation of it\".811\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 504.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 502.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 502.\n\n430.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asserts that Australian law is not inconsistent with the application of a foreseeability-based standard in abuse of rights cases. While the Claimant places emphasis on the decision in *Esso v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation* as stating that the passage of a tax amendment Bill then under discussion was not \"inevitable\", the Respondent contends that this observation \"is irrelevant in the current context\".812 According to the Respondent, the decision in *Esso v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation* turned on the authority of a different case, *Meggitt Overseas Ltd. v. Grdovic813* which stated that Australian courts are bound to apply the substantive law as it stands and that an Australian court \"cannot deny [a claimant] that right [to invoke the court's jurisdiction] because of a reasonable expectation that at some future date the law will be changed and that [the claimant's rights] according to law will be changed\".814 Moreover, the Respondent emphasises that the discussion in these cases \"says nothing about whether an international tribunal has jurisdiction over a pre-existing dispute or a specific future dispute that was specifically foreseen by the claimant at the time of a corporate restructur[ing] intended to manufacture jurisdiction over such disputes\".815\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 506.\n\n(1998) 43 NSWLR 527.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 506.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 507.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n431.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the Respondent's contention that abuse of rights can be established on the basis of \"knowledge of the existing or foreseeable dispute\" at the time the restructuring took place.816 The Claimant asserts that by focusing on the timing of the dispute, the Respondent misses the \"critical point\" in establishing an abuse of rights: namely the key factor of evidencing bad faith.817 To do otherwise would, in the terms used by the Claimant, \"[omit] the suggestion of excess inherent in the term 'abuse'\".818 The Claimant points out that the tribunal in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* also \"cautioned that this temporal test was not a 'thin red line' that was decisive of the question of abuse\".819 The *Pac Rim* tribunal noted the necessity to consider other circumstances, such as \"whether particular facts and circumstances of the corporate restructuring provide evidence of 'unacceptable manipulations' or acts 'in bad faith'\".820\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 327, 345.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 345.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 345.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 346.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 346.\n\n432.\n\nThe Claimant disputes that the \"foreseeability\" test is appropriate as a protection against the use of BIT protections in order to obtain an \"unfair advantage\" against the host State \"even in cases such as this where the respondent is given advance notice that the claimant intends to initiate arbitration in the event the respondent adopts a particular measure\".821 According to the Claimant, \"Respondent does not explain 'this inequality of position' or identify the 'unfair advantage' to which it refers\".822\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 346, 347.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 347.\n\n433.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent has failed to take a firm and clear position on what it means by \"foreseeable\" and instead \"offers a parade of inconsistent and disconnected concepts\".823 The standards adopted by the Respondent range from \"very high probability\" to \"imminent\".824 The Claimant takes issue with the Respondent's assertion that the Claimant would have abused its right to gain BIT protection \"where the dispute had crystallized, or was reasonably foreseeable, as at the date of the investment\", arguing that \"crystallized\" and \"reasonably foreseeable\" are two very different standards and only the former would imply that there is a ripe legal claim.825\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 353, 354.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 354.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 354.\n\n434.\n\nThe Claimant suggests that the reason for the inconsistency in the Respondent's approach is that \"there is no coherent\u2014much less settled\u2014principle of international law underlying Respondent's objection\".826 The Claimant restates its contention that \"no tribunal has dismissed a claim based on foreseeability, and no consistent doctrine of foreseeability has emerged from the case law, as each case has articulated a different standard\".827 The Claimant asserts that there cannot be a doctrine of abuse of rights based on the restructuring of an investment at a time when a dispute is \"foreseeable\" since such a test would be \"highly subjective and difficult to administer\", leading to the result that host States would \"scour the historical and administrative record for any State conduct... for evidence that could conceivably be viewed as telegraphing an intention to adopt the subsequent measure\".828 In any event, according to the Claimant, it is difficult to ascertain \"how foreseeable a dispute must be\".829 The Claimant concludes that \"the entire concept of foreseeability as a standard of abuse is ultimately unworkable\"830 and in any event does not justify the finding of *bad faith*.831\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 355.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 355.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 356.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 356.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 356.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 357.\n\n435.\n\nIn order to come close to establishing bad faith, the standard of the foreseeability criterion, if applied at all, must be set at \"a very high probability and not merely contemplated at the time the restructuring in question took place\".832 The Claimant disputes the Respondent's assertion that the standard of foreseeability is \"nothing more than that a dispute must be 'in reasonable contemplation of the investor, or whether a claim is in prospect'\".833 According to the Claimant, the Respondent derives this standard from a misinterpretation of the *Gremcitel* Award.834 The Claimant submits that the correct interpretation of *Gremcitel v. Peru* is that the tribunal \"found that the *Pac Rim v. El Savador* standard was analogous to a standard that assessed whether there was a 'reasonable prospect' that the challenged measure was 'imminent' or to a standard that assessed whether a dispute was 'highly probable'\".835 The Claimant insists that the *Gremcitel* tribunal did not state that the *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* standard is met when a dispute is \"merely in prospect\".836\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 352.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 54.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 54.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 54.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 54.\n\n436.\n\nThe Claimant submits that in light of the difficulties with the foreseeability standard, some tribunals have \"simply refused to engage in a discussion of whether a dispute was foreseeable at the time a restructuring occurred\"837 citing, in support of this assertion, the findings in *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela v. Venezuela* and *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*.838\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 359.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 360-362.\n\n437.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, in none of the cases heavily relied upon by the Respondent did the tribunal employ a \"reasonable foreseeability\" test, as the Respondent advocates in the present arbitration.839 In *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* and *ST-AD v. Bulgaria*, the tribunals found that \"the claimants had established artificial structures that served no purpose other than to create jurisdiction over existing domestic disputes for damages that had already been incurred \".840 Rather than applying a foreseeability test, the *Phoenix Action* tribunal instead applied the principle that assigning pre-existing claims to a foreign entity cannot lead to BIT protection for a domestic entity that is not entitled to such protection.841 The tribunal found an abuse of the investment treaty system on the ground that \"what was really at stake were indeed the pre-investment violations and damages\".842\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 365-366.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 332.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 369.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 368.\n\n438.\n\nThe tribunals in both *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* and *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, the Claimant emphasises, focused on determining \"whether the claimant was improperly seeking to assert legal claims based on conduct that occurred or situations that ceased to exist before the restructuring was complete\".843 In *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela*, the Claimant notes, the tribunal focused on \"the date on which that process culminated in Venezuela's adoption of the nationalisation measures that forced such migration and stripped Mobil of the value of its investments\".844 The Claimant therefore stresses that the *Mobil Corporation* tribunal did not adopt a foreseeability test at all.845 As regards *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, the Claimant submits that the tribunal followed the *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* approach and stressed \"the date on which the claim or cause of action accrued, not when it became 'foreseeable'\".846 To the extent that the tribunal in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* did consider foreseeability, it applied a very high standard. According to the Claimant \"[t]he *ConocoPhillips* tribunal found that a dispute under the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT was not foreseeable, even though one of the Dutch claimants (the shell company) was inserted into the chain of ownership *after* the enactment of two challenged tax measures (but before one of those measures took effect)\".847 The Claimant stresses that \"[c]learly, those measures were entirely foreseeable when the claimants inserted [ConocoPhillips] into the ownership structure, [b]ut the *ConocoPhillips* tribunal did not consider that fact to be relevant\".848\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 388.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 375.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 359.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 382.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 355.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 356.\n\n439.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the tribunals in both *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* and *Tidewater v. Venezuela* found no abuse of rights even with \"substantial evidence that the particular dispute at issue was (or should have been) within the reasonable contemplation of the investor prior to the restructuring\".849 To the extent that the *Pac Rim* and *Tidewater* tribunals did consider foreseeability, the Claimant asserts that both tribunals asserted a very high standard of foreseeability. The Claimant cites the *Pac Rim* tribunal as stating that \"because even at th[e] time [of restructuring] there still seemed to be a reasonable possibility, as understood by the Claimant\" to stop the challenged measure, the dispute was not foreseeable to \"a very high probability\" and the claimant did not \"act[] in bad faith\".850 According to the Claimant, the *Tidewater* tribunal \"found that a dispute under the Barbados-Venezuela BIT was not foreseeable even though Venezuela issued a threat to the claimants' industry just *two days before* they inserted a Barbados shell company into their chain of ownership, and Venezuela expropriated the claimant's investment two months later\".851\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 335.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 355.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 355.\n\n440.\n\nThe Claimant maintains the relevance of the tribunal's decision in *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation.* According to the Claimant, in *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation*, the host State objected that \"a [t]ransaction[] undertaken for litigation purposes without economic activity [was] an abuse of the investment treaty system\".852 The claimant in *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation* asserted that Russia had \"not demonstrated that making an investment in order to bring a treaty claim. would be illegitimate or in violation of the principle of good faith\".853 According to the Claimant, the *RosInvestCo* tribunal \"quickly dismissed this objection without finding any need to delve into questions of foreseeability\".854 The Claimant disputes the Respondents contention that *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation* is not relevant on the basis that the tribunal was concerned only with identifying whether there was a *bona fide* investment and not with whether there was abuse of rights.855 According to the Claimant, since the abuse of rights doctrine is based on the principle of good faith, \"the core question for an abuse of rights objections is always whether there was a ' *bona fide* ' investment\".856 Consequently, *RosInvestCo v. Russian Federation* cannot be distinguished on this basis.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 357.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 357.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 357.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 357.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 357.\n\n***(c) The \"Motivation\" Criterion***\n------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n441.\n\nThe Respondent \"accepts that it is a perfectly legitimate goal, and no abuse of an investment protection treaty regime, for an investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes with a host [S]tate\".857 The Respondent insists, however, that where the motivation for a corporate restructuring is to bring a specific preconceived BIT claim, this will be an abuse of right.858\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 468.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 455, 508.\n\n442.\n\nIn support of this assertion, the Respondent refers to the decision in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* where the tribunal referred to the foreseeability of a \"specific future dispute\".859 Likewise, the tribunal in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* referred to the foreseeability of \"the present dispute\".860 In *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* wherein the tribunal found that \"[w]ith respect to pre-existing disputes,. the tribunal considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain jurisdiction under a BIT for such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the *Phoenix Action* tribunal, 'an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs'\".861 The Respondent distinguishes the case of *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* in this regard since, in that case, the tribunal found that the restructuring took place before any claims were in prospect. This finding was supported by the significant value of the investment that was made\u2014a factor that the tribunal considered to be inconsistent with the proposition that the claimant foresaw or was motivated by an imminent nationalisation of its investment.862\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 488.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 488.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 148; Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 470.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 473; Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 50.\n\n443.\n\nThe Respondent explains that \"where there is a corporate restructur[ing] in the knowledge of an actual or specific future dispute, and a preconceived BIT claim is then brought, there is no longer an equality of position between the investor and the host State, and the investor benefits from an unfair advantage [since] the investor invests knowing that it is about to/ready to bring a claim [whilst] [t]he host State admits the investment, in ignorance of the investor's intent\".863 The Respondent cites the tribunal in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* which stated that \"[t]here is jurisdiction only if the parties to the dispute have each consented and throughout the process each is treated on an equal footing, as indeed the principles of due process and natural justice require\".864 The Respondent therefore stresses that \"it is not the corporate restructur[ing] *per se* that is abusive\" but rather that where there is a specific pre-determined dispute in mind, the abuse will arise \"where the claimant has benefited from this inequality of position\".865\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 491.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 491.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 492.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n444.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that restructuring to secure BIT protection does not amount to bad faith, even if the claimant could reasonably foresee a potential future dispute with the host State at the time.866 The Claimant cites the tribunal in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* as stating that, \"it is a perfectly legitimate goal, and no abuse of an investment protection regime, for an investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes with a host [S]tate\".867 Similarly, the tribunal in *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia* observed that, \"it is not uncommon in practice, and\u2014 absent a particular limitation\u2014not illegal to locate one's operations in a jurisdiction perceived to provide a beneficial regulatory and legal environment\".868 The Claimant refers to the Respondent's submissions during the Hearing on Bifurcation that, \"it is legitimate for a corporate group in good faith to make its investment into a country or restructuring an existing investment in a country in order to provide for BIT protection for that investment as regards future disputes\".869\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 337; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 54.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 340.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 340.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 341.\n\n445.\n\nThe Claimant submits further that the findings of the tribunals in *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* and *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, support its position: in both cases the tribunals found that even if the sole or predominant motivation for the restructuring is to gain access to investor-State arbitration that does not constitute an abuse of right.870 In *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* the tribunal found that it had jurisdiction notwithstanding the observation that the \"main, if not the sole purpose of the restructuring [at issue in that case] was to protect\" Mobil's pre-existing investment in Venezuela in light of potential adverse actions by the Venezuelan government before the restructuring occurred.871 In *ConocoPhillips v.

It was about the legality of the *implementation* of plain packaging pursuant to the Government's announced decision\".877 The Respondent also stresses that \"[t]he Parties' conflicting positions were unwavering\" such that they cannot be described as merely a \"policy debate about a potential act\".878\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 71.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 72.\n\n449.\n\nBy 3 September 2010, and no later than January-February 2011, \"the PM[I] [G]roup had a crystallised intention to bring a claim against Australia under the BIT in respect of plain packaging if and when the Government\u2019s decision to introduce the measure was implemented\".879 The Respondent strongly disputes the Claimant's assertion that it did not decide to bring a claim until June 2011 when it \"came to believe that the enactment of the plain packaging legislation became likely\".880 The Respondent emphasises various pieces of evidence to support its position:\n\na. According to the Respondent, the Revised Privilege Log (\"**RPL**\") entries leading up to early September 2010 \"record extensive preparations for BIT litigation that cannot credibly be explained away as simply a 'prudent' review of 'various legal scenarios'\".881\n\nb. The Respondent also points to \"38 communications\" circulated by the end of April 2010 by the PMI Group and its lawyers that \"involved *consideration of investment treaty protections for the Australian subsidiaries...* [REDACTED]882 The Respondent then points to \"68 communications\" that were circulated between 1 May 2010 to 2 September 2010 of which \"8 were communications between the PM[I] [G]roup and its external legal advisers with [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] in the subject line; 12 were entitled [REDACTED] and 1 was entitled [REDACTED]. 2 September 2010 saw 15 emails concerning the engagement of, or receipt of advice from, [REDACTED].883\n\nc. The Respondent points to other e-mails in the same period that establish that by 3 July 2010 the PMI Group had instructed lawyers to act for it in an investment treaty arbitration concerning plain packaging in Australia.884 In one particular e-mail dated 29 July 2010 from PMI to an investor relations firm, the Respondent points out that a PMI representative stated that \"[w]e. believe that a plain packaging measure would violate. international trade agreements\" and \"we are ready to take *all steps we deem necessary* to obtain the protection and relief to which the company is entitled\". The Respondent also points out that the same PMI representative stated that the Plain Packaging Act would cause Australia to violate its obligations under \"certain international trade treaties and other various investment treaties. [giving] rise to actions both by States and private investors in Australia\".885\n\nd. The Respondent refers to PML's August 2010 OB/LRP, which sets out, as part of a \"Plain Packaging Strategy\", the following components: \"*Litigate if the Bill is enacted*\" and \"*Litigation readiness*\". The Respondent asserts that litigation must have referred to investment arbitration when viewed in the context of PML public statements and internal documents before August 2010.886\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 46.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 74.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 79.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 79.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 79.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 82.\n\n450.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that in any event the evidence establishes \"beyond doubt\" that the PMI Group had the intention to bring a claim \"as at the date of the Foreign Investment Application on 21 January 2011 and subsequent execution of the restructur[ing] on 23 February 2011\" based on the \"BIT-related correspondence within the PMI Group and between the PMI Group and its external lawyers\".887 This correspondence, according to the Respondent, refers to [REDACTED].888 The Respondent also refers to the RPL's entries and e-mails \"during this period, including an email dated 10 December 2010 entitled [REDACTED].889\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 83.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 82.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 84-85.\n\n451.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant's assertion that the enactment of plain packaging was \"unlikely\" before June 2011. According to the Respondent \"a crystallised intention to sue *if and when* plain packaging was introduced, and a belief as to the precise prospects that plain packaging *would be* introduced, are entirely separate mindsets\".890 In any event, the Respondent insists that the introduction of plain packaging was of \"significant likelihood\" by September 2010 and \"highly probable\" by January or February 2011, \"and the PM[I] [G]roup took no different view\".891 The Respondent refers to the PMI Group's public statements and internal documents as evidence of its understanding that the Government was determined to introduce the measure.892\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 88.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 88.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 89.\n\n452.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that PMI's Annual Report for 2010, dated March 2011, states that \"it is impossible to predict the outcome of. the legislation slated for introduction in 2011\". However, this passage, according to the Respondent, \"does not say anything about PMI's *already crystallised intention to sue in the event that the legislation passed*\".893 The Respondent insists that Mr. Pellegrini has conceded that the PMI Group had a crystallised intention to sue Australia under the Treaty as at 23 February 2011, citing Mr. Pellegrini's oral testimony wherein he agreed that he approved the acquisition on 23 February 2011 for the purpose, amongst others, of placing PM Asia \"in a position where it could sue Australia *and would sue Australia* if the legislation passed\".894\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 85.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 86.\n\n453.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, even if the Tribunal were to consider that the relevant intention to bring a claim had not crystallised by early September 2010, the evidence provided by the Respondent \"in any event establish[es] the requisite degree of foreseeability which is all that Australia needs to ground its abuse of right claim\".895\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 73.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n454.\n\nThe Claimant insists that the Respondent has been unable to demonstrate that the Claimant had the intention to sue the Respondent under the BIT \"either in September 2010 or January 2011\".896 According to the Claimant, \"[t]he earliest time when it can be said that a dispute was foreseeable as a very high probability is late May/June 2011 [when] Claimant came seriously to believe that the legislation might pass, prompting consideration of whether to bring a claim in that eventuality\".897 The Claimant insists that the Respondent's logic is flawed: \"according to Respondent's logic, a dispute would have existed even if Prime Minister Rudd had *never* made an announcement, because a dispute existed as soon as PML expressed opposition to the Fielding Bill, which according to the Government did not even represent Government Policy\".898 The Claimant emphasises that a legal dispute cannot arise simply because someone expressed a view about the \"legality and efficacy\" of plain packaging, and that \"plain packaging\" itself is not a legal measure that can give rise to a legal dispute.899\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 121.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\n455.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent has failed to describe in \"any consistent way the dispute that allegedly crystallized in April 2010\".900 According to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s briefs \"conflate two events that are legally distinct: the inchoate policy debate that the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement spurred in April 2010 and the legal dispute that crystallized when Parliament enacted plain packaging legislation in 2011 and Claimant initiated the arbitration\".901\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19.\n\n456.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the communications it had with lawyers. According to the Claimant, \"what the RPL shows is simply that PMI lawyers reviewed legal options, as they had been doing for years before the announcement\".902 According to the Claimant, \"since BIT considerations played a role in the transfer decision. it is only natural that PMI\u2019s lawyers looked at the BIT in that context\".903 The Claimant notes that, \"more than 80% of the documents on the RPL are e-mails that do not represent a large number of separate conversations\".904 Moreover, the Respondent distorts the figures that it asserts: many of the communications that the Respondent lists are in fact communications that belong to a longer email chain.905 The Claimant submits that no conclusions can be drawn simply from numbers of e-mails sent at the time.906\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34.\n\n457.\n\nThe Claimant points to the testimony of Mr. Pellegrini who disagreed that, by August 2010, the necessary \"BIT intention\" had been formed.907 According to the Claimant, Mr. Pellegrini \"was not even aware of the BIT in August 2010, so Claimant could not have had a BIT intention at that time\".908 The Claimant strongly disputes the Respondent's assertion that the August 2010 OB/LRP was that \"the plain packaging legislation would be defeated\" and that this evidences an intention to defeat the legislation through investment treaty arbitration.909 The correct understanding of the OB/LRP was made clear in Mr. Pellegrini's oral testimony, wherein he stated that \"PML assumed in August 2010 that the plain packaging legislation would not pass Parliament, in part because merely highlighting the threat of litigation domestically and in [the] WTO would convince part of the Parliament that it was not worthwhile to proceed with the measure\".910 The Claimant highlights Mr. Pellegrini's statement that \"at the time, I was honestly convinced that plain packaging wouldn't happen\".911\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 121.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 121.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 121.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 121.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 121.\n\n458.\n\nThe Claimant also disputes the assertion made by the Respondent that the reference in the August 2010/LRP to \"litigation readiness\" must have meant that the Claimant had already decided to initiate arbitration. Referring to Mr. Pellegrini's testimony, the Claimant notes that, \"what we were discussing here was the *domestic litigation*\".912 The Claimant submits that the Respondent is asking the Tribunal to find that the August 2010 OB/LRP establishes the Claimant's intention that \"the plain packaging legislation would be defeated *in arbitration under the BIT* rather than through the Parliamentary process\".913 In any event, the Claimant points out, the OB/LRP establishes PML's three-year business plan, and \"nothing in the 2010 OB/LRP's financial projections or brand plans reflected the need to change the packaging or marketing of PML's products because of plain packaging\".914\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 122.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 124.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 124.\n\n459.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the dispute was not foreseeable at the time of restructuring in June 2011. According to the Claimant, \"numerous documents on the record show that neither Claimant nor Respondent had determined that the enactment of plain packaging was even likely, much less a very high probability, until months after the restructuring\".915 The Claimant refers in this regard [REDACTED] and the Transcript of Meet the Press interview with Minister for Health Nicola Roxon.916 The Claimant also points to a Parliamentary briefing book that stated that \"[i]t is difficult to determine the likely fate of the plain packaging proposal given that the position of the [Opposition] Coalition and the independent members is unknown\".917 Moreover, PMI\u2019s 2010 Annual Report, released in March 2011 noted that \"[i]t is not possible to predict the outcome of the [plain packaging] Bill or the legislation slated for introduction in 2011\".918 According to the Claimant, \"[t]o accept Respondent\u2019s assertion that the plain packaging legislation was foreseeable as a very high probability, the Tribunal would have to disregard both Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s testimony and the Government\u2019s admission that there was still a \"big fight\" over the plain packaging well into 2011, after restructuring took place\". In sum, the Claimant asserts that until June 2011, \"neither enactment of the legislation nor the dispute was foreseeable as a very high probability\" and \"the dispute did not crystallize until the legislation was passed and Claimant commenced this arbitration\".919\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 40.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26, referring to **Exhibit C-338**.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 25.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 27.\n\n***(e) Evidence of the Claimant's Motivation for Restructuring***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n460.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"[g]iving the [PMI] [G]roup a vehicle to carry out the [BIT claim], where none otherwise existed, was a, or the, true reason for the restructur[ing]\".920 The Respondent refers to Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s oral testimony in which he agreed that he approved the restructur[ing] for reasons including that the transaction would grant \"BIT protection to enable [PM Asia] to sue Australia if the measure passed into law\".921 The Respondent asserts that this was the \"driving motivation\" behind the restructuring922 as evidenced by the nature and volume of RPL entries from May 2010 onwards.923 Further evidence can, according to the Respondent, be found in the \"pattern of e-mails linking consideration of the restructur[ing]. with *plain packaging* and/or *investment treaty protection*\".924 The Respondent also considers the \"absence of communications about *any other reason* for the restructur[ing]\" to be indicative of the motivation behind the restructuring.925\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 47.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 93.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 94.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 95.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 96.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 97.\n\n461.\n\nThe Respondent highlights that \"PM Asia no longer seriously contests that obtaining BIT protection for the Australian subsidiaries in respect of future plain packaging legislation *was* a reason for the restructur[ing]\",926 but points out that the Claimant \"significantly understated the importance [of] the PM[I] [G]roup's decision to restructure [in order to gain] BIT protection in respect of plain packaging\".927\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 33.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 33.\n\n462.\n\nThe Respondent insists that the foreseeability of a claim, the intention to bring that claim and the need for a \"vehicle\" to achieve that claim are the *\"only*\" explanations for \"the interposition of *PM Asia* between the Australian subsidiaries and PM Brands S\u00e0rl, or later PM Holland\".928 According to the Respondent, \"[e]ach of the purported business rationales for the restructur[ing], other than the BIT strategy, is inconsistent with (i) the contemporaneous documents (such as they are), (ii) the detailed and uncontradicted economic analysis of Professor Lys, and (iii) the oral testimony of Mr. Pellegrini\".929 The Respondent purports to rebut each of the explanations given by the Claimant for the restructuring:\n\na. The Respondent disputes that the restructur[ing] was undertaken solely in order to \"streamline\" entities into two chains.930 The Respondent refers to Mr. Pellegrini's testimony that the restructuring had \"no relationship with that 'streamlining' rationale\".931 The Respondent also refers to Professor Lys's analysis which found that \"the explanation of the restructur[ing] lacked coherent purpose in light of the various logical and factual deficiencies that he identified\".932\n\nb. With respect to the Claimant's \"tax rationale\", the Respondent asserts that this is \"not corroborated anywhere in the evidence, and establishes no reason for interposing PM Asia between PM Holland Holdings and PM Australia\".933 The Respondent asserts that complex tax matters need to be proven by calling \"persons from PMI who supposedly designed the restructur[ing] with this aim\".934\n\nc. The Respondent disputes that the restructur[ing] was undertaken for \"revenue\" or \"cash flow\" purposes.935 This, according to Professor Lys, is \"a nonsensical and unpersuasive justification\" and would more easily have been achieved through an alternative restructuring that placed \"PM Australia directly under PM Holland\".936 The Respondent asserts that Mr. Pellegrini \"knew nothing about this alleged revenue purpose\".937 As further evidence against the \"revenue\" purpose, the Respondent points to the \"substantial delays between the purported decision to restructure and the various steps to implement [the restructuring]\".938 Finally, the Respondent contends that, if the motivation for restructuring was truly one of revenue, \"there were other more obvious targets amongst the top earning Asian affiliates\" but that none of these affiliates were considered for the restructur[ing] and that \"none [had] the nationality to bring the present claim\".939\n\nd. The Claimant\u2019s contention that the restructur[ing] was part of a broader regional strategy to \"align management control of affiliates with legal ownership\" is inconsistent with Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s oral testimony and is unsupported by any documentary evidence other than documents prepared when this arbitration was in contemplation or ongoing.940 The Respondent points to Professor Lys\u2019s second report as stating that this \"alignment had no business justification whatsoever\".941 The Respondent concludes that the Claimant has failed to explain \"why ownership of the Asia affiliates remains to this day 'spread all over the place\u2019... and why 'alignment\u2019 was necessary or beneficial when there was a regional structure and business relationship with the Australian affiliates that Mr. Pellegrini agreed was 'functioning perfectly well\u2019\".942 The Respondent further disputes the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the Claimant was the \"most logical\" candidate for the restructuring since this is, according to the Respondent, not borne out by the evidence.943\n\ne. Finally, the Respondent disputes any other asserted rationales for the restructur[ing]. Thus, the assertion that the restructur[ing] enabled PM Australia's dividends to fund the everyday operations of PM Asia is, according to the Respondent, \"a fiction\". This is because PM Asia passed on the entirety of the Australian dividends to PM Holland Holdings.944 Similarly, the assertion that the restructuring was part of a decade-long group-wide restructuring of legal entities is \"nonsense\". The Respondent points to a lack of evidence to support this assertion.945\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 48; Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, paras 35-36.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 50.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 100;

(ii) development of the BIT intention; or (iii) issuing of instructions to lodge the Foreign Investment Application\".946 This, according to the Respondent, includes Mr. Pellegrini, who could \"recall almost nothing surrounding the lodgement of PM Asia's NoC\".947 The Respondent asserts that \"[t]he failure to call the actual decision-makers leads to adverse inferences against PM Asia concerning the purpose of the restructur[ing]\".948\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 62.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 63.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 75.\n\n464.\n\nThe Respondent notes that there are evidentiary gaps in the Claimant's case: \"where were the five individuals who purportedly approved the restructur[ing] decision; [w]here were the 'senior management' in PMI above Mr. Pellegrini who were clearly the real decision-makers regarding litigation against Australia under the BIT; [w]here were the people who instructed the lawyers charged with undertaking the extensive legal work documented in the RPL; [w]here were the people who gave instructions to lodge the Foreign Investment Application?\"949 The Respondent further asserts that the Claimant has failed to produce adequate documents that could rebut the core elements of the Respondent's factual case, pointing to one non-privileged document concerning the decision to restructure; no documents concerning the decision to seek FIRB approval and proceed with the restructur[ing]; and one document contemporaneous with the restructuring.950 The Respondent contends that, if all of the documents relating to the Claimant's case are subject to legal professional privilege, \"the inference arising from the RPL... is overwhelming: there was *no commercial reason for the restructur[ing] separate from litigation strategy*\".951\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 64.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 67.\n\n465.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that the Tribunal \"cannot safely rely on Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s evidence to draw the conclusions that PM Asia seeks\" on the basis that Mr. Pellegrini \"was *not* a witness who could speak to any of the relevant issues in anything but vague terms based on second or third-hand conversations\".952 Moreover, \"there are inconsistencies in Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s testimony. which has driven PM Asia to use it very selectively in its [Post-Hearing Brief]\".953 The Respondent asserts that, at best, Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s testimony establishes that \"a decision *to initiate proceedings* was not made until June 2011\".954 According to the Respondent, this says nothing about \"whether the *PM[I] [G]roup* had formed an intention at the time of the decision to restructure or the Foreign Investment Application to bring a claim *if and when the plain packaging measure was enacted*\".955\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, paras 23-24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 30.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 31.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n466.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"the primary motivation underlying the restructuring of the Australian subsidiaries was unrelated to the BIT\".956 According to the Claimant \"[t]he transfer of the Australian subsidiaries to Claimant took place in the context of a restructuring of the PMI Group that has been in progress since 2005\".957 The restructuring was driven by many factors, \"the most important of which was the broad, company-wide reorganization\",958 the purpose of which was to \"'refine\u2019, 'rationalise\u2019 and 'streamline\u2019 PMI\u2019s corporate structure\".959 According to the Claimant, placing the Australian subsidiaries under PM Asia \"provided added benefits, including aligning ownership with Claimant\u2019s pre-existing management control of the subsidiaries and optimizing Claimant\u2019s cash flow\".960 Moreover, the Claimant was \"the most logical candidate to serve as the immediate parent company for the Australian subsidiaries within the ownership chain under PM Holland\".961\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 103.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 334-40;

A key motivation behind the restructuring was, according to the Claimant, that \"restructuring aligned the ownership and management control of many PMI affiliates\". The Claimant refers to documents from 2004 that evidence that \"centralized ownership will facilitate [its] overall objectives\".964 According to Mr. Pellegrini, \"there was an advantage in clarity\" and \"a better, leaner, clearer structure\" that would be achieved through the restructuring.965 This, in the view of the Claimant, was \"an entirely legitimate objective that was unrelated to the BIT and this arbitration\".966\n\nb. Another motivation behind the restructuring was, according to the Claimant, that \"PMI sought to minimize its tax liability\".967 Thus in 2010, PMI decided to transfer the Australian subsidiaries to the ownership chain under PM Holland to secure a tax advantage relating to the payment of intercompany debt.968\n\nc. The Claimant also asserts that the \"group-wide restructuring has optimized the cash flows of many PMI affiliates\" and refers to Mr. Pellegrini's testimony wherein he stated that the restructuring would be advantageous for PMI's regional headquarters to receive \"substantial, consistent cashflow. to fund everyday operations as well as less common expenses like strategic acquisitions\".969 According to the Claimant, the cash flow could be used \"for example, to fund potential strategic acquisitions\" and would have provided \"greater financial flexibility in the event an acquisition opportunity arose\".970 The Claimant reiterates Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s comment in oral testimony that \"you have to look at it prospectively\" because \"how Claimant used the dividends 'would depend on the amounts\u2019 of dividends as well as the future needs of the company\".971\n\nd. The Claimant acknowledges that an \"additional\" reason behind the restructuring was \"to gain an additional layer of protection under the BIT\".972 This, however, does not mean that the restructuring decision was made in order to sue the Respondent under the Treaty.973 The Claimant reiterates that \"it was not until June 2011 that the PMI Group decided to initiate arbitration if the plain packaging legislation were enacted\".974\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 106.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 110.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 108.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 112.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 112.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 106.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 341; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 107.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 109.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 115.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 116.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 105.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 106, 118.\n\n468.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Mr. Pellegrini \"is uniquely positioned to give evidence on why PM Asia added ownership to its longstanding control of the Australian subsidiaries [since] his approval was necessary for the transfer to proceed, and, therefore his understanding of the various objectives he described in his testimony is highly probative of the internal decisionmaking process\".975 The Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s \"inflammatory\" assertions that it lacks sufficient evidence. The Claimant points out that the Respondent\u2019s document requests did not cover the period leading up to the Written Notification of Claim, which indicates a deliberate attempt to avoid evidence that would be contrary to the Respondent\u2019s attempt to undermine the FATA notification.976 In sum, \"[since], as Mr. Pellegrini explained, the intention to bring a claim and the decision to litigate were formed well after February 2011, the RPL does not refer to documents relating to that decision\".977 As Mr. Pellegrini testified, he \"did not come to believe plain packaging would pass until after the Opposition announced its support of the Bill in May 2011\".978\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 23.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 36.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 36.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 8.\n\n**D. WHETHER THE PARTIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR BURDEN OF PROOF WITH RESPECT TOTHE PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n469.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether each of them has discharged the burden of proof with respect to the preliminary objections under consideration.\n\n470.\n\nThe Respondent explains that each Party carries the burden of proving the facts relied on to support its claim or defence. Relying on the decisions of international tribunals, the Respondent argues that once a party has adduced sufficient or *prima facie* evidence in support of its assertion, the evidential burden shifts to the other party to adduce sufficient evidence to rebut it.979 In this regard, the Respondent distinguishes legal burden of proof (which never shifts) from evidential burden of proof (which can shift from one party to another, depending upon the state of the evidence).980\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 13 referring to *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, NAFTA Arbitration, Award, 3 August 2005, para. 55 (**Exhibit RLA-116**).\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15 referring to *Apotex Holdings Inc. v. United Sates of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/12/1, Award, 25 August 2014 (**Exhibit RLA-368**).\n\n471.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant not only failed to rebut Respondent's *prima facie* case in respect of its preliminary objections but also failed to acknowledge that the burden shifts when Australia adduces sufficient *prima facie* evidence in support of its preliminary objections.981 The Respondent rejects the Claimant's proposition that Respondent's case is characterised by \"hypothetical scenarios based on counterfactuals\".982\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 14.\n\n472.\n\nFollowing the reasoning in *Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan*, the Respondent observes that when a party is unable to provide direct proof due to the evidence being in the primary control of the other party, the tribunal may draw inferences from a failure of the other party to adduce the evidence.983 The Respondent rejects the relevance of *Ambiente v. Argentina*, explaining that it is not in a similar position as Argentina in that case because the preliminary objections raised by Australia involve factual matters for which Australia has adduced *prima facie* evidence in spite of the Claimant having primary control over the evidence.984\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 13 referring to *Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/16, Award, 29 July 2008, para. 444 (**Exhibit CLA-060**).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17.\n\n473.\n\nThe Claimant, on the other hand, submits that it has met its burden of proving all the facts that establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction: that the Claimant is a Hong Kong investor under Article 1(f) of the Treaty; that it owns or controls investments in Australia under Article 1(e) of the Treaty; and that a dispute existed between the Claimant and the Respondent when the Claimant submitted its claim to arbitration.985\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 43.\n\n474.\n\nRelying on the tribunal\u2019s reasoning in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador*, the Claimant submits that the Respondent bears the burden to prove its jurisdictional objections.986 However, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has failed, or has not even attempted, to do so. Comparing the Respondent in the present dispute to that in *Ambiente v. Argentina*, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent must provide evidence to prove its jurisdictional objections and it cannot prevail merely by questioning the evidence the Claimant has presented. In this regard, the Claimant states that the Respondent \"only raises questions about the Claimant\u2019s evidence and poses hypothetical scenarios based on counterfactuals, but fails to prove its objections with evidence\".987\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 33 referring to *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v.

Burden to Prove the Non-admission of Investment Objection**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n476.\n\nWhile the Respondent points out that the Claimant has not adduced sufficient evidence to rebut the Respondent\u2019s arguments, the latter argues that it has discharged its burden of proving the facts to support that the Foreign Investment Application was false or misleading in relation to the Non-admission of Investment Objection. The Respondent emphasizes that, when having regard to Australian law, the Tribunal should apply a \"balance of probabilities\" standard of proof because this arbitration is similar to civil judicial review proceedings, and not to criminal proceedings.988\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 253-256; Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 22.\n\n477.\n\nIn this context, the Respondent denies the Claimant's suggestion that, in order to succeed on the Non-Admission of Investment Objection, Australia must establish that the Claimant has committed criminal offences under section 26(2) of the FATA and section 136.1 of Australia's Criminal Code. The Respondent explains that it has referred to the Criminal Code only to emphasise the existence of an obligation on investors to deal with the host State in a manner which is not false or misleading.989\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 64.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n478.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent has not proven its objection to the Claimant's admission of its investments under Article 1(e) of the Treaty and cautions the Tribunal not to discharge the Respondent's burden of proof based on a series of hypotheses which the Respondent puts before the Tribunal.990\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 36.\n\n479.\n\nThe Claimant characterises as hypothetical the following questions raised in the Respondent's pleadings: (1) what the Claimant should have disclosed to the Treasury had it already decided to sue Respondent under the Treaty at the time of the Foreign Investment Application, even though the Claimant had made no such decision at the time; (2) what the Treasury might have done if the Foreign Investment Application stated that transferring ownership of the Australian subsidiaries to the Claimant would provide an additional basis of jurisdiction under the Treaty; (3) whether the Foreign Investment Application was false or misleading under Section 136.1 of the Criminal Code, even though the Respondent now asserts that it is not alleging that the Claimant violated the Criminal Code;991 (4) whether the Treasury would have invalidated its No-objection Letter if it had been given the opportunity to revisit the matter; and (5) whether the investment was not properly admitted despite the provision of section 38 of the FATA.992\n\nSee Amended Transcript of the Hearing, Day 2, p. 100:15-21, whereby the Respondent stated at the hearing that it had not \"alleged that an offence has been committed under section 136.1 of the Criminal Code\".\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35.\n\n480.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant submits that the standard of proof is a matter of public international law and not Australian law. The Respondent bears the burden of proof when it accuses the Claimant of illegalities in the making of an investment. The Claimant explains that, although the present proceeding is not a criminal one, the Respondent should prove its case *beyond reasonable doubt*, as it is relying on breaches of Australia\u2019s Criminal Code.993\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 166; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 233.\n\n**2. Burden to Prove the** ***Ratione Temporis*** **Objection and an Abuse of Right**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n481.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it has discharged its burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, the facts supporting its *ratione temporis* objection and its abuse of rights argument, while the Claimant has adduced insufficient evidence to rebut the Respondent\u2019s evidence.\n\n482.\n\nSupporting its abuse of right argument with reference to Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s evidence, documents recorded in the RPL and internal documents of the PMI Group, the Respondent submits that it has established that the restructuring was *prima facie* abusive. In particular, the Respondent points out that the evidence of Professor Lys, which shows that there was no reason to believe that the restructuring was undertaken for a business purpose or economic rationale,994 has not been challenged by the Claimant. The evidential burden therefore shifts to the Claimant, which has failed to justify the restructuring of its subsidiaries: the Claimant\u2019s witnesses were not directly involved in the restructuring; and Mr. Pellegrini, who was \"at the margins of key decisions\", has stated that the decision to restructure was \"not particularly meaningful\".995\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 4b referring to the Second Expert Report of professor Lys (26 November 2014), para. 238 (**Exhibit RWS-012**)\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post Hearing Brief, paras 18-19; Respondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20.\n\n483.\n\nIn relation to the standard of proof, the Respondent submits that the Claimant, referring to the ruling in *Chevron v. Ecuador (I)*, seeks to set an unduly high standard for an abuse of right. The Respondent argues that it does not need to prove bad faith, or presume good faith. Following the reasoning in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador*, the Respondent points out that to impose any higher evidentiary threshold in the context of a corporate restructuring would fail to take account of the fact that the party that controls the corporate structure is also in control of the evidence that is required to substantiate the abuse of right claim. This would impose an unduly high evidential threshold on the Respondent.996\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n484.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the present dispute came into existence when the arbitration began and therefore the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis*. The Claimant states that the Respondent has failed to adduce persuasive evidence to prove the contrary. Instead, the Claimant argues that the Respondent asks the Tribunal to make assumptions\u2014that the Claimant intended in April 2010 to challenge Prime Minister Rudd's announcement, and that the Claimant knew, at that time, that the Respondent would adopt Plain Packaging Measures.997\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 37.\n\n485.\n\nWith regard to the abuse of rights argument, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to meet the required \"high threshold\", which encompasses a showing of bad faith, and cautions the Tribunal not to compare it to claimants in other cases put forth by the Respondent. Unlike in those cases, the Claimant argues that, in the present arbitration proceeding, there are no indicia of bad faith because the Claimant invested transparently in the host State; had exercised management control of the Australian subsidiaries for a decade before the transfer took place; did not engage in fraud; and did not \"internationalise\" a domestic dispute as stated by the Respondent.998\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 39.\n\n486.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's allegation that its abuse of right argument focuses on the timing of the restructuring, the Claimant submits that timing only is insufficient to prove an abuse of right. The Claimant further argues that the Respondent has failed to prove that the dispute was foreseeable at a \"very high probability\" and was not \"merely a possibility\" when the restructuring decision was made. It is not sufficient for the Respondent to create a reasonable doubt regarding the reasons for the restructuring, as (in the Claimant's view) Counsel for the Respondent attempted to do at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections.999\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 40-41.\n\n487.\n\nThe Claimant therefore submits that the Respondent failed to meet the \"high threshold\" to rebut the presumption of good faith to which the Claimant is entitled, and the evidentiary burden consequently does not shift to the Claimant.1000\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 42.\n\n**3. Burden to Prove the Control Argument**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------\n\n488.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the Claimant has failed to adduce sufficient evidence that it exercised control over its Australian subsidiaries since 2001.\n\n489.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s assertion of control is a \"distracting fiction\" and should be rejected by the Tribunal because it is inconsistent with the Notice of Arbitration and the Foreign Investment Application, in which the Claimant stated \"nil\" where it was required to specify shares or interests in shares in which it already held an interest.1001 In distinguishing the ruling in *SD Myers v. Canada* from the present arbitration proceeding, the Respondent further explains that the Claimant has not exercised \"control\" because it has not \"provided a single dollar for the operation of the Australian subsidiaries\".1002\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 51.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 58.\n\n490.\n\nThe Respondent also rebuts the Claimant\u2019s argument of \"delegated control\" and explains that this criterion is not sufficient to establish control for the purposes of Article 1(e) of the Treaty. A company exercising delegated control is not protected when the delegator is not itself an \"investor\" under the Treaty.1003\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 53.\n\n491.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent casts doubt on Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s testimony and submits that the Claimant\u2019s factual record does not support its assertion of control. For example, the Respondent explains that what really matters in the control of the Australian subsidiaries\u2019 business, as pointed out by Mr. Gledhill, is the \"region\" and the role played by PMI\u2019s regional structure, which Claimant has failed to disclose.1004\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 55.\n\n*The Claimant's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n492.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that it has established an independent basis for jurisdiction based on its control of the Australian subsidiaries since 2001. By claiming that managerial control is sufficient, the Claimant argues that it has discharged its burden to prove the factual elements of its control argument through extensive witness testimony and copious documentary evidence.1005 The Claimant further submits that by adducing such evidence, it has proved that it had controlled the subsidiaries before the ownership transfer and before the time the Respondent alleges the dispute began.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 44, referring to **Exhibits CWS-001**, **CWS-002**, **CWS-015**, **CWS-016**, **CWS-019** and **CWS-020**.\n\n493.\n\nSince the Respondent has, in the Claimant's view, failed to rebut the Claimant's evidence, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's preliminary objections must fail.1006 More specifically, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has not refuted the fact that Mr. Pellegrini, regardless of his title, works on behalf of the Claimant and that he and his staff at PM Asia control the Australian subsidiaries.1007\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 32, 45.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 29.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n494.\n\nThe Tribunal shall now examine the Parties' arguments. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the extensive factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their written and oral submissions. While the Tribunal considers that it is in the interest of clarity briefly to repeat certain aspects of each Party's case, the Tribunal's reasoning shall only address what the Tribunal regards as determinative for deciding the disputed issues of jurisdiction and admissibility. In the following, the Tribunal shall set out its findings of fact alongside its legal determinations, as the latter provide critical context for the former.\n\n**A. BURDEN OF PROOF**\n----------------------\n\n495.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there is no general disagreement between the Parties as to the principles governing burden of proof, although the application of these principles to certain preliminary objections requires further discussion. Specifically, it is for the Claimant to allege and prove facts establishing the conditions for jurisdiction under the Treaty; for the Respondent to allege and prove the facts on which its objections are based; and, to the extent that the Respondent has established a *prima facie* case, for the Claimant to rebut this evidence. Where relevant, the Tribunal will address the application of the burden of proof when discussing the various objections below.\n\n**B. WHETER THE CLAIMANT HAD CONTROLLED PML'S BUSINESS PRIOR TO THE RESTRUCTURING**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimant contends that Australia\u2019s preliminary objections relating to the maimer in which it obtained ownership of the PMI Group\u2019s Australian subsidiaries fail because it had already exercised management control over these entities since 2001. To succeed with its argument, the Claimant would need to convince the Tribunal that:\n\n- as a matter of Treaty interpretation, mere management control satisfies the test of \"controlled\" under the Treaty; and\n\n- as a matter of fact, it actually exercised such management control.\n\n**1. Interpretation of \"Contr olled\"**\n--------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls Subsection (e) of Article 1 of the Treaty regarding Definitions:\n\n\"investment\" means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one Contracting Party and admitted by the other Contracting Party subject to its law' and investment policies applicable from time to time [...].\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, a physical person or company shall be regarded as controlling a company or an investment if the person or company has a substantial interest in the company or the investment. Any question arising out of this Agreement concerning the control of a company or an investment shall be resolved to the satisfaction of the Contracting Parties.\n\n498.\n\nThus, the Treaty defines control through the concept of \"substantial interest\". Since the first paragraph mentions \"owned or controlled\" as alternative possibilities, it is evident that the drafters intended substantial filterest to require something other than full ownership. However, it is less clear what the concept refers to. The *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty\u2014as recorded in Exhibit R-7521008\u2014do not provide a conclusive answer. Paragraphs 26, 137 and 167 were discussed by the Pairies and considered more closely by the Tribunal:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n499.\n\nA possible reading of paragraph 137 appears to be that Australia considered that \"substantial interest\" would serve to extend protection to a minority owner. On the other hand, it might be argued that, irrespective of control, minority ownership would in any event have been protected by the Treaty under the notion of \"owned\" in the fu st sentence of the provision, as the scope of \"asset\" is broad and includes shares, and as the word \"owned\" is not limited by any qualification such as \"full\".\n\n500.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Claimant\u2019s reference to findings of the tribunal in *S.D. Myers* v. *Canada* in support of its assertion that oversight and management can suffice to establish control for the purposes of enjoying Treaty protection. According to the Claimant, the *S.D. Myers* tribunal considered similar language to that set out under Article 1(e) of the Treaty and confirmed that, \"control can exist independently of ownership\".1009 The present Tribunal is not persuaded by that comparison. First, in *S.D. Myers* v. *Canada,* the issue was whether the investment was controlled directly or indirectly, while in the present case the BIT expressly defines control by reference to \"substantial interest\". Second, as the Claimant itself mentions, the *S.D. Myers* tribunal \"relied on the testimony of the President of SDMI that he controlled Myers Canada in his role as President of SDMI, even though SDMI did not own equity in Myers Canada and that there was no legal agreement 'set[ting] out the respective responsibilities and obligations' of the companies\".1010 In the present case, as will be noted below, when discussing the evidence, Mr. Pellegrini has not been found to exercise such control at the relevant time.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 86.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 88.\n\n501.\n\nFor similar reasons, the decisions of other tribunals regarding the interpretation of \"control\" referred to by the Parties cannot be relied on for present purposes, because none of those other treaties defines \"control\" by reference to \"substantial interest\" or any similar wording. Therefore, \"control\" in this BIT must be interpreted independently.\n\n502.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the most plausible reading of \"substantial interest\" may be the Respondent's suggestion \"that the putative investor must have a right or power over an asset which is sourced in a legal arrangement, and which is capable of being exercised in some significant way that affects the economic returns from and disposition of the asset\".1011 As noted above, the Respondent contends that the essentially economic meaning of that phrase follows from the \"context of the term 'control'\" in the Treaty;1012 under the Treaty, \"'investments' are understood as an economic contribution of a certain duration which involves some element of risk\".1013 Specifically, the Respondent brings Articles 2(2), 3(1) and 8(1) of the Treaty to the Tribunal's attention, noting that these provisions \"apply to 'investments and returns' of investors\".1014 In addition, the Respondent refers to Article 6(1) of the Treaty, which provides that investors should be compensated for any loss suffered1015\u2014 a provision that would not make any sense in the absence of any economic interest in the investment.1016 This interpretation would have the consequence that PM Asia would not have had a \"substantial interest\" in the Australian Philip Morris subsidiaries before 2011 since, as the Respondent recalls, \"in the period 2001-2011, PM Asia did not have any expectation of 'an economic return' from its asserted '[management] control' of PM Australia and PML\".1017\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 146.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 146.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 173.\n\nStatement of Defence, Vol. A, para. 174.\n\n503.\n\nWhatever the precise intention of the negotiators as summarised in paragraph 137 of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* may have been, the Tribunal considers that it cannot draw the kind of far-reaching conclusions from this paragraph that the Claimant suggests.1018\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 70-71.\n\n504.\n\nTo better understand the notion of management control, one could attempt to invoke the fact that two or more entities could \"co-control\" an investment in Australia, such that they would all be considered protected investors under the Treaty, a result that the Treaty would arguably not allow. However, such reasoning would be inconclusive at best. Indeed, the exact same result may occur in a situation where several investors own the investment, as all of them would be considered protected investors under the Treaty.\n\n505.\n\nBe that as it may, considering the lack of clarity in the preparatory works on the Treaty, some doubt remains as to whether the Tribunal should dismiss the Claimant\u2019s control argument on the ground that the criterion of \"controlled\" in the Treaty could not be satisfied by mere management control. As explained below, the Tribunal does not need to rely on this argument. Furthermore, the Tribunal observes that, in view of the very last sentence in Article 1(e) of the Treaty, Australia had originally argued\u2014albeit in a different context\u2014that the interpretation of the notion of control under the Treaty fell outside the jurisdiction of the Parties and had to be considered and resolved to the satisfaction of the Treaty Parties through consultations. However, the argument was not raised again in respect of the meaning of \"controlled\" in the context of the Claimant\u2019s control argument.\n\n**2. Evidence regarding Control**\n---------------------------------\n\n506.\n\nFor the reasons just mentioned, *i.e*. because the documentation provided does not allow the Tribunal to reach any conclusive interpretation and because some uncertainty remains as to the Tribunal\u2019s role in interpreting the notion of control in view of the last sentence of subsection (e) quoted above, the Tribunal is inclined to leave open the precise meaning of the term \"controlled\". Instead, the Tribunal considers that, even if substantial interest could be defined through management control, it must be concluded that the Claimant has not proven that PM Asia exercised management control of any significance in respect of the Australian subsidiaries.\n\n507.\n\nThe following documentary evidence referred to by the Respondent in this context is relevant. With regard to PML\u2019s financial performance and budget, the documents produced by the Claimant do not show that PM Asia controlled PML.1019 As mentioned earlier, Mr. Pellegrini admitted that the CEO of PMI finalises PML's budget and that PMI is entrusted with the final decision-making power.1020 In his role within PMI, Mr. Pellegrini approved PML's capital expenditures in accordance with PMI policy,1021 but his role was limited. For example, for expenditures above USD 25 million, the approval from an officer further up in the hierarchy of PMI was required.1022 Similarly, it was a PMI officer \"who gave the ultimate approval for PML's payment of dividends\".1023 Regarding PML's major business initiatives and budgets, PMI finalised the numbers on PML's OB/LRP and Mr. Pellegrini would review the budgets according to PMI standards.1024 For the branding and marketing strategy, the decisions concerning international brands had to be approved by PMI in Lausanne.1025 While, to some extent, PML's managing directors reported to and worked under the supervision of the Claimant's President, Mr. Pellegrini, the evidence shows that much of the reporting was made directly to the PMI personnel in Lausanne, and only indirectly to Mr. Pellegrini.1026\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 220.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n508.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, while some (limited) management activity was exercised by PM Asia from Hong Kong prior to the 2011 restructuring, Mr. Pellegrini acted in most relevant circumstances as a manager of PMI, rather than PM Asia, and that all significant strategic and budgetary decisions were either taken by or at least had to be approved by PMI.\n\n509.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant, who bears the burden of proof on this issue, has failed to show that, prior to the 2011 restructuring, it had \"control\" with a \"substantial interest\" over the Australian investments in the sense of the definition in Article 1(e) of the BIT.\n\n**C. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT'S INVESTMENT HAS BEEN ADMITTED UNDER AUSTRALIAN LAW AND INVESTMENT POLICIES**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n510.\n\nThe Parties' arguments concerning the (non-) admission issue are summarised in considerable detail in Section V.B. above, to which the Tribunal refers. In essence, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's investment was never admitted under the Treaty, because the Foreign Investment Application was false or misleading, and that consequently, the investment cannot be afforded Treaty protection. By contrast, the Claimant submits that the admission requirement under Article 1(e) of the Treaty was satisfied, because (i) the Respondent admitted the investments following an open and factually accurate FATA notification and expressly stated that it had no objection to these investments; (ii) the No-Objection Letter is and was at all times a formal legally binding document; and (iii) the Respondent took no steps to invalidate its own regulatory action.\n\n**1. The Admission Test under the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nArticle 1(1)(e) of the Treaty provides that protected investments must have been admitted in the host country in the following terms:\n\n\"investment\" means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by investors of one Contracting Party and admitted by the other Contracting Party subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time [...].\n\n**2.** ***Prima facie*** **Admission of the Investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nThe starting point for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis as to whether the Claimant\u2019s investment was \"admitted\" in Australia is the No-objection Letter, *i.e*., the Respondent\u2019s notification to the Claimant of 11 February 2011 whereby the Treasury stated that it had no objection to the proposed restructuring. The No-objection Letter reads as follows:\n\nDear Mr Scarf,\n\nI refer to correspondence received on 21 January 2011 concerning the proposal for Philipp Morris Asia Limited to acquire Philip Morris (Australia) Limited as a result of a company reorganisation.\n\nThere are no objections to this proposal in terms of the Government\u2019s foreign investment policy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nForeign Investment Review Board Secretariat\n\n513.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the No-objection Letter, which contains no reservations, constitutes *prima facie* evidence that the investment was (and remains) validly admitted.\n\n514.\n\nTherefore, the burden of proving that the investment was *not* admitted shifts to the Respondent. Based on the evidence before it and for the reasons explained further below, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not provided sufficient evidence in support of its non-admission objection to rebut the No-objection Letter.\n\n**3. Lack of Evidence that the investment Was Not Admitted**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n515.\n\nHaving established that the investment was (initially) admitted through the No-objection Letter, the Tribunal must now review whether the No-objection Letter was nonetheless ineffective because the information provided by the Claimant was incomplete and thus misleading. The Tribunal finds that this was not the case in particular for the following reasons.\n\n516.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's reliance on the alleged requirements with respect to the content of the FATA notification as set forth in the How-to-Apply Guide1027 and in Australia's Foreign Investment Policy.1028 According to the Respondent, two elements were missing from the Claimant's FATA notification: first, a statement of its future intentions (immediate and ongoing) and, second, a description on how the proposed investment may impact on the national interest.\n\nSee **Exhibit R-001**.\n\nSee **Exhibit R-002**.\n\n517.\n\nHowever, the Respondent has not demonstrated that these requirements were mandatory. Hence, the Tribunal cannot conclude that non-compliance with some aspects of the Guide or the Policy, which is neither contained nor referred to in the FATA, resulted in a misleading application which could invalidate the admission. In other words, while it may be argued that the Claimant omitted a key reason for the restructuring, the Tribunal is not convinced that it was mandatory for the Claimant to mention any such reason in the context of its FATA notification.\n\n518.\n\nSecond and more specifically with respect to national interest, one cannot see why the applicant would have considered that the restructuring raised a concern of national interest, a term for which no precision had been provided. As to the applicant's intention, it is true that the latter did not disclose that it was seeking BIT protection, but this would have been known at least in some quarters of the Treasury. Indeed, the Government, including at least the Treasurer, was aware of (i) Australia's BIT programme; and (ii) the Claimant's intention to challenge Plain Packaging Measures. Thus, the Respondent's claim that, had it known of the BIT intention, the matter would have been elevated to the Treasurer, seems to be rather an admission of a defect in its own internal procedures, where a matter of potentially important public policy was missed. Nor is the Tribunal persuaded by the Respondent's assertion that the Treasury officials who reviewed the Foreign Investment Application lacked authority to issue the No-objection Letter. Instead, the Tribunal is more inclined to accept the Claimant's argument that the officials acted as the Treasurer\u2019s agents, his *alter egos,* and as such had the power to bind the principal.1029 This is confirmed by the practice of FIRB in other cases.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 240; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 84 referring to the [REDACTED]\n\n519.\n\nin particular, the Tribunal has reviewed excerpts of FATA notifications in previous cases.1030 It has also reviewed internal minutes of the Treasury, as produced by the Respondent and submitted in excerpts to the Tribunal by the Claimant, which show how applicants in the past described the purpose of their proposed restructuring. These descriptions (e.g., \"aligning a group\u2019s legal structure with its operational structure\") are similar in style and detail as that in the description contained in the PMI Group\u2019s Foreign Investment Application.1031 These minutes confirm that internal corporate restructuring did not normally raise serious national interest concerns.1032\n\nAnnex B to the Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections.\n\nAnnex A to the Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n520.\n\nThird, and more specifically with respect to the attribution of knowledge to the Treasurer, there is simply no evidence on the record of the state of knowledge of the lower-ranking officials deciding on the No-objection Letter. Thus, there is no basis for engaging in a discussion about attribution of knowledge within the Treasury for which the Respondent would have the burden of proof.\n\n521.\n\nFourth, the Tribunal observes that none of the other FATA applications on the record concern a scenario that is comparable with an intention to bring a BIT claim. Indeed, what the other applications suggest is that the Treasury\u2019s primary focus is on changes that result in foreign ownership of strategic industries. This finding further supports the Tribunal\u2019s view that the Claimant was not required to disclose what the Respondent has called its \"BIT intention\", namely, the intention to bring a Treaty claim against Australia if the Plain Packaging Measures were implemented, in the Foreign Investment Application.\n\n522.\n\nFinally, as to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the No-objection Letter was \"affected by jurisdictional error, and [was] as a result... an invalid decision,\" the Tribunal notes that the letter has never been formally revoked by the Government and that no procedure was initiated to have it declared invalid by any administrative authority or courts. In other words, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to challenge successfully the undisputed facts that the No-objection Letter was issued and no administrative or judicial authority has found the Noobjection Letter to be invalid. The Respondent itself has never taken any action to divest the Claimant of its investment. Moreover, the fact that the No-objection Letter had been sent was later confirmed by officials of the Treasury\u2014on 31 October 20111033 and on 31 July 20121034\u2014 to the effect that the investment was admitted, without there being any suggestion of invalidity.\n\nLetter from [REDACTED] (Treasury) to B. Campbell Q.C. (AGD) \"Request for Documents: Philip Morris Asia Limited Acquisition of Shares in Philip Morris\" (31 October 2011) (**Exhibit R-764**).\n\nClaimant's First-Post Hearing Brief, paras 90-91 referring to a Letter from [REDACTED] (Treasury) to B. Campbell Q.C. (AGD), \"Request for Documents: Philip Morris Asia Limited Acquisition of Shares in Philip Morris (Australia) Limited\" (31 July 2012) (**Exhibit R-765**).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n523.\n\nIn light of these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant's investment was admitted as required in subsection (e) of Article 1 of the BIT and that the Respondent's non-admission objection must thus fail.\n\n**D. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT's CLAIM FALLS OUTSIDE THE TEMPORAL SCOPE OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE TREATY**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n524.\n\nHaving found that the investment was \"admitted\", the Tribunal shall now consider whether the Claimant's claim in the present arbitration falls outside the temporal scope of the Parties' consent to arbitration embodied in Article 10 of the BIT, such that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction.\n\n525.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that the existence of a dispute is a question of substance, not form, and that, based on the facts of this case, a dispute pertaining to the legality and efficacy of plain packaging in Australia had arisen prior to the restructuring of PMI through which it obtained the protection of the Treaty. The Respondent considers that a relevant \"disagreement and/or conflict\" between the Parties existed as early as in April 2010, when the plan to enact plain packaging legislation was announced. The dispute that arose then is the same as the one presently before the Arbitral Tribunal, notwithstanding the fact that the parties are different and that the dispute now pertains to a specific breach of the Treaty. Article 10 does not envisage that the Treaty will apply to disputes that existed before the Treaty took effect vis-\u00e0-vis a particular investor. Absent specific provisions to the contrary, the jurisdiction *ratione temporis* under an investment treaty must be deemed to be limited to prospective disputes. To find otherwise would be contrary to the ordinary meaning of the dispute resolution clause, as well as the object and purpose of the Treaty.\n\n526.\n\nThe Claimant argues that a dispute regarding a breach of an international obligation cannot exist on the basis of mere threats or proposals of a measure. Any disagreement between the Parties prior to the enactment of wrongful legislation has the character of a policy debate in preparation for the positions to be taken in a dispute in the event of enactment. Until June 2011, neither the enactment of the legislation nor the dispute was foreseeable as a very high probability, and the dispute did not crystallise until the legislation was passed. There was therefore no relevant \"preexisting\" dispute, and the present dispute falls within the jurisdiction *ratione temporis* of the tribunal in accordance with Article 10 of the Treaty. Alternatively, even if a dispute did exist prior to the enactment of the legislation, nothing in Article 10 of the Treaty precludes the extension of the scope of the tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to pre-existing disputes.\n\n527.\n\nIn view of the arguments submitted by the Parties, the starting point for the Tribunal is to distinguish between the *ratione temporis* objection and the abuse of rights objection. This is now clear from the jurisprudence1035 and is also largely consistent with the manner in which the Parties structured their pleadings. As the tribunal reasoned in *Gremcitel* :\n\n182. As a further threshold matter, the Tribunal considers that an abuse of process objection must be distinguished from a *ratione temporis* objection. If a claimant acquires an investment after the date on which the challenged act occurred, the tribunal will normally lack jurisdiction *ratione temporis* and there will be no room for an abuse of process. Here, the Tribunal has established that Ms. Levy acquired her investment prior to the challenged measure, even if it was just slightly before. In such a situation, a tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* but may be precluded from exercising its jurisdiction if the acquisition is abusive.1036\n\nSee *Pac Rim* Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, paras 2,101, 2,107 (distinguishing between a *ratione temporis* objection and an abuse of process objection); *Lao Holdings NV. v. The Lao People's Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 February 2014, para. 76 (\"if a company changes its nationality in order to gain ICSID jurisdiction at a moment when things have started to deteriorate so that a dispute is highly probable, it can be considered an abuse of process, but for an objection based on *ratione temporis* to be upheld, the dispute has to have actually arisen before the critical date to conform to the general principle of non-retroactivity in the interpretation and application of international treaties\") (emphasis in bold omitted).\n\n*Gremcitel* Award, para. 182 (footnote omitted).\n\n528.\n\nThe Claimant distinguishes between jurisdiction *ratione temporis* (which it submits must be assessed at the time of filing the request for arbitration) and the *temporal application of the substantive standards* (in relation to which it accepts that the substantive standards could only apply after a claimant has made its protected investment under the BIT). While correct in theory, the Tribunal is of the view that the distinction is unnecessary when the cause of action is founded upon a treaty breach.1037 As the tribunal in *Gremcitel v. Peru* explained:\n\n146. [...] it is clear to the Tribunal that, where the claim is founded upon an alleged breach of the Treaty's substantive standards, a tribunal's jurisdiction is limited to a dispute between the host [S]tate and a national or company which has acquired its protected investment before the alleged breach occurred. In other words, the Treaty must be in force and the national or company must have already made its investment when the alleged breach occurs, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over a breach of that Treaty's substantive standards affecting that investment.\n\n147. This conclusion follows from the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties, which entails that the substantive protections of the BIT apply to the [S]tate conduct that occurred after these protections became applicable to the eligible investment. Because the BIT is at the same time the instrument that creates the substantive obligation forming the basis of the claim b efore the Tribunal and the instrument that confers jurisdiction upon the Tribunal, a claimant bringing a claim based on a Treaty obligation must have owned or controlled the investment when that obligation was allegedly breached.\n\n148. [\u2026] [A claimant] must therefore prove that [it] had already acquired [its] investment at the time of the impugned conduct.1038 (Emphasis added)\n\nFurthermore, in view of the Tribunal's conclusion below that the critical date is the date of enactment of the TPP Act, this discussion would become moot, as the Notice of Arbitration was filed on the same date of such enactment.\n\n*Gremcitel* Award, paras 146-148 (footnotes omitted).\n\n529.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with this approach and considers that, whenever the cause of action is based on a treaty breach, the test for a *ratione temporis* objection is whether a claimant made a protected investment before the moment when the alleged breach occurred. Investor-State jurisprudence is in accord with this approach.1039 In this respect, the identification of the critical date is essential for the assessment of the scope of the Tribunal's *ratione temporis* jurisdiction.\n\n*Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 17 September 2009, paras 112-114 (\"It is undisputed that an investor seeking access to international jurisdiction pursuant to an investment treaty must prove that it was an investor at the relevant time, *i.e*., at the moment when the events on which its claim is based occurred\"); *Libananco Holdings Co.

The investment of AES, a company incorporated in the United States, is not protected by the terms of this Treaty.

Accordingly, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over acts and events that took place before the Claimant acquired the investment, that is on 12 November 2004, at which time both the Treaty had entered into force and the investor had become a qualifying French national.\"); *GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/16, Award, 31 March 2011, para. 170 (\"The Tribunal agrees with Ukraine that in order for the Tribunal to hear the Claimant's claims, the Claimant must have held an interest in the alleged investment before the alleged treaty violations were committed.\"); *ST-AD GmbH v. Bulgaria*, Award on Jurisdiction, 18 July 2013, para. 300 (\"It is an uncontested principle that a tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to consider claims arising prior to the date of the alleged investment, since a BIT cannot be applied to acts committed by a State before the claimant invested in the host country. [\u2026] According to the well-known principle of non-retroactivity of treaties in international law, a BIT cannot apply to the protection of an investor before the latter indeed became an investor under said BIT\"). See also Zachary Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims* (Cambridge, 2009), para. 330 (\"The act of making a qualified investment is also controlling for the scope of the arbitral tribunal's adjudicative power in several respects. [\u2026] the timing of the investor's acquisition of its investment determines the commencement of the substantive protection afforded by the investment treaty and hence the temporal scope for the tribunal's adjudicative power over claims based upon an investment treaty obligation.\").\n\n530.\n\nTo identify the critical date **,** the *Gremcitel* tribunal took the following view:\n\n149. [\u2026] the critical date is the one on which the State adopts the disputed measure, even when the measure represents the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may have started years earlier. It is not uncommon that divergences or disagreements develop over a period of time before they finally \"crystallize\" in an actual measure affecting the investor's treaty rights.1040\n\n*Gremcitel* Award, para. 149.\n\n531.\n\nThe *Gremcitel* tribunal accepted that this was the situation in that case because it was only when the measure (a 2007 Resolution by the Peruvian *Instituto Nacional de Cultura* (INC)) was \"adopted and published\" that the rights of the claimants were allegedly affected. Prior to that moment, \"there was still a possibility that the INC would decide not to adopt the Resolution. The [c]laimants would then have had no act to complain about\".1041\n\n*Gremcitel* Award, para. 150.\n\n532.\n\nThe Tribunal shares this view. It should be mentioned in this context that the date of the *dispute* is not necessarily identical to that of the alleged breach. Rather, at least as far as one-time acts are concerned, the dispute normally follows the alleged breach (it arises when an aggrieved investor \"positively opposes\" the measures adopted or any claim of the other party that derives from them).1042\n\n*Gremcitel* Award, para. 149 (\"In theory, the moment when the challenged acts occurred is not necessarily the same as the one when the dispute arose [...]. It has rightly been noted that '[t]he time of the dispute is not identical with the time of the events leading to the dispute. By definition, the incriminated acts must have occurred some time before the dispute'. In the Tribunal's view, a breach or violation does not become a \"dispute\" until the injured party identifies the breach or violation and objects to it.\").\n\n533.\n\nIn conclusion, for purposes of the *ratione temporis* objection the critical date is the date when the State adopts the disputed measure, which in this case is the date of *enactment* of the TPP Act, as before that moment the Claimant's right could not be affected. In other words, the Claimant was to have acquired its investment by the date of enactment of the TPP Act, *i.e.* by 21 November 2011. The Tribunal observes that, whether the Tribunal refers to the date when the restructuring was decided (3 September 2010) or when it was completed (23 February 2011), both events occurred before the date of the enactment of the TPP Act.\n\n534.\n\nTherefore, and without prejudice to its later finding on abuse of rights, the Tribunal concludes that the requirements for the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* are met.\n\n**E. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT's INVOCATION OF THE TREATY CONSTITUTES AN ABUSE OF RIGHTS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n535.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal must address whether the invocation of the Treaty by the Claimant constitutes an abuse of rights under the present circumstances.\n\n536.\n\nThe essence of the Respondent's position is as follows. The doctrine of abuse of rights delimits the tribunal's jurisdiction as defined by the consent of the Parties to the Treaty.1043 While the Respondent accepts that it must meet the burden establishing an abuse, it does not accept that there is a presumption that the Claimant acted in good faith in bringing its claim, in undergoing a corporate restructuring and subsequently relying on Treaty protections.1044 According to the Respondent, there is no case law to support this contention.1045 Rather, cases hold that the entitlement of the Claimant to bring a claim under the Treaty is circumscribed by the scope of the consent of the parties to the Treaty, and such consent and its scope cannot be presumed, but instead must be positively established.1046 In discharging the burden of proof, the Respondent does not need to meet an exceptionally high evidentiary standard,1047 such as a standard of \"egregious conduct\".1048 The case law indicates that an abuse of right can be found where a corporate restructuring is *motivated* wholly or partly by a desire to gain access to treaty protection in order to bring a claim in respect of a specific dispute1049 that, at the time of the restructuring, *exists* or is *foreseeable*.1050 In these circumstances, the restructuring is intended to create an unfair advantage for the foreign investor because the investor has no intention of performing any economic activity in the host State.1051\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 443.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 450.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 447-448.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 448.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 458.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 458.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 455, 508.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 466.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 491.\n\n537.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the application of the doctrine of abuse of rights results in depriving a claimant of rights that otherwise fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the tribunal.1052 Such a deprivation is to be made only in exceptional circumstances.1053 To meet the burden of proof, the Respondent must overcome a presumption in favour of the Claimant that it has brought its claim in good faith.1054 The threshold for establishing an abuse of rights is that of compelling evidence of egregious bad faith akin to fraud.1055 \"Foreseeability\" is not relevant to establishing abuse of rights\u2014the critical test is bad faith.1056 To the extent that foreseeability is relevant, it must be to a very high standard of probability. The \"motivation\" of an investor is indeed a criterion of abuse of rights. However, bad faith does not exist by virtue of a mere corporate restructuring with a view to taking advantage of Treaty protections. Such normal business practice meets neither the standard of \"egregious\" conduct nor that of bad faith.1057\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 323.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 323.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 324.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 336.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras 345.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 337.\n\n**1. Arbitral Case Law Regarding \"Abuse of Rights\"**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n538.\n\nThe present case is by no means the first investment arbitration in which it is disputed whether a BIT claim brought shortly after restructuring is admissible. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to review the relevant case law on this point.\n\n539.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, it is clear, and recognised by all earlier decisions that the threshold for finding an abusive initiation of an investment claim is high. It is equally accepted that the notion of abuse does not imply a showing of bad faith. Under the case law, the abuse is subject to an objective test and is seen in the fact that an investor who is not protected by an investment treaty restructures its investment in such a fashion as to fall within the scope of protection of a treaty in view of a specific foreseeable dispute. Although it is sometimes said that an abuse of right might also exist in the case of restructuring in respect of an existing dispute, if the dispute already exists, then a tribunal would normally lack jurisdiction *ratione temporis*.\n\n540.\n\nA detailed examination of the relevant cases reveals the following considerations in connection with the legal test for an abuse of right. Among these, it is first and foremost uncontroversial that the mere fact of restructuring an investment to obtain BIT benefits is not *per se* illegitimate.\n\n541.\n\nIn *Tidewater v. Venezuela*, the tribunal said:\n\n184. [I]t is a perfectly legitimate goal and no abuse of an investment protection treaty regime, for an investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes with a host [S]tate in this way.1058\n\n*Tidewater Inc., Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater Caribe, C.A., Twenty Grand Offshore, L.L.C., Point* *Marine, L.L.C., Twenty Grand Marine Service, L.L.C., Jackson Marine, L.L.C. and Zapata Gulf Marine Operators, L.L.C. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013 (\"*Tidewater* Decision on Jurisdiction\"), para. 184.\n\n542.\n\nIn *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela*, the tribunal said:\n\n204. The aim of the restructuring of their investments in Venezuela through a Dutch holding was to protect those investments against breaches of their rights by the Venezuelan authorities by gaining access to ICSID arbitration through the BIT. The tribunal considers that this was a perfectly legitimate goal as far as it concerned future disputes.1059\n\n*Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd., Mobil Venezolana de* *Petr\u00f3leos Holdings, Inc., Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., and Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010 (\"*Mobil Corporation* Decision on Jurisdiction\"), para. 204.\n\n543.\n\nIn a similar vein, the tribunal in *Gremcitel v. Peru* said:\n\n184. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is now well-established, and rightly so, that an organization or reorganization of a corporate structure designed to obtain investment treaty benefits is not illegitimate per se, including where this is done with a view to shielding the investment from possible future disputes with the host [S]tate.1060\n\n*Gremcitel* Award, para. 184.\n\n544.\n\nIn *Aguas del Tunari SA v. Bolivia**,* the tribunal observed:\n\n... [T]o the extent that Bolivia argues that the December 1999 transfer of ownership was a fraudulent or abusive device to assert jurisdiction under the BIT, that:. (d) it is not uncommon in practice and\u2014absent a particular limitation\u2014not illegal to locate one\u2019s operation in a jurisdiction perceived to provide a beneficial regulatory and legal environment in terms, for example, of taxation or the substantive law of the jurisdiction, including the availability of a BIT.1061\n\n*Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005, para. 330.\n\n545.\n\nAt the same time, it may amount to an abuse of process to restructure an investment to obtain BIT benefits in respect of a foreseeable dispute. After commenting that it is legitimate for an investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes, the tribunal in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* went on to say:\n\nAt the heart, therefore, of this issue is a question of fact as to the nature of the dispute between the parties, and a question of timing as to when the dispute that is the subject of the present proceedings arose or could reasonably have been foreseen. If the Claimants' contentions are found to be correct as a matter of fact, then, in the view of the Tribunal, no question of abuse of treaty can arise. On the other hand, if the Respondent's submissions on the course of events are correct, then there may be a real question of abuse of treaty.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nBut the same is not the case in relation to pre-existing disputes between the specific investor and the [S]tate. Thus, the critical issue remains one of fact: was there such a preexisting dispute?1062\n\n*Tidewater* Decision on Jurisdiction, paras 145-146 and 184.\n\n546.\n\nThe point was reiterated in *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela* :\n\n205. With respect to pre-existing disputes, the situation is different and the Tribunal considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain jurisdiction under a BIT for such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the *Phoenix* Tribunal, \"an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID convention and the BITs\".1063\n\n*Mobil Corporation* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 205.\n\n547.\n\nThe tribunal in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* elaborated on this point, setting out a test for distinguishing between a general risk of future disputes and a specific dispute, stating:\n\n2.99. [\u2026] In the Tribunal's view, the dividing-line [between legitimate restructure and an abuse of process] occurs when the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a possible controversy.1064\n\n*Pac Rim* Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, para. 2.99.\n\n548.\n\nThe *Gremcitel* tribunal posited a simpler test stating:\n\n185. However, a restructuring carried out with the intention to invoke the treaty's protections at a time when the dispute is foreseeable may constitute an abuse of process depending on the circumstances.1065\n\n*Gremcitel* Award, para. 185.\n\n549.\n\nThe principle that a restructuring undertaken to gain treaty protection in light of a specific dispute can constitute an abuse was reiterated in *Lao Holdings v. Laos* in the following terms:\n\n70. The Tribunal considers that it is clearly an abuse for an investor to manipulate the nationality of a company subsidiary to gain jurisdiction under an international treaty at a time when the investor is aware that events have occurred that negatively affect its investment and may lead to arbitration. In particular, abuse of process must preclude unacceptable manipulations by a claimant acting in bad faith who is fully aware prior to the change in nationality of the \"legal dispute,\" as submitted by the Respondent.1066\n\n*Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People's Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 February 2014, para. 70.\n\n550.\n\nWhile they admit that, under certain circumstances, a restructuring may constitute an abuse, investor-State tribunals have set a high threshold for finding an abuse of process, requiring proof of the foreseeability of the claim and depending on the particular circumstances of each case. The *Tidewater* tribunal said:\n\n147. [u]nder general international law as well as under ICSID case law, abuse of right is to be determined in each case, taking into account all the circumstances of the case.1067\n\n*Tidewater* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 147.\n\n551.\n\nThat statement was reiterated in *Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela*.1068\n\n*Mobil Corporation* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 177.\n\n552.\n\nThe requirement of a high threshold was articulated by the *Chevron (I)* tribunal in the following terms:\n\n143.... [I]n all legal systems, the doctrines of abuse of rights, estoppel and waiver are subject to a high threshold. Any right leads normally and automatically to a claim for its holder. It is only in very exceptional circumstances that a holder of a right can nevertheless not raise and enforce the resulting claim. The high threshold results from the seriousness of a charge of bad faith amounting to abuse of process. As Judge Higgins stated in her 2003 Separate Opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case, there is \"a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on.\"1069\n\n*Chevron Corporation (USA) and Texaco Petroleum Company (USA) v. The Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 34877, Interim Award, 1 December 2008, para. 143.\n\n553.\n\nA similar approach was taken by the tribunal in *Gremcitel* when it said:\n\n186. As for any abuse of right, the threshold for a finding of abuse of process is high, as a court or tribunal will obviously not presume an abuse, and will affirm the evidence of an abuse only \"in very exceptional circumstances\". Furthermore, as the Tribunal in *Mobil v. Venezuela* stated, \"[u]nder general international law as well as under ICSID case law, abuse of right is to be determined in each case, *taking into account all the circumstances of the case*.\"1070\n\n*Gremcitel* Award, para. 186.\n\n554.\n\nDespite the variations in the formulations used in the decisions just quoted, this Tribunal considers that case law has articulated legal tests on abuse of right that are broadly analogous, revolving around the concept of foreseeability.1071 In the Tribunal's view, foreseeability rests between the two extremes posited by the tribunal in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* \u2014\"a very high probability and not merely a possible controversy\". On this basis, the initiation of a treaty-based investor-State arbitration constitutes an abuse of rights (or an abuse of process, the rights abused being procedural in nature) when an investor has changed its corporate structure to gain the protection of an investment treaty at a point in time when a specific dispute was foreseeable. The Tribunal is of the opinion that a dispute is foreseeable when there is a reasonable prospect, as stated by the *Tidewater* tribunal, that a measure which may give rise to a treaty claim will materialise. The Tribunal will now apply this test to the facts of the case.\n\nSee also *Gremcitel* Award, fn. 219.\n\n**2. The Restructuring in the Context of Political Developments**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n555.\n\nBoth Parties have presented long timelines of events, which need to be taken into account. In the following paragraphs, the Tribunal will juxtapose developments occurring at the corporate level within the PMI Group of companies and events arising at the political level within the Australian Government. Doing so, it will focus on occurrences which the Tribunal considers particularly relevant to place the Claimant\u2019s restructuring into temporal perspective.\n\n556.\n\nThe PMI Group has been restructured in various ways at least since 2005,1072 although it is not entirely clear to the Tribunal to what extent these changes in the corporate structure were part of a single restructuring plan rather than a series of *ad hoc* improvements. The Respondent began considering tobacco Plain Packaging Measures as early as 2008 with the introduction of the Fielding Bill in August 2009.1073 The Tribunal notes that on 2 September 2009 the PMI Group received a memorandum containing legal advice [REDACTED],1074 and, a month later, PML's solicitors wrote to the Health Minister. Nicola Roxon. expressing concerns about the effect of the plain packaging legislation on Philip Monis\u2019s property rights.1075\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nMemorandum from Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Union to Unknown Recipient Regarding Plain Packaging **(Exhibit C-221);** Parliamentary Digest.

On 7 July 2010, the Australian Government published a timetable which showed that the plain packaging legislation would be ready for introduction before 30 June 2011 and would be fully implemented by 1 July 2012.1082 The House of Representatives was dissolved on 19 July 2010.1083\n\nParliament of Australia Research Paper, p. 10 **(Exhibit C-189).**\n\nLetter from Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to Redacted Recipient on Plain Packaging (23 February 2010) **(Exhibit C-100);** Memorandum from Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Union to Unknown Recipient Regarding Plain Packaging **(Exhibit C-221).**\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 50; [REDACTED]\n\nEmail from Leo O'Keeffe to Ian Goss forwarded to Philip Noonan.

Health Minister Roxon did not commit to an answer.1099 Shortly thereafter, on 26 May 2011, the Australian press reported that Parliament would likely pass the plain packaging legislation because the Labor Patty had seemed the four extra votes that it needed to pass the legislation.1100\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 92.\n\nTranscript of Meet the Press interview with Minister for Health Nicola Roxon (22 May 2011) (**Exhibit C-338**).\n\nPhillip Coorey. \"Tobacco plain packaging to pass despite Opposition.\u2019\u2019 *The Sydney Morning Herald* (26 May 2011) **(Exhibit C-341).**\n\n565.\n\nOn 22 June 2011, a memorandum from Mr. Pellegrini indicates that PMI sought approval to refine its affiliates\u2019 corporate structure in the Asia region.1101 The Claimant then served the Respondent with the Notice of Claim under the BIT on 27 June 2011.

It is clear that the dispute contemplated here was a dispute about rights. The record shows that PMI stated clearly even before the Rudd announcement that plain packaging would deprive it of its legal rights. As early as 2009, it had informed the Australian Government that plain packaging would interfere with its property rights, and its internal memoranda made it clear that it was considering the matter in legal tenus. On 29 April 2010. Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Rudd and Health Minister Roxon unequivocally announced the Government\u2019s intention to introduce Plain Packaging Measures, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, there was no uncertainty about the Government's intention to introduce plain packaging as of that point. Accordingly, there was at least a reasonable prospect that legislation equivalent to the Plain Packaging Measures would eventually be enacted, which would trigger a dispute. The Tribunal is not convinced that political developments after 29 April 2010 were such that the Claimant could reasonably conclude that the enactment of Plain Packaging Measures and the ensuing dispute were no longer foreseeable.\n\n567.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to make two further general but at the same time case-specific considerations. First, in this case a period of 19 months passed between the announcement of the intention to legislate and the passage of the actual legislation. However, the length of time it takes to legislate is not a decisive factor in determining whether the legislation is foreseeable. The Tribunal notes that democratic States often have long legislative processes involving consultations with a variety of stakeholders. In this case, the process, which led to the approval of the TPP Act, was transparent, involving preliminary reports and consultations and discussions with all stakeholders, including the tobacco companies. However, this does not make the outcome any less foreseeable than in the case of a State that does not have the same sort of democratic oversight of the legislative process and might enact legislation almost overnight.\n\n568.\n\nSecond, in April 2010, long before the restructuring, the Australian Government announced that it would introduce Plain Packaging Measures and never withdrew from that position even though political leaders changed and the Government became a minority government. What became uncertain was not whether the Government intended to introduce plain packaging, but whether the Government could maintain a majority or would be replaced. But that is a difficulty which any minority government faces, and if it were treated as a basis for saying that there was no reasonable prospect of a dispute, then there would be one rule for majority governments and another for minority governments, which would create particular difficulty for States whose electoral processes can result in minority governments.\n\n569.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that, at the time of the restructuring, the dispute that materialised subsequently was foreseeable to the Claimant. Indeed, at least after the 29 April 2010 announcement, it was reasonably foreseeable that legislation equivalent to the Plain Packaging Measures would eventually be enacted and, consequently, a dispute would arise.\n\n**3. The Cogency of PM Asia's Alleged Other Reasons for Restructuring**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n570.\n\nHaving held that the dispute was foreseeable prior to the restructuring, the Tribunal now turns to the Claimant's reasons for restructuring. In this context, the Parties have discussed whether the restructuring was solely motivated by the desire to obtain treaty protection or whether such protection was merely an ancillary consequence of the restructuring. The Tribunal considers that the mere fact that a company prepared for \"the worst case\" by seeking legal advice about a BIT claim at an early stage would not be unusual; such conduct might simply be normal and prudent business behaviour. In the view of the Tribunal, it would not normally be an abuse of right to bring a BIT claim in the wake of a corporate restructuring, if the restructuring was justified independently of the possibility of bringing such a claim. The Tribunal acknowledges the reality that corporate groups\u2014and particularly multinationals\u2014are routinely restructured for a variety of reasons.\n\n571.\n\nThe Parties have addressed the cogency or persuasiveness of PM Asia\u2019s alleged other reasons for restructuring extensively both by arguments and by the submission of evidence. A summary of these submissions follows:\n\n572.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the restructuring was part of a broader, group-wide process that had been ongoing since 2005.1105 in support, the Claimant relies on internal memoranda that refer to proposals for restructuring PMI\u2019s European affiliates in 2004. and PMI\u2019s Latin American and Canadian affiliates in 2008.1106 The Claimant also submits one internal memorandum dated 3 September 2010 as evidence of a proposal to restructure affiliates in the African and Asian regions at that time.1107 and one internal memorandum dated 22 June 2011 as evidence of a proposal to restructure certain Asian affiliates imder PM Asia Limited \"as part of ongoing efforts to refine PMI affiliates\u2019 corporate structure in the Asia region.\"1108 in addition, the Claimant presents a Board decision as evidence of ongoing restructuring of other PMI affiliates.1109 To reinforce this documentary evidence, the Claimant relies on the witness statements and oral testimony of Mr. Pellegrini in support of its assertion that the transfer of ownership of PM Australia to the Claimant was consistent with the objectives of these other restructuring initiatives.1110\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 44; Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 334-343; Claimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 103, 106: Claimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, paras 22-23; Amended Transcript of the Hearing.

See also Claimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 23.\n\n573.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, relies on the witness statement of Professor Lys, who notes that the only contemporaneous piece of evidence provided by the Claimant that directly relates to a broader project to restructure PMI Asia is the internal memorandum dated 3 September 2010 and that this memorandum raises a number of questions about whether this restructuring made real business sense.1111 The Respondent also questions the veracity of that memorandum, citing to exceipts from company registers. Annual Reports of the affected affiliates, as well as previous internal PMI memoranda that appear to contradict the 3 September 2010 memorandum.1112 The Respondent criticises the Claimant\u2019s reliance on documentary evidence on the basis that it was prepared in contemplation of this arbitration, that it contradicts the Claimant\u2019s purported restructuring strategy, and that certain documents are too remote to be of relevance.1113 Finally, the Respondent argues that [REDACTED] oral testimony directly contradicts the Claimant\u2019s position, since \"[h]e agreed that [the restructuring] had no 'commercial advantage\u2019\"1114 and \"conceded he was not really a part of [the restructuring] and said it had no meaningful impact on this region\".1115\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n574.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that one relevant and compelling reason motivating the restructuring was the need to align ownership with the Claimant\u2019s pre-existing management control of its subsidiaries, thereby creating a \"better, leaner, clearer structure\".1116 The Claimant points to internal PM Asia memoranda in support of the contention that a more centralised ownership structure would facilitate PMI\u2019s overall objectives.1117 The Claimant relies on the oral testimony of Mr. Pellegrini who stated that one of the objectives of PMI\u2019s group-wide restructuring was to align the ownership and management control of its various affiliates.1118 Mr. Pellegrini also explained why Ceriani PMI affiliates in the Asia region had not been acquired by PM Asia, and that this did not contradict the streamlining objectives of the restructuring.1119\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 52; Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 330. 338-340; Claimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 111-14; Amended Transcript of the Hearing.

Day 3. pp. 9:1-10:23.\n\n575.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that the restructuring was motivated by the need to align PMI affiliates in the Asia region, pointing to a Table of PMI Affiliates in the Asia region over which PM Asia asserts oversight and control and which, according to the Respondent, establishes that the restructuring has not followed a regional pattern.1120 Pointing to a PMI internal Memorandum dated 22 June 2011, the Respondent asserts that the decision to transfer certain PMI Asian affiliates to PM Asia was made on the same day that Mr. Pellegrini signed the Notice of Claim.1121 The Respondent relies on the report of Professor Lys. who stated that the previous structure was functioning \"perfectly well\" before the restructuring and that the net impact of the restructuring was to complicate, rather than simplify the ownership structure.1122\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 112: [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 113-115; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras 104-107; Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 39; Amended Transcript of the Hearing.

See also Second Expert Report of Professor Lys (26 November 2014). paras 194. 197 **(Exhibit RWS-012).**\n\n576.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant contends that the restructuring helped to minimise the Claimant\u2019s tax liabilities. By way of example, the Claimant refers to an internal PMI memorandum dated [REDACTED], which indicates that certain tax benefits under the Dutch tax system were associated with shifting certain functions and responsibilities from PM Holland to PMI.1123 The Claimant also submits internal memoranda dated [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] that purportedly evidence PMI\u2019s efforts to streamline its activities, thereby liquidating redundant entities and creating consequential tax advantages.1124 These tax advantages, in turn, allowed the Claimant to finance an inter-company debt, as evidenced by a Loan Note between PM Holland and PM International Management S.A.1125 The Claimant finally relies on Mr. Pellegrini\u2019s oral testimony wherein he recalled that the restructuring presented \"an advantage front a tax point of view\" to finance intercompany debt.1126\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras 341; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 107; Philip Monis International.

It points in particular to a series of e-mails in this regard.1127 It adds that the Tribunal has been kept away from any \"tax experts\" who could speak of the supposed revenue rationale for the restructuring. Similarly, the Respondent observes that there are only few privileged documents listed in the RPL that support the purported tax benefits of the restructuring at the time when it was being approved by the PMI Group.1128 It refers to the report of Professor Lys which explains that any tax advantage from the restructuring would have been \"small and inconsequential\" in the context of other sources of income, and that these advantages were \"not needed to service its interest obligations under the 'loan-note\u2019\".1129\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief para 103 -Email from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] E-mail from [REDACTED] (23 August 2010) (**RPL Doc #335): Email From**  [REDACTED] (**Exhibit R 766).**\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 113-115; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 103; First Expert Report of Professor Lys (13 October 2013).

It refers in particular to the evidence of Professor Lys, who states that the restructuring did not have any of the anticipated financial benefits.1133 The Respondent also points to PM Asia\u2019s financial statements for 2001 and 2010 to show that PM Asia made a profit in those years without the receipt of dividend income from the restructuring.1134 The Respondent also recalls Professor Lys\u2019s report, and PM Asia\u2019s financial statements for 2011, 2012 and 2013, in order to demonstrate that any dividend income arising from the restructuring was not used to fruid PM Asia\u2019s operations or to make strategic acquisitions, in contradiction of the Claimant\u2019s purported rationale for the restructuring.1135 The Respondent relies on internal PMI documents, including various \"country reports\" and financial statements, as well as public comments made by PMI representatives, as evidence that PMI\u2019s growth in the Asia region was the result of non-Asian PMI affiliates making strategic acquisitions in the region, as opposed to the growth of PM Asia.1136\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras 113-115; First Expert Report on Professor Lys (13 October 2013), paras 423, 424 (Exhibit RWS-001); Second Expert Report of Professor Lys (26 November 2014). para. 39 (Exhibit RWS-012).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 108; Second Expert Report of Professor Lys (26 November 2014), paras 228-229; [REDACTED] PM Holland, \"Annual report for the year ended December 31st, 2012\" (filed in the Dutch Registry on 24 July 2013), pp. 14, 18 (Exhibit R-909).

Indeed, the persons most closely involved in the restructuring decision were not offered as witnesses by the Claimant. Nor was the Tribunal presented with contemporaneous corporate memoranda or other internal correspondence sufficiently explaining the business case for the restructuring in detail.\n\n583.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal is inclined to place limited weight on Mr. Pellegrini's testimony as it became apparent during the hearing that Mr. Pellegrini was not familiar with details of legal or corporate strategy. Against this background, the expert report of Professor Lys does carry weight, especially as it remains unrebutted by other expert evidence, and Professor Lys was not called for cross-examination.\n\n584.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not been able to prove that tax or other business reasons were determinative for the restructuring. From all the evidence on file, the Tribunal can only conclude that the main and determinative, if not sole, reason for the restructuring was the intention to bring a claim under the Treaty, using an entity from Hong Kong.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n585.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the commencement of treaty-based investor-State arbitration constitutes an abuse of right (or abuse of process) when an investor has changed its corporate structure to gain the protection of an investment treaty at a point in time where a dispute was foreseeable. A dispute is foreseeable when there is a reasonable prospect that a measure that may give rise to a treaty claim will materialise.\n\n586.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal has found that the adoption of the Plain Packaging Measures was foreseeable well before the Claimant's decision to restructure was taken (let alone implemented). On 29 April 2010, Australia's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Health Minister Roxon unequivocally announced the Government's intention to introduce Plain Packaging Measures. In the Tribunal's view, there was no uncertainty about the Government's intention to introduce plain packaging as of that point. Accordingly, from that date, there was at least a reasonable prospect that legislation equivalent to the Plain Packaging Measures would eventually be enacted and a dispute would arise. Political developments after 29 April 2010 did not involve any change in the intention of the Government to introduce Plain Packaging Measures and, thus, were not such as to change the foreseeability assessment.\n\n587.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion is reinforced by a review of the evidence regarding the Claimant's professed alternative reasons for the restructuring. The record indeed shows that the principal, if not sole, purpose of the restructuring was to gain protection under the Treaty in respect of the very measures that form the subject matter of the present arbitration. For the Tribunal, the adoption of the Plain Packaging Measures was not only foreseeable but actually foreseen by the Claimant when it chose to change its corporate structure.\n\n588.\n\nIn light of the foregoing discussion, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the initiation of this arbitration constitutes an abuse of rights, as the corporate restructuring by which the Claimant acquired the Australian subsidiaries occurred at a time when there was a reasonable prospect that the dispute would materialise and as it was carried out for the principal, if not sole, purpose of gaining Treaty protection. Accordingly, the claims raised in this arbitration are inadmissible and the Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute.\n\n**F. COSTS OF ARBITRATION**\n---------------------------\n\n589.\n\nAs this Interim Award (final save as to costs) comes to the conclusion that this Tribunal cannot exercise its jurisdiction, it brings the present proceedings to an end, but for a decision on the costs of arbitration.\n\n590.\n\nThe Tribunal will provide the Parties with an opportunity to make submissions regarding the amounts and the allocation of the costs of the proceedings, and the Tribunal will then fix and allocate the costs of arbitration in a final award on costs.\n\n**VII. DECISIONS**\n------------------\n\nFor the reasons set out above in this Award, the Tribunal unanimously decides, declares, and awards as follows:\n\n**I. The claims raised in this arbitration are inadmissible;**\n\n**II. Therefore, the Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute;**\n\n**III.

THE CLAIMANT**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe claimant in the present arbitration is Philip Morris Asia Limited (\"**PM Asia**\" or the \"**Claimant**\"), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong pursuant to the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance on 8 November 1994,1 with its registered address at Level 28, Three Pacific Place, 1 Queen's Road East, Hong Kong.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Claim, para. 21.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Mr. James Mendenhall, Ms. Marinn Carlson, and Mr. David Roney of Sidley Austin LLP; Mr. Joe Smouha Q.C. and Mr. Salim Moollan Q.C. of Essex Court Chambers; and Mr. Christopher Young of Ninian Stephen Chambers.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT**\n---------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent in this arbitration is the Commonwealth of Australia (\"**Australia**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"), a sovereign State.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented by Mr. Simon Daley P.S.M., Ms. Catherine Kelso, Mr. Jonathon Hutton, and Ms. Jancis Cunliffe of the Australian Government Solicitor; Mr. Justin T. Gleeson S.C., Solicitor-General of Australia (until 6 November 2016), Mr. Bill Campbell Q.C. of the Attorney-General's Department; Mr. James Hutton of Eleven Wentworth Chambers; Mr. Samuel Wordsworth Q.C. of Essex Court Chambers; and Professor Chester Brown of 7 Selborne Chambers.\n\n**C. BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n5.\n\nThe present Award is the second and final award in a dispute between PM Asia and Australia (together the \"**Parties**\") in respect of the Respondent's enactment and enforcement of the *Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011* (the \"**TPP Act**\") and the implementing regulations known as the *Tobacco Plain Packaging Regulations 2011* (the \"**TPP Regulations**\") (collectively the \"**Plain Packaging Measures**\").\n\n6.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration dated 21 November 2011 the Claimant had commenced arbitration in relation to this dispute pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of Hong Kong and the Government of Australia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 15 September 1993 (the \"**Treaty**\" or \"**BIT**\"). On 17 December 2015, the Tribunal issued an **Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility**, in which it addressed the following objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to admissibility of claims: (i) the Claimant's investment was not legally admitted in Australia (\"**Admission Objection**\"); (ii) the dispute had arisen before the Claimant obtained the protection of the Treaty (\"**Timing Objection**\"); (iii) in any event, the commencement of the arbitration shortly after the Claimant's restructuring constituted an abuse of rights (\"**Abuse Objection**\"). While the Tribunal rejected Australia's first two preliminary objections, it upheld the third objection, concluding:\n\nthe initiation of this arbitration constitutes an abuse of rights, as the corporate restructuring by which the Claimant acquired the Australian subsidiaries occurred at a time when there was a reasonable prospect that the dispute would materialise and as it was carried out for the principal, if not sole, purpose of gaining Treaty protection. Accordingly, the claims raised in this arbitration are inadmissible and the Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute.2\n\nAward on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, para. 588.\n\n7.\n\nThe dispositive part of the Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility reads as follows:\n\nFor the reasons set out above in this Award, the Tribunal unanimously decides, declares, and awards as follows:\n\nI. The claims raised in this arbitration are inadmissible;\n\nII. Therefore, the Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute;\n\nIII. Costs are reserved for a final award limited to costs.\n\n8.\n\nIt is with the question of the costs of arbitration that the Tribunal will deal in the present Final Award.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility recounts in detail the procedural history of the arbitration from its commencement up until the date of the issuance of that Award. The Tribunal has also issued seventeen procedural orders, each of which sets out the procedural events that are relevant to the particular decision. All of these documents have been published, in accordance with the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 5, on the website of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The Tribunal therefore recalls only key developments since December 2015, when the Partial Award was issued.\n\n10.\n\nOn 28 January 2016 and 29 January 2016, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 5, the Claimant and the Respondent submitted their proposed redactions to the Award.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 February 2016, the Respondent submitted objections to several of the Claimant's proposed redactions. On 29 February 2016, the Claimant replied to the Respondent's objections and, on 7 March 2016, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant's reply.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 March 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit further comments. The Respondent submitted its additional comments and the Claimant submitted its response to the Respondent's additional comments on 18 March 2016 and 25 March 2016 respectively. On 31 March 2016, the Respondent objected to certain additional redactions proposed by the Claimant.\n\n13.\n\nOn 2 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 17, in which it determined which of the redactions proposed by the Parties would be permitted in order to protect confidential information.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 6 June 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file submissions on costs by 1 July 2016 and comments on the opposing Party's submission on costs by 16 July 2016, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.\n\n15.\n\nOn 23 June 2016, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to inform it of an agreement between the Parties to postpone deadlines for the filing of the submissions on costs and comments on the opposing Party's submission on costs to 2 September 2016 and 16 September 2016 respectively.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated 23 June 2016, the Tribunal confirmed that the timetable agreed between the Parties was acceptable to the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nOn 2 September 2016, the Claimant submitted the **Claimant's First Submission on Costs** dated 2 September 2016. On the same date, the Respondent submitted **Australia's Submission on Costs** dated 2 September 2016.\n\n18.\n\nOn 16 September 2016, the Claimant submitted the **Claimant's Second Submission on Costs** dated 16 September 2016. On the same date, the Respondent submitted **Australia's Reply Submission on Costs** dated 16 September 2016.\n\n**III. INTRODUCTION TO THE TRIBUNAL'S EXAMINATION**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal has given consideration to all the extensive factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their submissions. The fact that a specific argument is not expressly referred to in the Award does not mean that it has not been considered; the Tribunal discusses only those submissions of the Parties which it considers most relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal's reasons, without repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties, address what the Tribunal considers to be the determinative factors in deciding on the Requests of the Parties.\n\n20.\n\nThe Parties have extensively referred to decisions of other tribunals. There is no dispute that in any event the decisions of other tribunals are not binding on this Tribunal. The many references by the Parties to certain arbitral decisions in their pleadings do not contradict this conclusion.\n\n21.\n\nHowever, this does not preclude the Tribunal from considering arbitral decisions and the arguments of the Parties based upon them, to the extent that it may find that they shed useful light on the issues that arise for the decision in the present case. Such an examination is conducted by the Tribunal, in so far as considered relevant for the present case, later in this Decision, after the Tribunal has considered the Parties' contentions and arguments regarding the various issues raised.\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal will first deal with the allocation of costs claimed by the Parties. Once the respective principles, their application in the present case, and the question whether any costs have to be reimbursed by a Party to the other are determined, the Tribunal will turn in a separate section to the question whether the amount of such costs is to be considered reasonable.\n\n**IV. ALLOCATION OF COSTS OF ARBITRATION**\n------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that the costs of the arbitration are to be allocated in accordance with Article 42(1) of the 2010 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Rules on Arbitration (2010) (\"**2010 Rules**\"). However, the Parties disagree as to the interpretation of this provision and its application to the present proceedings. The Respondent is of the view that the Claimant has been unsuccessful in this arbitration, and that there is no reason to depart from the \"loser pays\" approach, in particular in the light of the Tribunal's finding on abuse of rights. Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the Claimant should pay the costs of arbitration and the costs incurred by the Respondent. The Claimant, on the other hand, submits that the loser pays approach is \"readily reversible\". According to the Claimant, each Party prevailed on two and lost on two of the major issues in the preliminary objections phase of the arbitration. Each Party should therefore pay its own legal fees and one-half of the arbitration costs.\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT'S REQUEST**\n-----------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant refers to Article 42(1) of the 2010 Rules, which provides:\n\nThe costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes the words \"in principle\". In this regard, the Claimant refers to scholarly commentary on the UNCITRAL Rules that provides that the presumption in favour of the loser pays approach is \"readily reversible\" and that \"the determination of whether apportionment is reasonable is subject to the arbitral tribunal's own judgement.\"3 The Claimant further notes that some tribunals operating under the UNCITRAL Rules have rejected the loser pays approach. In particular, the tribunal in *EnCana v. Ecuador* stated that the loser pays presumption is \"not an inflexible rule\" and ordered the prevailing party to pay the unsuccessful claimant's arbitration costs.4 The Claimant notes that the Tribunal \"is not bound to adopt and apply the 'loser pays' approach\" and, instead, should apportion costs based on the circumstances of the case.5 The Claimant considers that relevant circumstances include the following considerations.\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 6, referring to David Caron and Lee Caplan, THE UNCITRAL ARBITRATION RULES: A COMMENTARY (2013), Oxford University Press at 866 (**Exhibit CLA-292**).\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated September 2, 2016, para. 6, referring to *EnCana Corporation* *v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN 3481, UNCITRAL, Award, February 3, 2006, para. 201 (**Exhibit CLA-026**); *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, para. 188 (**Exhibit CLA-287**); *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, March 14, 2003, paras 648-649 (**Exhibit CLA-288**); *Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, September 3, 2001, paras 317-319 (**Exhibit CLA-059**).\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 8.\n\n26.\n\nFirst, the Claimant contends that each of the Parties \"prevailed on two, and lost on two, of the key issues before the Tribunal\" and that \"in broad terms, Claimant prevailed in arguing that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over the dispute, while Respondent prevailed in its admissibility objection.\" The Claimant concludes that in such circumstances it is not \"correct or appropriate to label one party the 'winner' and one party the 'loser'.\"6 The Claimant further argues that, in cases where each party prevails on certain issues, \"tribunals should award costs in line with the proportion of issues upon which each party succeeded.\" The Claimant submits that it is an approach routinely adopted by UNCITRAL tribunals and refers to *Occidental v. Ecuador*, *Les Laboratoires Servier v. Poland* and *Rurelec v. Bolivia*.7 Similar to these cases, the Parties in the present arbitration had \"'mixed success' with respect to the four major issues in dispute.\"8 The Claimant notes that it would be \"unreasonable and unjust for Claimant to be ordered to pay the costs of adducing evidence on issues unsuccessfully raised by Respondent.\"9\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 9; Claimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 4-5.\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 9, referring to *Occidental Exploration* *and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3467, UNCITRAL, Final Award, July 1, 2004, para. 216 (**Exhibit CLA-049**); *Les Laboratoires Servier, S.A.S., Biofarma, S.A.S., Arts et Techniques du Progres S.A.S. v. Republic of Poland*, UNCITRAL, Award (Redacted), February 14, 2012, paras 669-672 (**Exhibit CLA-254**); *Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2011-17, UNCITRAL, Award, January 31, 2014, para. 620 (**Exhibit CLA-255**).\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 10.\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 10-11.\n\n27.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that the apportionment of costs is inappropriate where counsel for the parties have acted professionally and efficiently. In this regard, the Claimant relies on *Romak v. Uzbekistan,* where the tribunal observed \"a general trend\" towards an equal apportionment of arbitration costs \"irrespective of the outcome of the dispute.\" The tribunal in that case held:\n\nneither of the Parties has presented its case in a way justifying the shifting of arbitral costs against it. To the contrary, counsel for both Parties worked ably, diligently and efficiently in defense of their clients' respective interests.... Each of the Parties shall therefore be liable to pay half of the arbitration costs. Each Party shall also bear its own costs for legal representation and other costs incurred in connection with presenting its case.10\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 12, referring to *Romak S.A. v. Republic* *of Uzbekistan*, UNCITRAL, Award, November 26, 2009, para. 252 (**Exhibit RLA-319**).\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant also refers to *Merrill & Ring v. Canada* and *HICEE B.V. v. Slovak Republic,* where the respective tribunals emphasized \"professional competence\" and \"cooperation\" of the parties and ruled that each party was to bear its own costs.11\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 13, referring to *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award, March 31, 2010, paras 270-271 (**Exhibit CLA-291**); *HICEE B.V. v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, May 23, 2011, para. 151 (**Exhibit RLA-080**).\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, in the present arbitration, counsel for the Claimant \"worked ably, diligently and efficiently\" and demonstrated \"professional competence.\"12 Although Australia raised \"complex, novel and difficult questions of fact and law,\" the Claimant confined its submissions to a reasonable length and limited its use of witnesses and experts, which \"allowed for a relatively short jurisdictional hearing.\"13\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 14, referring to *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award, March 31, 2010, paras 270-271 (**Exhibit CLA-291**); *HICEE B.V. v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, May 23, 2011, para. 151 (**Exhibit RLA-080**).\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 14.\n\n30.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's arguments, the Claimant submits that the cases cited by the Respondent \"support Claimant's position that Respondent should not be awarded its claimed costs and fees, given that it was not fully successful in raising objections.\"14\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 4-5.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimant explains that notably in *Detroit International Bridge Company v. Canada* the tribunal \"rejected Canada's request to collect all of its costs and fees\" and described it as a \"partially unsuccessful\" party. In addition, the tribunal in this case noted that it had \"nearly total discretion to allocate the costs of arbitration pursuant to Article 42(1).\"15\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 7-8, referring to *Detroit International Bridge Company v. Canada*, PCA Case No. 2012-25, Award on Costs, August 17, 2015, paras 48, 50-51 (**Exhibit RLA-374**).\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimant submits that other cases that are relied upon by the Respondent are \"clearly distinguishable\". Thus, in *Achmea v. Slovak Republic II,* the claimant \"did not succeed in establishing jurisdiction\" and the tribunal awarded only a portion of the total fees claimed. In the present arbitration, according to the Claimant, it \"*did* succeed in establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction\" and the Respondent prevailed on its admissibility objection.16 As for *ICS v. Argentina* and *Gallo v. Canada*, the respondents in these cases, unlike the Respondent in this arbitration, were entirely successful and therefore, according to the Claimant, these cases are \"clearly irrelevant\".17 The Claimant also notes that *Philip Morris Brands Sarl et al. v. Uruguay* does not support the Respondent's position since the tribunal \"did not award the respondent its full costs and fees.\"18\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 10, referring to *Achmea B.V. v.* *Slovak Republic II*, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, paras 288-289 (**Exhibit RLA-236**) (emphasis by the Claimant).\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 11, referring to *ICS Inspection* *and Control Services Limited v. Argentine Republic*, PCA Case No. 2010-9 *,* Award on Jurisdiction, February 10, 2012, paras 59-63, 326-27 (**Exhibit RLA-375**); *Vito G. Gallo v. Canada*, PCA Case No. 2008-02, Award, September 15, 2011, paras 146, 328-330) (**Exhibit CLA-196**).\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 12, referring to *Philip Morris* *Brands S\u00e0rl v. Uruguay*, Award at para. 588 (Exhibit RLA-380).\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the Respondent cites abuse of rights cases that support the Claimant's, rather than the Respondent's, position. In particular, the Claimant submits that all of the awards cited by the Respondent either did not award full costs and fees to the respondent19 or awarded costs and fees to the respondent in order to sanction claimants for fraud or unprofessional conduct, which, according to the Claimant, was not present in this case.20\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 14-17, referring to *Transglobal* *Green Energy, LLC and Transglobal Green Panama, S.A. v.

Turkey* and *Europe Cement v. Turkey* the tribunals found abuse \"because the investors used forged and fraudulent documents as evidence of their purported ownership of the relevant investments\"; the tribunal thus used cost allocation to sanction the claimants for their unprofessional conduct.22 According to the Claimant, it \"complied with all procedural orders and conducted this arbitration in a professional manner\" and \"the Tribunal recognized that both Parties in this arbitration acted professionally.\"23\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 19, referring to *Plama Consortium* *Limited v Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, August 27, 2008, paras 321-322 (**Exhibit CLA-088**); *Saba Fakes v.

Turkey*, one of the cases on which the Respondent relied to make its Abuse Objection. In this case the tribunal \"ordered that each Party bears its own legal expenses and that the costs of arbitration be divided equally between the Parties.\"24\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 18, referring to *Alapli Elektrik* *B.V. v Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/13, Decision on Annulment, July 10, 2014, para. 26 (**Exhibit RLA-239**).\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's failed jurisdictional objections and its burdensome document requests caused both Parties to incur \"substantial fees and expenses.\" According to the Claimant, the Respondent's failed jurisdictional objections were not \"as closely 'intertwined' with its Abuse Objection\"25 as the Respondent suggests. In particular, the Claimant notes that \"Respondent's Admission Objection under domestic law was clearly distinct from its Abuse Objection under international law\" and required the Claimant's counsel to address not only Australian law but also \"the policies and practices of the Australian Treasurer and Foreign Investment Review Board.\"26\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 22.\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 23.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant also asserts that the Admission Objection was \"late, spurious and constantly shifting.\" The Respondent introduced this objection in its Statement of Defence, \"almost two years after Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration.\" According to the Claimant, the Respondent \"could not seriously have expected the Tribunal to find that Claimant's investment had not been admitted.\" Moreover, the Claimant notes that while in its Statement of Defence and Reply the Respondent made references to the Australian Criminal Code and \"evaded the question of whether it alleged criminal wrongdoing,\" at the hearing the Respondent informed the tribunal that it \"did not allege any criminal wrongdoing.\"27\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 24.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the Respondent's Timing objection was similarly not as intertwined with its Abuse Objection as the Respondent contends. It related to a \"distinct body of international jurisprudence on jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, which included a number of ICJ and PCIJ judgements.\" Furthermore, the Respondent \"submitted over 30 pages of additional argumentation devoted solely to its Timing Objection.\"28\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 25\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that \"it was Respondent's burdensome document requests that resulted in substantial costs and fees for both Parties.\" The Respondent, according to the Claimant, was \"seek[ing] virtually the entirety of Claimant's business records for a 13 year period,\" which was \"vastly overbroad and burdensome\" since the relevant question was \"whether Claimant controlled the Australian subsidiaries immediately before Respondent alleged that the dispute arose\u2014not a decade earlier in 2001.\"29\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 27-28.\n\n40.\n\nIn relation to its own production requests directed to the Respondent, the Claimant notes that these requests were \"a result of the Admission Objection\" and were directly caused by the Respondent's decision to raise that Objection. The Claimant further submits that \"the extent of the Parties' document review relating to [the files of Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (\"**FIRB**\")] is simply further evidence that Respondent's Admission Objection was not 'closely intertwined' with its Abuse Objection.\"30\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 29.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that \"the most reasonable method of apportioning costs and fees is to do so equally between the Parties\" and requests the Tribunal to order each party to pay its own legal fees and one-half of the arbitration costs.31\n\nClaimant's First Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 16-17, *see also* Claimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 35.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S REQUEST**\n-------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 42(1) of the 2010 Rules establishes a general rule that it is for the unsuccessful party to bear the costs of arbitration and the costs incurred by the successful party. The Respondent argues that, in this arbitration, there is no reason to depart from this general rule.32\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 4.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent provides that the loser pays principle has been applied by many tribunals. The Respondent in particular points to *ST-AD v. Bulgaria*, where the tribunal confirmed that the UNCITRAL Rules establish \"a presumption in favour of the losing party paying the costs of the arbitration.\"33 In addition, the Respondent asserts that both PM Asia's and Australia's submissions, exchanged prior to the Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, were consistent with that approach, as each Party had requested the Tribunal to award costs in its favour in the event that it prevailed in the arbitration.34\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 12.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 12.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent submits that PM Asia should be considered the \"unsuccessful\" party for the purposes of Article 42(1). In support, the Respondent relies on awards in which arbitral tribunals, applying the loser pays principle, held that a claimant failing to establish jurisdiction is the \"unsuccessful\" party.35 The Respondent notes that these cases also demonstrate that the key question is \"which *party* is unsuccessful, not which arguments are unsuccessful\"36 and that \"it is this *overall* result that the Tribunal must take as a starting point.\"37\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 13.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 13.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 14 (emphasis by the Respondent).\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent notes that certain factors in the present case reinforce the application of the loser pays principle.38 First, the Respondent points out that the Tribunal found that the initiation of the arbitration constituted an abuse of rights.39 The Respondent submits that \"[t]ribunals commonly enter costs awards against claimants that pursue abusive claims\" and that such approach is \"appropriate for obvious reasons of fairness.\"40 Second, the Respondent notes that Australia's arguments that were dismissed by the Tribunal\u2014the Admission Objection and the Timing Objection\u2014were serious and substantial and were \"closely intertwined with the abuse of right objection.\"41 In particular, the Respondent notes that the factual and evidentiary analysis that Australia undertook \"to demonstrate the driving motivation of the restructure\" was used in both of these arguments as well as in its abuse of rights argument.42\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 16.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 17.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 18-21.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 22-25.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 25\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the cases relied upon by the Claimant were decided under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Rules on Arbitration 1976 (\"**1976 Rules**\"), while the relevant rule in the present case is Article 42(1) of the 2010 Rules. The Respondent notes that a significant difference between these sets of Rules is that the 2010 Rules make \"the apportionment of the costs of legal representation and assistance subject to the same allocation principles as all other costs.\"43\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 6.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes the Claimant's \"mixed success\" approach. According to the Respondent, \"[t]he fact that a party may have succeeded on certain discrete issues does not prevent that party from being the 'unsuccessful party' within the meaning of that term in the first sentence of Article 42(1).\" The Respondent asserts that \"it is both legally correct and appropriate to regard PM Asia as the 'unsuccessful party'\" in the light of the Tribunal's finding that it is precluded from exercising jurisdiction.44\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 11.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees that the loser pays principle in Article 42(1) is readily reversible.45 Rather, \"there must be real and substantial reasons to depart from the principle.\"46 This approach, according to the Respondent, \"gives full effect to the plain meaning of Article 42(1) and is consistent with the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* for the 1976 Rules, which first included the 'loser pays' principle.\"47\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 13.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 12.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 12-19, referring to D Caron and L Caplan, The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary (With an Integrated and Comparative Discussion of the 2010 and 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules) (Oxford University Press, 2nd ed, 2013), p. 866 (**Exhibit RLA-372**); Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its eight session (Geneva, 1-7 April 1975) (A/10017) at A/31/17, Annex II, para. 222; as quoted in Binder UNCITRAL Commentary, para. 42-006 (**Exhibit RLA-383**).\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that \"tribunals have been reluctant to depart from the 'loser pays' approach\"48 even where the applicable rules of procedure did not require the application of that principle. The Respondent refers, in this regard, to the awards in *Mr. Kristian Almas and Mr. Geir Almas v. The Republic of Poland* and *Philip Morris Brands SARL, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Uruguay*.49\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 43.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 44-45.\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that in any event, \"the reasons advanced by PM Asia do not provide a compelling basis such as to displace the 'loser pays' principle.\" First, \"mixed success\" is not a significant factor in this case; rather the factor that should carry \"far greater weight\" is the Tribunals' finding on abuse of rights.\n\n51.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that acting in a professional and efficient manner is \"not in itself a reason to overturn the 'loser pays' principle.\"50 The Respondent refers to *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States,* where the tribunal noted that it \"does not find [professional and efficient conduct] a decisive factor for awarding costs in deviation of the general principle.\"51 The Respondent also submits that, in any case, PM Asia's approach to bifurcation \"cannot be described as efficient\" and has put the Tribunal and Australia to \"more effort and expense than was necessary.\"52\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 28.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 43, referring *to* *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States* (NAFTA Award, 26 January 2006), para. 218 (**Exhibit RLA-062**).\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 30.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, even if the Tribunal were to take the above-mentioned factors into account, \"other factors would lead the Tribunal to award Australia its claimed costs.\"53 In particular, the Tribunal's abuse of right finding, according to the Respondent, \"means that the arbitration should never have been commenced.\" Furthermore, the Respondent submits that PM Asia \"failed to acknowledge that many of the facts relating to Australia's jurisdictional objections were intertwined,\" while \"the control argument\u2014which PM Asia raised and on which Australia ultimately prevailed\u2014was the only freestanding jurisdictional point.\"54\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 33.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 34-40.\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that PM Asia \"does not refer to a single case involving a finding of abuse of right.\"55 According to the Respondent, a \"substantial body of cases\", including recent awards in *Green Energy, LLC and Transglobal Green Panama S.A. v. Panama* and *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v. Republic of Peru*, \"establish that the abusive nature of a proceeding is a factor that carries very significant weight in the allocation of costs.\"56\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 42.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 42-43, referring to *Green Energy, LLC* *and Transglobal Green Panama S.A. v. Panama* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/28, Award, 2 June 2016) (**Exhibit RLA-377**); and *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v. Republic of Peru* ((ICSID Case No. ARB/11/17, Award, 9 January 2015) (**Exhibit CLA-284**).\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant instead \"seeks to rely on irrelevant cases.\" First, according to the Respondent, PM Asia's submission referred to four cases \"as examples of tribunals reversing or 'rejecting' the 'loser pays' principle,\" however each of them was decided under the 1976 Rules, each went to the merits phase and each turned on \"circumstances that are quite different from those in the present case.\"57 Similarly, *Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic,* cited by PM Asia in support of its position that \"the mixed success of the parties should guide the Tribunal's decision on apportionment of costs,\" concerned only the apportionment of costs for legal representation. However, this case was determined under the 1976 Rules, which did not extend the loser pays principle to this category of costs.58\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 48.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 49.\n\n55.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cites irrelevant cases to support its statement that \"tribunals 'routinely' apportion costs based on wins and losses on discrete arguments.\"59 None of the cases cited by the Claimant in that respect \"involved a finding of abuse of right; none are examples of a claim being dismissed in its entirety at the jurisdictional phase; and all but *Guaracachi* were determined under the 1976 Rules.\" The Respondent further emphasizes that *Occidental* and *Les Laborotoires* \"contain only cursory analysis in relation to costs.\" The Tribunal should instead rely on such cases \"that have rigorously and carefully examined Article 42(1),\" which, according to the Respondent, support Australia's position.60\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 50-51, referring to O *ccidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador* (LCIA Case No. UN3467, Final Award, 1 July 2004) (**Exhibit CLA-049**), *Les Laboratoires Servie, S.A.S., Biofarma, S.A.S., Arts et Techniques du Progres S.A.S. v. Republic of Poland* (UNCITRAL, Award (Redacted), 14 February 2012) (**Exhibit CLA-254**), *Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia* ((PCA Case No. 2011-17, Award, 13 January 2014) (**Exhibit CLA-255**), *Hesham T. M. Al Warraq v. Republic of Indonesia* (UNCITRAL, Final Award, 15 December 2014) (**Exhibit CLA-289**).\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 51.\n\n56.\n\nFinally, the Respondent refers to *Romak* and *Merrill & Ring*, cited by the Claimant in support of the proposition that professional and efficient conduct of the parties provides a basis upon which to apportion costs evenly. The Respondent submits that these cases did not contain substantive discussion of the loser pays principle and did not involve the key factors present in the current arbitration. Moreover, in both cases, the professional and efficient conduct of the parties was \"just one of a number of factors that featured in the tribunals' analyses.\"61\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, paras 52-53.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nAs the Parties agree, Article 42(1) of the 2010 Rules is applicable. Article 42(1) provides:\n\nThe costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this provision of the 2010 Rules differs from the respective provision in the original 1976 Rules (not applicable in the present case) in so far as the 2010 Rules make the apportionment of the costs of legal representation and assistance subject to the same allocation principles as all other costs. For the present procedure, therefore, the disputed issue of the costs of legal representation has indeed to be decided on the basis of the above cited Article 42(1).\n\n59.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, this wording establishes a clear relationship between its two sentences: The first sentence, by the words \"in principle\", establishes a presumption that the unsuccessful party shall bear the costs. However, the wording of the second sentence of Article 42(1) makes it equally clear, by using the word \"may\", that the Tribunal has discretion to depart from this result if it finds that the circumstances of the case at hand make another result more \"reasonable\".\n\n60.\n\nRegarding the first sentence, the Parties dispute who is to be considered the \"unsuccessful party\". The Tribunal does not agree with the Claimant that, if each of the Parties \"prevailed on two, and lost on two, of the key issues before the Tribunal,\" it is not \"correct or appropriate to label one party the 'winner' and one party the 'loser'.\" While these considerations may be taken into account as \"circumstances\" under the second sentence of the provision, the Tribunal understands the \"unsuccessful party\" to be the one whose requests for final relief sought in the arbitration have been dismissed. In the present case, since the Tribunal has declared the Claimant's claims inadmissible, this is the Claimant. The Tribunal considers that the particular grounds on which the Claimant's claim failed reinforce this conclusion. The Tribunal has found that the commencement of the arbitration constituted an abuse of right. While a finding of abuse of right does not imply any bad faith on the part of a claimant (as explained in the Tribunal's Partial Award), a respondent State that faces an abuse of right should, in principle, not be burdened with the costs of defending itself against such a claim.\n\n61.\n\nRegarding the Tribunal's discretion in the application of the second sentence, it is a long tradition in the relevant jurisprudence in international investment law to consider, as relevant \"circumstances\", whether the unsuccessful party has prevailed regarding major disputed issues and whether the efforts expended on these issues have made up a considerable part of the work of the parties and of the Tribunal during the procedure.62\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3467, UNCITRAL, Final Award, July 1, 2004, para. 216 (**Exhibit CLA-049**); *Les Laboratoires Servier, S.A.S., Biofarma, S.A.S., Arts et Techniques du Progres S.A.S. v. Republic of Poland*, UNCITRAL, Award (Redacted), February 14, 2012, paras 669-672 (**Exhibit CLA-254**); *Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2011-17, UNCITRAL, Award, January 31, 2014, para. 620 (**Exhibit CLA-255**); *see also International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States,* UNCITRAL, Award 26 January 2006, para. 220\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no reason to depart from this approach in the present case.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Claimant's contention that each of the Parties \"prevailed on two, and lost on two, of the key issues before the Tribunal\" and that \"in broad terms, Claimant prevailed in arguing that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over the dispute, while Respondent prevailed in its admissibility objection.\" Indeed, the Claimant prevailed on the Admission Objection and the Timing Objection. The Respondent prevailed on the procedural issue of bifurcation and on the Abuse Objection. Moreover, the Claimant argued unsuccessfully that it had already exercised \"control\" within the meaning of the Treaty before the restructuring had occurred.\n\n64.\n\nFor its consideration of which apportionment is reasonable according to the second sentence of Article 42(1), the Tribunal notes at the outset that all four of the issues identified above, as well as the additional question of the Claimant's exercise of control before the restructuring, were heavily disputed points, which were discussed in detail in the written submissions of the Parties and further explored at the hearing on bifurcation and the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility. Ample documentary and expert evidence was adduced in respect of each of the Objections.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no reason to question the professional efficiency of the Parties' counsel at any stage of the proceedings. While many questions of procedure and substance were hard-fought in the present arbitration\u2014perhaps more than in many other investment cases\u2014counsel engaged with the factual record and the legal aspects of the case in a thorough and overall effective manner. The significant efforts made by counsel for both sides, including a number of procedural motions, were, in the Tribunal's view, commensurate with the exceptional economic and political significance of the case. This also applies to the Parties' extensive document requests. The Tribunal further notes the helpful cooperation of counsel for both sides in respect of a number of logistical questions that arose in the course of the proceedings. Hence, the Tribunal concludes that the procedural conduct of the Parties should not sway the allocation of costs in either direction; it does not constitute a circumstance in the present proceedings that leads the Tribunal to consider that \"apportionment is reasonable\" within the sense of the second sentence of Article 42(1).\n\n66.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal also notes that the Parties' dispute regarding the desirability of bifurcation of the proceedings led to a separate hearing and thereby to additional work and costs. The Tribunal recalls that the Respondent had requested an opportunity to address the Tribunal on this issue in the context of a hearing, while the Claimant had regarded a written procedure as sufficient. While it is rather unusual in investment arbitration to hold in-person hearings on procedural questions, such an approach may be helpful in some cases. The Tribunal was persuaded in the present proceedings that a hearing on bifurcation would be appropriate, and the Respondent ultimately prevailed with its request to order the bifurcation of (most of) its preliminary objections. Hence, the Tribunal does not consider that any adverse cost consequences should arise for the Respondent.\n\n67.\n\nHaving determined that the conduct of the Parties or their counsel in the context of the proceedings should not affect the allocation of costs, the Tribunal must consider whether the fact that the Claimant prevailed on the Admission Objection and on the Timing Objection warrants a departure from the principle that the Claimant, as the overall unsuccessful Party, should bear the costs in their entirety.\n\n68.\n\nIn this regard, a distinction must be drawn between the two Objections. The evidence as well as some of the legal arguments relevant to the Timing Objection were closely related to the Parties' submissions in respect of the Abuse Objection (on which the Respondent prevailed). Accordingly, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Parties were required to expend significant resources in presenting their arguments on the Timing Objection in addition to what was in any event required to address the Abuse Objection. The Tribunal would add that, in the present circumstances, the Tribunal does not regard the Claimant's success in respect of the Timing Objection as more significant than the Respondent's success in respect of the Abuse Objection, as the Claimant seems to suggest. In the event of a finding of abuse of rights, there is no room for diminishing the significance of such finding on the ground that it affects the admissibility of a claim rather than the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n69.\n\nThe matter lies differently in respect of the Admission Objection. That objection was based on a distinct body of evidence and raised distinct legal questions under both international law and Australian law, which did not arise in the analysis of any of the other Objections. In particular, the Tribunal recalls that it was presented with a substantial body of expert evidence regarding complex\u2014and in many respects unprecedented\u2014questions of Australian administrative law. Discussion of these questions accounted for a substantial proportion of the time spent at the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility, and the Tribunal expended considerable effort in analysing the substance of the Objection in appropriate depth. While the Tribunal regards Australia's Admission Objection as serious (rather than, as the Claimant suggest, spurious), the fact remains that the Respondent has not prevailed with its view. Had the Respondent not raised the Admission Objection, the Tribunal could have reached its conclusion that the claim is inadmissible more expeditiously and at more limited costs to the Parties. This conclusion must weigh in the Claimant's favour when it comes to the allocation of costs. The Tribunal accordingly takes the view that \"apportionment is reasonable\" in respect of some of the costs incurred, pursuant to the second sentence of Article 42(1).\n\n70.\n\nExercising its discretion pursuant to the second sentence of Article 42(1), taking into account all of the above aspects, the Tribunal considers it reasonable that the Claimant should bear [REDACTED] % of the costs of the Respondent. Since, as mentioned above, the new version of the 2010 Rules makes the costs of legal representation and assistance subject to the same allocation principles as all other costs, this decision applies to the costs mentioned in Article 40(2) under subsections (a) to (f). Therefore, the Claimants shall bear [REDACTED] % of the Respondent's costs mentioned in Article 40(2), subsections (a) to (f), in so far as these are found to be reasonable by the Tribunal.\n\n71.\n\nIn the next section of this Award, the Tribunal will deal with the quantum of the costs claimed by the Respondent.\n\n**V. AMOUNTS OF COSTS CLAIMED**\n-------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant does not claim any of the costs incurred in this arbitration. The Respondent claims a total of [REDACTED] in costs. The Parties differ in respect of the reasonableness of the amounts claimed by the Respondent. The Claimant submits that the Respondent's cost claim is excessive, whereas the Respondent contends that its claim \"is reasonable in light of the circumstances of the case.\"63\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 28.\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimant does not request an order from the Tribunal that the Respondent pay any of its costs. Accordingly, it refrains from providing any figures detailing the costs that it has incurred in connection with the present arbitration.\n\n74.\n\nCommenting on the Respondent's costs claim, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's costs claim is unreasonable for a \"legal team that consisted primarily of public servants.\"64 By way of comparison, the Claimant states that Canada and the United States, which have created specific Government divisions to represent the State in investment proceedings, \"have never claimed [REDACTED] as much in costs and fees as Respondent claims in this arbitration.\"65 In particular, Canada has never claimed more than US$4.5 million in costs and fees and the United States has never claimed more than US$3 million.66\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 33.\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 32.\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 32.\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that, even excluding the fees of four outside counsel, the Respondent's government lawyers claim over [REDACTED] in fees, even though Australia itself pays them \"very modest government salaries.\"67\n\nClaimant's Second Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 33.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S REQUEST**\n-------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent refers to Article 40(2) of the 2010 Rules, applicable in the present arbitration, which reads as follows:\n\nThe term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\nThe Respondent notes that it \"seeks reimbursement for its claimed costs falling into each of the above-listed categories.\"68\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 56-57.\n\n77.\n\nFirst, the Respondent seeks reimbursement of the amount of [REDACTED] which it has deposited towards the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.69\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 58.\n\n78.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that the expenses of its expert witness, Mr. Gyles Q.C., and its fact witnesses, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Swan, amounted to [REDACTED].70\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 59.\n\n79.\n\nThird, the Respondent claims [REDACTED] in legal and other costs incurred by Australia. The legal expenses of Australia consist of (i) the legal fees for services rendered by Australia's counsel team, (ii) the legal fees for services rendered by the Australian Government Solicitor (\"**AGS**\"), and (iii) the costs of certain legal services provided by the Office of International Law (\"**OIL**\").71\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 62.\n\n80.\n\nIn relation to the first category, the Respondent explains that Australia's legal team was led by Australia's Solicitor-General (Mr. Stephen Gageler S.C. between July 2011 and August 2012, followed by Mr. Justin Gleeson S.C. since November 2012); the costs for the services of the Solicitor-General are recoverable at a rate of AU$5,000 per day, as is provided for in general guidance notes issued by the Solicitor-General's department.72 Australia also retained four external counsel specializing in international law (Mr. Samuel Wordsworth Q.C. and Professor Chester Brown) and domestic law and evidentiary issues (Mr. Tony Payne S.C. and Mr. James Hutton). Counsel were briefed at \"Commonwealth rates\", which, according to the Respondent, are lower than their usual commercial rates.73\n\nAttorney-General's Department - Office of Legal Services Coordination, \"Guidance Note 11 - Briefing the Solicitor-General\" (July 2015), para. 32 (**Exhibit R-1411**).\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 64-67.\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent submits that AGS does not receive any government funding and was retained by Australia \"to appear as solicitor on the record in this arbitration and provide a range of legal services.\"74 In this regard, the Chief Solicitor in charge of the present file, Mr. Simon Daley P.S.M., explains in a witness statement that up until 1 July 2015 AGS was a statutory corporation \"operating on a commercial and competitive basis to provide a full range of legal and related services.\" Since 1 July 2015 AGS ceased to be a statutory corporation and was consolidated into the Attorney-General's Department, but \"continues to operate on a commercial and competitive basis in the marketplace.\"75\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 68\n\nDaley Statement (**Exhibit RWS-018**), paras 3-4.\n\n82.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, AGS \"was responsible for the day-to-day conduct of the arbitration.\" In particular, AGS focused on developing Australia's evidence and arguments for the preliminary objection phase and was also required to \"investigate and develop a range of merits-related subject matter for inclusion in Australia's Amended Statement of Defence.\"76 AGS was involved in document production tasks; in particular, a separate team was retained to address PM Asia's requests relating to the FIRB files.77\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 70-71.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 72-73.\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent explains that AGS charges on a fee-for-service basis, and AGS lawyers bill in 6-minute units and \"provide detailed bills describing the work carried out and the time and cost of the work.\"78 According to the Respondent, the fees of AGS are reasonable. From October 2014 to May 2015, the rates for the AGS core team were capped at 6 hours per day. In addition, junior lawyers and paralegals were used throughout the arbitration to reduce costs.79 Further, it was AGS's practice \"to review time records before rendering invoices on the Department of Health and to write down or write off any charges that AGS did not consider should be passed on.\"80 The invoices were reviewed once again for the purposes of preparing the costs claim, and a range of costs was excluded to \"ensure that only work directly incurred in relation to the arbitration has been included.\"81\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 74.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 76.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 77.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 78.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Australia retained a team of international lawyers from OIL within the Office of International Law in the Attorney-General's Department (\"**AGD**\") and that \"OIL's core function is to provide legal advice and other services to the Australian Government on matters of international law.\"82 According to the Respondent, OIL \"established a taskforce comprising of two teams of full-time lawyers.\" The first team provided advice on international law issues, while the second team was responsible \"for coordinating the litigation across a large number of Australian Government departments that provided information, documents and evidence in the arbitration.\" This taskforce was active from June 2011.83 The Respondent only seeks to recover the costs of the OIL team that provided international law services.84\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 81.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 81-84.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, para. 87.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent notes that OIL's costs were billed on a salary basis, even though it would have been open to OIL to charge on an hourly basis. In the Respondent's view, it is the established practice in investment arbitration \"to estimate the time spent working on the arbitration and then multiply the cost of each individual's salary and benefits for a given year by that estimate.\"85\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 85-86.\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent claims [REDACTED] for expenses incurred by Australia for twelve expert witnesses, who submitted eleven reports in response to sixteen reports submitted by expert witnesses for PM Asia.86\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 89-92.\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent claims [REDACTED] in travel costs, which include travel costs incurred by Australia for counsel, other lawyers and expert witnesses to travel for the purposes of arbitration. The Respondent notes that these travel costs are reasonable as, first, a minimum number of representatives attended each hearing, and, second, all international travel expenses incurred were consistent with the Australian Government's Best Fare of the Day policy. Domestic travels were similarly booked in line with the Australian Government's domestic travel policy which requires use of the \"lowest practical fare\".87\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 92-99.\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent claims [REDACTED] for other arbitration expenses \"incurred to assist Australian lawyers as part of Australia's defence in the arbitration.\" These expenses include the creation and maintenance of a Ringtail document management system, \"conference room hire during oral hearing phases, delivery and courier fees, photocopying and printing, library loans and other research expenses, corporate records and other database searches and reports and translation services.\"88\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 100-104.\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to award interest on the total sum of Australia's legal and other costs \"calculated from the date of the final award on costs until the date of payment in full.\" The Respondent asks that the interest be calculated at the rate of 1.50% (corresponding to the Australian cash rate as set by the Reserve Bank of Australia as applicable at the date of Australia's Submission on Costs).89\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 107-108.\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Australia's cost claim \"is reasonable in light of the circumstances of the case.\" Australia has undertaken a \"principled and cautious approach\", having notably deducted (i) fees paid to consulting experts who did not prepare reports for filing in this arbitration and of legal advisors who played a minor role in the proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by AGD \"which were not attributable to OIL's core role of providing advice and assistance on international law\"; and (iii) costs of counsel, the Australian Government Solicitor and OIL incurred prior to the service of the Notice of Arbitration.90\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 29-37.\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that PM Asia's strong opposition to bifurcation required Australia \"to prepare an extensive memorial and substantial supporting evidence to defend PM Asia's claim on its merits.\"91\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 39-42.\n\n92.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that Australia had to undertake a \"significant amount of work\" to respond to the PM Asia's claims as well as its defence to Australia's jurisdictional objections, noting that these claims and defences were \"particularly broad and complex and shifted over time.\"92\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 43-49.\n\n93.\n\nFinally, the Respondent emphasizes that Philip Morris sought to challenge a public health measure that is of a critical importance to Australia, and it was therefore necessary for the Respondent to \"mount a robust and comprehensive response to all aspects of the claim.\"93 The Respondent also notes that Australia's cost claim represents less than [REDACTED] of the total amount of damages claimed by Philip Morris, while in *Philip Morris Brands SARL, Philip Morris* *Products S. S. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Uruguay,* the Government of Uruguay claimed costs in an amount of approximately 46% of the damages claimed by Philip Monis.94\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 50-54.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016. para. 53.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Parties agree that Article 40(2) of the 2010 Rules, is applicable in the present case, which reads as follows:\n\nThe tenu \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators:\n\n(e) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable:\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal fixes the costs of the arbitration referred to under subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f) in the present case as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *Arbitrator fees* (EUR) Professor Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel *Fees:* Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler *Fees:* Professor Donald McRae *Fees (exclusive of VAT):* *VAT:* | [REDACTED] |  |\n| *Registry fees of the PCA* (EUR) | [REDACTED] |  |\n| *Expenses* (EUR) Arbitrator expenses: General expenses (court reporting, audio-visual technology, catering, courier and other expenses): | [REDACTED] |  |\n| TOTAL COSTS (EUR) | [REDACTED] |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TOTAL DEPOSIT (EUR)** | [REDACTED] \\* **\\*** reflect ing equal contributions from the Parties |\n| **REMAINING DEPOSIT (EUR)** | [REDACTED] |\n\n96.\n\nThe Parties disagree how subsection (e) should be applied in the present case, given that: \"*[t]he legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration\"* form part of the costs of arbitration, which the Tribunal may allocate between the Parties, only *\"to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable.\"* In light of its decision on cost allocation reached above, the Tribunal has only to consider the Respondent's costs. As summarized above, the Claimant considers that a number of the costs claimed by the Respondent are not \"*reasonable*\" as required by this subsection.\n\n97.\n\nFor its examination regarding the question whether and to what extent the costs claimed by the Respondent can be considered \"reasonable\", the Tribunal may take into account the jurisprudence in comparable cases, particularly in cases in which governments claimed their costs, as well as, more importantly, the specifics of the case at hand.\n\n98.\n\nThe table of comparison provided by the Claimant to the costs claimed by other governments only relates to NAFTA cases. While, indeed, these amounts are considerably smaller than those claimed by the present Respondent, they do not show the volume of work and the numbers of hours spent in those cases. Without further research, for which the Parties have not supplied sufficient information, the Tribunal is confident in its presumption that the present case has been one in which the volume of work and time involved in the presentation of the Parties' cases considerably exceeded what is usual in NAFTA and other investment arbitrations.\n\n99.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that both Parties presented voluminous Memorials, not only on bifurcation and jurisdiction, but also, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 7, full first Memorials on the merits, analysing in detail whether the Plain Packaging Measures were consistent with the substantive provisions of the Treaty. These Memorials were accompanied by a substantial body of evidence, including several expert opinions on questions of public health. While the Claimant's claims were in the end rejected as inadmissible, it is evident that the Parties' costs reflect the considerable work already performed in respect of the merits. The Tribunal also recalls that the present proceedings were, at various junctures, more complex than is the norm in investor-State arbitration. For instance, the Parties submitted several detailed briefs on key procedural questions (such as the place of arbitration and confidentiality) after the first procedural hearing and presented their views on bifurcation in the context of an in-person hearing.\n\n100.\n\nAs the Claimant mentions, in NAFTA cases, Canada and the United States rely on their own legal teams to represent them. However, while this may be considered appropriate because the NAFTA system is a repetitively used system of dispute resolution for these States, the present dispute proceeds under the Treaty between Australia and Hong Kong, under which Australia had never been a respondent and for which it had no pre-existing in-house expertise through a pre-constituted legal team familiar with the dispute settlement method and the issues involved. The Tribunal, therefore, considers it justified that the Respondent hired outside counsel to help its own legal team in this procedure. The fees and costs claimed for these outside counsel do not go beyond what is usual in other investment cases and are thus deemed reasonable by this Tribunal.\n\n101.\n\nThe costs and fees claimed by the Respondent for its own legal team have been explained in detail in paragraphs 62 to 88 and the Annexure to Australia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016. The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant's criticism with respect to the fact that these fees exceed what it describes as \"modest government salaries\".95 It is normal and justified practice in investment and other arbitrations that not only the salaries are claimed, but also considerably higher amounts in view of high overhead costs. The rates for the various members of its own legal team as explained by the Respondent appear reasonable to the Tribunal. Taking into account the complexity of issues of domestic and international law relevant in this procedure, particularly for a government team usually not engaged in such disputes, the Tribunal does not consider that any of these costs claimed by the Respondent were unreasonable and should not have been incurred. In making this assessment, the Tribunal also takes into consideration the significant stakes involved in this dispute in respect of Australia's economic, legal and political framework, and in particular the relevance of the outcome in respect of Australia's policies in matters of public health.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 16 September 2016, para. 33.\n\n102.\n\nThe same is true for the costs claimed by the Respondent for witnesses and experts96 as well as travel and other expenses claimed and explained in Australia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016. In this context, the Tribunal recalls that the Parties, under the procedure adopted, filed full submissions on the merits, together with all their evidence, including expert reports and witness statements.\n\nThis does not, however, include the witness expenses of Mr. Gyles QC, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Swan in an amount of [REDACTED] which were incurred solely in relation to the Respondent's Admission Objection and shall not be subject to reimbursement.\n\n103.\n\nIn conclusion therefore, the Tribunal finds that the amounts claimed by the Respondent for its legal representation in a total of [REDACTED] are reasonable.\n\n104.\n\nThe arbitration costs have to be added to this amount in application of subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f) of Article 40(2) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules which were found above to be [REDACTED].\n\n**VI. CONCLUSION**\n------------------\n\n105.\n\nApplying the Tribunal's conclusion at the end of Section IV above that the Claimant must bear [REDACTED] % of the Respondent's cost claim insofar as found reasonable, this leads to the conclusion that the Claimant has to reimburse the Respondent:\n\n\u2022 [REDACTED] % of the Respondent's share of the arbitration costs according to subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f), which the Respondent paid into the deposit of the PCA: ;\n\n\u2022 [REDACTED] % of the Respondent's costs according to subsections (d) and (e):.\n\n**VII. INTEREST**\n-----------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent has claimed interest from the date of the Final Award on the costs it is awarded to be reimbursed.97 In principle, this claim has not been objected to by the Claimant. Indeed, the jurisprudence relied on by the Respondent in this context affirms that such a claim can be raised, and the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from this approach.\n\nAustralia's Submission on Costs dated 2 September 2016, paras 107-108.\n\n107.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal accepts Respondent's suggestion that the interest shall be calculated on a simple basis using the Australian cash rate as set by the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the rate of 1.50%, to accrue from the date of this Final Award.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n108.\n\n**For the reasons set out above in this Award, the Tribunal decides, declares, and awards as follows:**\n\n**I. The Claimant shall pay to the Respondent the amount of** **[REDACTED]**  **in** **application of subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f) of Article 40(2) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules.**\n\n**II. The Claimant shall pay to the Respondent the amount of** **[REDACTED]**  **in** **application of subsections (d) and (e) of Article 40(2) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules.**\n\n**III. As from the date of this Award, the Claimant shall pay to the Respondent interest on the above amounts calculated on a simple basis using the Australian cash rate as set by the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the rate of 1.50%.**\n\n**IV. All other remaining claims are dismissed.**\n\n**V. The Registry is requested to return to the Parties in equal shares any remaining amounts on deposit.**"}]}
