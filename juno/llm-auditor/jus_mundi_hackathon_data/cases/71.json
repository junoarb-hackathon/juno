In the latter event the investor has the choice between either of the following:\n\n(a) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) provided for by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965; and\n\n(b) an ad-hoc arbitral tribunal which, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties to the dispute, shall be established under the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n(3) Each Party hereby gives its unconditional and irrevocable consent to the submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration in accordance with paragraph 2 above, except for disputes with regard to Article 10 paragraph 2 of this Agreement.\n\n(4) Once the investor has referred the dispute to either a national tribunal or any of the international arbitration mechanisms provided for in paragraph 2 above, the choice of the procedure shall be final.\n\n(5) An investor may not submit a dispute for resolution according to this Article if more than five years have elapsed from the date the investor first acquired or should have acquired knowledge of the events giving rise to the dispute.\n\n(6) The Party which is party to the dispute shall at no time whatsoever during the process assert as a defence its immunity or the fact that the investor has received, by virtue of an insurance contract, a compensation covering the whole or part of the incurred damage.\n\n(7) Neither Party shall pursue through diplomatic channels a dispute submitted to international arbitration unless the other Party does not abide by and comply with the arbitral award.\n\n(8) The arbitral award shall be final and binding for the parties to the dispute and shall be executed without delay according to the law of the Party concerned.\"\n\nDoc. C-6.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThis proceeding has been riddled with procedural incidents. In order to present a proper account of the history of this arbitration the Tribunal will first present a chronology of the procedure (1.) and will then recount in detail the main procedural incidents (2.).\n\n**(1) Chronology of the Procedure**\n-----------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 4 March 2016, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. against the Republic of Colombia, together with Exhibits C-1 through C-66 [\"**Request**\"].\n\n10.\n\nOn 16 March 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Art. 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n11.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Art. 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n12.\n\nOn 4 May 2016, Claimants appointed Mr. Oscar M. Garibaldi, a national of the United States of America as well as a national of the Argentine Republic, as arbitrator in this case. Mr. Garibaldi accepted his appointment on 6 May 2016.\n\n13.\n\nOn 3 June 2016, Respondent appointed Mr. Christopher Thomas, a national of Canada, as arbitrator in this case. Mr. Thomas accepted his appointment on 7 June 2016.\n\n14.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the Parties appointed Prof. Juan Fernandez-Armesto, a national of the Kingdom of Spain, as President of the Tribunal. Prof. Fernandez-Armesto accepted his appointment on 3 August 2016.\n\n15.\n\nOn 4 August 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings [\"**Arbitration Rules**\"], notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session and preliminary procedural consultation with the Parties by teleconference [\"**First Session**\"].\n\n17.\n\nOn 4 November 2016, following the First Session, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decisions of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C., and that Mrs. Krystle M. Baptista would act as Assistant to the Tribunal. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out three procedural calendars envisaging three different scenarios for the written phase.\n\n18.\n\nOn 16 December 2016, Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits, together with:\n\n- Witness Statements of:  \no Mr. Gary Nagle  \no Mr. Mark McManus  \n- Expert Report of Compass Lexecon  \n- Exhibits C-67 through C-184  \n- Legal Authorities CL-1 through CL-95\n\n19.\n\nThe submission was transmitted to Respondent and the Tribunal on 2 January 2017, in accordance with paragraph 15.2 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n20.\n\nOn 2 February 2017, Respondent filed its Request for Bifurcation, together with Exhibits R-1 through R-25, and Legal Authorities RL-1 through RL-34.\n\n21.\n\nOn 2 March 2017, Claimants filed their Response to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, together with Exhibits C-185 through C-194, and Legal Authorities CL-96 through CL-127.\n\n22.\n\nOn 3 April 2017, the Tribunal issued its decision on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation. The Tribunal decided not to bifurcate the proceedings, and to address the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent together with the merits, following the procedural calendar established as Scenario 3 in Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n23.\n\nOn 17 July 2017, Respondent filed its Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility and Counter-Memorial, together with:\n\n- Witness Statements of:  \no Mr. Oscar Paredes  \no Ms. Soraya Vargas  \n- Expert Report of Messrs. Frank Graves and John Dean of the Brattle Group, together with Exhibits BR-1 through BR-124  \n- Exhibits R-26 through R-203  \n- Legal Authorities RL-35 through RL-114\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 26 July 2017, Claimants noted that 41 of the exhibits accompanying Respondent's Counter-Memorial were private and internal email chains exchanged internally between Claimants' management and their in-house and external counsel [\"**Disputed Documents**\"]. Claimants requested *inter alia* that the Tribunal order Colombia to provide information regarding the time and manner in which these documents had been obtained, as well as a full log of Prodeco's private communications, documents and data in possession of Colombia, its internal and external counsel, and its witnesses and experts, indicating the chain of custody as well as the dates of access. Claimants further requested an order \"declaring inadmissible all documents irregularly obtained or produced by Colombia in breach of its duty of good faith and rules of privilege, and an order striking out any statements in Colombia's Counter-Memorial and/or witness statements and expert report that rely on such documents.\"\n\n25.\n\nOn 3 August 2017, Respondent submitted its response, together with Exhibits R-204 through R-214, and Legal Authorities RL-115 through RL-120. Respondent(i) explained that the Disputed Documents had been legally obtained by the *Superintendencia de Industria y Comercio* [\"**SIC**\"] in the context of a preliminary investigation into unfair practices by Prodeco and its affiliates and (ii) requested that the Tribunal declare the Disputed Documents admissible.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of 22 August 2017, Claimants' submitted their reply to Respondent's letter, together with Exhibits C-195 through C-228, and slightly amended their request for relief [\"**Claimants' First Application**\"]. On 11 September 2017, Respondent filed a rejoinder letter, reiterating its initial request.\n\n27.\n\nOn 20 September 2017, Claimants submitted a new letter [\"**Claimants' Second Application**\"] addressing the following issues:\n\n- the filing on 11 September 2017 of a criminal complaint by the *Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado* [\"**ANDJE**\"] with the office of the *Fiscal\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n* requesting *inter alia* de deposition of two of Claimants' employees;\n\n- the apparent leaking of the Disputed Documents to the Colombian press; and Colombia's intention to seek orders from the Tribunal for the production of communications between Prodeco and its former external counsel as well as an order compelling the latter to appear as a witness at the hearing.\n\nPending the Tribunal's consideration of their first application, in Claimants' Second Application, they requested an urgent measure to protect the *status quo*.\n\n28.\n\nOn 2 October 2017, Respondent submitted its response to Claimants' Second Application, together with Exhibits R-214 through R-230, and Legal Authorities RL-121 through RL-143, requesting that the Tribunal reject it.\n\n29.\n\nOn 26 September 2017, following exchanges between the Parties, the Centre transmitted the Parties' respective requests for production of documents. On 11 October 2017, the Tribunal postponed its decision on the disputed document production requests, pending the full review and deliberations on Claimants' applications.\n\n30.\n\nOn 4 November 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, deciding *inter alia* that the Disputed Documents should be excluded from the record of this arbitration, directing Respondent to re-submit its Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility and Counter-Memorial without attaching or referring to the Disputed Documents, giving the Parties an opportunity to file new requests for document production that would supersede and replace the original requests still pending before the Tribunal, and proposing a new procedural calendar. The new procedural calendar was agreed to by the Parties on 10 November 2017.\n\n31.\n\nBy letter of 14 November 2017, Respondent filed observations on Procedural Order No. 2, together with Exhibits R-231 through R-235, and Legal Authorities RL-145 through RL-147. The Tribunal invited Claimants to comment on Respondent's letter in their Reply Memorial.\n\n32.\n\nOn 16 November 2017, Respondent filed its Amended Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with:\n\n- Amended Witness Statement of Mr. Oscar Paredes  \n- Amended Expert Report of Messrs. Frank Graves and John Dean of the Brattle Group, together with Amended Exhibit BR-118  \n- New Exhibits R-236 and R-237\n\n33.\n\nIn accordance with the revised procedural calendar, on 14 December 2017, the Parties submitted their respective requests for production of documents for decision by the Tribunal, including the corresponding responses and replies thereto.\n\n34.\n\nOn 4 January 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning its decision on the Parties' request for production of documents in their respective Redfern Schedules. On 11 January 2018, following a request by Claimants and Respondent's comments, the Tribunal granted Claimants an extension of time to submit the documents subject to a production order under Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n35.\n\nOn 30 January 2018, Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits, together with:\n\n- Second Witness Statements of:  \no Mr. Gary Nagle  \no Mr. Mark McManus  \n- Second Expert Report of Compass Lexecon  \n- Exhibits C-229 through C-294, and resubmitted Exhibits C-50, C-56, and C-103  \n- Legal Authorities CL-127.1 through CL-149\n\n36.\n\nOn 23 February 2018, Respondent submitted a letter, together with Exhibits R-238 through R-240, asking the Tribunal *inter alia* :\n\n- to order Claimants to produce unredacted copies of the documents that had been produced in redacted form,\n\n- to produce the documents included in the privilege log submitted by Claimants with redactions only in the documents exchanged with external counsel in the relevant portions where legal advice had been sought or given,\n\n- to complete their production of documents in accordance with Procedural Order No. 3 and to confirm as much.\n\n37.\n\nOn 2 March 2018, Claimants submitted their response to Respondent's letter, in which they requested that the Tribunal dismiss Respondent's request of 23 February 2018, and confirmed that they had produced and/or logged all the documents in their possession, custody or control responsive to the Tribunal's orders and that they would produce any other documents that might subsequently come into their possession, custody or control.\n\n38.\n\nOn 6 March 2018, the Tribunal replied to the Parties' communications of 23 February and 2 March 2018, stating that the challenge to the relevant documents had to be done on a document-by-document basis and that the Tribunal could not entertain Colombia's general request for relief. In order to solve this incident in the most efficient manner, the Tribunal suggested that the Parties confer and try to reach an agreement on any disputed document. If an agreement could not be reached, the Tribunal would resolve any requests on a document-by-document basis.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter of 9 March 2018, Respondent submitted comments on the Tribunal's decision and requested the Tribunal's instructions to gather and marshal into the record evidence collected from the SIC by the General Prosecutor in the context of a domestic criminal investigation into the illegalities surrounding the Eighth Amendment. By letter of 12 March 2018, Claimants submitted observations on the Respondent's letter, and asked the Tribunal to decline Respondent's proposed procedure to address its request.\n\n40.\n\nOn 17 March 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties instructing Respondent on the steps to follow in order to gather the evidence collected by the General Prosecutor and marshal it into the record, and recommending that the Parties try to reach an agreement on the marshalling of all or a part of the documents before any application was presented to the Tribunal.\n\n41.\n\nOn 26 March 2018, following communications from the Parties, the Tribunal notified them of its decision to grant a 4-day extension to Respondent to submit its Reply on Preliminary Objections and Rejoinder on the Merits, and stated that Claimants would also be granted a 4-day extension of their deadline to present their Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections.\n\n42.\n\nBy letter of 27 March 2018, Respondent informed the Tribunal of the Parties' inability to reach an agreement with regard to the production of the unredacted documents and privilege log documents and, according to the Tribunal's communications of 6 and 17 March 2018, requested that the Tribunal order Claimants to produce the documents included in its document-by-document request, sent to Claimants on 12 March 2018.\n\n43.\n\nOn 2 April 2018, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction, together with:\n\n- Second Witness Statements of:  \no Mr. Oscar Paredes  \no Ms. Soraya Vargas  \n- Second Expert Report of Messrs. Frank Graves of The Brattle Group, John Dean of JD Energy and Landy Stinnet of FGM Consulting Group, Inc., together with Exhibits BR-125 through BR-190  \n- Exhibits R-241 through R-348  \n- Legal Authorities RL-148 through RL-186\n\n44.\n\nBy letter of 3 April 2018, Claimants submitted their observations on Respondent's letter of 27 March 2018 asking the Tribunal to reject Respondent's request.\n\n45.\n\nBy letter of 20 April 2018, Claimants requested the Tribunal's intervention regarding a notice that Prodeco had received from the National Mining Agency [\"**ANM**\"] stating that a commission composed of Colombia's international external counsel in this arbitration, Colombia's economic experts, Colombia's internal counsel for this arbitration (ANDJE) and several ANM officers would visit the Calenturitas mine between 30 April and 2 May 2018. Claimants alleged that the visit had no *bona fide* regulatory purpose but was rather aimed at gathering additional information for this arbitration, and requested that the Tribunal order Colombia to refrain from imposing a unilateral site visit for the purposes of this arbitration and to refrain from visiting the mine site without the Tribunal's authorization.\n\n46.\n\nOn 24 April 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the production of the redacted documents and the privilege log documents initially requested by Respondent in its communication of 23 February 2018. The Tribunal determined *inter alia* that while Claimants had not strictly complied with the Tribunal's instructions in Procedural Order No. 2 concerning privilege-based objections, this departure from the established procedure had not caused Respondent irreparable harm. As a consequence, the Tribunal decided not to dismiss Claimants' objections based on privilege *in limine*. As to the merits of the objections, the Tribunal found that legal privilege extends not only to outside counsel, but also to in-house lawyers and found no evidence suggesting that Claimants had waived legal or, to the extent relevant, settlement privilege. The Tribunal also directed Claimants' lead counsel to submit an affidavit confirming that each of the relevant documents met all of the privilege requirements identified by the Tribunal in the order and to produce all the relevant documents that did not. In light of the proximity of the hearing, the Tribunal also took the opportunity to call a number of persons to testify as witnesses at the hearing.\n\n47.\n\nOn 25 April 2018, Respondent submitted its comments on Claimants' letter regarding the site visit and requested that the Tribunal reject Claimants' allegations and not to intervene in any way in relation to the visit planned to the Calenturitas mine.\n\n48.\n\nOn 27 April 2018, the Tribunal issued its decision regarding the site visit. The Tribunal found no reason to deny the visit, so long as the precise dates were properly agreed between the Parties in order to facilitate Respondent's access and minimize the inconvenience to Claimants.\n\n49.\n\nOn 30 April 2018, and further to the Tribunal having called certain persons to testify as witnesses at the hearing [\"**Tribunal Witnesses**\"] in Procedural Order No. 4, the Parties submitted an agreed proposal concerning those witnesses.\n\n50.\n\nOn 30 April 2018, Claimants' lead counsel submitted a certification and affidavit in accordance with Procedural Order No. 4 and produced, in unredacted form, the documents that did not meet the privilege requirements established by the Tribunal in the order. On 1 May 2018, the Parties agreed that Mr. Blackaby's affidavit of 30 April 2018 should be submitted to the Tribunal without its annexes, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n51.\n\nOn 4 May 2018, Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, together with:\n\n- Third Witness Statement of Mr. Gary Nagle  \n- Exhibits C-295 through C-327, and resubmitted Exhibits C-90 and C-260  \n- Legal Authority CL-150\n\n52.\n\nOn 9 and 10 May 2018, respectively, the Parties confirmed the witnesses and experts that they wished to cross-examine at the hearing.\n\n53.\n\nOn 11 May 2018, Claimants sought leave to include a technical report as a new document into the record.\n\n54.\n\nOn 11 May 2018, Respondent requested that the documents that had been gathered from the *Fiscal\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n* [\"**FGN**\"] and filtered by Mr. Camilo Enciso in accordance with the Tribunal's directions be admitted into the record [\"**FGN Documents**\"]. Respondent further referred to a list of documents in Annex A to said communication [\"**Annex A Documents**\"] as responsive to Colombia's document production requests and not protected by either legal or settlement privilege, and asked that the Tribunal review these documents, order Claimants to produce them and admit them into the record. In the alternative, Respondent indicated that it would not object to the Tribunal appointing a conflicts counsel to analyse said documents.\n\n55.\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Claimants filed its response to Respondent's 11 May request and asked the Tribunal to deny the application to admit the FGN Documents as they did not amount to evidence garnered by the Colombian criminal courts and/or because Colombia had failed to demonstrate their relevance and materiality to the outcome of the dispute. Claimants further requested that the Tribunal reject Colombia's request to admit the Annex A Documents as they were not responsive to its document requests or were subject to legal or settlement privilege.\n\n56.\n\nOn 15 May 2018, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal elaborating on its 11 May request concerning the FGN Documents and Annex A Documents and requesting that the Tribunal reject Claimants' 11 May application to include a new document into the record. Claimants responded to this communication on 18 May 2018. On the same day, Respondent submitted the memorandum sent to Mr. Enciso on 5 April 2018 in connection with the FGN Documents as well as Colombia's communication to Mr. Enciso of 3 May 2018.\n\n57.\n\nOn 14 May 2018, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n58.\n\nOn 17 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 concerning the organization of the hearing.\n\n59.\n\nOn 18 May 2018, the Tribunal notified the Parties regarding its decision not to admit into the record any of the documents requested by the Parties and indicated that a full decision would follow. In particular, the Tribunal declined to admit the following documents: (i) the technical report identified by Claimants in their email of 11 May 2018; (ii) the FGN Documents; and (iii) the Annex A Documents.\n\n60.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held in Washington, D.C. from 28 May to 2 June 2018 [the \"**Hearing**\"].

The Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreements concerning post-hearing briefs and costs submissions on 26 June 2018. In the same communication, the Parties further agreed that \"the Award may be issued only in English, provided that an official Spanish translation is delivered to the parties a few months later.\"\n\n63.\n\nOn 31 July 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 containing its full decision and reasoning on the admissibility of (i) the technical report identified by Claimants in their email of 11 May 2018; (ii) the FGN Documents and (iii) the Annex A Documents, as advanced in the Tribunal's communication to the Parties of 18 May 2018.\n\n64.\n\nOn 8 August 2018, the Parties filed a single round of simultaneous post-hearing briefs together with their respective Legal Authorities RL-187 through RL-236 and CL-151 through CL-173.\n\n65.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal's confirmation of its costs instructions, the Parties submitted a new agreement on the parameters of the costs submissions on 18 and 19 September 2018, and filed their respective costs submissions on 24 September 2018.\n\n66.\n\nOn 7 March 2019, the Tribunal asked Claimants to provide further information in the interest of completeness and indicated when Respondent should file any comments it might have to the data provided by Claimants. Claimants filed the requested information on 14 March 2019.\n\n67.\n\nFurther to the Parties' agreement of 26 June 2018 concerning, *inter alia*, the language of the Award and to the Parties' respective communications of 16 July 2019 noting their diverging interpretations thereof, on 30 July 2019, the Tribunal decided that the Parties' agreement of 26 June 2018 had superseded the relevant provision in Procedural Order No. 1, such that the Award would be rendered in English only and the Tribunal would request that the Centre prepare and deliver to the Parties an official Spanish translation. The Tribunal clarified that \"[f]or all intents and purposes under the ICSID Convention and Rules, the date of dispatch of the certified copies of the Award in English shall be the date when the Award is deemed to have been rendered.\" On 15 August 2019, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**(2) Certain Procedural Incidents**\n------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe following sections of the award summarize and provide context to certain procedural incidents:\n\n- PO No. 2 (2.1);  \n- PO No. 3 (2.2);  \n- PO No. 4 (2.3);  \n- PO No. 6 (2.4).\n\n**(2.1) PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 2**\n--------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nIn order to understand the context of PO No. 2, the Tribunal will first recount the procedural and factual history that led to its issuance (A.), will then briefly summarize the decision (B.) and will explain its consequences (C.). The Tribunal will add a final section on the Parties' comments to PO No. 2 (D.).\n\n**A. The Road to PO No. 2**\n---------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe road to PO No. 2 began with Respondent's request for an extension of the deadline for filing its Counter-Memorial. Respondent's Counter-Memorial was scheduled to be filed not later than 3 July 2017.\n\n71.\n\nOn 7 June 2017, Respondent requested a one-month extension of the time limit to submit the Counter-Memorial on account of:\n\n- an administrative reorganization of Colombia's State Attorney Office (ANDJE), and\n\n- health issues affecting counsel for Colombia.\n\n72.\n\nAfter hearing Claimants, on 12 June 2017 the Arbitral Tribunal granted Respondent a two-week extension to file its Counter-Memorial.\n\n73.\n\nOne day thereafter, on 13 June 2017, Colombia's Antitrust Agency (SIC), the administrative agency that enforces antitrust law in Colombia3 and ANDJE, the public agency in charge of the legal defense of the State and its agencies, signed an agreement to exchange information [the \"**Cooperation Agreement**\"]:4\n\n*\"**PRIMERA. - OBJETO DEL CONVENIO:** Aunar esfuerzos t\u00e9cnicos, administrativos y de apoyo log\u00edstico entre la Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado y la Superintendencia de Industria y Comercio para contribuir de manera eficaz y oportuna en el intercambio de informaci\u00f3n relacionada con la defensa jur\u00eddica de Colombia, de conformidad con las competencias de cada entidad*\"*.* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-216, Art. 6.\n\nDoc. R-221.\n\n74.\n\nIn compliance with the Cooperation Agreement, at some unspecified date in June or July 2017 the SIC delivered to ANDJE certain documents it had seized from Prodeco three years earlier, in August 2014. At that time the SIC had raided Prodeco's premises in the context of a preliminary antitrust investigation relating to Puerto Nuevo. Using its regulatory powers, the SIC seized certain documents5 and downloaded in bulk all the emails lodged in the computers of certain Prodeco managers [the \"**Seized Emails**\"].\n\nDoc. R-205, pp. 2-3.\n\n75.\n\nAfter delivery of the Seized Emails, ANDJE and/or counsel to the Republic reviewed such documents, and identified certain documents unrelated to antitrust matters, but allegedly relevant to the adjudication of the present dispute.\n\nSubmission of Respondent's Counter-Memorial\n-------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nOn 17 July 2017, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial. Included amongst the attached exhibits were some of the Seized Emails.\n\n77.\n\nTen days thereafter, on 26 July 2017, Claimants filed a submission in which they averred that 41 of the exhibits were private and internal email chains exchanged internally between Claimants' management and their in-house and external counsel [previously defined as the \"**Disputed Documents**\"]. In that submission, Claimants requested *inter alia* that the Tribunal:\n\n- Order Colombia to provide:  \no information regarding the time and manner in which these documents had been obtained,  \no a full log of Prodeco's private communications, documents and data in possession of Colombia, its internal and external counsel, and its witnesses and experts, indicating the chain of custody as well as the dates of access.\n\n- Issue an order declaring inadmissible all documents irregularly obtained or produced by Colombia in breach of its duty of good faith and rules of privilege, and striking out any statements in Colombia's Counter-Memorial and/or witness statements and expert reports that rely on such documents.\n\n78.\n\nOn 3 August 2017, Respondent submitted its response. Respondent explained that the Disputed Documents had been legally obtained by SIC in the context of a preliminary investigation into unfair practices by Prodeco and its affiliates and requested that the Tribunal declare the Disputed Documents admissible.\n\n79.\n\nBy letter of 22 August 2017, Claimants submitted their reply to Respondent's response and slightly amended their request for relief [previously defined as \"**Claimants' First Application**\"].\n\nCriminal Complaint\n------------------\n\n80.\n\nOn Sunday, 10 September 2017, ANDJE filed a criminal complaint with the office of the *Fiscal\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n*, based on the Disputed Documents [the \"**Criminal Complaint**\"].\n\n81.\n\nThe Criminal Complaint, which was registered by the *Fiscal\u00eda* the following day, reported that certain named persons related to the execution of the Eighth Amendment may have committed the following crimes:\n\n- bribery,\n\n- conclusion of a contract lacking legal requirements,\n\n- conspiracy to commit a crime, and\n\n- undue interest of a public servant in the conclusion of contracts.6\n\nAnnex A to Claimants' Second Application, 20 September 2017, pp. 23-24.\n\n82.\n\nThe Criminal Complaint included a request that the *Fiscal* depose (*inter alia*):\n\n- Mr. Nagle, Prodeco's CEO from 2008 to 2013, and Claimants' witness in this arbitration, and\n\n- Ms. Anaya, one of Claimants' in-house counsel.\n\n**B. The Decisions in PO No. 2**\n--------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nOn 4 November 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, in which it made the following decisions:\n\n84.\n\nFirst, that the Disputed Documents should be excluded from the record of this arbitration.7 Consequently, the Tribunal directed Respondent to re-submit its Counter-Memorial without attaching or referring to the Disputed Documents.8\n\nPO No. 2, para. 70.\n\nPO No. 2, para. 109.\n\n85.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal gave the Parties the opportunity to file new requests for document production that would supersede and replace the original requests still pending before the Tribunal.9\n\nPO No. 2, para. 113.\n\n86.\n\nThird, as regards the filing of the Criminal Complaint by ANDJE, the Tribunal refused to take any actions, but:\n\n- Clarified that decisions adopted by Colombian criminal courts, which could potentially have an impact on the present procedure, could be freely marshalled by the Parties, subject to the rule established in para. 17(3) of Procedural Order No. 1;10\n\n- On the issue of marshalling of criminal evidence, the Tribunal found that it had not been sufficiently briefed but, as a precautionary measure, instructed the Parties to ask permission from the Tribunal before submitting any evidence gathered in a criminal procedure in Colombia;11 and\n\n- Instructed Colombia to implement appropriate measures to guarantee that Colombia's counsel in this arbitration (including ANDJE's officials) did not have access to confidential attorney communications emanating from the criminal investigations.12\n\nPO No. 2, para. 89.\n\nPO No. 2, para. 89.\n\nPO No. 2, para. 92.\n\n87.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal proposed a new procedural calendar, which was agreed by the Parties on 10 November 2017.\n\nThe Tribunal's Rationale for Excluding the Disputed Documents\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal decided the incident based on international law, and only turned to municipal law to confirm its findings.13 This is consistent with the Parties' arguments,14 the BIT and the ICSID Convention.15\n\nPO No. 2, para. 52.\n\nPO No. 2, para. 50.\n\nPO No. 2, para. 51.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith and the principle of equality of arms precluded Respondent from coercing evidence from Claimants through its administrative powers, and to marshal it thereafter in an investment arbitration.16 The Tribunal made reference to the general imbalance between claimants, which are normally private companies, and respondent States and explained that if States were allowed to use their wide powers to coerce evidence from claimants, it would create a perverse incentive: States would initiate all types of administrative proceedings against potential claimants in order to improve their litigation positions.17\n\nPO No. 2, paras. 66-70.\n\nPO No. 2, para. 69.\n\n90.\n\nUnder Colombian law, the Tribunal confirmed that SIC was authorized to seize the Disputed Documents for the sole purpose of an antitrust/unfair competition investigation - but not for any other purpose, including the use of the Disputed Documents as evidence in these proceedings. The Tribunal found that SIC had failed to prove that the delivery of the Disputed Documents to ANDJE was done for the sole purpose for which they had been obtained: to ensure compliance with antitrust or unfair competition law:18 by handing over the Disputed Documents to ANDJE, even if in compliance with the Cooperation Agreement, the SIC could have incurred in an administrative irregularity known as *desviaci\u00f3n de poder.*19\n\nPO No. 2, paras. 70-73.\n\nPO No. 2, paras. 73-74.\n\n**C. The Consequences of PO No. 2**\n-----------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nPO No. 2 had two major consequences for the procedure.\n\n92.\n\nThe first consequence was that on 16 November 2017, Respondent filed its Amended Counter-Memorial, eliminating all references to the Disputed Documents. It also resubmitted all its evidence and eliminated the Disputed Documents from the record.\n\n93.\n\nThe second consequence of PO No. 2 was that the Parties were provided with a new opportunity to obtain and submit evidence through a new document production process. In particular, Respondent was allowed to request that Claimants deliver the Disputed Documents in a context which preserved the equality of arms.\n\n94.\n\nThe Parties exercised this right extensively: Respondent made 39 requests for production of documents and Claimants seven.\n\n**D. Parties' Observations on PO No. 2**\n----------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nBy letter of 14 November 2017, Respondent made observations on PO No. 2 and submitted that the Tribunal was:\n\n- Exceeding its powers;20\n\n- Failing to state the reasons for its decisions;21\n\n- Seriously departing from a fundamental rule of procedure, by infringing Colombia's due process rights.22\n\nRespondent's letter of 14 November 2017, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's letter of 14 November 2017, p. 3.\n\nRespondent's letter of 14 November 2017, p. 3.\n\n96.\n\nClaimants answered Respondent's letter in their Reply Memorial. Claimants disagreed with Respondent's allegations and submitted the following main arguments:\n\n- First, that in issuing PO No. 2 the Tribunal acted fully within its powers under Arts. 44 and 46 of the ICSID Convention and 19 and 34(1) of the Rules to protect the integrity of the proceedings;23\n\n- Second, that even if the Tribunal's decision was flawed as a matter of Colombian law (*quod non*), Respondent did not and could not argue that the Tribunal's reasoning based on the international principles of fairness and equality of arms was erroneous;24\n\n- Finally, that the exclusion of documents obtained in violation of international law by Colombia could not violate the rights of the party which had acted unlawfully; and, in any case, PO No. 2 provided Respondent with the means to obtain and present evidence in accordance with international law through the document production exercise.25\n\nC II, para. 363.\n\nC II, paras. 364-367.\n\nC II, paras. 368-370.\n\n**(2.2) PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 3**\n--------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nIn PO No. 3, the Arbitral Tribunal decided on the Parties' contested document production requests.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal analysed each of the requests:26\n\n- The Tribunal first analysed whether each request complied with the ordinary requirements of:  \no identification of each document or description of a narrow and specific category of documents;  \no relevance and materiality; and  \no not in possession of the requesting party;\n\n- The Tribunal then reviewed whether each request was affected by one of the following objections, if raised by the Parties:  \no legal or settlement privilege;  \no production results in unreasonable burden;  \no loss or destruction;  \no technical or commercial confidentiality;  \no political or institutional sensitivity;  \no production would affect the fairness and equality of the procedure.\n\nPO No. 2, paras. 110-138.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal accepted (wholly or partially)27 23 out of Respondent's 39 requests and four out of Claimants' seven requests.\n\nPO No. 3, Annex B.\n\n**(2.3) PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 4**\n--------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nPO No. 4 was prompted by Respondent's failure to obtain through document production all of the Disputed Documents. The Tribunal will first explain the road that led to the decision (A.), will briefly summarize it (B.), and finally explain its consequences (C.).\n\n**A. The Road to PO No. 4**\n---------------------------\n\n101.\n\nA few days after the issuance of PO No. 3, which ruled on the Parties' document production requests, Claimants requested that the Tribunal extend the deadline for production of documents responsive to Colombia's requests. The Tribunal granted the extension, ordering that delivery be performed as the documents became available and, in any case, no later than 5 February 2018.\n\n102.\n\nOn 5 February 2018, Claimants produced to Respondent:\n\n- 366 documents, comprising more than 1GB of information in response to Colombia's document requests; and\n\n- a letter accompanied by a privilege log [the \"**Privilege Log**\"], identifying documents responsive to Respondent's requests which were subject to legal or settlement privilege [\"**Privilege Log Documents**\"], as well as\n\n- redacted documents [\"**Redacted Documents**\"],\n\n- [the Privilege Log Documents and the Redacted Documents will be jointly referred to as the \"**Privileged Documents**\"].\n\n103.\n\nOn 23 February 2018, Respondent requested [\"**Respondent's Privilege Log Request**\"] that the Tribunal order Claimants to produce the Privileged Documents in the following terms:\n\n\"To order Claimants to produce, within 48 hours, un-redacted copies of the Redacted Documents;\n\nTo order Claimants to produce, within 48 hours, the Privilege Log Documents, redacting only in those documents exchanged with external counsel the relevant portions where legal advice was sought or given;\n\nShould any of the Documents be available in a native format (such as.msg for email communications), to order production in such format;\n\nTo complete their production of documents in accordance with Procedural Order No. 3 and to confirm that they have completed production of all documents responsive to Colombia's requests; and\n\nTo order Claimants to reimburse Colombia for the costs and expenses incurred because of this incident (as quantified when this incident is resolved).\"\n\n104.\n\nOn 2 March 2018, Claimants answered Respondent's Privilege Log Request:\n\n- explaining that they had produced 366 documents, comprising more than 1GB of information in response to Colombia's document requests, and\n\n- confirming that they had \"produced and/or logged all documents responsive to the Tribunal's orders in Claimant's possession, custody and control\".28\n\nClaimants requested that the Tribunal dismiss Respondent's Privilege Log Request.29\n\nClaimants' letter dated 2 March 2018, p. 2.\n\nClaimants' letter dated 2 March 2018, p. 12.\n\n105.\n\nOn 6 March 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal provided guidance as to how to proceed:\n\n\"[...] The challenge to any Redacted Document or to any Privilege Log Documents must be done on a document-by-document basis. Thus, the Tribunal cannot entertain Colombia's general Request for Relief either for all the Redacted Documents or for all the Privilege Log Documents.\n\nIn order to solve this incident in the quickest and most efficient way possible, the Tribunal suggests that the Parties confer and try to reach an agreement on any disputed document. If, having made the appropriate good faith efforts to find a solution, it cannot be reached, the Tribunal will gladly solve any requests on a document-by-document basis. [...].\"\n\n106.\n\nOn 9 March 2018, Respondent submitted a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal noting that at least two of Colombia's arguments in its communication of 2 March 2018 did not require the Tribunal to rule on a \"document-by-document basis\". In particular, according to Colombia, a decision on a document-by-document basis was not required in order to rule that:\n\n- Claimants openly disregarded the Tribunal's directions in PO No. 2, and\n\n- Documents sent or received by in-house counsel are not privileged.\n\n107.\n\nColombia reserved all of its rights.30 It stated that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it undertook to comply with the Tribunal's directions and confer, in good faith, with Claimants in regard to their Privilege Log. Nevertheless, on the basis that it was likely that it would not obtain the Privileged Documents before the submission of its Rejoinder, Colombia reserved its rights to submit the evidence as soon as it came into its possession, custody or control.31\n\nColombia's letter of 9 March 2018, p. 1.\n\nColombia's letter of 9 March 2018, p. 4.\n\n108.\n\nClaimants presented a letter on 12 March 2018 *inter alia* denouncing:\n\n- Respondent's new attempt to reintroduce in the record the Disputed Documents through Respondent's Privilege Log Request;\n\n- Respondent's mischaracterization of the Tribunal's email of 6 March 2018.\n\n109.\n\nIn its communication of 17 March 2018, the Tribunal thanked the Parties for their efforts in trying to reach an agreement and clarified that it had not taken any decision with regard to the admissibility of the Privileged Documents:\n\n\"The Arbitral Tribunal appreciates the Parties' good faith efforts to reach an agreement on the production of the Documents (as defined in Respondent's letter dated March 9, 2018). Should the Parties prove unable to reach an agreement with regard to the production of some (or the totality) of such Documents, the Tribunal repeats its willingness to adjudicate the issue on a document-by-document basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal reiterates that it has not taken any decision with regard to the admissibility of such Documents.\"\n\n110.\n\nAfter approximately two weeks, on 27 March 2018, Respondent presented a new letter to the Tribunal explaining the steps taken to comply with the Tribunal's guidance. Colombia requested that the Tribunal order Claimants to produce the Privileged Documents without delay, and in any event, by 2 April 2018.32\n\nColombia's letter of 27 March 2018, p. 2.\n\n111.\n\nOn 2 April 2018, Claimants responded, arguing that Colombia's comments simply reiterated the same two allegations already set forth in its letter of 23 February 2018, namely that:\n\n- Claimants' assertions of privilege were belated, and\n\n- Privilege does not attach to communications sent or received by Prodeco's in-house counsel.\n\n**B. The Decision in PO No. 4**\n-------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nOn 24 April 2018, the Tribunal issued PO No. 4.\n\n113.\n\nThere were three main issues before the Tribunal:\n\n- Whether Claimants had failed to follow the appropriate proceedings for filing their Privilege Log;\n\n- Whether the attorney-client privilege extended to in-house counsel; and\n\n- Whether Claimants properly asserted settlement privilege over the Privileged Documents.\n\n114.\n\nTo decide such issues, the Arbitral Tribunal applied international law and, alternatively municipal law, as pleaded by the Parties.33\n\nPO No. 4, paras. 37-41.\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal adopted the following decisions:\n\n116.\n\nFirst, it decided that while Claimants had not strictly complied with the Tribunal's instructions in PO No. 2 concerning privilege-based objections, this departure from the established procedure had not caused Respondent irreparable harm.34 The Tribunal found that Respondent had been given ample opportunity to contest Claimants' objections by submitting comments on Claimants' Privilege Log, which the Tribunal had analysed in order to reach its decision.35 As a consequence, the Tribunal decided not to dismiss *in limine* Claimants' objections based on privilege.36\n\nPO No. 4, paras. 42-46.\n\nPO No. 4, para. 46.\n\nPO No. 4, para. 47.\n\n117.\n\nSecond, as to the merits of the objections, the Tribunal found that legal privilege extended not only to communications with outside counsel, but also to communications with in-house lawyers and found no evidence suggesting that Claimants had waived legal or, to the extent relevant, settlement privilege.37\n\nPO No. 4, paras. 48-76 and 92-94.\n\n118.\n\nThird, the Tribunal directed Claimants' lead counsel (i) to submit an affidavit confirming that each of the Privileged Documents met all of the privilege requirements identified by the Tribunal and (ii) immediately to produce all the relevant documents that did not.38\n\nPO No. 4, para. 95.\n\n**C. The Consequences of PO No. 4**\n-----------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nOn 30 April 2018, Claimants' lead counsel submitted an affidavit declaring that:\n\n- He had reviewed all of the documents over which Claimants had asserted privilege, as identified in the Privilege Log;\n\n- He confirmed that all of the documents over which Claimants had asserted privilege fulfilled the requirements provided for in para. 54 of PO No. 4, except for two;\n\n- He attached the two documents that did not comply with the requirements.\n\n120.\n\nSumming up, Claimants delivered to Respondent all documents identified in Respondent's requests, except for certain documents which met the requirements for claiming privilege as set forth in para. 54 of PO No. 4. Compliance with these requirements was proven by an affidavit signed, under his personal responsibility, by Claimants' lead counsel.\n\n**(2.4) PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 6**\n--------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nRespondent made further attempts to marshal certain Disputed Documents and certain Seized Emails attached to the Criminal Complaint.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal will first explain the road that led to PO No. 6 (A.), will briefly summarize it (B.), and finally explain its consequences (C.).\n\n**A. The Road to PO No. 6**\n---------------------------\n\n123.\n\nIn PO No. 4, the Arbitral Tribunal established a cut-off date for introducing further evidence or filing further submissions in this proceeding:\n\n\"98. After May 11, 2018 no new submissions and no additional evidence shall be admitted into the file, except as provided in the following paragraph.\n\n99. If in exceptional circumstances and for unexpected reasons any of the Parties considers that it is of paramount importance that an exception to the rule be made, it shall file a motion, asking for authorization, stating the grounds therefor, and without attaching the new submission or evidence. After hearing the other Party the Tribunal will decide. Any submission made or evidence marshalled in breach of this provision will be disregarded.\"\n\n124.\n\nOn 11 May 2018, Claimants requested that a new document be introduced in the record: NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Jerritt Canyon Mine prepared for Queenstake Resources Ltd., dated 20 April 2007 [the \"**Report**\"].\n\n125.\n\nOn the same day, Respondent presented a letter requesting that the following documents be included in the file:\n\n- Two sets of documents specified in Annex A of the letter: (i) Documents which Colombia claimed to be responsive to its requests for production ordered in PO No. 3 and (ii) Documents which Colombia alleged do not meet the cumulative requirements set forth in PO No. 4 for legal privilege, and are not protected by settlement privilege [the \"**Annex A Documents**\"]39; both sets of documents (i) and (ii) were part of the documents excluded by PO No. 2, *i*. *e*. the Disputed Documents;\n\n- Certain documents [the \"**FGN Documents**\"], specified in Annex C of the letter, which had been gathered by the *Fiscal\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n* (and filtered by Mr. Camilo Enciso, Colombia's designated special counsel, in accordance with the Tribunal's directions).\n\nThe Parties referred to these documents as the Disputed Documents, however, both Parties agreed that all of the documents comprised within such category had been excluded by the Tribunal in PO No. 2 (Letter from Colombia to the Tribunal of May 11, 2018, p. 1; Letter from Claimants to the Tribunal of 14 May 2018, p. 1).\n\n126.\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Claimants submitted a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal requesting that the Tribunal reject Respondent's request, and in the alternative order Colombia to provide Claimants with copies of the FGN Documents for Claimants properly to comment on Respondent's request.\n\n127.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal and the Parties held the pre-hearing conference call, in which Respondent agreed to provide Claimants with the FGN Documents. The Tribunal and the Parties further agreed that:\n\n- Respondent would submit its comments on Claimants' request by 15 May 2018;  \n- Claimants would submit their comments on Respondent's request to include the FGN Documents by 17 May 2018;  \n- Given the time sensitive nature of the Parties' requests, the Tribunal would issue\n\na decision by Friday, 18 May, and communicate the full decision and reasoning to the Parties afterwards.\n\n128.\n\nHence, on 15 May 2018, Respondent submitted a letter [\"**Respondent's FGN Request**\"]:\n\n- Reiterating its request of 11 May 2018; and  \n- Requesting that the Tribunal dismiss Claimants' request.\n\n129.\n\nOn 17 May 2018, Claimants submitted a letter to the Tribunal requesting that the Tribunal reject Respondent's FGN Request.\n\n**B. The Decision in PO No. 6**\n-------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal deliberated and decided to reject the Parties' applications to introduce further documents into the file. This decision was communicated by letter dated 18 May 2018:\n\n\"The Arbitral Tribunal has decided not to admit into the record any of the documents requested by the Parties for the following reasons:\n\n1. Claimants' petition to admit the technical report identified in its email of May 11, 2018 is belated since Claimants were the last to file a main submission.\n\n2. Respondent's petition to admit the FGN Documents: the FGN Documents did not make it into the record through Document Production and are not part of a formal *acusaci\u00f3n* in a Colombian criminal court proceeding. Thus, the Tribunal sees no reason to admit them into the record.\n\n3. Respondent's petition to admit Annex A Documents: there are two types of documents that Respondent wishes the Tribunal to admit into the record:\n\na. documents that Claimants' counsel has confirmed are subject to privilege and\n\nb. documents which - according to Claimants' counsel - are not responsive to the Tribunal's decisions in PO3.\n\nIt falls within the responsibility of Claimants' counsel to determine which documents are responsive to Respondent's petitions (as narrowed down by the Tribunal) and which are subject to privilege. The Tribunal has no reason to second guess these decisions.\n\nA full decision will follow in the next days\".\n\n131.\n\nOn 31 July 2018, the Tribunal issued PO No. 6 containing its full decision and reasoning.\n\n**C. The Consequences of PO No. 6**\n-----------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nIn PO No. 6, the Arbitral Tribunal directed the Parties to make allegations if they wished the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences based on the counterparty's decisions regarding responsiveness and privilege of ordered documents.\n\n133.\n\nIn its Rejoinder,40 Respondent asked the Arbitral Tribunal to draw adverse inferences from Claimants' failure to produce responsive evidence. In particular, Respondent requested that the Tribunal draw eight specific adverse inferences from Claimants' conduct. To the extent that such requests are relevant, the Tribunal will address them in later sections of this Award.\n\nR II, paras. 983-1002. The request was reiterated in the RPHB, paras. 163-177.\n\n134.\n\nIn the course of the Hearing, Respondent made one further request to marshal certain Disputed Documents into the record. That request led to the filing of Doc. R-100. The procedural incident is analysed in detail in section **V.1.(3.3).C***infra*.\n\n**III. CHRONOLOGY OF FACTS**\n----------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties stems from the execution of the eighth amendment to the Mining Contract [the \"**Eighth Amendment**\"] and the facts that surrounded such execution.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal will start by describing the execution of the Mining Contract and the ensuing period, during which the parties made seven amendments to the Mining Contract **(1)**.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal will then turn to the negotiations that surrounded the Eighth and most relevant amendment to the Mining Contract (**(2)**, **(4)** and **(5)**). The Tribunal will also describe the facts concerning Prodeco's acquisition of a mining concession, which, according to Respondent's version of the facts, served as a bribe for the State's execution of the Eighth Amendment **(3)**.\n\n138.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will examine the events that occurred after the execution of the Eighth Amendment, namely the parties' performance of the Eighth Amendment (**(6)** and **(11)**) and the proceedings which form the basis of Claimants' claims in this arbitration:\n\n- The investigation by the *Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica* [\"***Contralor\u00eda***\"] into whether the Eighth Amendment was detrimental to the Colombian State, which led to a decision holding Prodeco liable for damages to the State's finances [the \"**Fiscal Liability Proceeding**\"] **(7)** ; and\n\n- The claim filed by the mining agency responsible for the Mining Contract before the Colombian administrative courts seeking to have the Eighth Amendment declared null and void [the \"**Procedure for Contractual Annulment**\"] **(8)**.\n\n139.\n\nAfter the failure of amicable consultations, Claimants started the present arbitration against Colombia **(9)**. The Tribunal will also briefly address the criminal complaint filed by Colombia after the start of this arbitration **(10)**.\n\n(1) **The Mining Contract : Execution, Performance and Amendments**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nColombia is one of the world's largest coal producers. As Colombia's second largest export, coal is a major source of revenues and employment for the country.41\n\nNagle I, para. 13. See also HT, Day 1, p. 62, 6-9.\n\n141.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Colombia's Ministry of Mines and Energy granted *Carbones de Colombia, S.A.* [\"**Carbocol**\"], a state-owned company,42 mineral rights over a large area,43 which comprised an open-pit mine of over 6,600 hectares known as Calenturitas,44 located in the municipalities of La Jagua de Ibirico, El Paso, and Becerril45 [the \"**Calenturitas Mine**\" or the \"**Mine**\"].\n\nCarbocol was an *Empresa Industrial y Comercial del Estado*. As Respondent explains, the State agency in charge of coal mining contracts underwent several reorganizations and name changes throughout the years: Carbocol was replaced by the *Empresa Colombiana de Carb\u00f3n, Ltda.*, which was replaced by the *Empresa Nacional Minera Ltda., Minercol Ltda.*, which was replaced by the *Instituto Colombiano de*\n\nDoc. C-2, Clause 2: \"[...] *el \u00c1rea Contratada descrita en la Cl\u00e1usula Tercera de este contrato, la cual hace parte de un \u00e1rea mayor otorgada a CARBOCOL por el Ministerio de Minas y Energ\u00eda, a t\u00edtulo de Aporte, mediante la Resoluci\u00f3n No. 002857 de fecha 10 de octubre de 1977, Aporte No. 871*\".\n\nDoc. C-2, Clauses 2 and 3.\n\nNagle I, para. 14; R I, para. 19.\n\n142.\n\nAt present, the Mine is one of the largest thermal coal mines in Colombia. It is traversed by the Calenturitas River and is divided into four sectors, A to D:46\n\nDoc. R-55. See also Nagle I, paras. 14-15; HT, Day 1, p. 62, l. 10 - p. 63, l. 5.\n\n**A. 1989: Execution of the Mining Contract**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nIn 1988, Colombia adopted Decree 2655 by which it enacted the *C\u00f3digo de Minas* [\"**1988 Mining Code**\"].47 Pursuant to Art. 3 of said Code, and in accordance with Colombia's *Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica*, all non-renewable natural resources belong, inalienably and indefeasibly, to the Colombian Nation; in the exercise of its property right, Colombia may explore and exploit these resources through decentralized agencies, or grant private individuals or entities the right to do so.48\n\n*Geolog\u00eda y Miner\u00eda - Ingeominas.* The latter was eventually liquidated and transformed into the *Servicio Geol\u00f3gico Colombiano* and the *Agencia Nacional de Miner\u00eda* (R I, fn. 15).\n\nDoc. C-1; Doc. R-16.\n\nDoc. C-1, Art. 3: \"***Propiedad de los recursos naturales no renovables.** De conformidad con la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica, todos los recursos naturales no renovables del suelo y del subsuelo pertenecen a la Naci\u00f3n en forma inalienable e imprescriptible. En ejercicio de esa propiedad, podr\u00e1 explorarlos y explotarlos directamente a trav\u00e9s de organismos descentralizados, o conferir a los particulares el derecho de hacerlo, o reservarlos temporalmente por razones de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico, todo de acuerdo con las disposiciones de este C\u00f3digo*\".\n\n144.\n\nIn accordance with Art. 3 of the 1988 Mining Code, the Respondent, through Carbocol, chose to explore and exploit the resources in the Calenturitas area by means of a contract with a private entity. Prodeco, a Colombian mining company incorporated in 1974,49 was chosen for that purpose.\n\nDoc. CLEX-15, p. 9 of the *Estados Financieros* for 2015-2014.\n\n145.\n\nTo this effect, on 21 February 1989, Prodeco and Carbocol executed a contract for the exploration, construction, and exploitation of a coal project in the Calenturitas Mine [defined as the \"**Mining Contract**\"]. 50\n\nDoc. C-2, Clause 1. The Mining Contract is numbered 044/89.\n\n146.\n\nThe Mining Contract was initially entered into for a period of 30 years 51 comprising three stages: exploration, construction, and exploitation of the Calenturitas Mine.\n\nDoc. C-2, Clause 24.\n\n147.\n\nIn the exploration phase, Prodeco had to produce geological and engineering studies, at its own cost and risk, to evaluate the potential of the Calenturitas Mine, and submit a feasibility study for a coal-mining project. 52 Once Carbocol approved this feasibility study, Prodeco could start construction53 and, subsequently, operation of the Mine.54\n\nDoc. C-2, Clauses 5.1, 5.2, and Annex 3.\n\nDoc. C-2, Clauses 5.3, 8 and 9.1.\n\nDoc. C-2, Clause 13.\n\n148.\n\nFrom the beginning of the production phase and until the expiration of the Mining Contract, Prodeco had the right to carry out activities of extraction, processing, transport, and commercialization of the coal from the Mine.55 Prodeco could produce up to three million tonnes [\"**MT**\"] of coal per year [\"**MTA**\"], which would become its exclusive property. Prodeco could dispose of such coal as it deemed fit, subject to the Colombian laws and regulations on the commercialization and transformation of minerals.56\n\nDoc. C-2, Clause 11.\n\nDoc. C-2, Clauses 18 and 19.\n\n149.\n\nAs consideration for the granting of production and commercialization rights, Prodeco had to pay a defined compensation to Carbocol. The terms agreed in 1989 were as follows:\n\n- A 5% base royalty for each tonne of coal sold, which progressively increased up to 7.6% for the fifth year of production and beyond57 [\"**Base Royalty**\"];\n\n- A supplementary compensation58 amounting to a percentage of revenue and a fixed amount per tonne of coal sold, if the price of coal rose above USD 40 per tonne.59 At that time, the price of Colombian thermal coal was approximately USD 25 per tonne;60 if this price rose above USD 40 per tonne, Prodeco would receive extraordinary profits, and would have to pay the supplementary compensation.61\n\nDoc. C-2, Clause 21.1: \"*Regal\u00eda B\u00e1sica*\".\n\nThis suplementary compensation will later become the Gross Income Compensation or GIC. See para. 164 *infra*.\n\nDoc. C-2, Clause 22.1: \"*Regal\u00eda Adicional*\".\n\nDoc. C-183. See also HT, Day 1, p. 21, ll. 11-14.\n\nArt. 84(b) of the 1988 Mining Code provided that the compensation paid by producers could include a share of the producer's extraordinary profits due to rising mineral prices (Doc. C-1, Art. 84(b)).\n\n150.\n\nOther considerations included Prodeco's obligation to contribute to the social-economic development of the region of the Calenturitas Mine62 and to grant Carbocol access to Prodeco's port facilities [\"**Prodeco's Port**\"]63 for the export of coal.64\n\nDoc. C-2, Clause 23.1.\n\nProdeco's Port was located at approximately 200 kilometres north of the Calenturitas Mine, in Santa Marta, on the Atlantic coast of Colombia, and was used to export coal (Nagle I, para. 19). Prodeco originally obtained the Port concession in 1979, for a term lasting until 2013 (Doc. CLEX-15, pp. 10-11 of the *Estados Financieros* for 2012). In 2010 Prodeco began building a new port, which it now operates, known as Puerto Nuevo. Puerto Nuevo's concession belongs to the Sociedad Portuaria Puerto Nuevo S.A., in which Prodeco has a 94.9% share (Doc. CLEX-15, pp. 10-11 of the *Estados Financieros* for 2014; Doc. CLEX-11, p. 17).\n\nDoc. C-2, Clause 23.2.\n\n151.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2007, the parties to the Mining Contract executed seven \"*Otros\u00edes*\", or amendments, to the Mining Contract, which altered the initial basis of this agreement.\n\n**B. 1991-2002: First, Second, Third and Fourth Amendment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst Amendment\n---------------\n\n152.\n\nIn July 1989, Prodeco began to explore the Mine and to work on the preparation of a feasibility study.65\n\nDoc. R-63, p. 1.\n\n153.\n\nTwo years later, in 1991, Prodeco and Carbocol executed the First Amendment to the Mining Contract, which increased the size of the area of the Calenturitas Mine and defined the rules for trial production.66\n\nDoc. C-67.\n\n154.\n\nIn 1992, Carbocol approved the feasibility study prepared by Prodeco. That same year Prodeco started construction at the Mine.67\n\nDoc. R-63, p. 1; RfA, para. 13; Nagle I, para. 18.\n\nSecond Amendment\n----------------\n\n155.\n\nIn 1993, Carbocol became the *Empresa Colombiana de Carb\u00f3n Ltda. - Ecocarb\u00f3n* [\"**Ecocarb\u00f3n**\"]. On 6 December 1995, Ecocarb\u00f3n and Prodeco executed the Second Amendment to the Mining Contract,68 which established new rules regarding Prodeco's right to hire subcontractors.69\n\nDoc. C-70.\n\nDoc. C-70, pp. 1-2.\n\n156.\n\nThe exploitation phase of the Mine officially started in October 1995, but in reality, the mining activities were halted for several years,70 in part because of a lack of sufficient infrastructure to transport coal from the Mine to Prodeco's Port, in part because of low coal prices in the international market.71\n\nDoc. R-63, p. 1; Doc. R-64, p. 2.\n\nDoc. C-5, p. 1, point 2. See also Doc. C-74, p. 18.\n\nThird Amendment\n---------------\n\n157.\n\nIn 1995, Prodeco was acquired by Glencore,72 a multinational commodity trading and mining company.73\n\nDoc. CLEX-11, p. 12. See also RfA, para. 14; C I, para. 28; Nagle I, para. 19; Doc. H-1, p. 39; R I, fn. 16.\n\nC I, para. 22.\n\n158.\n\nThree years later Prodeco submitted to Ecocarb\u00f3n a revised feasibility study, which envisioned a production of 5 MTA, and a new timeline for the project. Ecocarb\u00f3n found that the revised feasibility study did not comply with the terms of the Mining Contract, and gave Prodeco two alternatives: either to comply with the Contract and the already approved feasibility study, or to negotiate a further amendment.74\n\nDoc. R-57.\n\n159.\n\nAccordingly, in 1999, the parties started negotiations,75 which led to the third amendment to the Mining Contract [\"**Third Amendment**\"] 76 being executed two years later, on 6 March 2001. The Third Amendment was signed by the new *Empresa Nacional Minera Ltda., Minercol Ltda.* [\"**Minercol**\"], which in the meantime had succeeded Ecocarb\u00f3n.77\n\nDocs. R-58, R-59, R-60 and R-61.\n\nDoc. C-5.\n\nDoc. C-5, p. 1. Minercol was constituted in December 1998.\n\n160.\n\nImportantly, the Third Amendment:\n\n- Created new obligations for Prodeco regarding the production phase (i), and  \n- Modified the existing compensation regime (ii).\n\n161.\n\n(i) Within a term of six months, Prodeco was required to submit to Minercol's approval a final report on exploration (*Informe Final de Exploraci\u00f3n* [\"**IFE**\"]).78 Following Minercol's approval of the IFE, Prodeco had to prepare and deliver a long-term work and investment plan (*Programa de Trabajos e Inversiones* [\"**PTI**\"]), concerning exploitation of the Mine.79 In addition, Prodeco agreed to submit a PTI for each year of the production phase [\"**Annual PTI**\"]. Each Annual PTI had to follow the exploitation sequence defined in the main PTI and contain a production forecast for the next 10 years.80\n\nDoc. C-5, Clause 7.\n\nDoc. C-5, Clause 8.\n\nDoc. C-5, Clause 8.9.\n\n162.\n\n(ii) The Third Amendment envisaged a production of between \"5 or 6 MTA\" of coal per year.81 This expansion led to changes in the compensation regime.\n\nDoc. C-5, recital 4 and Clause 14.\n\n163.\n\nThe Base Royalty continued to apply, as defined in the original Mining Contract, as long as production did not exceed 3 MTA. Once production exceeded that threshold, a newly defined \"**Additional Royalty**\" became applicable: the royalty rate would increase by 1% for every 1 MTA increase in production. In effect, this implied that after the fifth year of production - which was when the Base Royalty attained 7.6% - if annual production was, for instance, 4, 5, or 6 MTA, Prodeco would pay Royalties at a rate of 8.6%, 9.6%, and 10.6% on the entire price of the coal sold.82 For each 1 MTA of additional coal production, the rate of Royalties would increase by 1%.83\n\nDoc. C-5, Clause 14.\n\nSee Doc. C-5, recital 4.\n\n164.\n\nThe Third Amendment also created a *Compensaci\u00f3n por Ingresos Brutos* (Gross Income Compensation [\"**GIC**\"]), derived from the Supplementary Compensation initially provided for in Clause 22.1 of the Mining Contract. The GIC was an additional compensation, based on a sliding scale according to coal prices, which became applicable if the coal price exceeded USD 40 per tonne.84\n\nDoc. C-5, Clause 15.1. See also C I, para. 32; R I, para. 31.\n\n165.\n\nThus, after the execution of the Third Amendment, Prodeco had to pay three types of compensation depending upon the amount of production of the Mine and the price of coal:\n\n- A Base Royalty of 7.6%, which applied irrespectively of the amount of coal produced;\n\n- An Additional Royalty, when coal production exceeded 3 MTA, calculated applying an increasing percentage scale;\n\n- A GIC, which applied when the price of coal exceeded USD 40 per tonne.\n\n166.\n\nThe Third Amendment also defined the reference price which should be used to calculate the amount of Royalties and GIC, as the higher of:85\n\n- The weighted average free on board [\"**FOB**\"] Colombian port price for the current quarter for coal exported from the Calenturitas Mine, as published in the \"Coal Week International\" magazine; and\n\n- The weighted average FOB Colombian port price for Colombian steam coal exported during the same quarter, proportionally adjusted by calorific value, as published in \"Coal Week International\" magazine.\n\nDoc. C-5, Clauses 14.3 and 15.1.1.\n\nFourth Amendment\n----------------\n\n167.\n\nLater that same year (2001), Prodeco and Minercol executed the Fourth Amendment to the Mining Contract,86 which clarified certain aspects of the Third Amendment, namely:87\n\n- The duration of each of the stages of the Mining Contract;\n\n- The terms for Prodeco's social-economic investments in the Calenturitas region; and\n\n- The start date for the 30-year duration of the Mining Contract, which was set at 3 July 1990.\n\nDoc. C-73.\n\nDoc. C-73, Clause First and Clause Fourth.\n\n**C. 2002-2004: The 2003 PTI and start of production**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nOn 16 December 2002, Minercol approved Prodeco's IFE.88 One year later,89 Prodeco submitted to Minercol a long-term PTI, in which it laid out its plan to produce up to 4 MTA, for a total life-of-mine production of approximately 55 MT of coal [\"**2003 PTI**\"]. According to Prodeco, maximum production was capped by transport restrictions: coal had to be trucked to the Port and Prodeco stated that this was the maximum quantity which could be transported given the poor condition of roads and the limited availability of trucks.90\n\nDoc. C-74, p. 21.\n\nProdeco submitted a first version of the PTI on 9 September 2003 (Doc. R-65) and a revised version in December 2003 (Doc. C-74), at the request of Minercol (Doc. R-66, p. 2).\n\nDoc. C-74, p. 18.\n\n169.\n\nIn January 2004, the Colombian Ministry of Mines and Energy designated the *Instituto Colombiano de Geolog\u00eda y Miner\u00eda, INGEOMINAS* [\"**Ingeominas**\"], an institute created in 1916 for geoscientific research,91 as Minercol's successor, and delegated the functions of mining authority to this agency. 92\n\nParedes I, para. 20. By a Decree of 28 January 2004, the *Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n e Informaci\u00f3n Geocient\u00edfica, Minero Ambiental y Nuclear* was restructured and its name was changed to *Instituto Colombiano de Geolog\u00eda y Miner\u00eda* (Doc. R-10, p. 1).\n\nDoc. R-56.\n\n170.\n\nIt was Ingeominas that on 6 April 2004 approved the 2003 PTI.93\n\nDoc. R-66; Nagle I, para. 24.\n\n171.\n\nIn July 2004, the Calenturitas Mine finally entered into production.94 By the end of that year the Mine had produced 0.6 MT of coal; production increased to 1.5 MTA in the following year, 2005.95\n\nDoc. CLEX-11, p. 14; Doc. CLEX-15, p. 8.\n\nDoc. CLEX-15, \"*Informe de Gesti\u00f3n 2006*\", p. 348 of the PDF; Nagle I, para. 24; Doc. H-1, p. 50.\n\n**D. 2004: Fifth Amendment**\n----------------------------\n\nThe Contracting Committee\n-------------------------\n\n172.\n\nIn June 2004, Ingeominas created by internal resolution a *Comit\u00e9 de Contrataci\u00f3n Minera* [\"**Contracting Committee**\"], comprising Ingeominas' *Secretario General*, the *Director del Servicio Minero*, the *Subdirectores de Contrataci\u00f3n y Titulaci\u00f3n Minera* and *Fiscalizaci\u00f3n y Ordenamiento Minero*, and an *Asesor de la Direcci\u00f3n General*.\n\n173.\n\nThis Committee was responsible for advising the *Director del Servicio Minero inter alia* on contracts of *gran miner\u00eda* for areas historically granted to Ecocarb\u00f3n. In particular, the Contracting Committee had the following function:96\n\n\"*Recomendar al Director del Servicio Minero la aprobaci\u00f3n o desaprobaci\u00f3n de las solicitudes presentadas por los concesionarios relacionadas con modificaci\u00f3n, pr\u00f3rroga, cesi\u00f3n, subcontrataci\u00f3n, suspensi\u00f3n y renuncia de los contratos*\".\n\nDoc. R-10, Arts. 1 and 3.\n\n174.\n\nThe Contracting Committee thus became responsible for evaluating and making any recommendation to the *Director del Servicio Minero* regarding Prodeco's requests to modify the Mining Contract.\n\n175.\n\nIn September 2004, the scope of the Contracting Committee's functions was slightly altered by another resolution of Ingeominas:97\n\n\"*Recomendar a la Direcci\u00f3n del Servicio Minero o a las Subdirecciones de Contrataci\u00f3n y Titulaci\u00f3n Minera y Fiscalizaci\u00f3n y Ordenamiento Minero la aprobaci\u00f3n o rechazo de las peticiones presentadas por los beneficiarios de los t\u00edtulos mineros, relacionadas entre otros, con la modificaci\u00f3n, pr\u00f3rroga, suspensi\u00f3n, integraci\u00f3n de operaciones mineras y renuncia de los contratos de concesi\u00f3n y dem\u00e1s t\u00edtulos mineros*\".\n\nDoc. R-11, Art. 4(2).\n\nFifth Amendment\n---------------\n\n176.\n\nOn 15 December 2004, following the recommendation of the Contracting Committee,98 Prodeco and Ingeominas executed a fifth amendment to the Mining Contract,99 which clarified the calculation of the Base and Additional Royalties [\"**Fifth Amendment**\"].\n\nDoc. C-76, recital 16. See also Doc. R-68; Doc. R-69.\n\nDoc. C-76.\n\n**E. 2005: Sixth Amendment**\n----------------------------\n\n177.\n\nIt will be recalled that, in 1995, through the acquisition of Prodeco,100 Glencore became the indirect owner of concession rights over the Calenturitas Mine and Prodeco's Port.101\n\nDoc. CLEX-11, p. 12. See also RfA, para. 14; C I, para. 28; Nagle I, para. 19; Doc. H-1, p. 39; R I, fn. 16.\n\nDoc. CLEX-11, p. 12; Doc. CLEX-11, p. 249 of the PDF.\n\nAcquisition of Carbones de la Jagua S.A.\n----------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nIn 2005, Glencore acquired Carbones de la Jagua S.A. [\"**CDJ**\"], a company that held rights over some mining properties within the La Jagua coal mining project, located approximately 20 kilometres east of the Calenturitas Mine. Glencore was later able to consolidate ownership of the La Jagua coal project by acquiring Consorcio Minero Unido S.A. [\"**CMU**\"] in 2006 and Carbones El Tesoro [\"**CET**\"] in 2007.102 The Tribunal shall refer to CDJ, CMU, and CET jointly as the \"**Prodeco Affiliates**\".\n\nDoc. CLEX-11, pp. 12-13; RfA, para. 5.\n\nSixth Amendment\n---------------\n\n179.\n\nOne of the advantages of this acquisition was the blending of coal from the Calenturitas and La Jagua Mines-103 a procedure which called for an amendment of the Mining Contract.104 Accordingly, on 15 December 2005, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed the sixth amendment to the Mining Contract [\"**Sixth Amendment**\"]. This Amendment clarified how the Royalties and GIC payments should be calculated when the coal volume exported consisted of coal from the Calenturitas Mine blended with coal from other mines [\"**Blended Coal**\"].105\n\nNagle I, paras. 25-26.\n\nDoc. R-75.\n\nDoc. C-77, recital 6, Clause 1 and Annex 9A.\n\n180.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment also changed the reference price for calculating Royalties and GIC, from the \"Coal Week International\" price to the price of Colombian thermal coal published by the Platts \"International Coal Report\" [\"**ICR**\"], adjusted for calorific value. The Amendment specified that:106\n\n- If the coal exported by Prodeco came exclusively from the Mine, the reference price would be the higher of (i) the FOB Colombian port price for Colombian steam coal for the respective week as published in the ICR, adjusted for calorific value, and (ii) the shipment price estimated by Prodeco;\n\n- If the coal exported by Prodeco was Blended Coal, the reference price would simply be the FOB Colombian port price for Colombian steam coal, for the respective week as published in the ICR, adjusted for calorific value.\n\nDoc. C-77, Annex 9A.\n\nRailway\n-------\n\n181.\n\nIn March 2006, Prodeco, CDJ and CMU, the two mining companies recently acquired by Glencore, entered into an association contract with other coal producers, with the aim of sharing the use of a railway under concession to *Ferrocarriles del Norte de Colombia S.A.* [\"**Fenoco**\"]. Prodeco eventually indirectly acquired a 39.76% ownership interest in Fenoco.107\n\nDoc. CLEX-15, \"*Nota a los Estados Financieros*\" for 2007, p. 11; Doc. CLEX-11, p. 12; Doc. CLEX-13, p. 15. See also Compass Lexecon I, para. 25.\n\n182.\n\nThis railway linked the Mine region with ports situated in the Atlantic coast, specifically with Prodeco's Port, and solved Prodeco's transport difficulties: rail transport permitted the shipping of higher quantities of coal, at lower costs, and an increase in the capacity of the Calenturitas Mine.\n\n**F. 2006: The 2006 PTI**\n-------------------------\n\n183.\n\nProduction at the Calenturitas Mine continued to grow in 2006. In that year the Mine produced 2.9 MTA, almost twice the 2005 production.108\n\nDoc. CLEX-15, \"*Informe de gesti\u00f3n 2006*\", p. 348 of the PDF.\n\n184.\n\nIn addition, in 2006, Prodeco realized that it was possible to divert a section of the Calenturitas River that ran through the Mine, thereby increasing the amount of exploitable resources.109\n\nDoc. C-78, pp. 17-19 and 42.\n\n185.\n\nConsequently, in November 2006, Prodeco submitted a revised long-term PTI to Ingeominas, with new coal production objectives [\"**2006 PTI**\"]. Prodeco proposed to expand total coal production from the Mine to 116 MT between 2007 to 2019 (more than doubling the 55 MT envisioned in the 2003 PTI), initially at a rate of 4.4 MTA starting in 2007, and gradually increasing to 10 MTA from 2010 onwards:110\n\nDoc. C-78, pp. 17-19, 51 and 55.\n\n186.\n\nThe 2006 PTI also foresaw an investment of USD 500.1 million [\"**M**\"] being made in the years 2007-2010 (broken down as USD 196.4 M for equipment, USD 114.6 M for railway, USD 85.2 M for infrastructure, and USD 103.9 M for port and sundry investments), and an additional investment of USD 684.4 M for the remaining life of the project.111\n\nDoc. C-78, pp. 170 and 173.\n\n187.\n\nThe net present value of the project was estimated at USD 98 M (applying a discount rate of 15%), assuming costs of USD 24.79 per tonne of coal **111** 112 and a coal sales price of USD 42.58 per tonne.113\n\nDoc. C-78, p. 175.\n\nDoc. C-78, p. 170.\n\n188.\n\nMine-life Royalties to be paid to Ingeominas were estimated at USD 671 M.114\n\nDoc. C-78, p. 177.\n\n189.\n\nThe 2006 PTI also provided for additional exploratory drilling in Sectors B and D of the Mine.115\n\nDoc. C-78, pp. 35-36.\n\n190.\n\nOn 7 February 2007, Ingeominas approved the 2006 PTI, finding that this plan was more favourable than the original PTI, taking into account that it would generate a significantly higher compensation for the State. Ingeominas demanded, however, that in 2009 Prodeco submit an updated PTI, incorporating the results of the additional exploratory drilling in Sectors B and D.116\n\nDoc. C-80.\n\n**G. 2007: Seventh Amendment**\n------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nWhile Prodeco awaited the approval of the 2006 PTI, it consulted Ingeominas regarding the potential execution of a seventh amendment to the Mining Contract, with the goal of increasing the duration of the Contract and changing the existing Royalties regime, in particular for sales of coal in the Colombian domestic market. Prodeco explained that in order to be able to extract the maximum amount of coal resources and to profit from the significant investments it would make in the Calenturitas project - estimated at USD 1,184 M - the exploitation phase would need to be extended for a period of 20 years. 117\n\nDoc. C-79.\n\n192.\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations and upon the Contracting Committee's recommendation, on 15 February 2007, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed the Seventh Amendment to the Mining Contract [\"**Seventh Amendment**\"].118\n\nDoc. C-9.\n\n193.\n\nThe main thrust of the Seventh Amendment was to extend the duration of the Mining Contract by 15 years, until 3 July 2035.119 The justification given was that the 2006 PTI provided for the mining of an additional 60 MT of coal, and an increase of the capacity of the Mine to 10 MTA. The *Considerando* 6 of the Seventh Amendment concludes:120\n\n\"*En consecuencia los recursos que generar\u00e1 el proyecto por contraprestaciones econ\u00f3micas a favor del Estado se incrementan sustancialmente frente a lo previsto en el PTI original* [...]\".\n\nDoc. C-9, Clause 1.\n\nDoc. C-9, *Considerando* 6, p. 2.\n\n194.\n\nThe Seventh Amendment also allowed Prodeco to allocate up to 15% of its annual coal production to local sales; in such a case, Royalties would be calculated pursuant to the base price defined by the *Unidad de Planeaci\u00f3n Minero Energ\u00e9tica.*121\n\nDoc. C-9, Clause 2.\n\n195.\n\nThe basic system for quantifying Royalties and GIC was not changed, but a few clarifications and amendments were added. The Seventh Amendment provided:\n\n- That if the coal exported by Prodeco came exclusively from the Mine, the reference price for payment of Royalties and GIC would be the higher of (i) the FOB Colombian port price for Colombian steam coal for the respective week as published in the ICR, adjusted for calorific value [\"**FOB Price**\"], and (ii) the actual sale price;122\n\n- That Royalties and GIC would be calculated and paid within ten days of the shipment of coal, but would be subject to a quarterly readjustment \"based on the definitive prices\"123 (as will be explained later, the interpretation of this provision would become the subject of a debate between the Parties).\n\nDoc. C-9, Annex 9A.\n\nIn fact, a similar provision already existed in the Sixth Amendment, with a different wording (see Doc. C-77, Annex 9A, paras. A)(4) and B)(5)).\n\n196.\n\nFinally, the Seventh Amendment required Prodeco to submit a revised long-term PTI in January 2009, detailing its plans to exploit the Mine until 2035 and incorporating the results of the additional exploration conducted in Sectors B and D.124\n\nDoc. C-9, Clause 1.\n\n**(2) The Eighth Amendment : Preliminary Steps**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nClaimants argue that by signing the Eighth Amendment:\n\n- Ingeominas agreed to amend the Mining Contract and to change the system for calculating the Royalties and the GIC, and\n\n- In exchange, Prodeco undertook a massive additional program of investment, increasing the productive capacity of the Mine.\n\n198.\n\nThe result was a 'win-win' situation: Ingeominas would earn a higher remuneration (albeit by applying lower Royalties and GIC to a much higher production) and Prodeco would be able to make the necessary investments and develop the Mine to its full capacity.\n\n199.\n\nRespondent contests Claimants' version of the facts and argues that Claimants concealed and misrepresented crucial information in order to mislead the State into accepting an unjustifiable renegotiation of the Mining Contract, to the sole benefit of Claimants and to the detriment of the State. According to Respondent, Claimants made wilful misrepresentations, colluded with public servants, and engaged in corrupt practices, all in order to execute the Eighth Amendment.125\n\nR I, paras. 5, 9. See also HT, Day 2, p. 305, l. 22 - p. 307, l. 6.\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal will carefully analyse the evidence and establish the proven facts, starting with the preliminary steps which eventually led to the execution of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n**A. May 2008: Prodeco's First Approach**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nIn February 2007, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed the Seventh Amendment, and in October 2007 Prodeco delivered an Annual PTI for the year 2008. This PTI detailed the operations planned for 2008 and envisioned a production of 5 MTA.126\n\nDoc. BR-2, p. 13.\n\n202.\n\nThe Seventh Agreement did not change the basic structure of the remuneration which Prodeco had to pay to Ingeominas:\n\n- On the one side, progressive Royalties were calculated on the basis of an increasing scale, which added a 1% for every additional MTA produced by the Mine above; if the estimated production of 10 MTA was reached, the applicable Royalties rate would amount to 14.6%, to be applied to the totality of the coal sold; should production reach 11 MTA, the rate would rise to 15.6%, again to be applied to the totality of production;\n\n- On the other side, the GIC reference price of USD 40 per tonne had not been changed since 1989; and as a result of inflationary increases in Prodeco's mining costs, Prodeco had to pay Colombia a share of its gross revenues at price levels that barely covered its production costs.\n\n203.\n\nSix months after executing the Seventh Amendment, Prodeco decided to approach Ingeominas regarding a potential new amendment to the Mining Contract.127\n\nDoc. C-82.\n\n204.\n\nOn 23 May 2008, Prodeco's representatives met with Ingeominas' *Director General*, Mr. Mario Ballesteros [\"**Mr. Ballesteros**\"], and made a presentation, based on an extensive PowerPoint, suggesting a revision of the economic conditions of the Mining Contract.128 A few days thereafter, on 28 May, Prodeco submitted a 9-page formal request.129 Prodeco argued that the existing compensation arrangement compromised the potential expansion and even the viability of the Calenturitas mining project.130\n\nDoc. C-82.\n\nDoc. C-83.\n\nDoc. C-83. See also Doc. C-82 and Nagle I, paras. 41-45.\n\n205.\n\nAccordingly, Prodeco proposed that, in order to guarantee the sustainability of Colombia's returns and the viability of the mining project, certain conditions agreed upon in the Mining Contract should be amended:131\n\n- Replacing the ICR index by the API2-BCI7 indexes;132\n\n- Calculating Royalties and GIC based on the value of coal at the pithead of the Mine;\n\n- Capping Royalties at 10%;\n\n- Updating the value of the GIC and introducing a formula for indexation.\n\nDoc. C-82; Doc. C-83.\n\nMonthly arithmetic average of the export prices CIF ARA published by Argus/McCloskey in the index known as API2, minus the monthly average price of the maritime freight costs between Puerto Bolivar and Rotterdam published by SSY in the index known as BCI7 (see Doc. C-96, pp. 1-2).\n\n206.\n\nProdeco proposed the creation of a committee to analyse these potential modifications and, in the meantime, the execution of a memorandum of understanding.133\n\nDoc. C-82, p. 25; Doc. C-83, p. 10.\n\nIngeominas' reaction\n--------------------\n\n207.\n\nA few days thereafter,134 Ingeominas' *Subdirector de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n y Ordenamiento Minero*, Mr. Edward Franco, prepared an extensive legal and economic report, analysing Prodeco's proposal. The report was delivered to Mr. Ballesteros, for submission to Ingeominas' *Consejo Directivo.*135 Mr. Franco's proposal to the *Consejo Directivo* was the following:136\n\n\"*En cuanto a la modificaci\u00f3n propuesta se recomienda no acceder a la misma por ser poco favorable para los intereses de la Naci\u00f3n*\".\n\nThe precise date is difficult to establish, because the copy in the file is undated (Doc. R-79; Doc. R-80).\n\nDoc. R-80. See also Doc. R-79.\n\nDoc. R-80, p. 13.\n\n208.\n\nDespite this initial analysis, Prodeco and Ingeominas held further meetings to discuss the changes proposed by Prodeco.137\n\nDoc. C-86, p. 1.\n\n**B. July 2008: Prodeco's second approach**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nOn 15 July 2008, Prodeco sent to Ingeominas a second formal request for the revision of the economic conditions of the Mining Contract and the reduction of Royalties and GIC. That extensive request further developed Prodeco's original proposal and added a new supporting argument: if Ingeominas were prepared to reduce the compensation, Prodeco would increase its investments and increase the capacity of the Mine. **137** 138\n\nDoc. C-84, p. 19. See also p. 20.\n\n210.\n\nProdeco submitted a precise calculation of two scenarios - one, if the Mining Contract was not amended, and the other, if Prodeco's proposals were accepted.139\n\nDoc. C-84, Annex 8.\n\n211.\n\nIn essence, Prodeco was proposing to Ingeominas what Prodeco considered to be a 'win-win' deal: if Ingeominas agreed to a reduction of its Royalties, Prodeco would commit to making additional investments, production of the Mine would increase, costs would be cut, sales would be higher, and at the end of the life of the Mine, Prodeco would have earned higher profits and Colombia would have received significantly higher Royalties and taxes.\n\n**C. July 2008 - April 2009: The Dispute over the Definitive Price**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nIn its letter dated 15 July 2008, Prodeco also raised for the first time an interpretative issue regarding the definition of the so-called \"**Definitive Price**\" provision in the Seventh Amendment to the Mining Contract.140\n\nC I, para. 51; R I, paras. 61-62. See also Doc. C-84, paras. 1.3-1.15. The Tribunal notes that a similar provision already existed in the Sixth Amendment (see Doc. C-77, Annex 9A, paras. A)(4) and B)(5)).\n\n213.\n\n*Pro memoria*, the Seventh Amendment had established that the reference price for payment of Royalties and GIC would be the higher of (i) the FOB Price141and (ii) the actual sale price. Royalties and GIC would initially be calculated and paid within ten days of the shipment of coal, but they would be subject to a quarterly readjustment - upward or downward - \"based on the definitive prices.\"142\n\nDefined as the FOB Colombian port price for Colombian steam coal for the respective week as published in the ICR, adjusted for calorific value.\n\nDoc. C-9, Annex 9A.\n\n214.\n\nIn the letter Prodeco asserted that there were two possible interpretations of the term \"Definitive Price:\"143\n\n- The first interpretation would equal Definitive Price with the actual sale price received by Prodeco, evidenced in the invoices issued to the buyers;\n\n- Under an alternative interpretation, Definitive Price would be the higher of (i) the FOB Price in the week when the coal was shipped and (ii) the actual sale price obtained by Prodeco.\n\nDoc. C-84, para. 1.4.\n\n215.\n\nProdeco acknowledged that hitherto it had calculated the Definitive Price on the basis of the second alternative; but Prodeco now submitted that this interpretation failed to take into account that the market situation had drastically changed.\n\n216.\n\nProdeco proposed to Ingeominas that the Mining Contract be modified, so that Royalties and GIC be calculated on the basis of Prodeco's actual sale price.144\n\nDoc. C-84, para. 1.5-1.15.\n\n217.\n\nIn late August and early September 2008, Prodeco held meetings with the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda*, Mr. Hern\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez Torres, and with Mr. Ballesteros to discuss the revision of the Mining Contract.145 The evidence shows that the Minister agreed that it would be fair and reasonable for the Royalties to be calculated using the actual price received by Prodeco.146\n\nDoc. R-83; Doc. R-85, p. 2.\n\nDoc. C-86, p. 1 and Nagle I, para. 51. See also the *Versi\u00f3n Libre y Espont\u00e1nea* rendered by Minister Mart\u00ednez Torres in Doc. R-81, pp. 1-2: \"*Les record\u00e9 que el precio que deb\u00edan incluir en el acuerdo para liquidar las regal\u00edas deb\u00eda ser el precio del consumidor final y no el precio con que normalmente se registraba como de exportaci\u00f3n*\".\n\nNo negative inference\n---------------------\n\n218.\n\nRespondent says that given Claimants' failure to produce documents responsive to Colombia's request, the Tribunal must conclude that Prodeco actively sought to fabricate a dispute over payment of royalties to force Ingeominas into negotiating what would become the Eighth Amendment.147\n\nR II, para. 988.\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees.\n\n220.\n\nThere is no evidence that Prodeco \"fabricated\" a dispute, *i.e.* that it pursued a request knowing that it was not entitled to the rights claimed. To the contrary: the Minister of Mines agreed with the reasonableness of Prodeco's position, which proves that Prodeco at least had a *prima facie* case.\n\nProdeco unilaterally construes the Mining Contract\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nOn 8 September 2008, Prodeco sent a letter to Ingeominas, stating that as of 30 September 2008 it would start readjusting the amount of Royalties and GIC based on a Definitive Price equal to that paid by the end consumer.148\n\nDoc. C-86.\n\n222.\n\nOne month later, Prodeco did as it had anticipated: it paid the adjustment amount corresponding to the Royalties and GIC of the third quarter of 2008, applying the new interpretation of Definitive Prices. This led to an underpayment of USD 6 M in favour of Prodeco.\n\n223.\n\nThis interpretation, and consequent adjustment, was not accepted by Ingeominas. On 17 October 2008, Ingeominas replied to Prodeco saying that it was still evaluating the viability of the proposed contractual modification. According to Ingeominas, the reference price for the calculation of Royalties and GIC was the one published by the ICR, and any unilateral modification was without effect. Hence, Ingeominas demanded that Prodeco comply with the terms of the Mining Contract.149\n\nDoc. R-84.\n\n224.\n\nProdeco responded ten days later, stating that it was aware that any modification of the Mining Contract had to be bilaterally agreed, but that it was not seeking an amendment of the Definitive Price clause, given that its meaning was clear. 150\n\nDoc. R-85.\n\nIngeominas' *Requerimiento bajo apremio de caducidad*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nOn 23 January 2009, Ingeominas formally demanded payment of the amount in dispute through a *Requerimiento bajo apremio de caducidad*. Ingeominas asserted that Prodeco's unilateral interpretation of the Mining Contract amounted to a contractual breach. Through the *Requerimiento*, Ingeominas threatened Prodeco with a declaration of *caducidad* of the Contract if payment was not effected or an appropriate justification provided within one month.151\n\nDoc. C-88 / C-243.\n\n226.\n\nProdeco replied to the *Requerimiento* on 13 February 2009, restating the reasons for its interpretation of the Definitive Price term used in the Contract, and pointing out that Ingeominas had not explained why it disagreed with such interpretation.152\n\nDoc. C-244.\n\n227.\n\nIn April 2009, Prodeco approached Ingeominas regarding the outstanding royalty payments and proposed paying all the disputed amounts into an escrow account, until the dispute on the proper interpretation of the term Definitive Price had been settled.153 Ingeominas ultimately rejected this proposal, insisting that Prodeco pay the disputed amounts directly to Ingeominas in cash, before negotiations could progress.154\n\nDoc.

November 2008: Annual PTI for 2009**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nIn November 2008, Prodeco delivered to Ingeominas the Annual PTI for the year 2009, which envisaged a production of almost 7.2 MTA, and the start of the works for diverting the Calenturitas River, which would lead to an increase in the total Mine production of 80 MT of coal.155\n\nDoc. BR-3, pp. 1-1 to 1-3.\n\n229.\n\nPursuant to the Seventh Amendment, in January 2009, Prodeco was due to submit its revised long-term PTI, detailing its plans to exploit the Mine until 2035 and accounting for the results of the additional exploration in Sectors B and D.156 Nevertheless, since Prodeco had not completed its exploration program, it requested that the time to submit the PTI be extended until 30 May 2009,157 a request which Ingeominas granted.158 In fact, because of the parties' parallel negotiations, Prodeco would not submit such PTI until June 2010.159\n\nDoc.

March 2009: Sale of Prodeco to Xstrata**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nIn March 2009, Glencore sold Prodeco to the Australian mining company Xstrata, for a net consideration of USD 2 Bn; Glencore, however, retained a call option to repurchase Prodeco - which it eventually exercised.160\n\nDoc. R-77, p. 62; Doc. R-78, p. 2; Doc. R-278.\n\n(3) **The 3ha Contract**\n------------------------\n\n231.\n\nBefore continuing with its description of the negotiation and execution of the Eighth Amendment, the Tribunal must address a highly relevant averment of Colombia: namely, that Claimants obtained the Eighth Amendment through corruption. This is the factual predicate of Colombia's argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide this case.\n\n232.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimants bribed Mr. Ballesteros, Ingeominas' *Director General,* in order to secure his support for the execution of the Eighth Amendment, and that it paid the bribe through a complex scheme: Prodeco bought for a price of USD 1.75 M a concession contract [the \"**3ha Contract\"**] for the exploration and production of coal in a parcel of three hectares located in the middle of the La Jagua mine from a former employee of the Ministry of Mines and his partner.161 Respondent says that these individuals were strawmen of Mr. Ballesteros, who ultimately benefitted from the consideration paid by Prodeco, and the payment was the *quid pro quo* for the execution of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nR I, paras. 67-69.\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal will establish the proven facts, and in order to do so it will recount the full story of the 3ha Contract, starting in 2006.\n\n**A. November 2006: A Coveted Concession Contract**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nOn 29 November 2006, Mr. Jorge Maldonado [\"**Mr. Maldonado**\"] - a former employee of the Ministry of Mines and of Ingeominas' predecessors - and his partner, Mr. C\u00e9sar Garc\u00eda, filed a request with Ingeominas to obtain a concession contract for the exploration and production of coal in a parcel of 3 hectares.162\n\nDoc. C-197; Doc. R-93. See also R I, para. 71 and C II, para. 38(b).\n\n235.\n\nThese 3 hectares were located in the middle of several concessions which formed part of the La Jagua project and were exploited by Glencore through the Prodeco Affiliates (at the time only CDJ and CMU, since CET would be acquired in 2007).163\n\nDoc. R-90, p. 6. See also R I, para. 69 and C II, para. 38(b).\n\n236.\n\nFour months after Mr. Maldonado\u2019s application, Ingeominas issued on 2 March 2007 a technical report concluding that the 3ha Contract would partially overlap with other nearby concessions and that it was too small for a stand-alone mining operation.164 A week thereafter, on 17 March 2007, Ingeominas formally rejected Mr. Maldonado\u2019s application for the 3ha Contract.165\n\nDoc. C-199, pp. 1-2. See also R I, para. 72 and C II, para. 38(c).\n\nDoc. C-200. See also R I, para. 72 and C II, para. 38(c).\n\n237.\n\nIn January 2008, after Glencore\u2019s acquisition of CET, the Prodeco Affiliates submitted an agreement for the integrated use of mining infrastructure *(Acuerdo de Uso Integrado de Infraestructura Minera)* to Ingeominas, in order to conduct joint operations in the mining areas of the La Jagua project [\"**Integrated Use Agreement**\"].166 Ingeominas approved this Agreement on 28 January 2008.167\n\nDoc. C-234.\n\nDoc. C-202, p. 2, para. 11.\n\n238.\n\nOn 10 March 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates submitted to Ingeominas a formal opposition to the 3ha Contract, requesting that Ingeominas:168\n\n- Correct the errors in the coordinates of the titles granted to the Prodeco Affiliates, which had created the three-hectare gap; or\n\n- Alternatively, reject the request for the 3ha Contract, because it would be technically impractical to exploit such a small area.\n\nDoc. C-202, pp. 3-4.\n\nIngeominas backtracks and awards the 3ha Contract\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nIn June 2008, Ingeominas backtracked on its original decision, finding that the 3ha Contract area did not overlap with other mining concessions, and rejecting the objections of the Prodeco Affiliates.169 In July 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates filed a request for reconsideration,170 which Ingeominas rejected on 19 August 2008.171\n\nDoc. C-206. See also R I, para. 73 and C II, para. 38(j).\n\nDoc. C-207.\n\nDoc. C-208.\n\n**B. August 2008 - November 2008: Prodeco Complains to Authorities**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nProdeco was now faced with the situation that Ingeominas was about to grant the 3ha Contract to Mr. Maldonado and his partner - a concession which threatened to disrupt the development of the La Jagua mine. In this situation, Prodeco decided to complain in writing to various Colombian authorities - including the *Ministro de Presidencia.*\n\n241.\n\nFirst, on 26 August 2008, Ms. Margarita Zuleta, a lawyer acting on behalf of the Prodeco Affiliates, filed a formal complaint regarding the anomalies surrounding the 3ha Contract with Colombia\u2019s *Procurador General de la Naci\u00f3n.*172 Ms. Zuleta also forwarded this complaint to the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda*, to the *Ministro de la Presidencia,* to Mr. Ballesteros (Ingeominas\u2019 General Director), and to the *Contralor\u00eda,*173 the Republic\u2019s supervisory agency.\n\nDoc. C-209.\n\nDoc. C-210.\n\n242.\n\nSecond, on 22 September 2008, Ms. Zuleta approached the *Procurador General* again, saying that Ingeominas\u2019 rejection of the Prodeco Affiliates\u2019 request for reconsideration constituted a violation of due process and of the applicable mining provisions. Ms. Zuleta emphasised that the *Procurador General* should investigate the fact that the 3ha Contract had been awarded to an ex-employee of the agency, since there had been clear irregularities and an undue use of insider information.174 This letter was, once again, forwarded to the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* to the *Ministro de la Presidencia,* and to the *Contralor\u00eda.*175\n\nDoc. C-211.\n\nDoc. C-211, *\"C.c. Doctor Julio Cesar Turbay Quintero - Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica; Doctor Hern\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez - Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda; Doctora Cecilia Alvarez - Ministro de la Presidencia\u2019\".*\n\n243.\n\nThird, on 6 October 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates sent a complaint to Mr. Ballesteros and Mr. Edward Franco (with a copy to the *Procurador General,* the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* the *Ministro de la Presidencia* and the *Contralor\u00eda),* asking Ingeominas to review the 3ha Contract and to refrain from granting, or at least from registering, the 3ha Contract.176\n\nDoc. C-212, pp. 1 and 5.\n\n244.\n\nFourth, on 10 October 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates asked the *Jefe del Registro Minero Nacional* (with a copy to the *Procurador General*, the *Contralor\u00eda*, the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda* and the *Ministro de la Presidencia)* to refrain from registering the 3ha Contract, claiming that he had a duty to the defend the national interest.177\n\nDoc. C-213.\n\nExecution of the 3ha Contract\n-----------------------------\n\n245.\n\nNotwithstanding the Prodeco Affiliates\u2019 appeals and complaints, on 16 October 2008, Ingeominas (represented by Mr. Franco Gamboa) and Mr. Maldonado and his partner executed the 3ha Contract, and the latter thus became owners of the 3ha mining concession.178\n\nDoc. C-214.\n\n246.\n\nProdeco quickly reacted: on 21 November 2008, Ms. Zuleta asked Ingeominas\u2019 *Coordinador del Grupo de Control Interno Disciplinario* to open a disciplinary investigation against the employees involved in awarding the 3ha Contract (with a copy to the *Procurador General,* the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* the *Ministro de Presidencia,* the *Director del Programa Presidencial de Lucha contra la Corrupci\u00f3n,* and the *Contralor\u00eda).*179 And in February 2009 Prodeco\u2019s external counsel filed a citizen\u2019s suit *(acci\u00f3n popular)* against Ingeominas and Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda based on the irregularities surrounding the 3ha Contract.180\n\nDoc. C-239. See also Doc. C-222, p. 14.\n\nDoc. C-215.\n\n**C. May 2009: CDJ Buys the 3ha Contract**\n------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nIn the meantime, in December 2008, Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda approached Prodeco through an intermediary, offering to sell the 3ha Contract for USD 11 M.181\n\nDoc. R-280, pp. 1 and 2: \"He told me that the US $10 for ton was a starting point, but that price could be negotiated\" and \"Gary, total coal tones are 1\u2019114,000 aprox.\". The value of multiplying 1.14 MT by USD 10/tonne, would amount to approximately USD 11 million (See Nagle III, para. 6).\n\n248.\n\nAt the end of March 2009,182 the Prodeco Affiliates made a last complaint to the *Ministro de Presidencia* about the irregularities surrounding the 3ha Contract. Prodeco warned that the lack of a solution to the 3ha Contract situation would leave Prodeco with no option other than to engage in direct negotiations with Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda.183\n\nThe letter erroneously reads 31 March 2008. There is no doubt that it is from 2009, since it describes facts which are posterior to 31 March 2008 (Doc. C-300).\n\nDoc. C-300, p. 4.\n\n249.\n\nOnce again faced with the silence and inaction of the Colombian authorities, Prodeco decided to pursue the option of buying the 3ha Contract from Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda.\n\n250.\n\nThe transaction took place on 4 May 2009:184 Ms. Elsa Arag\u00f3n Barrera, acting on behalf and in representation of Mr. Maldonado, and Mr. Garc\u00eda signed an agreement assigning the 3ha Contract to CDJ, one of the Prodeco Affiliates, which paid USD 1.75 M as consideration [the \"**Assignment Contract**\"].185\n\nThe assignment contract is erroneously dated 4 May 2008 (Doc. C-301). There is no doubt that it is actually dated May 2009, as also proved by the draft submitted to Ingeominas for approval (Doc. R-95).\n\nDoc. C-301. See also Nagle II, para. 22; Paredes I, para. 17.\n\nApproval by Ingeominas\n----------------------\n\n251.\n\nProdeco and Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda submitted the Assignment Contract to Ingeominas for approval.186 In that version of the Contract, the price paid was unspecified: **.**187\n\n3. Precio y Forma de Pago. El CESIONARIO deber\u00e1 pagar al CEDENTE la suma de US$ pagaderos en pesos colombianos a la tasa representativa del mercado vigente el d\u00eda del pago. Este pago deber\u00e1 hacerse el d\u00eda h\u00e1bil siguiente a aquel en el cual la cesi\u00f3n del CONTRATO sea inscrita en el Registro Minero y en consecuencia haya constancia de que el CONTRATO est\u00e1 en cabeza del CESIONARIO.\n\nDoc. R-94.\n\nDoc. R-95.\n\n252.\n\nIngeominas approved the Assignment Contract on 8 May 2009, and the transaction was registered on 27 May 2009.188\n\nDoc. R-97. See also R I, para. 80 and C II, para. 38(p).\n\nPayment of the purchase price\n-----------------------------\n\n253.\n\nThe Assignment Contract provided that CDJ should make the payments due in Colombian Pesos, in two designated accounts opened in two Colombian banks *(Banco Davivienda* and *Banco Occidente.*): **.**189\n\nDoc. C-301, pp. 1-2.\n\n254.\n\nCDJ made the payments by transferring funds to the accounts located in Colombia and identified in the Contract, as evidenced by these transfer receipts:190\n\nDocs. C-303, C-307 and C-308. See also Doc. R-281; Doc. R-322.\n\n255.\n\nThere is also evidence in the file that, once payment had been made, CDJ made the appropriate tax withholding required under Colombian tax law:191\n\nDoc. C-315, p. 2; Doc. C-316, p. 2.\n\n256.\n\nThe transaction was also reflected in CDJ\u2019s audited financial statements of February 2010.192 On 1 February 2010, CDJ informed Ingeominas that it had acquired the 3ha Contract from Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda, this time disclosing the consideration of USD 1.75 M:193\n\nDoc. C-313, pp. 5-6.\n\nDoc. C-312, p. 2. The stated amount in USD (899,067.36) is slightly higher than USD 875,000 *(i.e.* USD 1.75 m divided by two) due to exchange rates.\n\n**D. May 2011: Further Developments**\n-------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThere is evidence that even after the Assignment Contract had been executed, Prodeco continued to complain about the irregular character of the grant of the three-hectare concession to Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda.\n\n258.\n\nMr. Paredes, Respondent\u2019s witness in this arbitration, who replaced Mr. Ballesteros as *Director General* of Ingeominas, recalls that Dra. Zuleta personally raised the issue with him.194\n\nParedes I, para. 17.\n\n259.\n\nIn a press conference of May 2011, the newly, appointed *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda*, Mr. Carlos Rodado, acknowledged the irregularities behind the 3ha Contract.195 In June 2011, Mr. Rodado asked the *Procuradur\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n*, the *Contralor\u00eda*, and the *Fiscal\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n* to start formal investigations into irregularities within Ingeominas.196\n\nDoc. R-237, video of the press conference, min. 00:00-02:42.\n\nDoc. R-245, Doc. R-246; Doc. R-247.\n\n**(4) The Eighth Amendment: Negotiations**\n------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\n*Pro memoria:* while the facts concerning the 3ha Contract were developing, Prodeco was involved in a dispute with Ingeominas, regarding the proper interpretation of the term \"Definitive Price\" as used in the Mining Contract.\n\n261.\n\nThe dispute, which had arisen in 2008, had escalated because Prodeco had unilaterally applied its own interpretation, and had failed to pay to Ingeominas an amount of more than USD 6 M. Ingeominas had reacted by requiring Prodeco to pay within one month *bajo apremio de caducidad,* and had rejected Prodeco\u2019s conciliatory proposal of depositing the disputed amounts in an escrow account.\n\n**A. May 2009: The Commitment to Negotiate**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe negotiations between Prodeco and Ingeominas continued, and on 21 May 2009 (a few days after CDJ\u2019s purchase of the 3ha Contract from Mr. Maldonado), both parties finally executed an *Acuerdo de Compromiso* [\"**Commitment to Negotiate**\"], in an attempt to solve their dispute.\n\n**B. June - November 2009: Negotiations**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nOnce the Commitment to Negotiate was signed, Ingeominas and Prodeco started formal negotiations. The negotiation period was extended three times, in September, October, and November 2009, before finally expiring on 9 December 2009.197\n\nDoc. C-99; Doc. C-105; Doc. C-109.\n\n264.\n\nThe negotiations revolved around two main issues:\n\n- The general compensation scheme that would be applied under the Mining Contract [\"**Compensation Scheme**\"];\n\n- The coal price to be used for calculating the compensation [\"**Coal Reference Price**\"].\n\n**a. The Meeting of the** ***Consejo Directivo*** **of 1 June 2009**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nOn 1 June 2009, Mr. Ballesteros, Ingeominas\u2019 *Director General,* informed its *Consejo Directivo* of the latest developments in the Prodeco negotiation: he explained that Ingeominas had notified Prodeco that it was in contractual breach, and that Prodeco had offered to pay USD 6 M into an escrow account while discussions were pending. He added that Ingeominas had rejected this proposal, and in order to move forward, Ingeominas and Prodeco had executed a document, in which Prodeco agreed to pay the disputed sum by 4 June 2009. The *Ministro de Minas,* Mr. Hern\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez Torres, then stated that holders of mining titles must comply with the terms of their concession agreements, and that it was Ingeominas\u2019 task to guarantee that this happened.198\n\nDoc. R-101, p. 3.\n\n**b. Negotiations Start**\n-------------------------\n\n266.\n\nOn 3 June 2009, Prodeco made the agreed payment of more than USD 6 M, and consequently the 90-day negotiation period started to run.199 Ingeominas scheduled a kick-off meeting for 12 June 2009 and sent a letter to Prodeco in preparation for that meeting.200\n\nDoc. R-109.\n\nDoc. R-110.\n\n267.\n\nThe kick-off meeting took place on 12 June 2009. Prodeco submitted an extensive PowerPoint presentation explaining its position.201 Claimants proposed to replace the existing Compensation Scheme (Royalties and GIC) with a single flat royalty rate based on Prodeco\u2019s actual sale prices. According to Prodeco, this modification would ultimately generate higher revenues for the State, without impairing the net present value [\"**NPV**\"] of the project for Claimants.202\n\nDoc. C-93; Doc. R-111 (contains a full resolution version of the PowerPoint presentation, in which it is possible to read on the first page *\"Junio 12, 2009\").*\n\nDoc. C-93, pp. 26-29.\n\n268.\n\nIn response, on 23 June 2009, Ingeominas requested that Prodeco provide a numerical, detailed and concrete proposal of the requested changes to the Compensation Scheme, and the analyses, valuations and commitments with respect to future investments, expansion, and production.203\n\nDoc. R-112 / BR-5, p. 1.\n\n269.\n\nProdeco presented its proposal at a meeting scheduled for 2 July 2009.204 Prodeco used a PowerPoint presentation,205 in which it offered a single compensation payment of 10% based on the higher of:\n\n- the actual coal sales price, and\n\n- USD 42.43 per tonne (which was the base price of the 2006 PTI).\n\nDoc. R-114.\n\nDoc. C-95.\n\n270.\n\nAccording to Prodeco, the proposal, by guaranteeing a minimum price per tonne, shielded Ingeominas from the risk of potential decreases in coal prices. In a letter sent two days thereafter, Prodeco again represented to Ingeominas that the proposal would permit a further expansion of the Mine and would also be advantageous for Ingeominas and for the Nation.206\n\nDoc. R-115.\n\n271.\n\nOn 13 July 2009, Ingeominas acknowledged receipt and declared that it was evaluating Prodeco\u2019s proposal *\"bajo la salva guarda [sic] de los intereses de la Naci\u00f3n y por ende de todos los Colombianos\"*.207\n\nDoc. R-116.\n\nc. **The Meeting of the** ***Consejo Directivo*** **of 27 July 2009**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nOn 27 July 2009, Adolfo Enrique Alvarez Gonz\u00e1lez, Technical Director of Ingeominas briefly informed its *Consejo Directivo* that it was studying a review of the remuneration owed under the Prodeco Mining Contract.208\n\nDoc. C-252, p. 4.\n\n273.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the minutes of the meeting do not properly reflect the scope of the negotiations. The Tribunal considers it established that in fact Prodeco and Ingeominas were discussing not only the Coal Reference Price, but a much wider range of topics affecting the Compensation Scheme.\n\n**d. Continuation of the Negotiations**\n---------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nThe next meeting took place on 31 July 2009.209 Mr. Gary Nagle [\"**Mr. Nagle**\"], Prodeco\u2019s Chief Executive Officer at the time,210 has testified as his recollection of the topics that were discussed at that meeting: Ingeominas had in the meantime analysed the proposal submitted by Prodeco, and accepted the application of a flat rate, albeit at a higher rate of 13%, with the possibility of increasing it to 15% if prices rose and Prodeco made windfall profits.211\n\nDoc. R-118. This meeting was initially programmed for 22 July 2009, but it was postponed by Ingeominas (Doc. R-117).\n\nMr. Nagle served as Prodeco\u2019s CEO from January 2008 to April 2013 (Nagle I, para. 3), after which he was replaced by Mr. Mark McManus [\"**Mr. McManus**\"] (McManus I, para. 5).\n\nNagle I, para. 60.\n\n275.\n\nSince Mr. Nagle\u2019s \"main takeaway\" from the meeting was that Ingeominas expected an improved offer, on 10 August 2009, Prodeco submitted a revised proposal.\n\n276.\n\nOn 27 August 2009, Ingeominas replied to Prodeco\u2019s revised proposal. Ingeominas explained that its officials were assessing Prodeco\u2019s revised proposal and hoped to come back with a response at the following meeting.212\n\nDoc. C-97, p. 3.\n\n277.\n\nProdeco answered on 1 September 2009, explaining that its improved offer was simply aimed at reflecting the parties\u2019 latest discussions. Prodeco declared that it was open to discussing Ingeominas\u2019 proposals at the following meeting, which should also address the fact that the Commitment to Negotiate was about to expire.213\n\nDoc. R-124.\n\n278.\n\nAs foreseen by Prodeco, the 90-day agreed period for negotiations expired, and on 3 September 2009, Ingeominas officially notified Prodeco that it would resort to mediation, as envisaged in the Commitment to Negotiate.214 But on that same day Prodeco and Ingeominas reached an agreement to extend the negotiation period until 30 October 2009, and no mediation was initiated.215\n\nDoc. C-98.\n\nDoc. C-99.\n\n279.\n\nOn 1 October 2009, the *Consejo Directivo* met again. The minutes show that the Prodeco negotiation was discussed in detail, and that Ingeominas\u2019 letter dated 23 September 2009 had in fact been issued at the suggestion of the *Consejeros.216*\n\nDoc. R-129, p. 3.\n\n**e. Prodeco Submits an NPV Model**\n-----------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nIngeominas and Prodeco held a further meeting on 5 October 2009,217 and a few days thereafter, on 9 October, Prodeco submitted a new letter, with additional explanations.218\n\nDoc. R-130, p. 3. See also Nagle I, para. 66.\n\nDoc. C-102.\n\n281.\n\nProdeco started by justifying why, under the existing Compensation Scheme, it was not economically feasible to expand the Mine, in terms of NPV. Applying the then current system, the maximum NPV was achieved at 8 MTA, and for higher production, the NPV started to decrease, as a result of the progressive Compensation Scheme agreed upon in the Mining Contract.219 Prodeco thus averred that beyond 8 MTA it would be uneconomical further to increase the capacity of the Mine.\n\nDoc. C-102, p. 1.\n\n282.\n\nIn the letter, Prodeco then submitted its alternative proposal, which it said had been discussed at the meeting with Ingeominas held on 5 October.\n\n283.\n\nUnder this proposal, the then current Compensation Scheme would be retained for production up to 8 MTA; but for higher production a unified compensation rate of 13% would be applied.\n\n284.\n\nIn that case an annual production of 15 MTA would become economical, even if the increase in production required a capital investment of USD 1.6 Bn. Prodeco would be prepared to assume such investment, since the NPV of the project increased to slightly more than USD 200 M. And Ingeominas would also benefit: the NPV of its take would increase to USD 600 M (again at 12% discount rate).220\n\nDoc. C-102, p. 2.\n\nAnalysis by Ingeominas\n----------------------\n\n285.\n\nIngeominas asked two of its officers - Mr. Giovanny Balcero and Ms. Luz Mireya G\u00f3mez, to analyse Prodeco's latest proposal.\n\n286.\n\nMr. Balcero and Ms. G\u00f3mez prepared a three-page memorandum, dated 20 October 2009, which reached the following conclusions:221\n\n- NPV was a proper financial tool to evaluate long term investment projects; if the NPV was higher than the required investment, the investment was feasible;\n\n- The model submitted by Prodeco had a positive NPV for annual production between 8 and 15 MTA and consequently a project foreseeing production in that range would be financially viable;\n\n- Certain aspects of Prodeco's model required further clarification;\n\n- Prodeco should submit a sensitivity analysis to confirm the financial viability of the project.\n\nDoc. R-134; Doc. R-135.\n\n287.\n\nThe report did not address Prodeco\u2019s argument that the NPV of the project was maximized at a production of 8 MTA, and that for higher production (which required higher investments) the NPV decreased - and that for Prodeco the best alternative, with the existing Compensation Scheme, was to limit production at 8 MTA.\n\n288.\n\nOn 26 October 2009, Ms. G\u00f3mez met with Mr. Johnny Campo, Prodeco\u2019s Projects Financial Analyst, to discuss her memorandum. On that same day, as requested, Mr. Campo sent to Mr. Balcero of Ingeominas a sensitivity analysis,222 reflecting the impact of the variation of certain factors (discount rate, coal prices, labour costs, fuel costs, explosive costs) on the NPV of the project at different production levels,223 supporting the conclusion that \"*a partir de 8Mtpy la expansi\u00f3n es inviable ya que el VPN del proyecto se reduce a partir de este nivel de producci\u00f3n\".*\n\nDoc. R-134; Doc. C-103.\n\nDoc. C-103. See also Nagle II, para. 58; Brattle I, para. 39.\n\n289.\n\nThereafter, officers from Prodeco and Ingeominas met several times and jointly ran different sensitivity models.224\n\nDoc. C-103; Doc. C-134, pp. 5-6.\n\nf. **The Meeting of the** ***Consejo Directivo*** **of 26 October 2009**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nOn 26 October 2009, Ingeominas\u2019 *Consejo Directivo* held a meeting, at which Prodeco\u2019s proposal was discussed. Ms. Luz Aristiz\u00e1bal, an officer of Ingeominas, who would later be involved in the *Contralor\u00eda* proceeding, submitted a report and gave a detailed explanation of the ongoing negotiations between Prodeco and Ingeominas. In essence,225\n\n- She acknowledged that under the existing Compensation Scheme an expansion of the mine beyond 8 MTA was not viable, because if production was geared up to (say) 12 MTA the Base Royalty of 7.6% would increase by an Additional Royalty of 9%, making the expansion not feasible;\n\n- She proposed a new deal, whereby the percentage of Royalties should progressively increase, until the Mine reached its optimum production level; if production exceeded that level, the percentage of Royalties should remain fixed;\n\n- She added that if this amendment were not accepted, the Nation would lose the additional royalties deriving from the expansion of the Mine;\n\n- Finally, she discussed various alternative methods of calculating the Coal Reference Price on which the Royalties were to be applied.\n\nDoc. R-138.\n\n291.\n\nThe *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* who was present at the meeting, suggested using the price of sale to the final consumer, instead of indexes, as the Coal Reference Price for the calculation of royalties. He further questioned why some projects applied a royalty rate based on FOB Prices, while others used pithead prices. The Minister concluded that there was a need to conduct a comparative analysis of prices and levels of production for each contract of *Gran Miner\u00eda.*226\n\nDoc. C-104, pp. 3-4. See also Doc. R-138, with Ingeominas\u2019 presentation to the *Consejo Directivo.*\n\ng. **Second Extension of the Commitment to Negotiate**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nOn 29 October 2009, Prodeco and Ingeominas agreed to a new extension of the Commitment to Negotiate until 30 November 2009.227\n\nDoc. C-105.\n\nAdditional NPV Information\n--------------------------\n\n293.\n\nOn that same day, Prodeco\u2019s Mr. Campo sent further information to Ingeominas\u2019 official Mr. Balcero, at the latter\u2019s request. The information took the form of a graph indicating the impact of an expansion of the project on its NPV.228 The graph confirms that the NPV is maximized at a production of 8 MTA, and that at higher production rates expenses rise faster than income, resulting in lower NPVs.\n\nDoc. C-255.\n\nProdeco\u2019s Revised Proposal\n--------------------------\n\n294.\n\nOn 4 November 2009, Prodeco presented yet another revised proposal to Ingeominas, on the basis of the information and projections reviewed jointly by Ingeominas and Prodeco.229\n\nDoc. C-106. See also Nagle I, para. 70 and Brattle I, para. 40.\n\n295.\n\nOn 11 November 2009, Prodeco submitted two proposed *formulae* to calculate the GIC payments. Prodeco also drew Ingeominas\u2019 attention to the fact that it had been almost six months since the execution of the Commitment to Negotiate, and that despite Prodeco\u2019s repeated proposals, Ingeominas had not yet presented any counter-proposals.230\n\nDoc. C-107.\n\nThe Meeting of 17 November 2009\n-------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nProdeco and Ingeominas representatives met again on 17 November 2009 and Ingeominas provided Prodeco with some feedback:231\n\n- Ingeominas recognised the need to update the GIC threshold;\n\n- But insisted on using the ICR index as the Coal Reference Price to calculate Royalties and GIC - a point which Prodeco accepted;\n\n- It proposed that a flat 12.6% royalty rate apply to all production when production exceeded 8 MTA.\n\nDoc. R-145. See also Nagle I, para. 71.\n\nFurther Analyses\n----------------\n\n297.\n\nOn 25 November 2009, Prodeco's Mr. Campo sent Ingeominas two charts showing the impact of Ingeominas' proposals on NPV.\n\n**h. The Meeting of the** ***Consejo Directivo*** **of 23 November 2009**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nIngeominas held a further meeting of its *Consejo Directivo* on 23 November 2009. Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal again made a presentation to the *Consejo232* and summarized the status of the negotiations with Prodeco:\n\n- Ingeominas was proposing to keep the present Compensation Scheme for production of up to 8 MTA and to apply a fixed rate of 12.6% for production above that threshold;\n\n- Ingeominas acknowledged that the costs on which the GIC was based had to be updated, to take into account inflation; there was however no agreement on the identification of the proper indexes.233\n\nDoc. R-145.\n\nDoc. R-146, p. 3.\n\n299.\n\nThe Directors did not express any opposition to these proposals; they simply asked to be kept informed of the progress in the negotiations.234\n\nDoc. R-146, p. 3.\n\n**i. Third Extension of the Commitment to Negotiate**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nOn 27 November 2009, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed a third, and last, extension of the Commitment to Negotiate, until 9 December 2009.235\n\nDoc. C-109.\n\n**(5) The Eighth Amendment : Execution**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. December 2009: Execution of the Initial Version**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nThe negotiations continued at a meeting held on 3 December 2009. In the course of that meeting, agreement seemed within reach. Prodeco accepted Ingeominas' proposals:236\n\n- A 12.6% flat royalty rate would apply on all production in excess of 8 MTA;\n\n- The ICR reference prices should be weighted to determine a Coal Reference Price to calculate Royalties and GIC;\n\n- The GIC tables should be indexed to the Colombian consumer price index and not to international indexes;\n\n- Prodeco\u2019s proposal that GIC payments be due only where production costs exceed 75% of sales prices was rejected.\n\nNagle I, para. 74.\n\n302.\n\nHaving apparently reached an accord, on 9 December 2009 - the last day of validity of the Commitment to Negotiate - Prodeco and Ingeominas met and executed an eighth amendment to the Mining Contract [\"**Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment**\"], which:237\n\n- Maintained the existing Compensation Scheme for production volumes up to 8 MTA;\n\n- Established a 12.6% flat royalty rate on all coal produced in excess of 8 MTA, applied on the FOB reference price at the Colombian port;\n\n- Determined that the FOB reference price was to be calculated applying a formula which consisted of the weighted average of ICR prices in force 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months before the date of each shipment (the so-called lags), adjusted by calorific power;\n\n- Set a table with updated thresholds to calculate GIC payments based on the FOB reference prices; these thresholds would be updated according to Colombian inflation.\n\nDoc. C-111.\n\n303.\n\nThe Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment also provided that Prodeco had to pay approximately USD 20.8 M to Ingeominas, to settle outstanding payments derived from the Definitive Price provision, but that such payment should not be understood as Prodeco\u2019s acknowledgement of Ingeominas\u2019 interpretation.238\n\nDoc. C-111, Clause Seventh.\n\n304.\n\nThe Initial Version would enter into force upon its registration at the National Mining Registry, and would be deemed to take effect on 1 January 2010.239\n\nDoc. C-111, Clauses Ninth and Tenth.\n\n305.\n\nProdeco and Ingeominas initialled and signed three copies of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.240 Mr. Ballesteros requested, however, that Prodeco leave its signed copy with Ingeominas, so that, as a courtesy, he could explain the contents of the agreement at the *Consejo Directivo* meeting scheduled for the following day, and Prodeco complied with that request.241\n\nDoc. C-111 shows the initials and signatures; the document shows a stamp saying *\"Sin vigencia por falta de inscripci\u00f3n en el Registro Minero al considerarse lesivo para el Estado\".*\n\nDoc. C-112. See also Nagle I, para. 78.\n\n**B. The Meeting of the** ***Consejo Directivo*** **of 10 December 2009**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nOn 10 December 2009, Ingeominas held a meeting of its *Consejo Directivo,*242 and Ms. Aristizabal again appeared and submitted a report summarizing the terms of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.243 She attached a chart, which compared the level of Royalties in an 8 MTA and in an expansion scenario, assuming a USD 70 coal price:244\n\nDoc. R-150.\n\nDoc. R-149.\n\nDoc. R-149, p. 5.\n\n307.\n\nIn accordance with this chart, in the 8 MTA scenario the Royalties collected by Ingeominas would remain stable at USD 80 M per year between 2009 and 2015. In the alternative expansion scenario, applying the new Royalties foreseen in the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, Ingeominas\u2019 income would dip in 2009 (to approximately USD 70 M) and in 2010 (to approximately USD 75 M), but would then rise to USD 105 M in 2011 and to more than USD 120 M in 2012-2015.\n\n308.\n\nIt is unclear what exactly happened next at the meeting of the *Consejo Directivo.*\n\n309.\n\nMinister Hern\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez Torres has testified in the *Contralor\u00eda* proceeding that he disagreed with the signed Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, that he asked that his disagreement be included in the minutes of the meeting, and that it was agreed to create a task force to analyse whether the changes were in the interest of the Nation.245 The official minutes simply say that the Minister and the remaining members requested that the issue be re-examined with more detail taking into account the national interest.246\n\nDoc. C-157; Doc. R-81, p. 1.\n\nDoc. R-150, p. 3.\n\n310.\n\nSumming up, what seems to have happened is that, although legally speaking the authorization of the *Consejo Directivo* was not necessary for the execution of an amendment to the Mining Contract, Director Ballesteros did not feel comfortable going forward without the support of his Board, and consequently agreed to review the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, to satisfy the Board that the amendment was in the best interest of the Nation.\n\n**C. December 2009: Ingeominas Denies Registration at the Mining Registry**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nFaced with Ingeominas\u2019 silence for a week, on 16 December 2009 Prodeco sent a letter demanding that Ingeominas return Prodeco\u2019s signed copy of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.247\n\nDoc. C-112.\n\n312.\n\nIngeominas replied to Prodeco on 21 December 2009, saying that, in coordination with the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* Ingeominas was making a final review of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment. Ingeominas noted that the *Consejo Directivo* was the entity in charge of running and managing Ingeominas, and of defining its policies, plans and programs, together with the *Director General*. Hence, Ingeominas informed that it would communicate its decision regarding the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment in the second half of January 2010.248\n\nDoc. C-113.\n\n313.\n\nOn 30 December 2009, Prodeco paid Ingeominas USD 20.8 M, as required under the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.249 A few days later, Prodeco once again requested its signed copy of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.250\n\nDoc. R-15.\n\nDoc. R-18; Doc. R-19.\n\n314.\n\nOn 18 January 2010, Ingeominas finally delivered to Prodeco a signed copy of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, but with multiple stamps stating:251\n\n*\"SIN VIGENCIA POR FALTA DE INSCRIPCI\u00d3N EN EL REGISTRO MINERO NACIONAL AL CONSIDERARSE LESIVO PARA EL ESTADO\".*\n\nDoc. C-115. See also Doc. R-17, with an internal memorandum of Ingeominas dated 14 January 2010.\n\n315.\n\nIn the cover letter, Ingeominas explained that the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment was contrary to the interests of the Nation and that registration at the Mining Registry had been denied.252\n\nDoc. C-115, p. 1.\n\n316.\n\nIngeominas added that it would promptly reimburse Prodeco the USD 20.8 M already paid.\n\n317.\n\nFinally, Ingeominas invited Prodeco to an immediate and joint review of the pending aspects of the negotiations.253\n\nDoc. C-115, p. 2.\n\n**D. January 2010: Execution of the Eighth Amendment**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nUpon receipt of Ingeominas' letter dated 18 January 2010, negotiations between the parties resumed.\n\n319.\n\nIngeominas suggested minor adjustments to the royalty scheme. Namely, Ingeominas proposed maintaining the existing Royalty rate up to 8 MTA (*i.e*., a maximum flat 12.6% rate at 8 MTA), but that each additional MTA be subject to an additional 1% rate *(i.e.* the 9th MTA only would be subject to a 13.6% royalty rate, the 10th MTA only to a 14.6% royalty rate, and so on).254\n\nNagle I, para. 81.\n\n320.\n\nProdeco acquiesced to Ingeominas' proposed modifications.255\n\nNagle I, para. 81.\n\n321.\n\nHence, four days later, on 22 January 2010, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed the final version of the Eighth Amendment,256 which was registered with the National Mining Registry three days later.\n\nDoc. C-15.\n\n322.\n\nThe Parties agree that, save for the change to the new Royalty schedule suggested by Ingeominas, the Initial and final versions of the Eighth Amendment are practically identical.257\n\nNagle I, para. 82; Brattle I, para. 43.\n\n**E. Content of the Eighth Amendment**\n--------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment changed the Compensation Scheme and the Coal Reference Price.\n\n*Considerandos*\n---------------\n\n324.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment starts with six extensive *Considerandos.*\n\n325.\n\n*Considerando* 3 explains that on 21 May 2009 Prodeco and Ingeominas signed the Commitment to Negotiate regarding the Definitive Price dispute and *\"otros temas mencionados en dicho acuerdo de compromiso\".*\n\n326.\n\n*Considerando* 5 then describes the negotiations which took place and itemises the five areas where agreement had been reached:258\n\n- The first agreement was the decision not to change the Compensation Scheme in the Mining Contract for production, up to 8 MTA;\n\n- The second was to establish a limit on the percentage of Royalties to be applied for production above 8 MTA \"*de manera que sea factible la expansi\u00f3n del proyecto\";*\n\n- The third was to update the values used to calculate GIC payments;\n\n- The fourth was to clarify the formula used in the determination of the Additional Royalty;\n\n- And the fifth was to determine the Coal Reference Price using ICR, with a formula to introduce time lags reflecting Prodeco's actual sales price.\n\nDoc. C-15, p. 1.\n\n327.\n\nThe final *Considerando* sets out the goals of the Eighth Amendment: **.**259\n\n\"6. *Que con el presente acuerdo se garantizan los intereses del Estado y la viabilidad de la expansi\u00f3n del proyecto minero, lo cual ha sido el fundamento de la negociaci\u00f3n entre las partes\".*\n\nDoc. C-15, p. 2.\n\nClauses260\n----------\n\nDoc. C-15, pp. 2-9.\n\n328.\n\n**Clause 1** of the Eighth Amendment modifies clause 14.1 of the Mining Contract regarding the calculation of Royalties.\n\n329.\n\nUnder the Eighth Amendment, Prodeco undertakes to pay a Base Royalty of 7.6% for production up to 3 MTA, and an Additional Royalty of 1% for every 1 MTA increase in production, up to 8 MTA *(i.e.* 12.6%), on the totality of the coal sold.261 This was the scheme originally agreed upon in the Mining Contract.\n\nDoc. C-15, new Clause 14.1.\n\n330.\n\nOnce production exceeds 8 MTA, the Additional Royalty ceases to be levied on all the annual production. Instead, the 1% incremental royalty is applied only to the incremental MTA of production:\n\n- an additional 1% for production between 8 and 9 MTA,\n\n- an additional 2% for production between 9 and 10 MTA,\n\n- an additional 3% for production between 10 and 11 MTA, and so on.\n\n331.\n\nThis means that if total production is 9 MTA, a 12.6% royalty rate applies to the first 8 MTA and a 13.6% royalty rate applies to the 9th MTA only.\n\n332.\n\nAlthough the parties did not establish a limit on production, no production beyond 15 MTA was envisaged.\n\n333.\n\nIn addition, the Eighth Amendment also slightly modifies the provision of clause 14.1 related to the royalties applicable to the coal sold in the Colombian national market.\n\n334.\n\n**Clause 2** of the Eighth Amendment modifies clause 14.2 of the Mining Contract. It provides that the Base Royalty shall be paid monthly, within ten days of the end of the month, at the applicable exchange rate. As to the Additional Royalty, applicable when production exceeds both 3 MTA and 8 MTA, it shall be paid annually, within one month of the end of each year.\n\n335.\n\n**Clause 3** modifies clause 14.3 of the Mining Contract, which relates to the Coal Reference Price for the payment of royalties.\n\n336.\n\n*Pro memoria:* The Seventh Amendment had established that if the coal exported by Prodeco came exclusively from the Mine, the Coal Reference Price for payment of Royalties and GIC would be the higher of (i) the FOB Colombian port price for Colombian steam coal for the respective week as published in the ICR, adjusted for calorific value [defined as the \"FOB Price\"], and (ii) the actual sale price.262\n\nDoc. C-9, Annex 9A.\n\n337.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment introduces two relevant changes:\n\n- First, it does away with the \"higher of\u2019; consequently the Coal Reference Price is based only on the FOB Price in Colombian Port;\n\n- Second, it creates a new formula, which introduces a time lag; in essence the formula takes into account the FOB Prices in the 18 months preceding the calculation date, weighted by Prodeco\u2019s sales in the respective periods, on the basis of annual weighing coefficients, established *ex ante* (before 15 January of each year) by an independent auditor appointed by Ingeominas on 31 October of each year; these same coefficients are then also used to correct the compensation paid in the year in question.\n\nTransition Period\n-----------------\n\n338.\n\nUnder the new pricing formula, on each given date the Coal Reference Price is established by taking in consideration not only the FOB Price on such date, but also the FOB Prices which were applicable in the previous 18 months. This system of calculation creates a difficulty: how to calculate the weighing coefficient for the first year of application of the Eighth Amendment? Indeed, no independent auditor had yet been appointed who could have established the coefficients *ex ante*.\n\n339.\n\nJust as in the Initial Version, the Eighth Amendment came up with a solution called the *per\u00edodo de transici\u00f3n* [\"**Transition Period**\"]: during the first year of application of the Eighth Amendment, the weighing coefficients were already set by Prodeco and Ingeominas at 0,333. These coefficients were to be applied to the FOB Price which was applicable three, six, and nine months before each determination date.\n\n340.\n\nThis transitory regime was to be applied in the period between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2010; for this reason, this period was defined as the Transition Period.\n\n341.\n\nAs will be explained below, the Transition Period would become highly relevant, because in the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Fiscal Liability Proceeding the damage caused to the State is calculated using the Transition Period as the yardstick.\n\n342.\n\n**Clause 4** modifies clause 14.4 of the Mining Contract and defines the information regarding the payment of royalties that Prodeco has to provide to Ingeominas on a monthly basis.\n\n343.\n\n**Clause 5** modifies clause 43 of the Third Amendment to the Mining Contract, and eliminates Annexes 9 and 9A, which had been included in the Mining Contract by virtue of the Sixth Amendment.\n\n344.\n\n**Clause 6** modifies clauses 15.1.1 of the Mining Contract:\n\n- Clause 15.1.1 establishes new FOB price thresholds to calculate the GIC payments, as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | A Precio FOB US$/t | B Precio Base US$/t | C % Aplicable a diferencia | D Monto Fijo US$/t |  |\n|  | 59.94 < FOB < 67.43 | 59.94 | 1.0% | $0.00 |  |\n|  | 67.43 < FOB < 74.93 | 67.43 | 1.5% | $0.10 |  |\n|  | 74.93 < FOB < 82.42 | 74.93 | 7.5% | $0.25 |  |\n|  | 82.42 < FOB < 89.91 | 82.42 | 11.0% | $0.55 |  |\n|  | FOB > 89.91 | 89.91 | 12.5% | $1.05 |  |\n\n- Clause 15.1.2 provides that Prodeco and Ingeominas agree that these thresholds shall be adjusted quarterly by indexing to the Colombian consumer price index, as published by the DANE, the Colombian State entity in charge of statistics-263 even though the GIC thresholds are expressed in USD;264\n\n- Clause 15.1.3 establishes that the GIC shall be paid quarterly, within ten days of the end of the quarter;\n\n- Clause 15.4 determines that the GIC shall be paid on the basis of the Coal Reference Price set out in the new clause 14.3.\n\nDoc. C-15, new Clause 15.1.2.\n\nIt seems that Prodeco and Ingeominas were not able to find another suitable index (see Doc. C-132, p. 6; Doc. C-133, p. 2).\n\n345.\n\nPursuant to **Clause 7**, Prodeco agrees to pay approximately USD 20.8 M265 to Ingeominas to settle the outstanding amounts resulting from Ingeominas' interpretation of the Definitive Price term - without agreeing to such interpretation.\n\nUSD 9,713,947.49 and USD 11,085,718.06.\n\n346.\n\nIn turn, in **Clause 8**, Ingeominas declares that:266\n\n*\"Habida cuenta que con los acuerdos consagrados en los numerales anteriores se soluciona y por ende deja de existir la controversia que dio origen a la suscripci\u00f3n del Acuerdo de Compromiso y del presente otros\u00ed, y teniendo en cuenta que EL CONTRATISTA pagar\u00e1 las sumas indicadas en la cl\u00e1usula anterior, la AUTORIDAD MINERA declara subsanada cualquier causal de aplicaci\u00f3n de multas, caducidad o cualquier otra medida sobre la liquidaci\u00f3n de contraprestaciones econ\u00f3micas por raz\u00f3n de dicha controversia\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-15, p. 9.\n\n347.\n\n**Clause 9** provides that the Eighth Amendment shall be deemed to have entered into effect on 1 January 2010.\n\n348.\n\nIn **Clause 10**, Prodeco and Ingeominas undertake to review the Coal Reference Price formula within a year, to consider applying the API2-BC17 indexes.\n\n349.\n\nFinally, **Clause 11** determines that the Eighth Amendment shall enter into force upon its registration at the National Mining Registry.\n\n350.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment was duly registered in the Mining Registry on 25 January 2010,267 and consequently entered into force on that date, with retroactive effects as of 1 January.\n\nNagle I, para. 83.\n\n**F. The Meeting of the** ***Consejo Directivo*** **of 26 January 2010**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nOn 26 January 2010, Ingeominas again held a meeting of its *Consejo Directivo*. This time it was Mr. Ballesteros himself who informed the board members that the Eighth Amendment had been signed \"*teniendo en cuenta las sugerencias emitidas por ellos en consejos anteriores*\". He then provided detailed information on the agreed changes.268\n\nDoc. C-257, pp. 4-5.\n\n**G. January 2010: The Viability Study**\n----------------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nAt some point in January 2010, Ingeominas prepared a study of the *\"Viabilidad para la suscripci\u00f3n del Otros\u00ed No. 8 modificatorio del Contrato 044-89\"* [the \"**Viability Study**\"], which summarized the arguments which Ingeominas had taken into consideration when negotiating with Prodeco.269\n\nDoc. R-13.\n\n353.\n\nThe 8-page document was signed by Ms. Luz Aristiz\u00e1bal, Ms. Luz Mireya Gom\u00e9z, Ms. Melida Cabezas and Mr. Giovanny Balcero and was dated \"*el mes de enero de 2010*\".270 It is likely that the Viability Study was signed after the execution of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nDoc. R-13, p. 8.\n\n354.\n\nThe main conclusion of the Viability Study is the following:271\n\n*\"Con la suscripci\u00f3n del otros\u00ed descrito, se garantizan los intereses del Estado y la viabilidad de la expansi\u00f3n del proyecto minero, lo cual ha sido el fundamento de la negociaci\u00f3n entre las partes\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc.

R-13, p. 3.\n\n356.\n\nThe Viability Study explained that Prodeco had asked to review, *inter alia,* the following elements of the Mining Contract:\n\n- the price index for compensation,\n\n- FOB price vs. pithead prices,\n\n- the Additional Royalty, and\n\n- GIC.\n\nThe Viability Study acknowledged that Prodeco had presented several proposals and summarized these proposals in broad terms. The Viability Study also noted that the clauses of mining contracts could be freely negotiated between the mining authority and the contractor.273\n\nDoc. R-13, pp. 2-4.\n\n357.\n\nThe Viability Study found that the negotiations with Prodeco had the following benefits for the State:274\n\n- The clause regarding the Additional Royalty, which could give rise to a legal dispute, was no longer ambiguous: it was now clear that from 3 to 8 MTA, the Additional Royalty was applicable to all the coal sold and that the Coal Reference Price for the calculation of the Additional Royalty was not the price of the invoices;\n\n- For production in excess of 8 MTA, the increase in Royalties was capped, but such limitation was necessary to guarantee the expansion of the Calenturitas Mine and, consequently, the economic development of the region;\n\n- The GIC thresholds had to be updated to take into consideration inflation, since production costs exceeded USD 42 per tonne of coal, surpassing the GIC threshold; the threshold had to be indexed towards the future, and for this purpose, after extensive analysis, the Colombian consumer price index was selected;\n\n- Any doubts regarding the Coal Reference Price for the payment of Royalties and GIC were cleared up; the new Coal Reference Price was now based on the ICR index.\n\nDoc. R-13, pp. 4-5.\n\n358.\n\nThe Viability Study also explained that Ingeominas had compared all the mining projects with production exceeding 8 MTA in the past 22 months and had found that Prodeco would always generate more revenues for the State than other projects. The Study contained the following chart in support of this finding:275\n\nDoc. R-13, p. 7.\n\n**(6) Performance of the Eighth Amendment**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**A. February 2010: Payment Under the Eighth Amendment**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nOn 16 February 2010, Prodeco for the second time paid to Ingeominas USD 20.8 M, as required by the Eighth Amendment (the first payment due under the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment had in the meantime been returned by Ingeominas).276\n\nDoc.

R-77, p. 62; Doc. R-78.\n\n**C. June 2010: The 2010 PTI**\n------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nIn the meantime, Prodeco was preparing an updated long-term PTI, which was due in May 2009,278 but had been delayed due to the negotiations between the Parties.279\n\nSee section **III.(2)****.D** *supra.*\n\nDoc. R-25, p. 3.\n\nThe 2006 PTI\n------------\n\n362.\n\n*Pro memoria:* The 2006 PTI had been prepared before execution of the Seventh Amendment (which extended the life of the Mining Contract until 2035)280 and of the Eighth Amendment (which changed the Compensation Scheme). The exploration in Sectors B and D of the Mine and the diversion of the Calenturitas River also took place after 2006.281\n\nSee sections **III.(1)****.F** and **III.(1)****.G** *supra.*\n\nDoc. C-117 / CLEX-28, pp. 52-53.\n\n363.\n\nIn the 2006 PTI Prodeco had planned to expand the Mine's total coal production to 116 MT. Annual production would gradually increase from 4.4 MTA in 2007 to 10 MTA from 2010 through 2019.282\n\nSee section **III.(1)****.F** *supra.*\n\n364.\n\nThe 2006 PTI also foresaw an investment of USD 500.1 M in the period 2007-2010 (broken down as USD 196.4 M for equipment, USD 114.6 M for railway, USD 85.2 M for infrastructure and USD 103.9 M for port and sundry investments).\n\n365.\n\nBy 2010, these investments had mostly been carried out: the stock of investment had increased between 2006 and 2010 from USD 162.5 M283 to USD 644.2 M,284*i.e.* by USD 481.7 M.\n\nDoc. C-78, p. 174.\n\nDoc. C-117, p. 195.\n\nThe 2010 PTI\n------------\n\n366.\n\nIn June 2010, Prodeco delivered to Ingeominas an updated long-term PTI [the \"**2010 PTI**\"],285 pursuant to which it expected to achieve the following objectives:\n\nDoc. C-117.\n\n367.\n\nAnnual production : Annual production would reach 6.4 MTA in 2010, rise to 7.6 MTA in 2011 (2006 PTI: 4.4 MTA), and progressively increase until reaching a maximum of 14.2 MTA in 2019 (2006 PTI: 10 MTA), and then progressively decrease until 2032 (2006 PTI: no production after 2019).286\n\nDoc. C-117, pp. 59, 61 and 199.\n\n368.\n\nMine-life production : Prodeco expected to produce approximately 254 MT of coal from 2010 through 2032287 (more than doubling the 2006 PTI estimation of 116 MT between 2007 and 2019).\n\nDoc. C-117, p. 61.\n\n369.\n\nInvestment 2010-2015 : USD 654 M was to be invested in the development of the Mine, including in railway and port infrastructure, in the five-year period288 between 2011 and 2015289 (2006 PTI: USD 684.4 M spread-out over the 13-year period 2007-2020).290\n\nThe 2010 PTI is not very clear as to the initial date of the five-year period; the PTI, proposed in June 2010 and approved in December 2010, simply says that the amounts are to be invested *\"en los pr\u00f3ximos 5 a\u00f1os\"* (p. 191). The Tribunal assumes this to mean in the period 2011 through 2015.\n\nDoc. C-117, pp. 173 and 176.\n\nDoc. C-78, p. 173.\n\n370.\n\nMine-life investment : USD 1,477 M291 (2006 PTI: USD 1,184 M).292\n\nDoc. C-117, p. 191.\n\nDoc. C-78, p. 173.\n\n371.\n\nNet present value : the Mine offered a NPV of USD 116 M (2006 PTI: USD 98 M) (both at a 15% discount rate), assuming costs of USD 47.26 per tonne (2006 PTI: USD 24.79) and a coal price of USD 55 per tonne293 (2006 PTI: USD 42.58).\n\nDoc. C-117, pp. 191 and 204.\n\n372.\n\nMine-life Royalties : estimated at USD 1,782 M294 (2006 PTI: 671 M).\n\nDoc. C-117, p. 200.\n\n373.\n\nThe 2010 PTI was approved by Ingeominas on 6 December 2010, after asking Prodeco to make minor modifications.295\n\nDoc. C-122.\n\n**D. 2010-2015: Promised Investments**\n--------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nAs enshrined in its preamble, the Eighth Amendment had two main goals:\n\n- To guarantee that the Mine expansion was viable, and\n\n- To maximize the income for the State.\n\n375.\n\nThe Preamble expresses this idea with the following words:296\n\n\"[...] *con el presente acuerdo se garantizan los intereses del Estado y la viabilidad de la expansi\u00f3n del proyecto minero, lo cual ha sido el fundamento de la negociaci\u00f3n entre las partes\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-15, *Considerando* 6.\n\n376.\n\nIn other words: under the Eighth Amendment, Prodeco accepted the commitment to carry out significant investments in the Mine and to expand its production capabilities; the increased production would generate additional Royalties, with the end result that Colombia would receive a higher revenue.\n\n377.\n\nAs Mr. Nagle said in his testimony, the investments and production levels projected in the 2010 PTI were \"negotiation commitment(s)\" that \"led to them [Ingeominas] agreeing and us [Prodeco] agreeing to this *Otros\u00ed\".*297 And Minister Mart\u00ednez Torres confirmed that through the Eighth Amendment, Prodeco committed to increase production beyond 8 MTA.298\n\nHT, Day 3, (Mr. Nagle\u2019s deposition), p. 875, l. 22 - p. 876, l. 2.\n\nHT, Day 4, p. 1129, l. 5 - p. 1130, l. 7.\n\n378.\n\nWhat were the concrete levels of investment and production promised by Prodeco?\n\n379.\n\nThe quantified objectives were not set forth in the Eighth Amendment, but rather in the 2010 PTI - a semi-contractual document proposed by Prodeco and approved by Ingeominas in June 2010.\n\n380.\n\nAccording to the 2010 PTI, Prodeco undertook to invest USD 654 M in the five-year period 2011 through 2015, broken down in:299\n\n- USD 243 M for mining equipment,\n\n- USD 7.6 M for railways,\n\n- USD 40 M for infrastructure,\n\n- USD 301 M for port, and\n\n- USD 62.4 for sundry investments.\n\nDoc. C-117, p. 194.\n\n381.\n\nClaimants say that in fact they invested much higher amounts: USD 465 M in 2011, USD 300 M in 2012, USD 75 M in 2013 and USD 45 M in 2014,300 totaling USD 885 M. These figures are not challenged by Respondent.301 Prodeco consequently invested in the period 2011-2014 some USD 231 M more than anticipated in 2010.\n\nMcManus I, fn. 18.\n\nR II, para. 211.\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Prodeco indeed complied with its investment commitments under the Eighth Amendment and the 2010 PTI.\n\n**E. 2010-2018: Coal Production and Royalties**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nUnder the 2010 PTI the production of the Mine for the years 2010-2018 was planned to reach certain levels; in reality, production was for most of the years lower:302\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n|  | Year | 2006 PTI (MTA) | 2010 PTI (MTA) | Actual production (MTA) | Royalties paid (including GIC) (COP Million) | **FX Rate** (Avg) | Royalties paid (including GIC) (USD Million) |  |\n|  | [1] | [2] | [3] | [4] | [5] | [6] |\n| 2006 | - | - | 2.9 | 22,638 | 2,359 | 9.6 |\n| 2007 | 4.4 | - | 3.2 | 37,215 | 2,076 | 17.9 |\n| 2008 | 4.2 | - | 4.7 | 100,329 | 1,967 | 51.0 |\n| 2009 | 8.0 | - | 5.7 | 140,698 | 2,153 | 65.3 |\n| 2010 | 10.0 | 6.4 | 5.2 | 63,391 | 1,899 | 33.4 |\n| 2011 | 10.0 | 7.6 | 7.6 | 135,571 | 1,847 | 73.4 |\n| 2012 | 10.0 | 11.5 | 10.2 | 250,819 | 1,798 | 139.5 |\n| 2013 | 10.0 | 11.5 | 11.6 | 236,466 | 1,869 | 126.5 |\n| 2014 | 10.0 | 12.5 | 12.6 | 230,769 | 2,000 | 115.4 |\n| 2015 | 10.0 | 13.8 | 11.0 | 223,052 | 2,743 | 81.3 |\n| 2016 | 10.0 | 13.8 | 11.1 | 225,327 | 3,051 | 73.9 |\n| **2017** | 10.0 | 131 | 9.8 | 248,513 | 2,951 | 84.2 |\n| 2018 | 10.0 | 13.8 | 7 | 216,127 | 3,216 | 67.2 |\n| **TOTAL** | 106.6 | 104.7 | 102.5 | 2,113,464 | n.a. | 938.6 |\n\nTable of actual production and royalties paid between 2006 and 2017, sent by Claimants on 14 March 2019.\n\nCoal production\n---------------\n\n384.\n\nActual production for the period 2010-2018 was thus only 86.1 MT, while the 2010 PTI had foreseen production of more than 100 MT.\n\n385.\n\nOne reason for this decrease in production is that in 2016 Prodeco performed a geological reappraisal of the Mine, with negative results. In accordance with the new studies, the available reserves had to be reduced from 254 MT (the amount foreseen in the 2010 PTI) to 170 MT. This reduction in available coal was reflected in the 2016 PTI, which was approved by Ingeominas.303\n\nHT, Day 6, (Prof. Spiller\u2019s deposition), p. 1441, l. 17 - p. 1442, l. 21. See also Compass Lexecon II, paras. 62-63.\n\n386.\n\nProduction in 2015 and 2016 was also disincentivized by very low international prices for coal, and the years 2016 and 2017 turned out to be extremely wet, thus impairing mining activities.304\n\nDoc.

C-117, p. 200.\n\nDoc. C-78, p. 177.\n\n(7) **The Fiscal Liability Proceeding**\n---------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* is an autonomous agency of the Colombian State, entrusted with the supervision and control of the use of public funds.307 The main task of the agency is to establish what the law calls \"*responsabilidad fiscal*\", *i.e*. the responsibility of civil servants and private individuals for the mismanagement of public funds or assets.308\n\nDoc. C-68, Art. 267: \"*El control fiscal es una funci\u00f3n p\u00fablica que ejercer\u00e1 la Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica, la cual vigila la gesti\u00f3n fiscal de la administraci\u00f3n y de los particulares o entidades que manejen fondos o bienes de la Naci\u00f3n*\".\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 1. Art. 268(5) of the *Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica* provides that the *Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica* is competent to \"*establecer la responsabilidad que se derive de la gesti\u00f3n fiscal, imponer las sanciones pecuniarias que sean del caso, recaudar su monto y ejercer la jurisdicci\u00f3n coactiva sobre los alcances deducidos de la misma*\" (Doc. C-68).\n\n389.\n\nFiscal responsibility is established through an administrative procedure, which is initiated, conducted, and decided by the *Contralor\u00eda* itself.\n\n390.\n\nMs. Soraya Vargas, who acted as *Contralora Delegada Intersectorial de Regal\u00edas adscrita a la Unidad de Investigaciones Especiales contra la Corrupci\u00f3n* from 2013 to 2016309 and approved the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision, has provided the following diagram, explaining how a preliminary investigation and a fiscal liability proceeding unfold:310\n\nDoc. R-26. See also Vargas I, para. 9.\n\nVargas I, para. 21.\n\n391.\n\nThis fiscal liability proceeding may be preceded by a preliminary investigation *(indagaci\u00f3n preliminar),* although this is not mandatory.311 The proceedings are divided into two phases: the first one is preceded by a formal decision *(\"decision de apertura*\") and requires that the allegedly responsible civil servants or private persons be heard. Thereafter the *Contralor\u00eda* may decide to close the file, or to issue an \"*Auto de imputaci\u00f3n*\" against certain persons. In the second phase evidence is marshalled, leadings to the *fallo*, either absolving or declaring the fiscal liability of those imputed and ordering those found responsible to indemnify the Republic for the damage caused to it.\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 39: \"*Si no existe certeza sobre la ocurrencia del hecho, la causaci\u00f3n del da\u00f1o patrimonial con ocasi\u00f3n de su acaecimiento, la entidad afectada y la determinaci\u00f3n de los presuntos responsables, podr\u00e1 ordenarse indagaci\u00f3n preliminar por un t\u00e9rmino m\u00e1ximo de seis (6) meses, al cabo de los cuales solamente proceder\u00e1 el archivo de las diligencias o la apertura del proceso de responsabilidad fiscal\".*\n\nNature of the Proceso de Responsabilidad Fiscal\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nThe *Proceso de Responsabilidad Fiscal* is a purely administrative and inquisitorial procedure, in which the *Contralor\u00eda* investigates the facts and then issues a decision *(fallo)* The *Contralor\u00eda* itself has described it in the following words:312\n\n\"[...] *el proceso de responsabilidad fiscal es un procedimiento administrativo de car\u00e1cter patrimonial que persigue la reparaci\u00f3n de un da\u00f1o causado al patrimonio del Estado por un servidor p\u00fablico o un particular en ejercicio de gesti\u00f3n fiscal o con ocasi\u00f3n de esta como consecuencia de una conducta dolosa o gravemente culposa*\".\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 113.\n\n393.\n\nAn important trait of the *Proceso de Responsabilidad Fiscal* is that the *Contralor\u00eda* acts simultaneously as prosecutor and as judge *vis-\u00e0-vis* the civil servant or private individual who is being investigated. In one of its decisions, the *Contralor\u00eda* has acknowledged this fact and has provided the following description of how the *Proceso* develops:313\n\n\"[...] *en el proceso de responsabilidad fiscal no opera el concepto de partes que aparece cabalmente dise\u00f1ado en el proceso judicial, en el cual existe un juez, que es el encargado de dirimir la controversia, y unas partes con intereses opuestos. En la actuaci\u00f3n administrativa, la administraci\u00f3n funge como juez y como parte frente a un administrado que es el sujeto que puede resultar afectado con la decisi\u00f3n que se adopte dentro de la respectiva actuaci\u00f3n\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-26, p. 8.\n\n394.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that this is an administrative procedure, the law authorizes the *Contralor\u00eda* to order the preliminary attachment of assets belonging to the civil servant or private person under investigation (without requiring judicial approval).314\n\nDoc. C-71, Art.12.\n\n395.\n\nThe *Proceso* will eventually lead to a decision *(fallo),* in which the *Contralor\u00eda* (by itself, and without the participation of a judge) decides whether the indicted person is to be absolved or to be found guilty. In this latter situation, the *fallo* will order the person declared *fiscalmente responsable* immediately to pay the amount required to compensate the Republic for the damage it suffered.315\n\nDoc. C-71, Arts. 53 and 54.\n\n396.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that the *fallo* is an administrative act, taken by a civil servant. As the *Contralor\u00eda* acknowledged in one of its decisions:316\n\n\"[...] *ni el Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica, ni los contralores delegados intersectoriales administran justicia en nombre de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia, no ejercen funciones jurisdiccionales, esto es, no son jueces, y los procesos de responsabilidad fiscal se adelantan en ejercicio de sus funciones de control* [...]\".\n\nDoc. C-35, p. 35.\n\n397.\n\nAfter its issuance by the *Contralor Delegado* (and its appeal to the *Contralor General)*317 the *fallo* becomes final. If the civil servant or particular that has been found laible disagrees with the *Contralor\u00eda's* findings, the *fallo* may then be challenged before the Colombian Courts through a *procedimiento contencioso administrativo,*318 but this review of the *fallo* by the Colombian Courts occurs *ex post*.\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 64.\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 59.\n\n**A. The Preliminary Investigation**\n------------------------------------\n\n398.\n\nA few months after the execution of the Eighth Amendment, a scandal erupted concerning allegedly corrupt practices in Ingeominas.319\n\nParedes I, para. 26. See also Doc. R-42; Doc. R-170.\n\n399.\n\nIn light of the scandal, but also of audits which the *Contralor\u00eda* had been conducting in Ingeominas,320 on 8 October 2010, the newly appointed *Contralora General de la Rep\u00fablica,* Ms. Sandra Morelli, decided to constitute an *Equipo Especial de Reacci\u00f3n Inmediata* [\"**Immediate Reaction Team**\"], with the goal of:321\n\n\"[...] *analizar la situaci\u00f3n que comporta un especial inter\u00e9s nacional y que eventualmente podr\u00eda comprometer el patrimonio p\u00fablico del Estado en lo referente a las presuntas irregularidades en el manejo contractual que INGEOMINAS le ha dado a los contratos con la Sociedad CERRO MATOSO S.A., Sociedad DRUMMOND y Sociedad C.I PRODECO S.A.*\".\n\nDoc. R-28, p. 2.\n\nDoc. C-118 / R-27. See also Vargas I, paras. 34-37.\n\n400.\n\nConsequently, on 19 October 2010, the *Contralor\u00eda* opened an *indagaci\u00f3n preliminar* into Ingeominas [\"**Preliminary Investigation**\"].322 The Investigation would start with a visit to the offices of Ingeominas, to examine all the documents related to the contracts of Cerro Matoso and Drummond (also suspected mining companies), and of Prodeco.323\n\nDoc. C-120.\n\nDoc. C-120, Second Resolution, p. 6.\n\n401.\n\nOn 20 October 2010, the Immediate Reaction Team visited the offices of Ingeominas and asked for the files regarding Drummond, Cerro Matoso, and Prodeco, and particularly documents post-dating 20 06.324 Ingeominas delivered a series of documents, as requested.325\n\nDoc. R-30, p. 1.\n\nDoc. R-167.\n\n402.\n\nOn 27 October 2010, the *Contralor\u00eda* interviewed two Ingeominas officers who had been involved in the negotiations of the Eighth Amendment, Ms. Luz Aristiz\u00e1bal and Mr. Giovanny Balcero.326*Pro memoria,* these individuals had signed the Viability Study; Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal had been in charge of making presentations to Ingeominas' *Consejo Directivo,* and Mr. Balcero had prepared a memorandum in October 2009 regarding Prodeco's NPV.\n\nDoc. C-121. See also C I, para. 74 and R I, para. 232.\n\n403.\n\nOver the following months, Ingeominas replied to several requests for information from the Immediate Reaction Team.327\n\nDoc. C-124; Doc. C-125.\n\n404.\n\nIn March 2011, the Immediate Reaction Team finalized its report,328 which was divided into three sub-reports, for each of the mining projects. Ms. Johanna Tovar Silva was in charge of the report on Prodeco [the \"**Tovar Silva Report**\"].329\n\nDoc. R-32.\n\nDoc. C-125.\n\n405.\n\nThe Tovar Silva Report recounted the history of the Mining Contract and the amendments thereto. It also summarized the negotiations between Prodeco and Ingeominas regarding the Eighth Amendment.\n\n406.\n\nThe Tovar Silva Report concluded that:\n\n- Prodeco had not marshalled evidence proving that the mining project would be unviable without the Eighth Amendment;330\n\n- There had been no juridical, technical, or financial reasons to modify the economic conditions of the Mining Contract;\n\n- Ingeominas had failed to properly analyse the impact of the Eighth Amendment;331\n\n- The modifications to the compensation scheme under the Eighth Amendment were detrimental for Colombia, since in 2010 Colombia had received less revenues than it would have received under the previous compensation scheme.\n\nDoc. C-125, p. 21.\n\nDoc. C-125, p. 22.\n\n407.\n\nThe Tovar Silva Report based its finding on the so-called Transition Period contemplated in the Eighth Amendment, which was the period between 1 January and 31 December 2010.\n\n408.\n\nMs. Tovar Silva's analysis draws attention to one of the main issues confronted in the *Contralor\u00eda* 's analysis: how to calculate the damage caused in a long-term contract. As Ms. Tovar Silva explains, in this type of contract there is a possibility that losses in one year are offset by gains in succeeding years - thus making the calculation of the damage caused more uncertain. To resolve this difficulty, Ms. Tovar Silva decided to focus on the one-year *\"per\u00edodo de transici\u00f3n\"* foreseen in the Eighth Amendment, which in her opinion \"*se ha consolidado plenamente*\", and then to calculate the damage as the loss of income suffered by the Republic in that period - disregarding all possible events in subsequent years.\n\n409.\n\nProdeco would not be notified of the Tovar Silva Report until August 20 1 2332 (more than a year later).\n\nDoc. C-146, p. 4.\n\n**B. The** ***Contralor\u00eda*** **Initiates the Fiscal Liability Proceeding**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nOn 10 May 2011, the *Contralor\u00eda* closed the Preliminary Investigation333 and decided to start Fiscal Liability Proceeding against:334\n\n- Prodeco, and\n\n- Mr. Jos\u00e9 Fernando Ceballos, Ingeominas' *Director del Servicio Minero,* who had signed the Eighth Amendment on behalf of Ingeominas.\n\nDoc. R-36. The *Contralor\u00eda* officially closed the visits to Ingeominas' facilities on 14 April 2011 (Doc. R-31).\n\nDoc. C-17.\n\n411.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* based this decision on the conclusions of the Tovar Silva Report.335 The *Contralor\u00eda* found that all the audited mining contracts (including those of Drummond and Cerro Matoso) contained irregularities, but that only Prodeco\u2019s contract had actually caused damage to the State\u2019s finances and could give rise to fiscal responsibility.336\n\nDoc. C-17, pp. 13 *et seq.*\n\nDoc. C-17, pp. 8 and 43.\n\n412.\n\nThe Proceedings sought to collect COP 51.35 billion (approximately USD 29 M at the exchange rate of the time),337 which was calculated as the difference between the Royalties and GIC that Prodeco would have paid during the Transition Period under the old regime, and those actually paid under the Eighth Amendment.338\n\nC I, para. 79.\n\nDoc. C-17, p. 41: \"[...] *de no haberse modificado la f\u00f3rmula para el c\u00e1lculo y de la compensaci\u00f3n por ingresos brutos y la del c\u00e1lculo de regalias, el Estado habria recibido -tan solo en el periodo de transici\u00f3n-la suma de $51,353,629,267,07, valor que para efectos del Proceso de Responsabilidad Fiscal, se entiende como la cuantia estimada del da\u00f1o\".* See also Doc. C-17, p. 38.\n\n413.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* explained that it was pursuing Mr. Ceballos because Ingeominas was in charge of collecting royalties and compensation, which, according to the Colombian *Constituci\u00f3n Politica,* are resources of the State.339\n\nDoc. C-17, p. 11.\n\n414.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* also found that it could pursue Prodeco for two reasons:340\n\n- Because Prodeco was the *\"orientador\"* of the Eighth Amendment, and\n\n- Because it provided information to Ingeominas, which Ingeominas used in its *\"evaluaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica y econ\u00f3mica\".*\n\nDoc. C-17, pp. 41-42.\n\n415.\n\nAccording to the *Contralor\u00eda,* Prodeco was not simply a third party, whose actions were limited to paying compensation to Ingeominas; on the contrary, Prodeco had a close and necessary relation with Ingeominas\u2019 fiscal management and hence should be made responsible through the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.341\n\nDoc. C-17, pp. 42-43.\n\n416.\n\nA few days later, Prodeco was notified of the start of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.342\n\nDoc. C-127. Ingeominas was also notified of the start of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding (Doc. R-51).\n\n**C. Depositions**\n------------------\n\n417.\n\nBecause the *Contralor\u00eda* must ensure due process rights in its Fiscal Liability Proceeding, including *inter alia* the right to present a defence and to be heard,343 the *Contralor\u00eda* called Mr. Ceballos and a representative of Prodeco to depose.\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 2: *\"En el ejercicio de la acci\u00f3n de responsabilidad fiscal se garantizar\u00e1 el debido proceso y su tr\u00e1mite se adelantar\u00e1 con sujeci\u00f3n a los principios establecidos en los articulos 29 y 209 de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica y a los contenidos en el C\u00f3digo Contencioso Administrativo\"\".* See also Vargas I, para. 20.\n\n418.\n\nOn 9 June 2011, Mr. Ceballos declared to the *Contralor\u00eda* that:344\n\n- He had worked as *Director del Servicio Minero* from November 2009 to August 2010 and by the time he joined the process, Prodeco and Ingeominas had already conducted extensive negotiations (*pro memoria*, the Commitment to Negotiate was signed in May 2009 and the Eighth Amendment in January 2010);\n\n- Both Mr. Ballesteros and the *Consejo Directivo*, including the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* had always been informed about Prodeco\u2019s proposals and the analyses that were being conducted;\n\n- The employees of the *Subdirecci\u00f3n de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n y Ordenamiento Minero345* in charge of the Eighth Amendment were competent to interpret the mining legislation and to conduct the necessary analysis; in January 2010, these employees had prepared a Viability Study supporting the viability of the Eighth Amendment;\n\n- The Eighth Amendment had been the object of a detailed analysis and there had been no rushed decisions:346\n\n\"[...] *el otros\u00ed No. 8 no fue un documento que apareci\u00f3 de un momento a otro, ni que lo hubiera firmado de manera aislada sino que fue el producto de una acci\u00f3n previamente analizada discutida al interior de Ingeominas, teniendo en cuenta las diferentes propuestas presentadas por Prodeco y siempre teniendo en la mira buscar condiciones m\u00e1s favorables para el Estado*\".\n\n- Prodeco\u2019s proposed expansion of the Calenturitas Mine and the new compensation scheme would, in the long-run, generate much higher revenues to the State, compared to the previous regime.\n\nDoc. C-128, pp. 1-2.\n\nMr. Ceballos said that these employees were Ms. Luz Marina Aristiz\u00e1bal (engineer), Ms. Luz Mireya G\u00f3mez R\u00edos (economist), Ms. M\u00e9lida Andrea Cabezas (legal counsel) and Mr. Giovanny Balcero (engineer).\n\nDoc. C-128, pp. 4-5.\n\n419.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Ceballos delivered the January 2010 Viability Study and asked that the *Contralor\u00eda* call the four Ingeominas employees in charge of the Eighth Amendment to testify.347\n\nDoc. C-128, p. 3.\n\n420.\n\nTwo days later, Ms. Margarita Zuleta, an officer of Prodeco, who had signed the Eighth Amendment on the company\u2019s behalf, was also called to give her statement to the *Contralor\u00eda*. Ms. Zuleta described the negotiations between Prodeco and Ingeominas and explained the rationale behind the Eighth Amendment.348 Ms. Zuleta explained:349\n\n*\"Finalmente creo que es importante tener en cuenta que el proyecto Calenturitas iba a producir Carb\u00f3n solo hasta 8 millones de toneladas y que el otros\u00ed No. 8 permiti\u00f3 a Prodeco expandir su operaci\u00f3n por encima de 8 millones de toneladas, lo cual requiere de importantes inversiones en equipo y personal las cuales nunca hubieran sido efectuadas si el VPN de la expansi\u00f3n hubiera sido inferior a cero. En consecuencia, la Naci\u00f3n con el otros\u00ed No. 8 tiene un ingreso adicional en regal\u00eda y contraprestaciones consistente en las contraprestaciones aplicables a los tonelajes superiores a 8 millones de toneladas al a\u00f1o. Por lo cual Prodeco considera que el otros\u00ed No. 8 en ning\u00fan caso implica un detrimento para la Naci\u00f3n por el contrario implica unos ingresos adicionales derivados de la explotaci\u00f3n adicional a 8 millones de toneladas al a\u00f1o. Una vez el otros\u00ed No. 8 fue perfeccionado, Prodeco present\u00f3 a Ingeominas un plan de trabajo de inversiones para explotar hasta 15 millones de toneladas al a\u00f1o\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-129; Doc. R-171.\n\nDoc. R-171, p. 3.\n\n421.\n\nMs. Zuleta concluded that the *Contralor\u00eda* should employ financial advisors to study the case in detail and that Prodeco\u2019s team was available to answer any questions of the *Contralor\u00eda.350*\n\nDoc. R-171, p. 4.\n\n422.\n\nIn August 2011, Prodeco sent a letter to the *Contralor\u00eda*, explaining in detail the negotiation process between Prodeco and Ingeominas and the motivations behind the Eighth Amendment. Prodeco argued that it had not caused damage to the State and requested that the *Contralor\u00eda* close the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.351\n\nDoc. C-130.\n\n**D. Statements by Officers of Ingeominas and the Ministry of Mines**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nIn light of Mr. Ceballos\u2019 request for further evidence, in late September 2011 the *Contralor\u00eda* summoned several officers of Ingeominas and the Ministry of Mines and Energy to testify.352 The *Contralor\u00eda* also ordered the production of a technical report by an economics specialist with knowledge of the energy sector.353\n\nDoc. R-39 and Doc. C-131.\n\nDoc. R-39, p. 4.\n\n424.\n\nBetween 24 and 26 October 2011, the *Contralor\u00eda* deposed the Ingeominas officials who had signed the Viability Study (as explained in detail below, a. to d.) and an employee of the Ministry of Mines (e.). Before testifying, these witnesses were required to swear to tell the truth and the *Contralor\u00eda* informed them of the consequences of perjury.354 Counsel for Prodeco and Mr. Ceballos, and Mr. Ceballos himself, were present at these depositions.355\n\nC I, para. 85; R I, para. 240. See also Docs. C-132 to C-136.\n\nDocs. C-132 to C-136.\n\n425.\n\n(a) Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal - who had already given a statement during the Preliminary Investigation - declared that there had been numerous meetings between Prodeco and Ingeominas, although not all were documented, to discuss an amendment to the Mining Contract. She further confirmed that Prodeco\u2019s costs had significantly increased between 2003 and 2008 and that under the previous compensation scheme it would not have been possible to expand the Mine. Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal also noted that Prodeco was paying the highest royalties in comparison with other projects. Finally, she said that she had handed several documents to the Immediate Reaction Team that were not part of the file of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.356\n\nDoc. C-132.\n\n426.\n\n(b) Ms. Luz Mireya G\u00f3mez - who together with Mr. Balcero had prepared Ingeominas\u2019 memorandum of October 2009 - declared that there had been weekly meetings between Prodeco and Ingeominas to discuss Prodeco\u2019s proposals and that Mr. Ballesteros and Ingeominas\u2019 *Consejo Directivo* had always been kept informed of the negotiations. Ms. G\u00f3mez also confirmed that there had been a significant increase in coal production costs in the past ten years. Ms. G\u00f3mez explained that Prodeco and Ingeominas had agreed that the GIC threshold would be adjusted quarterly by reference to the Colombian consumer price index, because it resulted in lower increases in prices than other indexes. Finally, she said that:357\n\n\"*En el momento en que se realiz\u00f3 la negociaci\u00f3n del otros\u00ed no existia un procedimiento en el Instituto para adelantar este tipo de negociaciones y con ocasi\u00f3n de un plan de mejoramiento (posterior a la fecha de suscripci\u00f3n del otros\u00ed No. 8), se implement\u00f3 el procedimiento respectivo\".*\n\nDoc. C-133, p. 2.\n\n427.\n\n(c) Mr. Balcero - who also had given a statement during the Preliminary Investigation - explained that he had made a technical analysis of Prodeco\u2019s proposal; he had found that Prodeco\u2019s proposal was justified by the need to expand the Mine, and that this would ultimately benefit Colombia. Mr. Balcero stated that he had run several economic models, upon the request of Ingeominas\u2019 *Consejo Directivo.* Mr. Balcero confirmed, as did Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal and Ms. G\u00f3mez, that Mr. Ballesteros and Ingeominas\u2019 *Consejo Directivo* had always been informed of the negotiation process and that production costs had increased in the past 10 years. Mr. Balcero also directed the *Contralor\u00eda* to the Viability Study. Finally, Mr. Balcero declared that the Eighth Amendment had prompted Prodeco to make significant investments in the Calenturitas Mine in 2010.358\n\nDoc. C-134.\n\n428.\n\n(d) Ms. Melida Cabezas - who had been in charge of the legal aspects of the negotiation with Prodeco - stated that in mid-2009 Ingeominas\u2019 officials had found that Prodeco\u2019s proposal was not technically or legally viable. However, Mr. Ballesteros had asked them to come up with a counter-proposal to offer Prodeco. After conducting further studies, Ingeominas\u2019 officials found that an expansion of the Mine would benefit the Colombian State. Ms. Cabezas also confirmed that Mr. Ballesteros and the *Consejo Directivo* had been fully informed of the negotiations.359\n\nDoc. C-135.\n\n429.\n\n(e) Ms. Maria D\u00edaz L\u00f3pez, Chief Legal Advisor to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, declared that Ingeominas\u2019 officers had kept the *Consejo Directivo* informed of Prodeco\u2019s requests for an amendment to the Mining Contract. Ms. D\u00edaz L\u00f3pez explained that the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda* had given several recommendations to Ingeominas and that the aim of the negotiation was to increase royalty payments for the State and to expand the Mine.360\n\nDoc. C-136.\n\n**E. The** ***Contralor\u00eda*** **Extends the Indictment and Attaches Assets**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nOn 26 April 2012, the *Contralor\u00eda* ordered the production of further evidence in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, including, *inter alia*, all the documents and calculations that had served as the basis for the Viability Study.361\n\nDoc. R-40.\n\n431.\n\nAs a result of this new evidence, on 11 July 2012, the *Contralor\u00eda* decided to extend the indictment to additional civil servants. In addition to Mr. Ceballos and Prodeco, previously indicted, the *Contralor\u00eda* indicted the former *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda*, Mr. Ballesteros, and the four Ingeominas officers who had been involved in the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment, to wit:\n\n- Mr. Hern\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez Torres, who was the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda* at the relevant time; the *Contralor\u00eda* considered that Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres\u2019 action as member of Ingeominas\u2019 *Consejo Directivo* had been passive or careless, whereas it should have been active and decisive;362\n\n- Mr. Ballesteros, Ingeominas\u2019 *Director General* at the relevant time; the *Contralor\u00eda* found that Mr. Ballesteros had failed to comply with the appropriate controls and procedures, and to conduct the appropriate analysis;363\n\n- Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal, Ms. Cabezas, Mr. Balcero, and Ms. G\u00f3mez, as officers of Ingeominas\u2019 *Subdirecci\u00f3n de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n y Ordenamiento Minero*, involved in the process of the Eighth Amendment; the *Contralor\u00eda* considered them suspect because they had signed the Viability Study, although they had previously declared that a modification of the Mining Contract was not warranted.364\n\nDoc. C-18, pp. 5-6.\n\nDoc. C-18, pp. 7-9.\n\nDoc. C-18, pp. 9-12.\n\nPreliminary Attachment\n----------------------\n\n432.\n\nOn 17 July 2012 the *Contralor\u00eda* decided, as precautionary measures, to attach assets belonging to each of the civil servants indicted in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.365 These attachments were aimed at guaranteeing the State\u2019s right to be compensated for the damage caused - which had been estimated at USD 29 M for the Transition Period.366\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the *Contralor\u00eda* did not attach any assets of Mr. Ceballos (Doc. C-19).\n\nDoc. C-19, p. 5 and Doc. C-20, p. 5: *\"Para hacer efectiva la funci\u00f3n que desarrolla este \u00f3rgano de vigilancia y control, cuando se examina la gesti\u00f3n fiscal y determina la responsabilidad fiscal del servidor p\u00fablico y/o particular que administra bienes o fondos del Estado, se hace imperioso practicar las medidas cautelares como instrumento eficaz, sin las cuales no se materializar\u00eda el resarcimiento del da\u00f1o patrimonial al Estado Colombiano y nos encontrar\u00edamos frente a un fallo ilusorio, adem\u00e1s de que no se estar\u00eda logrando el fin esencial del Proceso de Responsabilidad Fiscal, cual es el resarcimiento patrimonial del da\u00f1o causado al erario\".*\n\n433.\n\nIn addition, the *Contralor\u00eda* attached three of Prodeco\u2019s bank accounts,367 and, two months later, Prodeco\u2019s shares in Fenoco.368\n\nDoc. C-19.\n\nDoc. C-20.\n\n**F. New Technical Reports**\n----------------------------\n\n434.\n\nOn 24 August 2012, the *Contralor\u00eda* notified the Tovar Silva Report to Prodeco.369\n\nDoc. C-146, p. 4.\n\n435.\n\nOn 5 September 2012, Prodeco challenged the Tovar Silva Report *(infra,* i) and once again requested that the *Contralor\u00eda* close the Fiscal Liability Proceeding (ii). This request was accompanied by an expert report by KPMG (iii).370\n\nDocs. C-141 to C-143.\n\n436.\n\n(i) In the challenge, Prodeco said that the Tovar Silva Report had made legal considerations which were beyond its scope and had ignored all the documents submitted by Prodeco to Ingeominas explaining the benefits of the Eighth Amendment for the State. Furthermore, Prodeco took issue with the fact that the Tovar Silva Report had limited its economic analysis to the Transition Period, disregarding the long-term impact of the Eighth Amendment.371\n\nDoc. C-142.\n\n437.\n\n(ii) Prodeco also argued that the Eighth Amendment had not caused any damage to Colombia and that Prodeco had always acted in good faith. Prodeco explained that the Eighth Amendment had to be examined as a whole, and that it would only be possible to ascertain if the State had suffered damage once the Mining Contract had expired. Prodeco also submitted that it could not be subject to the Fiscal Liability Proceeding because it did not have any public fiscal responsibility.372\n\nDoc. C-143.\n\n438.\n\n(iii) The KPMG report analysed the economic and financial aspects underlying the Eighth Amendment and the benefit it generated for the State\u2019s finances. The report found that an expansion of the Calenturitas Mine would not have been possible without the Eighth Amendment. The report also explained that the Eighth Amendment had resulted in a much higher benefit for the State than for Prodeco.373\n\nDoc. C-141. In particular, the KPMG report found that: *\"La Naci\u00f3n obtiene un incremento de sus beneficios en casi tres veces el aumento de los beneficios que recibe Prodeco con la realizaci\u00f3n de la expansi\u00f3n y el otros\u00ed 8. Con la ejecuci\u00f3n del Proyecto de Expansi\u00f3n y con la suscripci\u00f3n del otros\u00ed 8, el incremento el VPN de las regalias es de un 57% mayor al Proyecto de Producci\u00f3n Anterior al otros\u00ed 8. Sin embargo el aumento del VPN de la mina que tiene Prodeco es del 23%\"* (Doc. C-141, p. 11).\n\nClarifications by Tovar Silva\n-----------------------------\n\n439.\n\nAs a consequence of Prodeco\u2019s challenge to the Tovar Silva Report, on 29 October 2012, the *Contralor\u00eda* asked Ms. Tovar Silva to provide clarifications.374 Accordingly, on 9 November 2012, Ms. Tovar Silva explained that she had examined the impact of the Eighth Amendment on the State\u2019s finances only during the Transition Period because this was the only period for which there was actual data.375\n\nDoc. C-146.\n\nDoc. C-147.\n\nValenzuela/Riveira Report\n-------------------------\n\n440.\n\nOn 14 November 2012, Messrs. Luis Valenzuela and Felipe Riveira, who had respectively served as Minister and Vice-Minister of Mines and Energy,376 submitted an expert opinion, commissioned by Prodeco, analysing whether the Eighth Amendment had benefitted Colombia.377 The report came to the following conclusions:378\n\n- Under the original compensation scheme Prodeco would not have expanded production, since this would have generated a reduction in its NPV;\n\n- The benefits or disadvantages of the Eighth Amendment on the State\u2019s finances could only be established by examining the entire life of the Mining Contract, not just its first year in isolation;\n\n- Colombia would only see the benefits of the Eighth Amendment once Prodeco\u2019s programmed expansion actually took place - a process that required several years; this meant that in 2010-2011 the Eighth Amendment would not yet be generating higher yields for the State;\n\n- The Eighth Amendment did not cause a damage to Colombia; on the contrary, it would bring an additional USD 205 M in compensation payments.\n\nDoc. R-173, p. 2.\n\nDoc. C-148. See also Doc. R-173, by which Prodeco submits the report into the record of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.\n\nDoc. C-148, pp. 2-3.\n\n441.\n\nFaced with contradictory information, on 10 April 2013, the *Contralor\u00eda* decided to commission a technical support team to produce a report on the Eighth Amendment:379\n\n\"[...] *para determinar si se desvirt\u00faan los fundamentos del presente proceso de responsabilidad y el da\u00f1o causado a la Naci\u00f3n por la disminuci\u00f3n en las regal\u00edas y compensaciones a su favor\".*\n\nDoc. C-151, p. 3.\n\n**G. New Depositions**\n----------------------\n\n442.\n\nBetween April and May 2013, the *Contralor\u00eda* heard the depositions of the new defendants in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, Mr. Ballesteros, Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres, Ms. Aristaz\u00e1bal, Ms. Cabezas, Ms. G\u00f3mez and Mr. Balcero *(infra,* a. to f.).380 Given that these individuals were no longer witnesses, but indicted defendants in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, they were not required to swear to tell the truth lest they might incriminate themselves - thus they presented what in Colombian practice is known as a *\"versi\u00f3n libre y espont\u00e1nea\"*.381\n\nDocs. C-152, C-153, C-154 / R-23, C-155 / R-22, C-156 / R-81, C-157 / R-25.\n\nDoc.

Mr. Ballesteros noted that the negotiation between Ingeominas and Prodeco had been long, and Ingeominas had never accepted Prodeco\u2019s proposals at face value. Finally, Mr. Ballesteros insisted that the Eighth Amendment would generate higher revenues for the State than the previous regime.382\n\nDoc. C-152.\n\n444.\n\n(b) Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres testified that he had always acted to make sure that the State\u2019s interests were protected. He argued that the Eighth Amendment was beneficial to the State and that he understood that the analysis had been correctly performed.383\n\nDoc. R-81.\n\n445.\n\n(c) Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal asked that her previous sworn deposition be taken into account. She noted that she was not competent to decide whether or not the Eighth Amendment had to be signed, and that Ingeominas had chosen not to hire external experts to conduct economic analysis. Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal explained that Ingeominas\u2019 officers had tried to be as diligent as possible, to avoid any future disputes regarding the Eighth Amendment.384\n\nDoc. C-153.\n\n446.\n\n(d) Ms. Cabezas confirmed that there had been numerous meetings with Prodeco, with the participation of Mr. Ballesteros, who was adamant that the Eighth Amendment should be executed. She deposed that she had felt pressured by Mr. Ballesteros: **.**385\n\n\"*De acuerdo a las proyecciones presentadas por PRODECO se hacia [sic] el estudio econ\u00f3mico y t\u00e9cnico de los mismos como la negociaci\u00f3n no avanzaba por cuanto el an\u00e1lisis que de los cuadros nosotros hac\u00edamos de las propuestas presentadas por PRODECO al Dr. Mario no le gustaban porque iban en contrav\u00eda de su querer el cual era dar viabilidad a la suscripci\u00f3n de la modificaci\u00f3n del contrato 0044/89 Esta circunstancia gener\u00f3 que el Dr. Mario Ballesteros nos exigiera la sustanciaci\u00f3n a Luz Marina, Luz Mireya a Giovanni y a m\u00ed que ten\u00edamos que elaborarle un cuadro y un escrito en el que se viera reflejada la mejor posibilidad presentada por PRODECO para que se pudiera dar la viabilidad del otros\u00ed.

R-22, p. 4.\n\n448.\n\n(e) Ms. G\u00f3mez described the analysis she had performed before the execution of the Eighth Amendment:387\n\n\"*B\u00e1sicamente lo que yo hice fue las estimaciones matem\u00e1ticas de lo que estaba cancelando PRODECO por concepto de regal\u00edas y cu\u00e1nto pagar\u00eda si aumentaba su volumen de producci\u00f3n a diez millones de toneladas*\".\n\nDoc. R-23, p. 3.\n\n449.\n\nMs. G\u00f3mez did not mention any pressure exercised by Mr. Ballesteros.\n\n450.\n\nShe explained that Mr. Ceballos had asked her and other colleagues to prepare the Viability Study after the Eighth Amendment had been signed. The report was meant to serve as an \"*aide-m\u00e9moire\"* which described all the parameters which Ingeominas had taken into account when deciding to execute the Eighth Amendment.388\n\nDoc. R-23.\n\n451.\n\n(f) Mr. Giovanny Balcero also confirmed that there had been a number of meetings between Ingeominas and Prodeco. He recalled that Prodeco had offered to increase the capacity of the mine to 14 MTA, but that the restriction which made such expansion unviable was the compensation provided for in the Mining Contract. His task consisted in preparing financial models of the production of the Mine.389\n\nDoc. R-25, p. 3.\n\n452.\n\nMr. Balcero also confirmed that the Viability Study had been prepared after the execution of the Eighth Amendment, and was meant to be a sort of *aide-m\u00e9moire*, compiling all the information reviewed and all the analyses performed by the Deputy Mining Direction. Finally, Mr. Balcero stated that Mr. Ballesteros showed an interest in the execution of the Eighth Amendment, that no external experts were hired, and that he breached internal procedures by not consulting the *Subdirectora de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n,* Ms. Gloria del Socorro Arias.390\n\nDoc. R-25, p. 5.\n\n**H. The Technical Support Report**\n-----------------------------------\n\n453.\n\nOn 20 May 2013, the *Contralor\u00eda's* technical support team delivered a report with its findings [\"**Technical Support Report**\"]. The Report mainly commented on KPMG's report of September 2012.391\n\nDoc. C-159. This report is sometimes referred to in correspondence as the \"Garc\u00eda Alarcon - Garc\u00eda Olaya Report\".\n\n454.\n\nAs in the case of the Tovar Silva Report, the Technical Support Report focused exclusively on the year 2010, and found that the Eighth Amendment had resulted in a reduction of Royalties and GIC paid to the State in an amount of COP 52.21 billion (equivalent to USD 27.28 M):392\n\nDoc. C-159, p. 14.\n\n455.\n\nThe Technical Support Report said that the KPMG report of September 2012 had been based on projections, instead of taking into account the actual data available after the execution of the Eighth Amendment for the years 2010 and 2011.393 Finally, the Technical Support Report recommended that the calculation performed for the Transition Period should be repeated for 2011 and 2012.394\n\nDoc. C-159, p. 14.\n\nDoc. C-159, p. 17.\n\nFurther Reports\n---------------\n\n456.\n\nIn June 2013, Prodeco presented a challenge to the Technical Support Report,395 which was accompanied by a new expert report by KPMG.396\n\nDoc. R-174.\n\nDoc. C-161.\n\n457.\n\nAnd in July 2013, the technical support team issued yet another report, challenging KPMG\u2019s methodology of projecting future production scenarios and insisting that any analysis of the damage suffered by the State should only take into account the year 20 1 0.397\n\nDoc. C-163.\n\nProdeco\u2019s Request for Closure of the Proceedings\n------------------------------------------------\n\n458.\n\nOn 28 August 2013, Prodeco once again requested that the *Contralor\u00eda* close the Fiscal Liability Proceeding. Prodeco argued that the facts did not lead to the conclusion that the State had suffered damage, or that Prodeco had acted deceitfully or with gross negligence.398\n\nDoc. C-164.\n\n**I. The Contralor\u00eda Issues the** ***Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nDespite Prodeco\u2019s submissions and requests, on 30 August 2013, the *Contralor\u00eda* issued an *Auto de imputaci\u00f3n de responsabilidad fiscal, [\"**Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n\"**]* formally charging Prodeco, Mr. Ceballos, Mr. Ballesteros, Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres, and Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal. Prodeco, Mr. Ceballos and Mr. Ballesteros were accused of acting with *dolo*, whereas Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres and Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal were accused of acting with *culpa grave.399*\n\nDoc. C-24.\n\n460.\n\nThe *Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n* is a lengthy document, totalling more than 200 pages.\n\n461.\n\nThe *Auto* first analyses whether the State has suffered damages.400 Its general thrust is that the Eighth Amendment has resulted in damage to the Colombian State, due to a reduction in the Royalties to be paid by Prodeco.401\n\nDoc. C-24, p. 111.\n\nDoc. C-24, p. 112.\n\n462.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* dismisses Prodeco\u2019s argument that the fiscal analysis of the Mining Contract could be made only upon its expiration in 2035:402\n\n\"[...] *en el ejercicio de sus funciones las contralor\u00edas tienen conferida la atribuci\u00f3n de verificar la existencia cierta y actual de un da\u00f1o fiscal, con ocasi\u00f3n de la ejecuci\u00f3n de un contrato, y de adelantar la acci\u00f3n dirigida a su resarcimiento, sin esperar a su liquidaci\u00f3n, ni menos a la extinci\u00f3n de las acciones contencioso administrativas*\".\n\nDoc. C-24, p. 119.\n\n463.\n\nAs regards the quantum of the damage suffered by the State, the *Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n* draws from the Tovar Silva Report and the Technical Support Report, and concludes that the damage amounts to COP 51 billion, which is the reduction in earnings suffered during the year 2011.403\n\nDoc. C-24, p. 135.\n\n464.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* also declares that although Prodeco was a private entity, it had assumed responsibility towards the assets of the State when it executed the Mining Contract, because it gave direction to the negotiations:404\n\n\"*As\u00ed las cosas, es evidente que C.I. PRODECO particip\u00f3 activamente en el resultado objeto de reproche fiscal, como quiera que la Firma, tal como lo se\u00f1al\u00f3 el auto de apertura orient\u00f3 la cuestionada modificaci\u00f3n y cada uno [sic] de las propuestas presentadas a INGEOMINAS\".* [Emphasis added; spelling errors in the original]\n\nDoc. C-24, p. 184.\n\n465.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* also concludes that Prodeco has wilfully caused damage to the State:405\n\n\"*A lo largo de todo el material probatorio obrante en el proceso, se evidencia una clara intenci\u00f3n por parte de Prodeco de modificar el contrato 044-89 a sabiendas de que con esta modificaci\u00f3n se disminuir\u00edan los ingresos para el [sic] Naci\u00f3n Colombiana, por lo cual se califica su conducta como DOLOSA\".* [Emphasis added and capitalisation in the original]\n\nDoc. C-24, pp. 176-187.\n\n466.\n\nIn the same *Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n*, the *Contralor\u00eda* decided to dismiss the indictment and close the Fiscal Liability Proceeding with respect to Ms. Cabezas, Mr. Balcero, and Ms. G\u00f3mez, on the ground that their functions within Ingeominas did not involve any decision-making powers.406\n\nDoc. C-24, pp. 206-221: \"*las funciones asignadas al profesional especializado* [Mr. Balcero], *otorgan ninguna* [sic] *tipo de decisi\u00f3n o disposici\u00f3n\"* (p. 211); \"*La doctora G\u00f3mez seg\u00fan las funciones a su cargo, no ten\u00eda ning\u00fan poder de decisi\u00f3n en el asunto\"* (p. 216); \"*De igual forma es claro que las obligaciones contratadas* [por la Dra. Cabezas] *no comportaban ning\u00fan poder decisorio* [...]\" (p. 221). See also Vargas I, para. 67.\n\n**J. Prodeco\u2019s Defence and Requests for Submission of New Evidence**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n467.\n\nPursuant to Art. 50 of the Law 610 of 2000, regarding Fiscal Liability Proceeding:407\n\n\"*Los presuntos responsables fiscales dispondr\u00e1n de un t\u00e9rmino de diez (10) d\u00edas contados a partir del d\u00eda siguiente a la notificaci\u00f3n personal del auto de imputaci\u00f3n o de la desfijaci\u00f3n del edicto para presentar los argumentos de defensa frente a las imputaciones efectuadas en el auto y solicitar y aportar las pruebas que se pretendan hacer valer* [...]\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 50.\n\n468.\n\nAccordingly, in October 2013, Prodeco and the remaining defendants in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding submitted their arguments of defence against the *Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n.*408\n\nDoc. C-166 (Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal), Doc. C-167 (Mr. Ballesteros), Doc. C-169 (Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres), Doc. C-171 (Mr. Ceballos), Doc. C-173 (Prodeco).\n\n469.\n\nProdeco\u2019s defence submitted that the *Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n* was groundless for several reasons:\n\n- Colombia had not suffered a certain and actual damage: Prodeco recognized that the *Contralor\u00eda* could exercise a fiscal control at all times; however, it took issue with the fact that the *Contralor\u00eda* had chosen to disregard the overall economy of the Mining Contract and had based its analysis on the Transition Period.409\n\n- The evidence on the record did not lead to the conclusion that Prodeco had acted with the intent of causing damage to the State\u2019s financial interests; the *Contralor\u00eda* seemed to mistake Prodeco\u2019s legitimate intention of executing the Eighth Amendment with an alleged intent of causing a damage to the State;410\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* seemed to confuse Ingeominas\u2019 irregular conduct with that of Prodeco; the *Contralor\u00eda* failed to consider that Ingeominas was a specialized State agency and that Prodeco could not have influenced its decision-making process;411\n\n- Prodeco could not be held fiscally liable because it was not responsible for the management of public resources.412\n\nDoc. C-173, pp. 7-10.\n\nDoc. C-173, pp. 11-17 and 35.\n\nDoc. C-173, pp. 18-19.\n\nDoc. C-173, pp. 35-37.\n\n470.\n\nProdeco also marshalled additional evidence: an expert report produced by Inverlink413 and a request that the *Contralor\u00eda* call several witnesses to testify.414\n\nDoc. C-165.\n\nDoc. C-173, pp. 37-40. Prodeco asked that the *Contralor\u00eda* hear the testimonies of: Ms. Margarita Zuleta; Mr. Ballesteros; two of Prodeco\u2019s employees who had participated in the negotiation process; several officials of the *Contralor\u00eda*, including Ms. Tovar Silva; and the experts who had produced reports in the course of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.\n\n471.\n\nIn their defences, Mr. Ballesteros, Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres, and Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal also asked to introduce more evidence in the record.415\n\nDoc. C-166, pp. 30-31 (Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal); Doc. C-167, p. 22 (Mr. Ballesteros); Doc. C-169, p. 6 (Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres).\n\n472.\n\nOn 14 January 2014, the *Contralor\u00eda* rejected most of Prodeco\u2019s requests to submit new evidence,416 on the ground that the majority of the new evidence was either superfluous or useless:417\n\n- The Inverlink report did not bring a new perspective on the negotiations between Ingeominas and Prodeco compared with the KPMG reports;\n\n- Ms. Margarita Zuleta, as legal representative of Prodeco; had already given her statement on the facts in question;\n\n- Mr. Ballesteros was a defendant in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and as such it would not be appropriate to have his testimony; in addition, he had already given a statement;\n\n- The testimonies of two of Prodeco\u2019s employees who had participated in the negotiation process were superfluous, because the events on which they would testify were already covered in the record;\n\n- The experts who had produced reports were not witnesses, but rather independent experts, who had already submitted their views in the course of the investigation.\n\nDoc. C-26.\n\nDoc. C-26, pp. 8-11.\n\n473.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* decided to hear only Ms. Natalia Anaya, an officer of Prodeco who had taken part in the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment.418\n\nDoc. C-26, p. 13.\n\n474.\n\nIt is worth noting that the *Contralor\u00eda* also accepted the request by Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal (an officer of Ingeominas who was among the defendants) to give a new statement,419 although she had already been heard three times before, whereas it denied Prodeco\u2019s request that Ms. Margarita Zuleta be heard again.\n\nDoc. C-26, p. 18.\n\n475.\n\nOn 23 January 2014, Prodeco challenged the *Contralor\u00eda's* decision. According to Prodeco:420\n\n- An *in limine* rejection of evidence could only take place when the evidence was manifestly and flagrantly irrelevant, useless, or inopportune;\n\n- All the evidence it had requested to submit was necessary to establish the economic rationale behind the Eighth Amendment and the negotiation process, which were at the heart of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding;\n\n- If the *Contralor\u00eda* found itself \"judge and party\", there was no guarantee of impartiality;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* had disregarded Prodeco\u2019s due process rights.\n\nDoc. C-174.\n\n476.\n\nOn 13 February 2014, the *Contralora Delegada* confirmed its initial decision and denied Prodeco\u2019s challenge.421 Prodeco appealed the *Contralora Delegada\"* s decision. On 17 March 2014, the *Contralora General* confirmed the first instance decision.422\n\nDoc. C-27.\n\nDoc. C-28, p. 20.\n\nFurther Appeals\n---------------\n\n477.\n\nOn 6 May 2014, Prodeco presented a request for annulment of the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s decision that had barred Prodeco from producing additional evidence, and all subsequent procedural decisions. According to Prodeco, the Proceedings had violated Prodeco\u2019s due process rights, in particular Prodeco\u2019s right to defend itself.423\n\nDoc. C-176.\n\n478.\n\nThis led Prodeco to file a constitutional injunction (*acci\u00f3n de tutela*) with the *Tribunal Superior del Distrito Judicial de Bogot\u00e1.*424 This court dismissed Prodeco\u2019s action, whereupon Prodeco lodged an appeal with the *Corte Suprema de Justicia.*425\n\nDoc. R-250, pp. 8348-8356. See also Doc. C-31, p. 1 and Doc. C-32, p. 10.\n\nDoc. C-31.\n\n479.\n\nOn 22 October 2014, the *Corte Suprema* dismissed Prodeco\u2019s request.426 The *Corte Suprema* noted that an *acci\u00f3n de tutela* was not applicable to a Fiscal Liability Proceeding, which had their own mechanisms for challenging a decision and were subject to the jurisdiction of administrative courts.427 In addition, the *Corte* found that the *Contralor\u00eda* had not acted arbitrarily and had properly justified its decisions.428 The *Corte Suprema* concluded that:429\n\n\"[...] *dentro del proceso de responsabilidad fiscal no se ha vulnerado el derecho al debido proceso y a la defensa de la accionante; m\u00e1xime que la actuaci\u00f3n a\u00fan se encuentra en curso y, como anteriormente se expres\u00f3, contra la decisi\u00f3n administrativa que ponga fin al proceso, en caso de que le sea desfavorable, tiene la posibilidad de impetrar la acci\u00f3n de nulidad y restablecimiento del derecho*\".\n\nDoc.

Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal\u2019s Third Statement**\n----------------------------------------\n\n481.\n\nOn 24 April 2014, the *Contralor\u00eda* heard Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal\u2019s new statement.431 Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal explained in more detail her mission in Ingeominas and her participation in the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nDoc. C-175 / R-9.\n\n482.\n\nDeparting from her three earlier statements, Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal declared that Mr. Ballesteros had exercised undue pressure over her and that the other Ingeominas officers who were working on the Eighth Amendment had violated the applicable internal procedures. Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal made clear that she was not responsible for the execution of the Eighth Amendment:432\n\n\"*Con lo anterior quiero reiterar que frente a acuerdos e imposiciones, previamente establecidas, prim\u00f3 la subordinaci\u00f3n y el temor al desobedecimiento de unas \u00f3rdenes que en forma directa ven\u00edan siendo dadas por el mismo Director General*\".\n\nDoc.

Public Interview by the** ***Contralora General***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n483.\n\nIn December 2013, the *Contralora General,* Ms. Morelli Rico, gave an interview to the newspaper *Semana Sostenible.* In that interview she stated her opinion that Prodeco was not properly paying the royalties due under the Mining Contract, in an amount of almost COP 50 billion, adding that there was *\"un principio de prueba\",* to be properly defined in the procedure. She also expressed surprise that Prodeco was threatening a claim under the BIT.433\n\nDoc. C-266.\n\n**M. The** ***Procuradur\u00eda*** **Closes the Investigation into Mr. Ceballos**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nIn November 2013, the *Procuradur\u00eda* had initiated a disciplinary investigation against Mr. Ceballos, the Ingeominas\u2019 officer who had actually signed the Eighth Amendment.\n\n485.\n\nSix months thereafter, on 13 May 2014, the *Procuradur\u00eda* decided to close the file, without finding any responsibility.\n\n486.\n\nAfter reviewing the documentation surrounding the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment, the *Procuradur\u00eda* found that the the Eighth Amendment was approved by Ingeominas applying reasonable technical and financial criteria:434\n\n\"*Al estudiar los antecedentes descritos y las explicaciones contenidas en los distintos documentos aportados por la Agencia Nacional de Miner\u00eda, a petici\u00f3n de este despacho, es dable colegir que no existe conducta constitutiva de falta disciplinaria atribuible a JOS\u00c9 FERNANDO CEBALLOS ARROYAVE\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. R-250, p. 8783.\n\n**N. The** ***Contralor\u00eda\u2019's*** **Decision**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nOn 30 April 2015, the *Contralora Delegada,* Ms. Vargas, issued the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision*,* a 234-page-long *fallo* closing the *Procedimiento de Responsabilidad Fiscal.* The main finding was that, by executing the Eighth Amendment,\n\n- Prodeco,\n\n- Mr. Ballesteros (the Director of Ingeominas),\n\n- Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres (the Minister of Mining), and\n\n- Mr. Ceballos (the Ingeominas officer who signed the Eighth Amendment, and who had been acquitted in the disciplinary proceedings),\n\nhad incurred in fiscal liability. The *fallo* sentenced the convicted defendants to pay to the State, jointly and severally, compensation for the damage caused which amounted to COP 60 Bn.435\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 231. Approximately USD 25 million at the exchange rate of the time (McManus I, fn. 20).\n\n488.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision, however, absolved Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal of liability, after finding that there was no causal link between her conduct and the damage to the State\u2019s finances.436\n\nDoc. C-32, pp. 171 and 232.\n\nSummary\n-------\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal will highlight some aspects of the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision.437 In general terms, the Decision accepted the same line of reasoning as the *Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n,* and its principal thrust is to reinforce the arguments already announced in the *Auto.*438\n\nThe decision regarding Prodeco can be found on pp. 68-115 of the *Contralor\u00eda\"* s Decision (Doc. C-32).\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 68.\n\n490.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* first found that, contrary to Prodeco\u2019s argument, although the Mining Contract is a long-term contract, the *Contralor\u00eda was* entitled to evaluate its fiscal effects at any time, without having to wait for its termination.439\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 69.\n\n491.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda'* s main conclusion was that the Eighth Amendment did not properly defend the interests of Colombia: the Amendment failed to formalize Prodeco\u2019s obligation to increase production of the Mine, and how and when such increase would result in an increase in the compensation received by the State. In accordance with Prodeco\u2019s argumentation, the increase of production had been formalized in the 2010 PTI - but the Eighth Amendment lacks any reference to such document.440\n\nDoc. C-32, pp. 78-79.\n\n*Dolo*\n------\n\n492.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* explained that Prodeco had wilfully permitted damage to the State\u2019s financial interests, in order to obtain greater benefits, thereby acting with *dolo.*441 Although the *Contralor\u00eda* recognised that any private contractor had the right to receive benefits from its economic activity, it found that it was improper for a contractor to try to receive higher benefits to the detriment of the State\u2019s interests.442\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 109.\n\nDoc. C-32, pp. 85, 93 and 106.\n\n493.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* found that Prodeco had put in place a series of manoeuvres to pay a lower compensation to the State,443 in particular:444\n\n\"*El grado de culpabilidad que se le ha endilgado a PRODECO no se basa en la intenci\u00f3n leg\u00edtima de impedir o detener p\u00e9rdidas, ni en la obtenci\u00f3n de mayores ingresos, circunstancias que por s\u00ed solas no constituyen irregularidad alguna, como bien lo ha dicho el apoderado. Se fundamenta en la serie de maniobras desplegadas por PRODECO que se materializan, en c\u00f3mo rechazadas sus propuestas por INGEOMINAS, planteaba diferentes escenarios, c\u00f3mo [sic] pas\u00f3 entre otros, de desequilibrio econ\u00f3mico contractual, desacuerdo en la interpretaci\u00f3n de cl\u00e1usulas contractuales, falta de competitividad en el mercado aduci\u00e9ndose entonces desigualdad con otras empresas explotadoras de carb\u00f3n en Colombia, hasta expansi\u00f3n, pero con \u00e9sta disminuyendo el porcentaje de regal\u00edas a favor del Estado con el argumento de que entre mayor producci\u00f3n mayores ingresos a favor del mismo. En este \u00faltimo escenario se sostiene que tal disminuci\u00f3n se compensar\u00e1 m\u00e1s adelante, sin que se hubiese determinado de antemano forma y t\u00e9rmino para ello, salvo enunciados abstractos y gen\u00e9ricos\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 106.\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 85.\n\n494.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* also concluded that Prodeco\u2019s conduct after receiving the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment was contrary to good faith:445\n\n\"*No obedece a los postulados de la buena fe, que despu\u00e9s de suscrito el primer otros\u00ed No 8, que se devuelve sin registro minero, por* lesivo a los intereses de la Naci\u00f3n*, CI PRODECO, no asumiera un comportamiento acorde con la realizaci\u00f3n y ejecuci\u00f3n del contrato suscrito, pasara por alto la advertencia realizada y con ello desconociera el inter\u00e9s de la otra parte\".* [Emphasis in the original]\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 99.\n\n495.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* found that Prodeco was Ingeominas\u2019 \"collaborator\":446\n\n\"*Pasa por alto el se\u00f1or apoderado que PRODECO tiene una relaci\u00f3n contractual* sui generis*, producto del contrato estatal suscrito mediante el cual se busca el cumplimiento de los fines del Estado, v\u00ednculo jur\u00eddico en el que est\u00e1 involucrado el inter\u00e9s general, y por tal raz\u00f3n, adquiri\u00f3 la calidad o condici\u00f3n de 'colaborador\u2019 en el cumplimiento de tales fines\".*\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 87.\n\n496.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* finally concluded that, although Ingeominas had failed to meet its responsibilities, so also had Prodeco:447\n\n\"*En el caso objeto de debate, C.I. PRODECO conoci\u00f3 y particip\u00f3 en los hechos que dieron lugar a la lesi\u00f3n de los intereses patrimoniales del Estado. No obstante, ahora pretende que las cargas s\u00f3lo reposaban en cabeza de la administraci\u00f3n INGEOMINAS, cuando en realidad **tambi\u00e9n formaban parte de su carga y responsabilidad como colaborador de aquella\".***448 [Emphasis in the original]\n\nDoc. C-32, pp. 99 and 102.\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 94.\n\nPreliminary studies\n-------------------\n\n497.\n\nIn addition, the *Contralor\u00eda* found that Ingeominas did not prepare the preliminary studies, which would have been required in any contract of *gran miner\u00eda*. Ingeominas had also failed formally to appoint officials to the negotiation and to seek the recommendation of the Contracting Committee.449 The *Contralor\u00eda* also noted that the Viability Study had not been prepared prior to the execution of the Eighth Amendment, and contained severe inconsistencies, and overall it failed to secure the State\u2019s interests.450\n\nDoc. C-32, pp. 198-199.\n\nDoc. C-32, pp. 200-203.\n\n498.\n\nIn sum, the *Contralor\u00eda* considered that, although Prodeco was a private person, by executing the Mining Contract it had assumed responsibility for the exploitation of a non-renewable public resource and had thus become subject to fiscal liability.451\n\nDoc. C-32, pp. 93 and 107.\n\nDamage\n------\n\n499.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda's* subsequent conclusion was that during the Transition Period *(i.e.* during the year 2010), the Republic had suffered a reduction in the compensation received from Prodeco, and that Prodeco was responsible therefor:452\n\n\"*La responsabilidad de C.I. PRODECO deviene de la lesi\u00f3n a los intereses patrimoniales del Estado Colombiano como consecuencia de la modificaci\u00f3n al negocio y condiciones ya pactadas, conocidas y en ejecuci\u00f3n por el inversionista PRODECO e INGEOMINAS respecto del contrato 044/89, las que fueron lesivas en el periodo de transici\u00f3n a los intereses de la Naci\u00f3n, por lo que como bien se evidencia, lo que se busca es la reparaci\u00f3n al Estado con una indemnizaci\u00f3n equivalente al valor que deb\u00eda haberse pagado por parte del inversionista al Estado Colombiano, por la explotaci\u00f3n del suelo y subsuelo en el periodo de transici\u00f3n, bajo las condiciones del contrato que no habian cambiado en dicho periodo, que conocia y habia aceptado el inversionista con la suscripci\u00f3n del mismo\"* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-32, pp. 115-116.\n\n500.\n\nThe relevant period for the calculation of the damage was exclusively the *periodo de transici\u00f3n.* The Decision justified this conclusion exclusively by reference to the Tovar Silva Report:453\n\n\"*Con el otros\u00ed No. 8, se establecieron modificaciones en relaci\u00f3n con la liquidaci\u00f3n de regalias y otras contraprestaciones econ\u00f3micas, tal como se recoge en el informe t\u00e9cnico del grupo de reacci\u00f3n inmediata, rendido por la doctora Johanna Tovar Silva, el cual obra en el expediente y que claramente determina las condiciones econ\u00f3micas que fueron modificadas con ocasi\u00f3n del otros\u00ed No. 8 y su periodo de transici\u00f3n.*\n\n*Por lo tanto, para la presente causa fiscal, el da\u00f1o ocasionado y cuantificado es el previsto para el denominado periodo de transici\u00f3n, el cual se estipul\u00f3 en el otros\u00ed No. 8, tal y como lo precisan los informes t\u00e9cnicos obrantes como pruebas dentro del proceso, y lo se\u00f1al\u00f3 en su oportunidad el auto de imputaci\u00f3n, las distintas modificaciones introducidas al contrato advierten una disminuci\u00f3n y menoscabo en la [sic] regal\u00edas y contraprestaciones econ\u00f3micas, como en efecto ocurri\u00f3 para dicho periodo* [...]\".\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 219.\n\n501.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision calculated such damage as the difference between the income which the Republic had received under the Eighth Amendment during the Transition Period *(i.e.* during the year 2010) and the income which it would have received had the Eighth Amendment not been executed.454 For the precise calculations, the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision referred to:455\n\n- The Tovar Silva Report, which estimated a damage of COP 51.4 billion, and\n\n- The Technical Support Report, which reached a slightly higher amount of COP 52.2 billion.\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 217.\n\nDoc. C-32, pp. 221-222.\n\n502.\n\nThe Decision explained that the difference between both reports was due to differences in the *Tasa Representativa del Mercado* [\"**TRM**\"], without providing further detail,456 and eventually settled for the higher amount:457\n\n\"*Para este despacho, las conclusiones del informe son contundentes en se\u00f1alar que como consecuencia de los cambios realizados en el c\u00e1lculo de los items de regalia b\u00e1sica, regalia adicional y compensaci\u00f3n por ingresos brutos, para la producci\u00f3n del a\u00f1o 2010 (a\u00f1o considerado de transici\u00f3n), en la Mina Calenturitas de acuerdo con el otros\u00ed 8, el Estado dej\u00f3 de percibir la suma de $52,214,393,982,17\".*\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 222.\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 228.\n\n503.\n\nThis amount was then indexed in accordance with the Colombian inflation rate between December 2010 and January 2015, reaching a total of COP 60,023,730,368.33.\n\nCausal link\n-----------\n\n504.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* also held that Prodeco\u2019s conduct had been decisive for the execution of the Eighth Amendment, and consequently that there was a causal link between Prodeco\u2019s *dolo* and the damage suffered by the State.458\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 109.\n\n*Dispositif*\n------------\n\n505.\n\nThe *dispositif* ordered Prodeco and Messrs. Ceballos, Mart\u00ednez Torres and Ballesteros, jointly and severally (\"*solidariamente\")* to pay to the Colombian State the amount of COP 60 Bn. Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal was acquitted of liability.459\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 232. The *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision also lifted the precautionary measures which had been ordered against Ms. Aristaz\u00e1bal (Doc. C-32, p. 234).\n\n506.\n\nFinally, the *Contralor\u00eda* decided to send a copy of the Decision to the State\u2019s mining agency, for the effects of Art. 61 of Law 610 of 2000,460 which provides for:461\n\n*\"Caducidad del Contrato Estatal. Cuando en un proceso de responsabilidad fiscal un contratista sea declarado responsable, las contralor\u00edas solicitar\u00e1n a la autoridad administrativa correspondiente que declare la caducidad del contrato, siempre que no haya expirado el plazo para su ejecuci\u00f3n y no se encuentre liquidado\".*\n\nDoc.

Prodeco\u2019s Appeals en V\u00eda Gubernativa**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n507.\n\nImmediately after the enactment of the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision, Prodeco started a long list of requests and appeals to have such Decision overturned.\n\n508.\n\nOn 11 May 2015, Prodeco filed:\n\n- A *recurso de reposici\u00f3n* asking for reconsideration of the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision, with the *Contralora Delegada*, the very authority who had issued the Decision, and\n\n- A *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n* with the *Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica,* the supervisor of the *Contralora Delegada.462*\n\nDoc. C-33.\n\n509.\n\nThese administrative appeals were unsuccessful.\n\nReconsideration Decision\n------------------------\n\n510.\n\nIn July 2015, the *Contralora Delegada* rejected Prodeco\u2019s *recurso de reposici\u00f3n.* In her Reconsideration Decision, the *Contralor\u00eda* dismissed Prodeco\u2019s reasoning.463\n\nDoc. C-35.\n\nAppeal Decision\n---------------\n\n511.\n\nOn 21 August 2015, the *Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica* issued the Appeal Decision in the *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n*, confirming the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision [\"**Appeal Decision**\"].464\n\nDoc. C-37.\n\n512.\n\nIn his Decision, the *Contralor General* explained the background to the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and summarized the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision.465 After reviewing the facts in the file, the *Contralor General* fully supported the conclusions of the *Contralora Delegada* and dismissed the appeal.466\n\nDoc. C-37, pp. 3-14.\n\nDoc. C-37, pp. 15-43.\n\n513.\n\nAs to Prodeco\u2019s reasons to lodge an appeal, the *Contralor General* noted the following:\n\n514.\n\n(i) The *Contralor\u00eda* is authorized to exercise its control function over contracts once the contract has been signed, there being no requirement that the contract be finalized and liquidated.467\n\nDoc, C-37, pp. 58-59.\n\n515.\n\n(ii) The lack of planning and of preliminary studies by Ingeominas could be directly imputed to Prodeco. Prodeco, by signing a contract with the public administration, became its collaborator and entered into a special relationship.468\n\nDoc. C-37, p. 61.\n\n516.\n\nProdeco failed to adhere to this heightened level of responsibility. It imposed its desire to obtain profits over the collective interests of the society, and it took advantage of the institutional frailty of Ingeominas:469\n\nDoc. C-37, p. 62.\n\n517.\n\n(iii) The characterization of Prodeco\u2019s conduct as *dolosa* in the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision was accurate.470 There are two fundamental reasons why Prodecto acted with *dolo* :\n\n- Its actions showed \"*una intenci\u00f3n de incrementar ileg\u00edtimamente sus ganancias derivadas del negocio, sin hacer un m\u00ednimo esfuerzo por armonizarlos [sic] con los intereses estatales, obligaci\u00f3n que se deriva de su condici\u00f3n de colaborador de la administraci\u00f3n*\";\n\n- Additionally, *dolo* derives from the fact that Prodeco resorted to the argument that it would increase its investments and the volume of coal mined, but such increases did not materialize during the Transition Period *(i.e.* during the year 2010).471\n\nDoc. C-37, pp. 62-64.\n\nDoc. C-37, pp. 63-64.\n\n518.\n\n(iv) The Appeal Decision also confirmed that Prodeco can be subjected to a fiscal control procedure and that there had been no violation of due process.472\n\nDoc. C-37, pp. 65-67.\n\n519.\n\nThe *Contralor General* also rejected the remaining appeals by Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres, Mr. Ballesteros, and Mr. Ceballos.473\n\nDoc. C-37, pp. 67-87.\n\n**P. Judicial Recourse: The Annulment Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n520.\n\nHaving exhausted the available administrative remedies *(recursos en via gubernativa*), Prodeco put in motion a judicial *proceso de nulidad* before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* [\"**Annulment Procedure**\"]. This was the first time that the dispute between Prodeco and the *Contralor\u00eda* was submitted to a Court of Justice - till then, the Fiscal Liability Proceeding had been handled and decided by the *Contralor\u00eda,* a non-judicial agency of the Colombian Republic.\n\n521.\n\nAfter a mandatory, but eventually unsuccessful conciliation attempt, on 31 March 2016, Prodeco filed the Annulment Procedure with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca.*474 The remedies sought were:475\n\n- Annulment of the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision,\n\n- With the consequent restitution of the amounts already paid by Prodeco in compliance with the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision,\n\n- Certain ancillary requests plus damages.\n\nDoc. R-2. See also McManus I, para. 45.\n\nSubsidiarily, Prodeco also claimed against Messrs. Mart\u00ednez Torres, Ballesteros, and Ceballos and the insurance companies, requesting reimbursement of the amounts paid to the *Contralor\u00eda.*\n\nProgress\n--------\n\n522.\n\nThe progress of this court procedure has been slow.\n\n523.\n\nThe *Tribunal Administrativo* adopted its first measure on 31 January 2017, when it dismissed the claim on formal grounds. Two months later, on 17 March 2017, Prodeco filed a submission correcting the errors. This submission was presented to the Judge (\"*al despach\u00f3\")* on 28 March 2017.476\n\nDoc. R-175.\n\n524.\n\nThe evidence submitted by the Parties on the record shows the development of the Annulment Procedure only until June 2017.477 The Parties have however confirmed that the *Tribunal* has not yet issued a decision on Prodeco\u2019s claim.478\n\nDoc. R-175, which is an official record of all the actions and decisions adopted by the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* in relation to this procedure.\n\nRPHB, para. 114; HT, Day 1, p. 155, l. 4.\n\n**Q. Payment by Prodeco**\n-------------------------\n\n525.\n\nOn 19 January 2016, in order to avoid the forfeiture of the Mining Contract, Prodeco paid to the Colombian State the Fiscal Liability Amount of COP 63 Bn (USD 19.1M), which Prodeco had been ordered to pay as a result of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding [the \"**Fiscal Liability Amount**\"]. Prodeco did so under protest.479\n\nDoc. C-180, p. 3. See also McManus I, para. 43.\n\n526.\n\nProdeco also asked that the *Contralor\u00eda* lift the attachment of Prodeco\u2019s assets, which had been ordered in 2012.480\n\nDoc. C-180, p. 4.\n\n**(8) Filing of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nPursuant to clause 39, the Mining Contract is subject to Colombian law and to the jurisdiction of Colombian courts.481 Colombian courts are thus empowered to adjudicate all disputes arising out of the Mining Contract - including any dispute as regards the validity of the Contract or of its Amendments.\n\nDoc. C-2, clause 39, p. 38.\n\n528.\n\nOn 30 March 2012, the SGC (the mining agency), invoking clause 39 of the Mining Contract, and after an unsuccessful request for mandatory conciliation, filed the Procedure for Contractual Annulment with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* [previously defined as the \"**Procedure for Contractual Annulment**\"]. The SGC requested that the court declare the nullity of the Eighth Amendment, arguing that such Amendment was detrimental to the general interest of the State: the Amendment had been executed on the assumption that it would generate benefits for the State, but this scenario had not materialized.482\n\nDoc. C-140, pp. 3, 34 and 35.\n\n529.\n\nSubsidiarily, the SGC requested that the *Tribunal Administrativo* revise the Eighth Amendment, *\"de tal manera que se preserve el inter\u00e9s general, recuperando y manteniendo a un futuro el equilibrio de la ecuaci\u00f3n financiera del Contrato 044/89, perdido con el desarrollo del Otros\u00ed No. 8\".*\n\n530.\n\nThe SGC's claim was served on Prodeco in October 2012.483\n\nDoc. C-149, p. 1.\n\n531.\n\nOn 15 May 2013, the ANM (which had replaced the SGC) resubmitted its claim before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca,*484 in terms which were practically identical to the initial ones. The ANM however updated the amount of the State's alleged losses resulting to USD 99 M.485\n\nDoc. C-158.\n\nDoc. C-158, p. 46.\n\n532.\n\nOn 7 October 2013, Prodeco filed its response to the ANM's resubmitted claim,486 together with a report by KPMG.487\n\nDoc. C-170. It should be noted that Prodeco had already submitted a response to the SGC's initial claim on 21 May 2013 (Doc. C-160).\n\nDoc. C-168.\n\n533.\n\nProdeco said that the Eighth Amendment had been executed in accordance with Colombia's legislation and had been necessary to permit an expansion of the Mine. Prodeco also argued that the Eighth Amendment would increase Colombia's benefits in the long-term. According to Prodeco, the impact of the Eighth Amendment's on the State's finances could only be determined at the end of the life of the Mining Contract.488\n\nDoc. C-170.\n\n534.\n\nOn 22 October 2013, the ANM filed its reply submission.489\n\nDoc. C-172.\n\n535.\n\nIt is undisputed that the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* has not issued a decision in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment.490\n\nC I, para. 143; Compass Lexecon I, para. 58; R I, para. 261; R II, para. 383; HT, Day 1, p. 155, l. 4.\n\n**(9) Amicable Consultations and Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n536.\n\nOn 28 August 2015, Claimants wrote to the President of Colombia Mr. Juan Manuel Santos, formally notifying a dispute under the Treaty.491 Claimants referred to their letter of September 2013, in which they had explained their investments in Colombia and expressed their concern regarding the State's actions, which Claimants considered to be in violation of the Treaty. Claimants thus put in motion the six-month amicable consultation period provided for in Art. 11 of the Treaty.492\n\nDoc. C-38. Claimants also forwarded this letter to several Ministers of the Colombian Government (see p. 26).\n\nDoc. C-38. Doc. C-6, Art. 11(1) of the Treaty provides that: \"If an investor of a Party considers that a measure applied by the other Party is inconsistent with an obligation of this Agreement, thus causing loss or damage to him or his investment, he may request consultations with a view to resolving the matter amicably\".\n\n537.\n\nOn 4 March 2016, following the expiration of such period, Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration with ICSID,493 which gave rise to the present arbitration.\n\nRfA, dated 4 March 2016.\n\n**(10) Criminal Complaint Against Prodeco**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n538.\n\nOn Sunday, 10 September 2017, the *Director de la Agencia Nacional de Defensa Juridica del Estado* [previously defined as \"**ANDJE**\"] filed with the *Fiscalia General de la Naci\u00f3n* a \"*Denuncia penal en averiguaci\u00f3n de responsables por la presunta comisi\u00f3n de delitos contra la administraci\u00f3n p\u00fablica\"* against Prodeco and Glencore [previously defined as the \"**Criminal Complaint**\"].494\n\nDoc. C-278.\n\n539.\n\nThe copy of the Criminal Complaint submitted in this procedure is partially redacted, and hence relevant aspects of such *denuncia* remain unknown to this Tribunal. In the unredacted part, the ANDJE provides the factual background to the 3ha Contract (see section **III****.(3)** *supra),* gives a summary of the facts surrounding the negotiation and execution of the Eighth Amendment, and submits a list of articles of the Colombian Criminal Code which might have been violated.\n\n540.\n\nThe Criminal Complaint does not accuse any individual persons of having committed specific illegal conduct, but simply asks the *Fiscalia* to investigate and to determine wheter crimes have been commited.495\n\nDoc. C-278, p. 1.\n\n541.\n\nThere is no evidence in the file of any investigation carried out by the *Fiscalia* as a consequence of the Criminal Complaint.\n\nDisciplinary complaint against employees and ex-employees of the mining agency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n542.\n\nOnly two days after the Criminal Complaint, the ANDJE submitted a new complaint, in this case a disciplinary complaint, with the *Procurador General de la Naci\u00f3n* against several ex-employees of Ingeominas and the Ministry of Mines, *inter alia* Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres, Mr. Ballesteros, Mr. Ceballos, and Mr. Maldonado, for alleged violations of the *C\u00f3digo \u00danico Disciplinario.*496\n\nDoc. R-228.\n\n543.\n\nAccording to the ANDJE\u2019s complaint, the concerned individuals had engaged in irregular courses of conduct between 2006 and 2010, in order to permit the execution of the Eighth Amendment. The ANDJE attached to its disciplinary complaint the Criminal Complaint filed with the *Fiscalia*.\n\n544.\n\nThere is no evidence in the file of any investigation carried out by the *Procuraduria* as a consequence of this disciplinary complaint.\n\n**(11) Provisional Application of the Eighth Amendment**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n545.\n\nDespite all these disputes and procedures, it is an undisputed fact that the Parties have been abiding by the terms of the Eighth Amendment and that Prodeco has been making Royalty payments based thereon.497\n\nR I, paras. 211 and 262-263; Paredes I, para. 37; R II, paras. 381-382.\n\n**IV. RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE PARTIES**\n------------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nIn the present section the Arbitral Tribunal reproduces the Parties' requests for relief.\n\n**(1) Claimants\u2019 Request for Relief**\n-------------------------------------\n\n547.\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Brief,498 Claimants declared that they reiterated the requests for relief submitted in their Reply memorial, which reads as follows:499\n\n\"374. On the basis of the foregoing, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DECLARE that Colombia has breached Articles 4(1), 4(2) and 10(2) of the Treaty;\n\n(b) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM or any other government agency that may in due course become the contractual counterparty of Prodeco under the Mining Contract, continue to perform and observe the Eighth Amendment and further that all organs of the Colombian State take any and all actions necessary to ensure and not interfere with such continued performance and observance;\n\n(c) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM, procure the immediate and unconditional cessation of the ANM Proceedings with prejudice;\n\n(d) ORDER that Colombia provide appropriate assurances and guarantees from the GCO500 that it will refrain from initiating any new proceedings in relation to the Eighth Amendment;\n\n(e) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM, give appropriate assurances and guarantees that it will refrain from initiating any new proceedings in relation to the Eighth Amendment;\n\n(f) ORDER that, by way of restitution, Colombia repay to Prodeco the Fiscal Liability Amount of US$19.1 million501 paid by Prodeco to Colombia on 19 January 2016 in the context of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, and any sums that the GCO or any other organ of the Colombian State or Colombian court may, up to the date of the Tribunal's Award, have ordered Prodeco to pay by way of royalties or GIC calculated on the purported basis that the Eighth Amendment should not apply, adjusted from the date of payment to the date of the Award at an annual rate of 9.69%, compounded semi-annually;\n\n(g) ORDER that if Colombia does not comply with orders requested in (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) above within 90 days of the date of the Award, Colombia:\n\n(A) pay Claimants the Fiscal Liability Amount of US$19.1 million plus interest to the date of the Award;\n\n(B) pay Claimants forward-looking damages as of the date of the Award computed as the difference in expected net revenues between a scenario with and without the royalty and GIC provisions in the Eighth Amendment between the date of Award and the end of the Calenturitas mine life as assessed by Claimants\u2019 experts at US$336.1 million as of 31 December 2017;

In light of all the above, and reserving its right to complement, develop or modify its position at a further, appropriate stage of these proceedings (including on the basis of the documents Claimants are yet to disclose), Colombia respectfully requests the Tribunal:\n\n**8.1 On Jurisdiction And Admissibility**\n\n1004. To declare:\n\n\u2022 That it lacks jurisdiction over all of Claimants' claims; and\n\n\u2022 That all of Claimants' claims are, in any event, inadmissible;\n\n\u2022 That Claimants' claims newly raised in the Reply are untimely and hence inadmissible; and\n\n1005.

JURISDICTIONAL AND ADMISSIBILITY OBJECTIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n550.\n\nClaimants argue that their investments in Colombia are protected pursuant to Arts. 1(1) and 1(2)(c) of the Treaty505 and that all requirements for access to arbitration both under the ICSID Convention and under the Treaty have been satisfied.506\n\nC I, paras. 150-158.\n\nC I, paras. 159-168.\n\n551.\n\nRespondent, however, argues that Claimants' claims are not admissible and fall outside the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.507 Respondent raises three jurisdictional and one admissibility objections:508\n\n- The Tribunal may not exercise competence over Claimants' claims because the Eighth Amendment is tainted with illegality, as it was procured through illicit means and bad faith conduct [\"**Illegality Objection**\"] (**V.1**);\n\n- Claimants' claim against the conduct of the *Contralor\u00eda* falls outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by virtue of the fork-in-the-road provision of the Treaty, because Claimants resorted to Colombian administrative courts to adjudicate that claim before starting the present arbitration [\"**Fork-in-the-Road Objection**\"] (**V.2**);\n\n- The Tribunal cannot derive competence from the umbrella clause of the Treaty, because the dispute-resolution clause of the Treaty expressly excludes disputes based on such clause; additionally, the Tribunal also lacks competence over claims against the ANM, since these claims are contractual and the Mining Contract contains its own dispute-resolution clause [\"**Umbrella Clause Objection**\"] (**V.3**);\n\n- Claimants' claims are not ripe for adjudication and are, therefore, inadmissible [\"**Inadmissibility Objection**\"] (**V.4**).\n\nR I, para. 264; R II, paras. 383-384.\n\nR I, paras. 265-268; R II, paras. 385-388.\n\n552.\n\nClaimants note that Respondent does not dispute that Claimants and their investments are protected under the Treaty, or that Claimants have fulfilled all requirements to have access to arbitration under the ICSID Convention and the Treaty.509 As to Colombia's jurisdictional and admissibility objections, Claimants consider that they do not withstand scrutiny.510\n\nC II, para. 159; HT, Day 1, p. 178, ll. 5-10.\n\nC II, para. 160; HT, Day 1, p. 178, l. 14.\n\n**V.1. ILLEGALITY OBJECTION**\n-----------------------------\n\n553.\n\nColombia argues that Claimants' claims are tainted by illegality, because Claimants engaged in acts of corruption and bad-faith conduct. Respondent submits that Claimants' illicit conduct deprives Claimants' investments of the protection of the Treaty and that the Centre lacks jurisdiction and the Tribunal competence over such claims **(1)**).511\n\nR II, paras. 385 and 389.\n\n554.\n\nClaimants counter that Respondent's illegality allegations are devoid of any support or substance.512 Claimants argue that Respondent has failed to satisfy the standard of proof required for corruption allegations, and that Respondent's characterization of Prodeco's actions cannot deprive the Centre of its jurisdiction and the Tribunal of its competence **(2)**.513\n\nC II, para. 175.\n\nC III, paras. 11 and 49.\n\n555.\n\nThe Tribunal will devote separate sections to the allegation of corruption **(3)** and of bad faith **(4)**, and will finally summarize its decisions **(5)**.\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n556.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants' investment made in connection with the Eighth Amendment cannot be protected by the Treaty, because such investment was secured in contravention of Colombian law, and is tainted by Claimants' illegal and disloyal behaviour, including corruption and bad-faith conduct.514\n\nR I, para. 269; R II, para. 389.\n\n557.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Arts. 2 and 4(1) of the Treaty expressly exclude from protection investments made in violation of the laws and regulations of the recipient State.515 Respondent argues that if an investment was made on an illicit basis, contrary to principles of good faith, or by way of corruption, fraud or deceitful conduct, it cannot benefit from the substantive protection of the Treaty.516\n\nR I, paras. 270-272; R II, paras. 424-431.\n\nR I, paras. 276-278, referring to *Hamester,* para. 123; R II, paras. 447-449.\n\n558.\n\nRespondent explains that it is part of the general consensus in international investment law that:\n\n- Tribunals cannot exercise jurisdiction over illegal, illicit or improperly acquired investments,517 and\n\n- The purpose of the international mechanism of protection of investments through ICSID arbitration is not to defend investments which are illegal or secured through improper means, but only *bona fide* investments.518\n\nR I, paras. 273-274.\n\nR I, paras. 279-280, referring to *Phoenix,* para. 100.\n\n559.\n\nRespondent submits that if the Tribunal were to exercise jurisdiction over claims based on illegal or illicit conduct, it would be condoning and encouraging such misconduct.519\n\nR I, para. 275, referring to *World Duty Free,* para. 157.\n\n560.\n\nRespondent considers that Claimants\u2019 conduct in securing the Eighth Amendment falls within the type of illegal and improper behaviour which cannot be protected by the ICSID arbitration system, for two main reasons:520 in order to secure the execution of the Eighth Amendment, Claimants engaged in illicit acts (**A**) and in bad faith conduct (**B**).\n\nR I, para. 281.\n\nA. **Claimants Obtained the Eighth Amendment Through Illicit Means**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n561.\n\nColombia submits that Claimants caused Ingeominas to execute the Eighth Amendment through corruption: Claimants acquired the 3ha Contract from Mr. Maldonado, thereby securing Director Ballesteros\u2019 support for the Commitment to Negotiate. According to Respondent, Claimants cannot deny that they made an outsized payment to an associate of Director Ballesteros.521\n\nR I, para. 283; R II, paras. 390, 422 and 434.\n\n562.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal should follow the approach set out by the *Metal-Tech, Spentex,* and *World Duty Free* tribunals for evaluating evidence of corruption.522\n\nR II, paras. 395 and 398-407.\n\n563.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Tribunal has a duty to inquire about the reasons for the payment of a substantial sum made by Claimants to Mr. Maldonado, an associate of Director Ballesteros. In this endeavour, the Tribunal should depart from traditional rules on the burden of proof, and rather assess the evidence as whole, given that it is almost impossible to prove bribery and corruption. The Tribunal should \"connect the dots\" and identify \"red flags\" of corruption, in particular the following:523\n\n- Prodeco paid a very high compensation of USD 1.75 M for the 3ha Contract;\n\n- The price increased exponentially between December 2008 and April 2009 and was disproportionate to the consideration received, which was a small plot of land;\n\n- Prodeco hid the documentation underlying the 3ha Contract; Prodeco did not disclose the price of the transaction to Ingeominas until two years thereafter, in the wake of the corruption scandal at Ingeominas; in addition, Prodeco has produced almost no evidence concerning the 3ha Contract in this arbitration;\n\n- Prodeco failed to produce evidence of the account to which the payment for the 3ha Contract was made;\n\n- Finally, the payment was made directly to a former employee of Ingeominas' predecessor, Mr. Maldonado, and as such, closely connected to the Director of that State agency; only ten days after CDJ's acquisition of the 3ha Contract was approved, Director Ballesteros caused Ingeominas to execute the Commitment to Negotiate.\n\nR II, paras. 408-422.\n\n564.\n\nColombia contends that as a result of this undue influence, Claimants induced Ingeominas to execute the Eighth Amendment in complete disregard of the legal framework applicable to the amendment of mining contracts. Claimants caused Ingeominas to bypass the necessary authorizations and to breach the procedure for the renegotiation of the Mining Contract.524 In particular:525\n\n- The *Consejo Directivo* of Ingeominas was not kept properly informed of the negotiations;\n\n- The advice of Ingeominas' Contracting Committee and external consultants was not sought, nor were the required ministerial approvals;\n\n- No viability assessments were carried out prior to the execution of the Eighth Amendment;\n\n- The final version of the Eighth Amendment was negotiated over the span of five days only, in an informal context.\n\nR I, para. 282; R II, para. 390.\n\nR I, para. 282; R II, para. 390.\n\n565.\n\nColombia argues that the above leads to the conclusion that the Eighth Amendment was procured through illicit acts and in contravention of Colombian law; hence, Claimants' investment is tainted with illegality and cannot benefit from the protection of the Treaty.526\n\nR I, para. 282.\n\nHearing\n-------\n\n566.\n\nIn the course of the Hearing, Colombia reiterated its position that an illegal investment does not deserve legal protection, since the investor does not have \"clean hands\":527\n\n- First, because Arts. 2 and 4(1) of the Treaty restrict the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to investments \"made in accordance with [the Contracting Party's] laws and regulations\", and under Colombian law, corruption is illegal under Art. 411 A of the Criminal Code;\n\n- Second, Respondent says that the evidence in the present case meets the standard of proof for an illegality objection, and this follows from the application of the red-flag methodology as used by the tribunals in *Metal-Tech* and *Spentex;*528\n\n- Third, tribunals confronted with illegality objections and corruption allegations have a duty to take affirmative action and inquire as to the true reasons behind suspicious payments;529\n\n- Fourth, if explanations are not provided by the party who made the suspicious payment, then tribunals must draw the only logical adverse inference, namely that the payments have been made with the purpose of corrupting public officials;\n\n- Fifth, tribunals must not ignore red flags on the issue of corruption, and when these red flags appear, a tribunal must connect the dots and conclude that the investment was tainted with corruption;530\n\n- Sixth, tribunals should not apply strictly the *actori incumbit probatio* rule, or a heightened standard of proof, but instead they must look to the entirety of the evidence in the record - otherwise they run the risk of making it almost impossible to prove bribery.531\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 467, l. 7 - p. 468, l. 4, referring to *Al Warraq.*\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 469, ll. 9-15, referring to *Metal-Tech,* para. 241 and *Spentex* (quoted by K. Betz, Proving Bribery, Fraud, and Money Laundering in International Arbitration: on Applicable Criminal Law and Evidence, 2017, Doc. RL-149).\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 469, l. 20 - p. 470, l. 3, referring to *Metal-Tech.*\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 471, ll. 12-18, referring to *Spentex*.\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 474, ll. 1-22.\n\n567.\n\nRespondent also reiterated the red flags which - in its submission - prove corruption:532\n\n- The payment,\n\n- The fact that Mr. Maldonado was a former employee of Minercol (the Republic's prior mining agency),\n\n- The timing of such payment,\n\n- Claimants' concealment of the transaction,\n\n- Claimants' decision to restrict knowledge of the transaction to three members of its top management,\n\n- The fact that the Eighth Amendment was executed in open disregard of the applicable law and regulations.\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 476, l. 14 - p. 477, l. 14.\n\n**B. Claimants Acted in Bad Faith**\n-----------------------------------\n\n568.\n\nAccording to Colombia, Claimants provided false and misleading information to Ingeominas, while withholding other important information, so as to induce Ingeominas to execute the Eighth Amendment. Colombia finds that this bad-faith conduct in securing the Eighth Amendment is sufficient to deprive the investment of the protections of the Treaty.533 In particular:534\n\n- Claimants misrepresented the economic situation of the project, in order to persuade Ingeominas that expanding production beyond 8 MTA, under the current conditions, was not economically feasible;\n\n- Claimants presented misleading figures, aimed at showing the alleged lack of profitability of the project's expansion under the existing Compensation Scheme;\n\n- Claimants deliberately withheld geological, technical and accurate pricing information from Ingeominas;\n\n- Claimants improperly sought to justify delaying the submission of the 2010 PTI;\n\n- Claimants sought to exert undue influence over Ingeominas through questionable means.\n\nReferring to *Plama*, para. 144.\n\nR I, paras. 285-286; R II, paras. 390, 446 and 451.\n\n569.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' argument that Colombia would be estopped from raising an illegality objection in the present case, given that the execution of the Eighth Amendment would be attributable to Colombia. Respondent argues that the responsibility for the misconduct surrounding the negotiations of the Eighth Amendment cannot be placed solely on Ingeominas. Through corruption and bad faith, Claimants willingly caused and shaped the negotiations that led to the execution of the Eighth Amendment.535\n\nR I, paras. 287-288; R II, paras. 432-444.\n\n570.\n\nIn sum, Respondent submits that, in securing the Eighth Amendment, Claimants did not act in good faith, but rather acted deceitfully and illegally. The Eighth Amendment was procured through acts of corruption, which is prohibited under both international and Colombian law. This means that Claimants' claims are tainted with illegality and fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction.536\n\nR I, para. 289; R II, paras. 445 and 453.\n\n571.\n\nRespondent says that, alternatively, if the Tribunal were to consider that Claimants' conduct is not an obstacle to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, it should conclude that Claimants' unclean hands render their claims inadmissible.537\n\nR I, para. 290; R II, para. 453.\n\n**(2) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n572.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent's allegations of illegality (**A**) and bad faith (**B**) have no merit and cannot deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.\n\n**A. Colombia\u2019s Allegations of Ilegality are Devoid of Substance**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n573.\n\nClaimants argue that Colombia's corruption allegations are false and unsubstantiated. According to Claimants, as recognised by the *Metal-Tech, Spentex,* and *ECE* tribunals, the party who raises corruption allegations has the burden of proof.538\n\nC III, para. 13.\n\n574.\n\nCase-law confirms that when confronted with such allegations, tribunals are bound to consider them, but also to safeguard those against whom corruption is alleged. As explained by the *Spentex* tribunal, shifting the burden of proof and demanding evidence from the accused party that it did not engage in corrupt acts would subject such party to a *probatio diabolica*. Hence, it is not for Claimants to prove their innocence, but for Colombia to prove its claims.539\n\nC III, paras. 14-16.\n\n575.\n\nAccording to Claimants, in the present case, Colombia has failed to produce any evidence supporting its allegation that the Eighth Amendment was procured through corruption.540\n\nC III, para. 17.\n\n576.\n\nClaimants submit that, far from engaging in corrupt practices in order to influence civil servants to negotiate a contractual amendment, Claimants were the victims of an extortion scheme, facilitated by the Colombian government's inertia in the face of Claimants' multiple challenges, complaints and requests for investigation. Claimants argue that:541\n\n- Prodeco filed multiple administrative petitions and appeals to prevent the 3ha Contract from being granted to Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda; after it had been granted, and even after it was assigned to CDJ, Prodeco still complained to the highest Colombian authorities and requested investigations;\n\n- Faced with the silence of the Colombian authorities, CDJ agreed to the assignment of the 3ha Contract; the price paid by CDJ for this assignment was not disproportionately high, given the value of the coal within the three-hectare area, and the significant losses that would have resulted for the Prodeco Affiliates from the inability to mine around that area; in addition, Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda had initially requested that CDJ pay approximately USD 10 million for the assignment;\n\n- Claimants have not concealed the documentation underpinning the 3ha Contract; the vast majority of the evidence relating to this transaction was placed on the record by Claimants; in addition, Claimants have presented Mr. Nagle as a witness, whereas Colombia has not presented a single witness who was involved in the events allegedly involving corruption; Colombia also deliberately ignores information that it has in its possession, such as the repeated complaints filed by the Prodeco Affiliates or the volume of coal extracted by CDJ from the 3 hectare concession;\n\n- Claimants did not keep the price paid for the 3ha Contract secret; there was no obligation to disclose the purchase price to Ingeominas before the transaction; in any event, CDJ disclosed the purchase price to Ingeominas nine months after the transaction, it reflected the purchase price in its accounts and audited financial statements, and made the necessary Colombian tax withholdings; finally, Claimants paid the purchase price to the bank accounts identified in the assignment contract;\n\n- Colombia has not established any connection whatsoever between Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Ballesteros; moreover, Mr. Maldonado was an employee of Carbocol, Ecocarb\u00f3n and Minercol between 1988 and 2002, whereas Mr. Ballesteros only began his tenure at Ingeominas in 2007.\n\nC II, paras. 38 and 163(b); C III, paras. 19-42.\n\n577.\n\nAs for Colombia\u2019s allegation that through corruption Claimants induced Ingeominas to execute the Eighth Amendment, Claimants reject it, and argue that there were no departures from internal Government procedures:542\n\n- Ingeominas\u2019 *Consejo Directivo* did not have to approve contractual amendments such as the Eighth Amendment;\n\n- Ingeominas had discretion to decide whether to appoint an external advisor or to consult the Contracting Committee;\n\n- Ingeominas was not required to prepare a viability report;\n\n- The *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda* did not have to approve the Eighth Amendment prior to execution;\n\nC II, paras. 163(c) and 168-171; C III, para. 43.\n\n578.\n\nClaimants submit that even if true, these alleged departures could not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction because they were not known to or not attributable to Claimants and were not significant.543 Colombia is bound by the actions of its officers under international law and is, thus, estopped from objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the basis that those officers did not comply with their own obligations.544\n\nC II, paras. 171-173; C III, para. 43.\n\nC II, paras. 169-171; C III, para. 43.\n\n579.\n\nClaimants submit that Colombia has also failed to explain how Mr. Ballesteros would have allegedly single-handedly forced employees or board members of Ingeominas, or even the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* to engage in purported irregularities in the negotiation and execution of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n580.\n\nIn addition, the new administration of Ingeominas, led by Mr. Paredes, never raised these procedural irregularities when it sought to annul the Eighth Amendment, or investigated the concerned parties for administrative or disciplinary purposes.545\n\nC III, para. 44.\n\n581.\n\nThus, Claimants argue that Colombia\u2019s illegality objection must be dismissed in its entirety.546\n\nC III, para. 47.\n\nHearing\n-------\n\n582.\n\nAt the Hearing, Claimants reiterated that Respondent\u2019s allegations of corruption were advanced for the first time in this arbitration, without a shred of evidence.547\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 180, ll. 3-16.\n\n583.\n\nClaimants explained that following Glencore\u2019s acquisition of the Prodeco Affiliates, these companies submitted to Ingeominas an agreement for the integrated use of mining infrastructure, to conduct joint operations in the La Jagua mine. Ingeominas authorized this integrated mining operation in April 2007. It was in this context that Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Garc\u00eda applied for a concession over the 3 hectare area situated in the middle of the La Jagua project, likely exploiting insider knowledge. Despite CDJ\u2019s administrative challenges, Ingeominas reversed its initial decision, and resolved to give the 3 hectare concession to Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda548.\n\nHT, Day 1, pp. 181-186.\n\n584.\n\nClaimants submit that, thereafter, Prodeco complained to the highest Colombian state authorities; despite this, not a single authority took any action against what was apparently highly inappropriate conduct.549 Even after Prodeco purchased the 3ha Contract from Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda, the company continued to complain to the highest authorities. Nevertheless, no authority with investigative power did anything.550\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 189, ll. 3-6.\n\nHT, Day 1, pp. 190-196.\n\n585.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent\u2019s corruption allegation only stands through a highly selective and deliberately misleading narrative of the facts.551 Claimants refer to the *Methanex* decision, in which the tribunal found that in order properly to connect the dots and make inferences, each and every relevant dot must be considered individually before trying to assert a pattern.552 Claimants argue that Respondent\u2019s alleged \"red flags\" are totally without merit:553\n\n- The amount paid by Claimants for the 3ha Contract was not strikingly high or disproportionate, since the Prodeco Affiliates stood to lose tens of millions of dollars if they could not gain access to the 3 hectare area;\n\n- Claimants have not concealed any documents related to the 3ha Contract; in fact, Claimants have brought extensive correspondence to the record; by contrast, Respondent did not tell this Tribunal that the Prodeco Affiliates had filed multiple complaints relating to the 3ha Contract with the State\u2019s highest authorities;\n\n- Claimants did not conceal the price paid for the 3ha Contract from the Colombian authorities; there was no obligation to disclose the price paid for the 3 hectare concession to Ingeominas, and in any event CDJ did so as part of its regular disclosures of domestic suppliers of goods and services; in addition, Claimants made the appropriate tax withholdings and the price was reflected in CDJ\u2019s audited financial statements; finally, the Assignment Contract clearly identifies the price paid for the 3 hectare concession;\n\n- Respondent has not established any connection between Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Ballesteros; Mr. Maldonado worked in Ecorcarb\u00f3n and Minercol in Valledupar between 1998 and 2002; Mr. Ballesteros started his tenure at Ingeominas in Bogot\u00e1 in 2007;\n\n- There was no departure from internal Government procedures.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 196, ll. 17-18.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 196, l. 18 - p. 197, l. 1.\n\nHT, Day 1, pp. 198-209.\n\n**B. Claimants Did Not Act in Bad Faith**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n586.\n\nClaimants submit that they did not misrepresent or conceal any information from Ingeominas. Even if Colombia\u2019s mischaracterization of Claimants\u2019 conduct were correct, there would still be no ground for a jurisdictional objection.554\n\nC III, para. 49.\n\n587.\n\nClaimants argue that the standard for proving bad faith is a demanding one; only significant and intended violations of applicable laws by investors can serve as grounds for challenging jurisdiction. Colombia has failed to prove any violations or conduct grave enough to give rise to a jurisdictional objection.555\n\nC II, paras. 172-173; C III, paras. 50 and 58, referring to *Invesmart,* para. 430 and to *Bayindir,* para. 143.\n\n588.\n\nClaimants say that Colombia does not dispute that throughout the over 20 months of negotiations for the Eighth Amendment, Prodeco:556\n\n- Diligently responded to all of Ingeominas' requests for information;\n\n- Repeatedly invited Ingeominas to request any additional information that might facilitate its review of Prodeco's proposals;\n\n- Solicited questions from Ingeominas;\n\n- Facilitated in-depth, in-person reviews of the proposals with Ingeominas' negotiation team.\n\nC II, para. 163(d); C III, para. 51.\n\n589.\n\nClaimants also deny Colombia's accusations that they presented skewed information to Ingeominas, or that they omitted to present any material information to Ingeominas in bad faith.557 Claimants argue that Colombia and its experts try to scavenge for purported errors in the estimates and analyses shared by Prodeco with Ingeominas at the relevant time. Their argument, however, is based on information that Ingeominas never requested. As held by the *Mamidoil Jetoil* tribunal, States cannot abuse the process by scrutinizing the investment *post factum* with the intention of rooting out minor or trivial illegalities as a pretext to free themselves of an obligation.558\n\nC III, paras. 63-81.\n\nC III, paras. 54-55, referring to *Mamidoil Jetoil Greek Petroleum,* para. 483.\n\n590.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Colombia is submitting for the first time in this arbitration that Claimants acted disloyally, since it never raised any complaints regarding the information provided by Prodeco at the time of the negotiations or in the context of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment. Similarly, no such accusations were made by the *Contralor\u00eda* in the context of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.559\n\nC III, paras. 52-53.\n\n591.\n\nProdeco was always transparent about its assumptions and about the trade-off underpinning the Eighth Amendment: there would be a reduction in Colombia's royalty taken as a percentage of the total value of production; however, this reduction would be compensated by a higher royalty associated with higher production following expansion, and Colombia would overall receive higher revenues.560 Claimants submit that they always discussed these assumptions with Ingeominas, which was the State agency competent to verify the information delivered by Prodeco.561\n\nC II, para. 163(d); C III, para. 62.\n\nC II, paras. 163(d) and 164; C III, paras. 62 and 65-67.\n\n592.\n\nIn sum, Claimants argue that the Tribunal should dismiss Respondent's Illegality Objection.\n\n**(3) Corruption**\n------------------\n\n593.\n\nRespondent's first argument is that, in order to secure the Eighth Amendment, Claimants corrupted Mr. Ballesteros, Ingeominas' *Director General.* The corrupt payment was allegedly disguised as the purchase price for the acquisition of the 3ha Contract. Colombia submits that Mr. Maldonado, the co-owner of the 3ha Contract, was in fact an associate of Mr. Ballesteros, and that both shared the USD 1.75 M price paid by Prodeco.\n\n594.\n\nClaimants deny any wrongdoing. They acknowledge the purchase of the 3ha Contract in May 2009, after having reported the situation to various Colombian authorities, and having received no support or solution whatsoever. They also deny that Mr. Ballesteros was the final recipient of the funds.\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal will first establish the proven facts **(3.1)**, then explain certain issues which arose regarding the marshalling of evidence regarding corruption **(3.2)**, and finally dismiss Respondent\u2019s objection **(3.3)**.\n\n**(3.1) Proven Facts**\n----------------------\n\n**A. The 3ha Contract**\n-----------------------\n\n596.\n\nOn 29 November 2006, Mr. Jorge Maldonado - a former employee of the Ministry of Mines and of Carbocol, Ingeominas\u2019 predecessor as mining agency of the Republic - and his partner, Mr. C\u00e9sar Garc\u00eda, filed a request with Ingeominas to obtain a concession contract for the exploration and production of coal in a parcel of 3 hectares located in the middle of the La Jagua coal mine, which was already being exploited by Prodeco through its Affiliates.562 The arrow in the following map shows the tiny 3 hectares strip, surrounded by Prodeco\u2019s mining concessions:\n\nDoc. R-90, p. 6. See also R I, para. 69 and C II, para. 38(b).\n\n597.\n\nThe Prodeco Affiliates had obtained their mining rights over the La Jagua project from the mining agencies that had preceded Ingeominas, long before Glencore\u2019s involvement.563 It seems that the three-hectare gap was the result of clerical errors in the mapping of the concessions granted in the 1990s and 2000s.564 While it remains uncertain whether these errors were accidental or intentional, it should be noted that Mr. Maldonado worked in Carbocol and in the subsequent mining agencies from 1988 through 2002565 and was accordingly in a position to obtain insider information on the three-hectare gap.\n\nDoc. C-234, p. 2.\n\nDoc. C-202, pp. 1-2. See also Nagle II, para. 16.\n\nDoc. R-92. See also Paredes I, para. 17.\n\nInitial rejection by Ingeominas\n-------------------------------\n\n598.\n\nFour months after Mr. Maldonado's application, on 2 March 2007, Ingeominas issued a technical report concluding that the 3ha Contract would partially overlap with other nearby concessions and that it was too small for a standalone mining operation.566 A week thereafter, on 17 March 2007, Ingeominas formally rejected Mr. Maldonado's application for the 3ha Contract.567\n\nDoc. C-199, pp. 1-2. See also R I, para. 72 and C II, para. 38(c).\n\nDoc. C-200. See also R I, para. 72 and C II, para. 38(c).\n\n599.\n\nThere is a dispute as to whether Mr. Maldonado filed a request for reconsideration of this decision on time. In the apparent absence of a request for reconsideration, on 3 May 2007, Ingeominas issued a resolution declaring that its decision to reject the application for the 3ha Contract had become final and enforceable.568\n\nDoc. C-233.\n\n600.\n\nOn 11 May 2007, Mr. Maldonado contested this resolution, saying that he had presented a request for reconsideration at Ingeominas' offices in the city of Valledupar on 2 May 2007. Attached to his letter was a hardly legible request for reconsideration dated 2 May 2007.569 The request seemed to have some irregularities, and did not contain a notary stamp, as required by law.570 According to Mr. Maldonado, after this incident and until April 2008, he received no further information from Ingeominas, except that the case was still under analysis.571\n\nDoc. C-201.\n\nDoc. C-201; Doc. C-207, p. 2. Pursuant to Art. 52 of the *Codigo Contencioso Administrativo (Decreto 1 de 1984),* a *\"recurso\"* has to be filed in person. According to the Prodeco Affiliates, there should be some sort of authentication if Mr. Maldonado had indeed filed the *recurso* in person (Doc. C-209, p. 9).\n\nDoc. C-204, pp. 2-3.\n\nIntegrated Use Agreement\n------------------------\n\n601.\n\nIn early 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates submitted to Ingeominas a proposed Integrated Use Agreement which would allow them to conduct joint operations in the mining areas of the La Jagua project,572 an agreement which Ingeominas subsequently approved.573 Accordingly, on 10 March 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates submitted to Ingeominas a formal opposition to the 3ha Contract, requesting that Ingeominas:574\n\n- Correct the errors in the coordinates of the titles granted to the Prodeco Affiliates, which had created the three-hectare gap; or\n\n- Alternatively, reject the request for the 3ha Contract, because it would be technically impractical to exploit such a small area.\n\nDoc. C-234.\n\nDoc. C-202, p. 2, para. 11.\n\nDoc. C-202, pp. 3-4.\n\nIngeominas backtracks and awards the 3ha Contract\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n602.\n\nPrompted by Mr. Maldonado\u2019s request for reconsideration and by the Prodeco Affiliates\u2019 opposition to the 3ha Contract, Ingeominas went back to evaluate the viability of the 3ha Contract. In June 2008, Ingeominas backtracked on its original decision: it found that the 3ha Contract area did not overlap with other mining concessions and revoked its rejection of Mr. Maldonado\u2019s application.575\n\nDoc. C-205. See also R I, para. 73 and C II, para. 38(j).\n\n603.\n\nIn July 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates filed a request for reconsideration,576 which Ingeominas rejected on 19 August 2008.577\n\nDoc. C-207.\n\nDoc. C-208.\n\n**B. Prodeco Complains to Authorities**\n---------------------------------------\n\n604.\n\nProdeco was now faced with the situation that Ingeominas was about to grant the 3ha Contract to Mr. Maldonado and his partner - a concession which threatened to disrupt the development of the La Jagua mine.578 In this situation Prodeco decided to complain in writing to various Colombian authorities.\n\nDoc. C-300, p. 4. See also Doc. H-1, p. 184; Doc. C-207, p. 9; Nagle III, paras. 7-9; HT, Day 1, p. 184, l. 13 - p. 185, l. 19 and p. 190, l. 14 - p. 191, l. 10.\n\n605.\n\nFirst, on 26 August 2008, Ms. Zuleta, acting on behalf of the Prodeco Affiliates, filed a formal complaint regarding the anomalies surrounding the 3ha Contract with Colombia\u2019s *Procurador General de la Naci\u00f3n.579* Ms. Zuleta forwarded this complaint to the *Ministro de Minas y Energ \u00ed a,* to the *Ministro de la Presidencia,* to Mr. Ballesteros, and to the *Contralor\u00eda.580* In particular, the Prodeco Affiliates explained that:581\n\n*\"Si INGEOMINAS persiste en otorgar a los se\u00f1ores Maldonado Mestre y Garc\u00eda Vargas la concesi\u00f3n del \u00e1rea solicitada como HKT-08031, incurre en un grave y serio detrimento patrimonial contra la Naci\u00f3n y las entidades territoriales beneficiarias de las regal\u00edas derivadas de la explotaci\u00f3n de los recursos existentes en dicha \u00e1rea.* [...]\n\n*El \u00e1rea objeto de la solicitud de concesi\u00f3n en controversia contiene reservas estimadas de 1'114,761 toneladas de carb\u00f3n, que s\u00f3lo [sic] se podr\u00e1n explotar dentro de una integraci\u00f3n con los dep\u00f3sitos 285-95, 109-90, 132-97 y DKP-141, por lo cual, debido a que la explotaci\u00f3n aislada que pretenden hacer los se\u00f1ores Maldonado Mestre y Garc\u00eda Vargas no ser\u00e1 factible, se perder\u00e1n no solo dichas reservas, sino las 10'186,766 toneladas de carb\u00f3n que en el evento de pretenderse tal explotaci\u00f3n habr \u00ed a que dejar de explotar dentro de la integraci\u00f3n aprobada a CDJ, CET y CMU, por cuanto que est\u00e1n contenidas en las \u00e1reas contiguas que constituir\u00edan los taludes de seguridad que tendr\u00edan que dejarse entre las fronteras de los t\u00edtulos mineros circundantes al \u00e1rea solicitada.*\n\n*Por tal raz\u00f3n, la Naci\u00f3n y las entidades territoriales correspondientes dejar\u00e1n de percibir una suma estimada en $106,314,873,123* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-209.\n\nDoc. C-210.\n\nDoc. C-209, p. 8.\n\n606.\n\nSecond, on 22 September 2008, Ms. Zuleta approached the *Procurador General* again, saying that Ingeominas\u2019 rejection of the Prodeco Affiliates\u2019 request for reconsideration constituted a violation of due process and of the applicable mining provisions. Ms. Zuleta emphasised that the *Procurador General* should investigate the fact that the 3ha Contract had been awarded to an ex-employee of the agency, since there had been clear irregularities and an undue use of insider information.582 This letter was, once again, forwarded to the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda*, the *Ministro de la Presidencia* and the *Contralor\u00eda.*583\n\nDoc. C-211.\n\nDoc. C-211, *\"C.c. Doctor Julio Cesar Turbay Quintero - Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica; Doctor Hern\u00e1n Martinez - Ministro de Minasy Energ\u00eda; Doctora Cecilia Alvarez - Ministro de la Presidencia\".*\n\n607.\n\nThird, on 6 October 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates sent a complaint to Mr. Ballesteros and Mr. Edward Franco (with copy to the *Procurador General,* the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* the *Ministro de la Presidencia* and the *Contralor\u00eda),* asking Ingeominas to review the 3ha Contract and to refrain from granting, or at least from registering, the 3ha Contract.584\n\nDoc. C-212, pp. 1 and 5.\n\n608.\n\nFourth, on 10 October 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates asked the *Jefe del Registro Minero Nacional* (with copy to the *Procurador General*, the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* the *Ministro de la Presidencia* and the *Contralor\u00eda)* to refrain from registering the 3ha Contract, claiming that he had a duty to the defend the national interest.585\n\nDoc. C-213.\n\n609.\n\nDid these repeated complaints produce any effect?\n\n610.\n\nRespondent has not provided evidence of any reaction from any of the Colombian authorities to whom Prodeco complained. There is also no written record of any of these authorities taking any action to rectify the situation.586\n\nDoc. C-300, p. 4. The *Contralor\u00eda* and the *Procurador General* simply forwarded the complaints to the *Oficina de Control Interno Disciplinario* at Ingeominas (C-210; C-222).\n\nExecution of the 3ha Contract\n-----------------------------\n\n611.\n\nNotwithstanding Prodeco\u2019s appeals and complaints, on 16 October 2008, Ingeominas (represented by Mr. Franco Gamboa) and Mr. Maldonado and his partner finally executed the 3ha Contract, and thus became the owners of the three-hectare mining concession.587\n\nDoc. C-214.\n\n612.\n\nProdeco\u2019s reaction did not take long to materialize: on 21 November 2008, Ms. Zuleta asked Ingeominas\u2019 *Coordinador del Grupo de Control Interno Disciplinario* to open a disciplinary investigation against the employees involved in awarding the 3ha Contract (with copy to the *Procurador General,* the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* the *Ministro de Presidencia,* the *Director del Programa Presidencial de Lucha contra la Corrupci\u00f3n,* and the *Contralor\u00eda).*588 And in February 2009 Prodeco\u2019s external counsel filed a citizen\u2019s suit *(acci\u00f3n popular)* against Ingeominas and Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda based on the irregularities surrounding the 3ha Contract.589\n\nDoc. C-239. See also Doc. C-222, p. 14.\n\nDoc. C-215.\n\nNo negative inference\n---------------------\n\n613.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 failure to deliver documents responsive to Colombia\u2019s request to produce documents exchanged or reviewed by management related to the challenge of the 3ha Contract, should lead the Tribunal to infer:\n\n- that Prodeco was aware that the challenge would end up on Mr. Ballestero\u2019s desk, and\n\n- that Prodeco \"[w]anted to address the consequences of Ingeominas\u2019 decision to grant the 3ha Contract directly with [Mr.] Ballesteros\".590\n\nR II para. 990.\n\n614.\n\nThe argument is a *non sequitur.* Furthermore, there is overwhelming evidence proving Prodeco\u2019s repeated complaints to the highest administrative authorities within the Republic.\n\n**C. CDJ Buys the 3ha Contract**\n--------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nIn the meantime, in December 2008, Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda had approached Prodeco through an intermediary, offering to sell the 3ha Contract for USD 11 M.591 Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda knew that the three-hectare area was fundamental for La Jagua\u2019s integrated project. Prodeco, on the other hand, initially feigned not to be interested in acquiring the area.592\n\nDoc. R-280, pp. 1 and 2: \"He told me that the US $10 for ton was a starting point, but that price could be negotiated\" and \"Gary, total coal tones are 1\u2019114,000 aprox.\". The value of multiplying 1.14 MT by USD 10/tonne, would amount to approximately USD 11 million (See Nagle III, para. 6).\n\nDoc. R-280. See also Nagle II, para. 22; Nagle III, para. 8: \"I believed that the best approach was to initially delay matters and 'show indifference\u2019 regarding the 3-hectare concession. In this context, I stated that we should tell the concession holders that, 'as we are not interested in buying them [out], even $ 100\u2019000 is too high\u2019\".\n\n616.\n\nBut when the mining operations in La Jagua were starting to surround the 3 hectare concession, Prodeco was left with little option: either to mine around the area, which would imply losing up to 11 million tonnes of coal, or to buy out Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda.593\n\nDoc. C-300, p. 4. See also Doc. H-1, p. 184; Doc. C-207, p. 9; Nagle III, paras. 7-9; HT, Day 1, p. 184, l. 13 - p. 185, l. 19 and p. 190, l. 14 - p. 191, l. 10.\n\nFurther complaint\n-----------------\n\n617.\n\nAt the end of March 2009,594 Prodeco made a last complaint to the *Ministro de Presidencia* about the irregularities surrounding the 3ha Contract. Prodeco warned that the lack of a solution to the 3ha Contract situation would leave Prodeco with no option other than to engage in direct negotiations with Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda:595\n\n\"*A pesar de lo anterior a la fecha, seis meses despu\u00e9s de otorgado el contrato de concesi\u00f3n HKT-08031 la administraci\u00f3n no ha iniciado investigaci\u00f3n sobre los hechos mencionados y los titulares del contrato de concesi\u00f3n HKT-08031 no han iniciado actividad exploratoria alguna, a pesar de que la Operaci\u00f3n Conjunta ha permitido el acceso al \u00e1rea siempre que ha sido solicitado*.\n\n*La Operaci\u00f3n Conjunta se vio obligada a modificar su plan minero, lo cual significa menos toneladas de carb\u00f3n explotadas, menos regal\u00edas y menos generaci\u00f3n de empleo.*\n\n*La demora en la soluci\u00f3n de esta situaci\u00f3n, de otra parte, obligar\u00e1 a la Operaci\u00f3n Conjunta a aceptar una comunicaci\u00f3n directa con los titulares del contrato de concesi\u00f3n HKT-08031, lo cual es totalmente contrario a sus intereses y a su pol\u00edtica, pero la Operaci\u00f3n Conjunta no puede seguir viendo c\u00f3mo se afecta su operaci\u00f3n minera sin que se adelante actuaci\u00f3n alguna para corregir la situaci\u00f3n creada por INGEOMINAS\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nThe letter erroneously reads 31 March 2008. There is no doubt that it is of 2009, since it describes facts which are posterior to 31 March 2008 (Doc. C-300).\n\nDoc. C-300, p. 4, para. 9.\n\n618.\n\nOnce again faced with the silence of the Colombian authorities, Prodeco eventually settled for the alternative of buying out the 3ha Contract from Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda.\n\nThe purchase\n------------\n\n619.\n\nThe transaction took place on 4 May 2009:596 Ms. Elsa Arag\u00f3n Barrera, acting on behalf of and in representation of Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Garc\u00eda, executed the Assignment Contract, under which CDJ, one of the Prodeco Affiliates, acquired the 3ha Contract against payment of a consideration of USD 1.75 M.597\n\nThe Assignment Contract is erroneously dated 4 May 2008 (Doc. C-301). There is no doubt that it is actually dated May 2009, as also proved by the draft submitted to Ingeominas for approval (Doc. R-94; Doc. R-95).\n\nDoc. C-301. See also Nagle II, para. 22; Paredes I, para. 17.\n\n620.\n\nProdeco submitted the Assignment Contract to Ingeominas for approval. In that version of the Contract, the price paid was redacted.598\n\nDoc. R-95.\n\n621.\n\nIngeominas approved the Assignment Contract on 8 May 2009, and the transaction was registered on 27 May 2009.599\n\nDoc. R-97. See also R I, para. 80 and C II, para. 38(p).\n\nPayment of the Purchase Price\n-----------------------------\n\n622.\n\nThe Assignment Contract provided that CDJ should make the payments due in Colombian Pesos, in two designated accounts opened in two Colombian banks *(Banco Davivienda* and *Banco Occidente').*600 There is evidence that CDJ, a Colombian company affiliated to Prodeco, made the payments by transferring funds to the sellers\u2019 accounts located in Colombia and identified in the Assignment Contract.601\n\nDoc. C-301, pp. 1-2.\n\nDoc. C-303; Doc. C-307; Doc. C-308.\n\n623.\n\nThere is also evidence in the file that, once payment had been made, CDJ made the appropriate tax withholding required under Colombian tax law.602\n\nDoc. C-315, p. 2; Doc. C-316, p. 2.\n\n624.\n\nThe transaction was also reflected in CDJ\u2019s audited financial statements of February 2010,603 and on 1 February 2010, CDJ informed Ingeominas that it had acquired the 3ha Contract from Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda, this time disclosing the consideration of USD 1.75 M paid to both.604\n\nDoc. C-313, pp. 5-6.\n\nDoc. C-312, p. 2. The amount in USD is slightly higher than USD 875,000 corresponding to each partner due to exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nFurther Complaints\n------------------\n\n625.\n\nThere is also evidence that even after the Assignment Contract was executed, Prodeco continued to complain about the irregular character of the grant of the three-hectare concession to Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda.\n\n626.\n\nMr. Oscar Paredes, Respondent\u2019s witness in this arbitration, who replaced Mr. Ballesteros as *Director General* of Ingeominas, recalls that Dra. Zuleta personally raised the issue with him:605\n\n*\"Cuando fui nombrado Director General de Ingeominas en febrero de 2011, esta entidad se encontraba en una profunda crisis institucional y reputacional caracterizada por diversos cuestionamientos por la adjudicaci\u00f3n de titulos mineros en zonas ambientales excluidas de la actividad minera, la falta de acciones para frenar la especulaci\u00f3n con los derechos mineros, y varias quejas y denuncias por presuntos actos de corrupci\u00f3n y falta de transparencia.* [...] *Recuerdo, por ejemplo, una conversaci\u00f3n con la Dra. Mar\u00eda Margarita Zuleta, representante legal de Prodeco, en la que me coment\u00f3 que su empresa hab\u00eda tenido que adquirir, a un precio exorbitante un contrato minero de tres hect\u00e1reas que se encontraba en el medio de otros contratos mineros que eran operados conjuntamente por Carbones de la Jagua \".*\n\nParedes I, para. 17.\n\n**D. Public Statement of New Minister**\n---------------------------------------\n\n627.\n\nIn August 2010, President Santos took office and Mr. Carlos Rodado became Minister of Mines and Energy. At a press conference held in May 2011, Mr. Rodado acknowledged that irregularities had occurred in the granting of mining licenses. Certain well-connected individuals had been able to register mining licenses in small strategic areas, in order to \"greenmail\" owners of adjacent mining exploitations:606\n\n*\"Que les permiten negociar con los dos titulares vecinos. Los titulares vecinos pueden ser uno mismo. Tienen un \u00e1rea aqu\u00ed, y tiene otra \u00e1rea, pero aqu\u00ed se mete un corredor. Y este se\u00f1or del corredor adquiere digamos un poder de negociaci\u00f3n y vende estos t\u00edtulos a un precio alto, alt\u00edsimo y los que quieren, las empresas ellas que quieren hacer una explotaci\u00f3n que permita un aprovechamiento racional de los recursos tienen que comprarle al precio que este especulador quiere cobrar.*\n\n*Y aqu\u00ed quiero hacer una declaraci\u00f3n. La gran mayor\u00eda de las empresas mineras que trabajan en Colombia son unas empresas serias* [...] *y ellos son los primeros interesados en que haya transparencia y que haya un manejo eficiente, y est\u00e1n cooperando y colaborando en que las investigaciones que se hagan den resultados.

Y si es de un ex funcionario de una de las entidades que han manejado la miner\u00eda en Colombia, esto se vuelve tambi\u00e9n un caso de verdadera duda que merece ser investigado por los organismos competentes. Nosotros obviamente tenemos nombres de quienes son los titulares de todo esto, pero nosotros obviamente no somos organismo de investigaci\u00f3n, no somos \u00f3rgano de control, no somos poder judicial, pero pondremos todo esto en manos de las autoridades pertinentes\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. R-237, video of the press conference, min. 00:00-02:49.\n\n628.\n\nIt is noteworthy that during this press conference Minister Rodado used a PowerPoint presentation in which Prodeco\u2019s three-hectare concession was clearly visible,607 and that in his public statement there is no allegation that Prodeco had bribed any public official or had otherwise engaged in improper conduct. To the contrary, he explicitly stated that most mining companies working in Colombia were responsible enterprises. At that time, criticism was directed at the former Ingeominas employees who had granted the irregular mining contracts.\n\nDoc. R-237, min. 01:45. In the video there is a zoom in on Mr. Rodado\u2019s PowerPoint presentation, in which it is possible to read \"Carbones de La Jagua S.A.\".\n\n629.\n\nAlthough Minister Rodado announced *\"pondremos todo esto en manos de las autoridades pertinentes\"*, there is no information in the file showing that any Colombian authority commenced a formal investigation into the events surrounding the 3ha Contract (or any of the other analogous irregular situations).\n\n**E. No Reference to Corruption nor to the 3ha Contract**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n630.\n\nMinister Rodado never accused Prodeco or Glencore of improper behaviour - to the contrary, he portrayed mining companies in general as victims of greenmail, permitted by the unscrupulous behaviour of certain civil servants and insiders.\n\n631.\n\nThere is also no accusation of corruption in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding. In this extensive and thoroughly researched administrative file, the *Contralor\u00eda* never alleged that Prodeco had bribed Mr. Ballesteros; in fact, there is no reference at all to the 3ha Contract.\n\n632.\n\nThe *Contaloria's* Decision and the Appeal Decision found that Prodeco had acted with *dolo,* in essence because, when negotiating the Eighth Amendment, Prodeco was considered to have taken advantage of the frailty of Ingeominas and had advanced its own interests to the detriment of those of Colombia. But in the course of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, there is no indication that either Prodeco or its parent Glencore had engaged in the corruption of public officials.608\n\nAs Prodeco has established in the Annulment Procedure; see Doc. R-2, pp. 41-42.\n\n633.\n\nThe same is true for the Procedure for Contractual Annulment filed by the new mining agencies that succeeded Ingeominas: in their submissions to the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca,* the SGC and the ANM never raised any accusation that either Prodeco or its parent Glencore had engaged in corruption of public officials.\n\n**F. The 2017 Criminal Complaint**\n----------------------------------\n\n634.\n\nThe argument that Prodeco had bribed Mr. Ballesteros was formally raised by Colombia for the first time on Sunday, 10 September 2017, when the Director of ANDJE - the agency which provides legal support to the Colombian State - filed with the Public Prosecutor a Criminal Complaint against (unnamed) officers of Prodeco and Glencore and against civil servants in Ingeominas.609\n\nDoc. C-278.\n\n635.\n\n*Pro memoria:* Claimants had commenced this investment arbitration a year and a half earlier, in March 2016. Colombia's Counter-Memorial, dated 16 November 2017 *(i.e.* one month after the Criminal Complaint), devoted only a few paragraphs to this accusation,610 which was fully developed for the first time in Respondent\u2019s Reply on Preliminary Objections and Rejoinder on the Merits of April 2018.611\n\nR I, paras. 82-84 and 283.\n\nR II, paras. 390-423.\n\n636.\n\nSince the copy of the Criminal Complaint submitted in this arbitration procedure is heavily redacted, significant portions of it remain unknown to this Tribunal. In the unredacted part, the ANDJE provides the factual background to the 3ha Contract (see section **III.(3)**. *supra),* gives a summary of the facts surrounding the negotiation and execution of the Eighth Amendment, and submits a list of articles of the Colombian Criminal Code which might have been violated.\n\n637.\n\nThe Criminal Complaint does not accuse any individual persons of having committed specific forms of illegal conduct, but simply asks the *Fiscalia* to investigate and to determine:612\n\n\"[...] *responsables por la presunta comisi\u00f3n de los delitos de cohecho, celebraci\u00f3n de contrato sin cumplimiento de requisitos legales, inter\u00e9s indebido en la celebraci\u00f3n de contratos, concierto para delinquir, tr\u00e1fico de influencias y tr\u00e1fico de influencia de particular, por los hechos que se describen a continuaci\u00f3n, relacionados con el desarrollo de actividades de agentes de la empresa CI Prodeco S.A.* [...] *subsidiaria de la multinacional suiza Glencore International AG* [...], *perpetrados durante los a\u00f1os 2009 y 2010*\".\n\nDoc. C-278, p. 1.\n\n638.\n\nThere is no evidence in the file that, upon receipt of the Criminal Complaint, the *Fiscalia* carried out any investigation or indicted any individual because of such Criminal Complaint.\n\n**(3.2) The Procedural Incident**\n---------------------------------\n\n639.\n\nThe allegations of corruption also provoked a relevant procedural incident.\n\n640.\n\nOn 17 July 2017, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial together with certain exhibits.\n\n641.\n\nTen days thereafter, Claimants submitted a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal averring that 41 of these exhibits were private e-mail chains exchanged between Claimants\u2019 management and their in-house and external counsel [previously defined as the \"**Disputed Documents**\"]. Claimants requested that the Tribunal exclude such documents from the evidence.613\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter dated 26 July 2017, pp. 7-8.\n\n642.\n\nOn 3 August 2017, Respondent reacted to Claimants\u2019 allegations, explaining that the Disputed Documents had been legally obtained by the *Superintendencia de Industria y Comercio* [the \"**SIC**\"] in the context of a preliminary investigation into unfair practices by Prodeco and its affiliates at Puerto Nuevo. Respondent requested that the Tribunal declare the Disputed Documents to be admissible evidence.614\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated 3 August 2017, p. 17.\n\n643.\n\nBoth Parties reiterated their requests in their reply and rejoinder letters presented on 22 August 2017615 and 11 September 2017,616 respectively.\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter dated 22 August 2017, section IV.2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated 11 September 2017, section IV.\n\n644.\n\nThe Tribunal had no direct and complete knowledge of the precise content of the Disputed Documents,617 other than by reading Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial and the Criminal Complaint - which transcribed passages from some of the Disputed Documents. The Disputed Documents apparently consisted of chains of private e-mails sent or received by three of Claimants\u2019 managers. Some of the e-mails were either addressed to or sent by Claimants\u2019 (in-house and possibly external) lawyers.\n\nIn the communication sent by the Secretary to the Parties on 27 July 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal announced it would not review the Disputed Documents.\n\nUse of the Disputed Documents in the arbitration\n------------------------------------------------\n\n645.\n\nIt was common ground between the Parties that the SIC had lawfully obtained the Disputed Documents in the course of an antitrust investigation against Prodeco. Yet the Parties disagreed on whether such Documents could lawfully be used in these proceedings.\n\n646.\n\nClaimants argued that the introduction of the Disputed Documents in this arbitration violated Colombian Law and undermined the integrity of the proceedings by breaching basic concepts of due process, fairness, and equality between the Parties, as guaranteed by international law. Respondent denied this allegation.\n\n647.\n\nIn PO No. 2, the Tribunal ruled for Claimants. The Arbitral Tribunal found that the introduction of the Disputed Documents into the record constituted a violation of the international law principle that parties ought to arbitrate fairly, in good faith and with equality of arms618; and that under Colombian Law, their introduction would seem to amount to a *desviaci\u00f3n de poder.*619\n\nPO No. 2, paras. 66-70\n\nPO No. 2, paras. 71-74.\n\n648.\n\nAccordingly, the Disputed Documents were excluded from the file and Colombia was ordered to re-submit its Counter-Memorial free of references to the Disputed Documents and without attaching them.620\n\nPO No. 2, para. 109.\n\n649.\n\nThe Tribunal further clarified that the proper procedure for obtaining evidence from the counterparty was through the agreed-upon document production exercise,621 and gave the Parties the opportunity to re-submit their document production requests.622 The Tribunal then issued certain rules and recommendations for the document production exercise.623\n\nPO No. 2, para. 70.\n\nPO No. 2, para. 113. See also section **II****.(2.1)** *supra.*\n\nPO No. 2, section III.2-5.\n\nDocument R-100\n--------------\n\n650.\n\nAmongst the Disputed Documents was document R-100 [\"**Doc. R-100**\"], an email chain exchanged in May 2009 between Prodeco\u2019s management and its in-house counsel *(i.e.* between Natalia Anaya, Gary Nagle, Chris Phillips, Margarita Zuleta, and Tom\u00e1s Lopez) which discussed the *caducidad* procedure and the negotiations with Ingeominas.\n\n651.\n\n*Pro memoria:* On 23 January 2009, Ingeominas had formally put Prodeco on notice through a *Requerimiento bajo apremio de caducidad*. Ingeominas considered that Prodeco\u2019s unilateral interpretation of the Mining Contract amounted to a contractual breach. By means of the *Requerimiento*, Ingeominas threatened Prodeco with termination of the Contract through a declaration of *caducidad* if payment of the disputed amount was not effected or an appropriate justification provided within one month.624\n\nDoc. C-88 / C-243.\n\n652.\n\nProdeco replied to the *Requerimiento* on 13 February 2009, restating the reasons for its interpretation of the Definitive Price term used in the Contract, and pointing out that Ingeominas had not explained why it disagreed with such interpretation.625\n\nDoc. C-244.\n\n653.\n\nIn April 2009, Prodeco approached Ingeominas regarding the outstanding royalty payments and proposed paying all the disputed amounts into an escrow account, until the dispute on the proper interpretation of the term Definitive Price had been settled.626 Ingeominas rejected this proposal, insisting that Prodeco must pay the disputed amounts directly to Ingeominas in cash, before negotiations could proceed.627\n\nDoc. C-90.\n\nDoc. R-101, p. 3. See also Nagle I, para. 56; Nagle II, para. 25; HT, Day 3, p. 658, ll. 7-11 and p. 661, ll. 10-22.\n\n654.\n\nThe email chain in Doc. R-100 covers precisely the week before Ingeominas rejected Prodeco\u2019s proposal that the payment be made to an escrow account. The email chain starts with an e-mail sent by Ms. Natalia Anaya, Prodeco\u2019s in-house counsel, to Prodeco\u2019s officers and other in-house counsel (Gary Nagle, Chris Phillips, Margarita Zuleta, and Tom\u00e1s Lopez) recounting her conversation with Ms. Marcela Estrada, Ingeominas\u2019 lawyer. In the e-mail, Ms. Anaya says that Ms. Estrada confirmed her agreement with Mr. Ballesteros that Prodeco could pay the contested sum into an escrow account to end the *caducidad* process:628\n\n\"Marcela Estrada confirmed today that she agreed with Ballesteros that they will accept our proposal for the trust and with that they will end the caducity process. She said that Ballesteros did not put any problems to this and that Adolfo supported her a lot so that everything was accepted easily by Ballesteros.\n\nShe will draft the letter today and expects to issue it on Monday (as tomorrow will be in Medellin). I asked her if we should go and talk to Ballesteros about this and she said that it is not necessary because everything was clear for him. However, I told her that I will be following up on Monday and if by then there has been any issue to send us the letter, I will request the meeting with Ballesteros.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. R-100, p. 5.\n\n655.\n\nMr. Nagle, Prodeco\u2019s Chief Executive Officer at the time, responded to Ms. Anaya\u2019s email with the following sentence:\n\n\"Of course he now supports us, we have bought the 3has.\"\n\n656.\n\nThe chain continues with Ms. Anaya reporting on her follow-up with Ms. Estrada, and on the status of the letter that would in fact confirm to Prodeco that the *caducidad* process would end if Prodeco paid the outstanding amounts into the escrow account.\n\n657.\n\nThe email chain ends with a long email by Ms. Anaya reporting on several meetings held at Ingeominas on 15 May 2009. Ms. Anaya explains that Ingeominas\u2019 director, Mr. Ballesteros, changed his mind regarding the escrow account and that the only way to avoid *caducidad* would be for Prodeco to pay the disputed sum directly to Ingeominas. Ms. Anaya recounts that Ms. Estrada told her she believed that it had to do with the 3 hectare issue:\n\n\"First, I met with Marcela and she told me straight away that she is very embarrassed because she assured me that everything was OK, but that Mario yesterday had a sudden change and that (off the record) she believes it has to do with the 3 hectares issue because he is very upset that we negotiated the assignment as it made him look really bad in front of Uribe.\n\n[...]\n\nAfter the meeting, Marcela told me that she strongly considers that it is even more risky for Ingeominas to receive a payment without a cause and then be exposed to having to offset the money after it [has] been delivered to the municipalities, and that she will strongly defend these arguments at their internal meetings. But she said that it is not her decision and reiterated that Mario is so crossed with the 3 hectares issue that she believes it will not be easy for him to accept the trust. [...]\". [Emphasis added]\n\nIntroduction of Doc. R-100 during the Hearing\n---------------------------------------------\n\n658.\n\nAt the Hearing, counsel for Respondent stated that an email existed which showed that the Eighth Amendment had been executed because Mr. Ballesteros was pleased by Prodeco\u2019s purchase of the 3ha Contract.629 He added that the email in question, Doc. R-54, was one of the Disputed Documents which the Tribunal had excluded from the file in accordance with PO No. 2.\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 366, ll. 19-22.\n\n659.\n\nThe Tribunal requested that the Parties agree630 that the email in question, which seemed a highly relevant document, be introduced into the record. Both Parties agreed to the request, and it was further agreed to include the complete email chain in which the email was inserted as Doc. R-100.631\n\nHT, Day 2, pp. 372-378.\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 378, ll. 3-15.\n\n660.\n\nOn the following day, both Parties were granted the opportunity to make brief presentations regarding Doc. R-100 and its probative value.\n\n661.\n\nClaimants asserted that Doc. R-100 showed \"no link whatsoever anywhere of anything between Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Vargas and Mr. Ballesteros\",632 while the Republic reached the opposite conclusion.633 The Tribunal will analyse Doc. R-100 extensively in section **V.1.(3.3)****.C** *infra.*\n\nHT, Day 3, p.623, ll. 18-20.\n\nHT, Day 3, p.628, ll. 12-19.\n\n**(3.3) Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n662.\n\nColombia says that Glencore procured the Eighth Amendment through corruption. The Tribunal takes the contention of the Republic very seriously.\n\n663.\n\nCorruption is morally odious: the proper governance of public affairs and the correct assignment of public goods is substituted by favour and arbitrariness. Corruption is also economically deleterious: it restrains economic development and subdues nations into under-development and poverty, as bribes enriching well-connected civil servants or politicians are financed via inflated prices paid or reductions in income suffered by the poorest citizens. Scarce public funds are misdirected by enriching privileged individuals, at the expense of the common good.\n\n664.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that, provided that there are *prima facie* grounds for suspecting malfeasance, an international arbitration tribunal has the duty to investigate the facts, even *sua sponte*, and to take appropriate measures under the applicable principles of law.\n\n665.\n\nThe Tribunal further agrees with the Republic that an investment obtained through corruption is not protected by the Treaty. Arts. 2 and 4(1) of the Treaty expressly require that the investments, to be protected, have to be \"made in accordance with [Colombia\u2019s] laws and regulations.\"634 Under Colombian law, an investor who corrupts civil servants of the host State to procure the investment commits a crime.635 Therefore, an investment made by corrupting the senior Colombian civil servant in charge of supervising the mining sector would not be protected by the Treaty.636 In light of the clarity of this conclusion, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide, as other tribunals have done, that an investment made through corruption would violate international public policy.637\n\nDoc. C-6.\n\nArt. 28 of the Law 1474 of 2011 (Doc. R-87) and Art. 411 of the Colombian Criminal Code, Law 599 of 2000 (Doc. R-88).\n\n*Flughafen,* para. 129 (Doc. RL-42); *Phoenix,* para. 100 (Doc. RL-37); *Spentex* (quoted in an article by K. Betz, p. 5 of Doc. RL-149).\n\n*Plama,* paras. 141-143 (Doc. RL-36); *Spentex* (quoted in an article by K. Betz, p. 5 of Doc. RL-149).\n\n666.\n\nThe issue to be determined is thus not a question of material law: if Claimants have bribed Mr. Ballesteros, disguising the corrupt payment as the consideration for the acquisition of the 3ha Contract, the necessary consequence will be the loss of international law protection.\n\n667.\n\nThe real question in this case is whether corruption has been proven.\n\nBurden of Proof\n---------------\n\n668.\n\nIn international law, the general principle is *actori incumbit probatio:* the party who alleges a certain fact has the burden to prove it.638 The Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from this principle. Since Colombia is alleging that the Eighth Amendment was obtained through the corruption of Director Ballesteros, it is for Colombia to marshal the appropriate evidence.\n\n*Flughafen,* para. 136 (Doc. RL-42); *Metal-Tech,* para. 237 (Doc. RL-122).\n\n669.\n\nAs for the standard to be applied to assess the evidence, the Tribunal perceives no reason to depart from the traditional standard of preponderance of the evidence, since neither the Treaty nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules impose a different standard. Colombia argues, based on the approach followed by the tribunal in *Spentex,* that the Tribunal should adopt a methodology of starting from \"red flags\" (individual indicia of corruption) and \"connecting the dots\" to obtain a larger picture:639\n\n\"In order to avoid making it practically impossible to prove corruption, the *Spentex* tribunal considered it appropriate to connect the dots in the indicia of corruption before it. It *\"applied a method of 'connecting the dots', thereby assessing all individual indicia in detail and checking the plausibility of a potential picture emerging from putting them together.\"* As a result, the *Spentex* tribunal found that the most compelling explanation of the facts it had considered was that there had been corruption involving the investor and Uzbek State officials [...].\" [Emphasis in the original]\n\nR II, para. 405, footnotes omitted.\n\n670.\n\nIn fact, what Respondent labels as \"connecting the dots\" is nothing else than the time-honoured methodology followed by tribunals in all jurisdictions to establish truth based on indicia or circumstantial evidence: if a party marshals evidence that proves the existence of certain indicia, and it is possible to infer from these indicia (using experience and reason) that a certain fact has occurred, the tribunal may take such fact as established. The Tribunal has followed this methodology.\n\nRelationship with municipal criminal investigation\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n671.\n\nAs noted, corruption is a criminal offence in Colombia. In this case, the ANDJE has filed a Criminal Complaint against officers of Glencore/Prodeco and civil servants in Ingeominas, accusing them of corruption in the procurement of the Eighth Amendment.640\n\nDoc. C-278.\n\n672.\n\nWhat is the relevance of the Criminal Complaint for the present arbitration?\n\n673.\n\nThe Criminal Complaint and this procedure operate in different legal spheres, are subject to diverging standards of proof, and may reach conflicting results. The fact that the Colombian criminal system has not punished (in fact, in accordance with the available record, has not even investigated) the alleged corrupt practices surrounding the Eighth Amendment, does not preclude a hypothetical finding by this Tribunal that corruption has occurred. And *vice-versa.*\n\n674.\n\nThat said, the conclusions of the justice system at the municipal level, or absence thereof, which have a much higher capacity of investigation than this Arbitral Tribunal, is one of the various elements that must be considered when evaluating the available evidence.\n\n675.\n\nThe Tribunal will in the subsequent sections analyse the red flags identified by Respondent (**A.**), and then weigh the available evidence (**B.**). Finally, it will devote a section to the evidentiary value of the email chain in Doc. R-100 (**C.**).\n\n**A. The Red Flags**\n--------------------\n\n676.\n\nIn the course of the Hearing, Respondent identified the red flags which - in its submission - prove corruption:641\n\n- The payment to Mr. Maldonado and his partner,\n\n- The fact that Mr. Maldonado was a former employee of Minercol,\n\n- The timing of such payment,\n\n- Claimants\u2019 concealment of the transaction,\n\n- Claimants\u2019 decision to restrict knowledge of the transaction to three members of its top management, and\n\n- The fact that the Eighth Amendment was executed in open disregard of the applicable law and regulations.\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 476, l. 14 - p. 477, l. 14. See also R II, para. 407.\n\n677.\n\nThe Tribunal will analyse these indicia in turn.\n\n**a. The Payment to Mr. Maldonado and his Partner**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n678.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants paid a strikingly high price of USD 1.75 M for the 3ha Contract.642\n\nR II, para. 409.\n\n679.\n\nIt is undisputed that Prodeco, through one of its Affiliates, made a payment of USD 1.75 M for the 3ha Contract to Mr. Jorge Maldonado (a former employee of the predecessors of Ingeominas) and his partner, and in exchange secured the mining rights for a small plot located in the middle of the La Jagua mine. But the transaction must be viewed in its proper context.\n\n680.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the press conference held in May 2011 by Colombia\u2019s then-Minister of Mines, Mr. Carlos Rodado, where he acknowledged that the granting of mining licenses had been plagued by irregularities, and that certain well-connected individuals, using privileged information, had been able to register mining licenses in small strategic areas, adjacent to substantial mines, with the purpose of selling these licenses at an exorbitant price. And as an example of such greenmail, the Minister specifically referred to the La Jagua mine and the 3ha Contract. He explicitly stated that most mining companies working in Colombia were responsible enterprises, and his criticism was directed to the Colombian mining agencies, which had irregularly awarded licenses for the benefit of certain insiders.643\n\nDoc. R-237, video of the press conference, min. 00:00-02:42.\n\n681.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls that Prodeco vigorously and repeatedly objected to the concession of the 3ha Contract to Mr. Maldonado, and that the objections were dismissed by Ingeominas.644 Prodeco complained not less than four times in writing to at least five authorities within the Colombian government (*Procurador General*, *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda*, *Ministro de la Presidencia*, *Contralor\u00eda* and Ingeominas), denouncing the irregularities surrounding the 3ha Contract. The complaints did not elicit any material reaction from the authorities.\n\nDoc. C-208.\n\n682.\n\nIn the absence of support from the public administration, Prodeco negotiated with Mr. Maldonado the purchase of the 3ha Contract, to minimize the losses of having to mine around his concession. But before doing so, Prodeco made a last plea to the *Ministro de la Presidencia*, reiterating that the administration had failed to launch any investigation into the irregularities, and declaring that it was being forced to submit to the greenmail *(\"aceptar una comunicaci\u00f3n directa con los titulares del contrato de concesi\u00f3n\"\").645*\n\nDoc. C-300, p. 4.\n\n683.\n\nThis last plea also remained unanswered. Only thereafter did Prodeco execute the Assignment Contract.\n\n684.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see any illegality or impropriety in the transaction. It is true that Prodeco yielded to greenmail - but it was a greenmail caused by Ingeominas\u2019 inappropriate registration of the 3ha Contract in favour of Mr. Maldonado, and the Colombian authorities\u2019 unwillingness or inability to react, notwithstanding repeated warnings and complaints.\n\n685.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that Prodeco\u2019s behaviour is exactly the opposite to that normally adopted in cases of bribery. Corruption requires secrecy. In this case, Prodeco announced *urbi et orbi* that it was being subjected to greenmail and requested assistance from the public administration. When the authorities offered no support, Prodeco informed *ex ante* not less than the *Ministro de la Presidencia* that it was being forced to buy the 3ha Contract.\n\nExcessive payment\n-----------------\n\n686.\n\nRespondent also says that the payment made to Mr. Maldonado and his partner was excessive.\n\n687.\n\nThe available evidence shows that Prodeco negotiated the price: Mr. Maldonado initially asked for USD 10 per tonne,646 but eventually settled for the much lower amount of USD 1.75 M. Taking into consideration that the mining operations were approaching the 3ha Contract, and would be severely affected if the 3ha plot had to be excluded, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent\u2019s unsubstantiated argument that the price was excessive.647\n\nDoc. R-280 (Email from A. L\u00f3pez dated 14 December 2008).\n\nThe USD 100,000 figure, repeatedly invoked by Respondent (R II, paras. 52 and 411), is not an internal valuation; it is a recommendation between two Prodeco officers on how to negotiate with Mr. Maldonado (see Doc. R-280, p. 1).\n\n**b. Mr. Maldonado was a Former Employee of Minercol and Carbocol**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n688.\n\nRespondent argues that Mr. Maldonado was a former employee of Ingeominas\u2019 predecessors, and as such he was \"closely connected\" to the *Director General* of Ingeominas, Mr. Ballesteros.648\n\nR II, para. 420.\n\n689.\n\nThe first part of the averment is documented: in accordance with an official certificate, Mr. Maldonado was employed by Carbocol, Ecocarb\u00f3n, and Minercol between 1998 and 2002 as a *\"Profesional especializado\",* his work relationship with these agencies ending in the northern city of Valledupar on 30 June 2002.649\n\nDoc. R-92.\n\n690.\n\nMr. Ballesteros, a political appointee, did not begin his tenure until 2007, *i.e.* five years thereafter, and was based in Colombia\u2019s capital city, Bogot\u00e1, 850 km south of Valledupar.650\n\nDoc. C-297.\n\n691.\n\nColombia has failed to marshal any evidence suggesting that there was any connection, let alone a close one, between Mr. Maldonado, or his associate Mr. Garc\u00eda, and Mr. Ballesteros. They worked at different agencies, in different locations, with a time gap of five years.\n\nNo negative inference\n---------------------\n\n692.\n\nRespondent adds that Claimants\u2019 failure to produce management documents responsive to Colombia\u2019s requests should induce the Tribunal to infer\n\n- that Mr. Ballesteros had a direct interest in the consideration paid by Prodeco and\n\n- that through the payment of an exorbitant payment Claimants secured Mr. Ballesteros\u2019 support.651\n\nR II, para. 993.\n\n693.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees.\n\n694.\n\nRespondent had asked in the document production exercise for internal management documents regarding the negotiations with Mr. Maldonado, and Respondent now complains that no (or only a few) internal documents have been produced. The complaint is baseless. Prodeco had no obligation to prepare internal memoranda justifying its negotiations with Mr. Maldonado. The existence or non-existence of such documentation does not prove the involvement of Director Ballesteros, nor that the payment eventually benefitted Director Ballesteros.\n\nc. **The Timing of the Payments**\n---------------------------------\n\n695.\n\nColombia says that only 10 days after Prodeco was served notice of the resolution approving the assignment of the 3ha Contract, and only six days before such assignment was registered at the Mining Registry, Director Ballesteros caused Ingeominas to enter into the Commitment to Negotiate.652\n\nR II, para. 422.\n\n696.\n\nOn 4 May 2009, Prodeco and Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda executed the Assignment Agreement, transferring the 3ha Contract and receiving the USD 1.75 M consideration. A few days thereafter, on 21 May 2009, Prodeco and Ingeominas signed the Commitment to Negotiate, which eventually led to the execution of the final version of the Eighth Amendment on 22 January 2010.\n\n**d. Claimants\u2019 Concealment of the Transaction**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n697.\n\nRespondent says that Prodeco tried to conceal the acquisition of the 3ha Contract and draws the attention of the Tribunal to the fact that the request for approval of the assignment of the 3ha Contract did not specify the purchase price, which was instead recorded as \"US$\".653\n\nR II, para. 414.\n\n698.\n\nAs a preliminary observation, it seems that it was not Prodeco who submitted the draft Assignment Contract to Ingeominas for approval, but rather Ms. Elsa Arag\u00f3n Barrera, acting on behalf of Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Garc\u00eda.654\n\nDoc. R-94.\n\n699.\n\nIn any event, it is true that the Assignment Contract which was submitted to Ingeominas for approval did not contain the price details.655 But it is undisputed that there was no legal obligation to indicate the purchase price in the form requesting registration of the assignment-656 Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda and Prodeco made the submission in the customary manner, deleting the purchase price.\n\nDoc. R-94; Doc. R-95.\n\nC II, para. 38(p), accepted by Respondent in R II, para. 54.\n\n700.\n\nIn addition, in all subsequent public statements, Prodeco did not conceal the acquisition or the consideration paid:\n\n- On 1 February 2010, CDJ (Prodeco\u2019s Affiliate which had executed the Assignment Contract) complied with its contractual duty to disclose to Ingeominas all assets and services acquired in the course of the preceding year; in that disclosure the payment of USD 1.75 M to Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda was properly disclosed;657\n\n- CDJ made the appropriate tax withholding required under Colombian tax law;658\n\n- The transaction was also reflected in CDJ\u2019s audited financial statements for 2009.659\n\nDoc. C-312, p. 2. The amount is split between both sellers, is expressed in USD and is slightly higher than the USD 875,000 actually paid, presumably due to changes in the exchange rates.\n\nDoc. C-315, p. 2; Doc. C-316, p. 2.\n\nDoc. C-313, pp. 5-6.\n\n**e. Restriction of Knowledge to Top Management**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n701.\n\nRespondent says that only the top management of Prodeco (Mr. Phillips, Mr. L\u00f3pez, Ms. Zuleta, and Mr. Nagle) were aware of the amount which was being paid by CDJ, and that this reinforces a finding that Prodeco intended to conceal the transaction.660\n\nR II, para. 414.\n\n702.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that in an email dated 1 May 2009, it was agreed that information within the company should be restricted to Mr. Phillips, Ms. Zuleta, and Mr. Nagle.661\n\nDoc. R-271.\n\n703.\n\nBut Claimants have convincingly explained that this restriction only operated prior to the closing of the 3ha Contract - a standard practice, Claimants say, to avoid information leaks. But once the deal had been closed, information pertaining to the transaction was made available to other officers of Prodeco, and by the date of payment of the second instalment (on 28 May 2009), at least eight additional employees had been made aware of the deal and of the consideration paid.662\n\nC III, footnote 99. These employees include Carlos Carrillo, Edgardo Alberto Pich\u00f3n Visbal, Juan Rafael, Ch\u00e1vez Ruiz, Sandra Milena Molina Ramos, Viviana Gaines Vimos, Lucila Casas, and the entire *\"Contabilidad\"* Department (Doc. C-304); Monica Bossa (Doc. C-305); and Carmen Julia Duarte (Doc. R-282 and R-322).\n\nf. **Disregard of Mandatory Regulations**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n704.\n\nRespondent says further that, because of Claimants\u2019 undue influence, Mr. Ballesteros disregarded applicable laws and regulations when negotiating and approving the Eighth Amendment.663 Respondent avers that Director Ballesteros did not submit the Eighth Amendment to the *Consejo Directivo* (*infra*, **(i)**), and that he failed to request mandatory advice from Ingeominas\u2019 Contracting Committee **(ii)**.\n\nR I, para. 282; R II, para. 390; H 2, p. 24.\n\n(i) *Consejo Directivo*\n-----------------------\n\n705.\n\nUnder Colombian law, Ingeominas did not require approval of its *Consejo Directivo* in order to conclude the Eighth Amendment*.* This conclusion derives from Decree 252 of 2004, which does not include among the functions of the *Consejo Directivo* the approval of mining contracts or their amendments,664 a point that was confirmed by the former *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* Mr. Mart\u00ednez Torres.665\n\nDoc. C-190.\n\n*Versi\u00f3n Libre y Espont\u00e1nea* rendered by the then-Minister Mart\u00ednez Torres in Doc. R-81, p. 2: *\"Quiero recordar que el Consejo Directivo de INGEOMINAS, no tiene autoridad sobre el ente de INGEOMINAS, sino simplemente act\u00faa como un verdadero consejero, por tanto, pues no podiamos dar \u00f3rdenes a INGEOMINAS, si orientaci\u00f3n que fue lo que el Ministro hizo en todo momento\";* HT, Day 4 (Mr. Martinez\u2019s deposition), p. 1098, ll. 8-10. See also Doc. C-115 (p. 2), in which Mr. Ballesteros refers simply to the need for a \"recommendation\" from the *Consejo Directivo* and Doc. C-136, p. 2.\n\n706.\n\nIn August 2009, Ingeominas had approved a document called \"*Guia de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n de Proyectos de Inter\u00e9s Nacional*\", which provided guidelines on the internal procedures to be followed when dealing with *Proyectos de Inter\u00e9s Nacional.666* This *Guia* was an internal document, drafted within Ingeominas, to structure its procedures when handling national interest mining projects.667\n\nDoc. R-102.\n\nDoc. R-102, p. 1.\n\n707.\n\nThe *Guia* confirms that proposals for the approval of mining contracts are presented to the *Consejo Directivo* for a \"recommendation\", not for its approval:668\n\n*\"Se analiza y se eval\u00faa la propuesta en reuni\u00f3n de Consejo Directivo, donde se recomienda sobre su aceptaci\u00f3n, rechazo o complemento y aclaraciones si es del caso*\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. R-102, p. 10.\n\n708.\n\nIn accordance with these Guidelines, the *Consejo Directivo* of Ingeominas was informed on at least seven occasions of the progress in the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment - as reflected in its official minutes (see section **III****.(4)** *supra).*\n\n709.\n\nThe two most relevant meetings of the *Consejo Directivo* were those held on 10 December 2009 (after the execution of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment) and on 26 January 2010 (after the execution of the final version of the Eighth Amendment).\n\n*Meeting of the Consejo Directivo* on 10 December 2009\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n710.\n\nOn 10 December 2009 (one day after execution of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment), Ingeominas held a meeting of the *Consejo Directivo*669 at which Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal appeared and submitted a report summarizing the terms of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.670\n\nDoc. R-150.\n\nDoc. R-149.\n\n711.\n\nMinister Hern\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez Torres testified in the *Contralor\u00eda* proceeding that he disagreed with the signed Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, that he asked for his disagreement to be included in the minutes, and that it was agreed to create a task force to analyse whether the changes were in the interest of the Nation.671 The official minutes simply say that the Minister and the remaining members requested that the issue be re-examined in more detail taking into account the national interest.672\n\nDoc. C-157 / R-81, p. 1.\n\nDoc. R-150, p. 3.\n\n712.\n\nIn any case, Director Ballesteros did not feel comfortable going forward without the support of his Board, and consequently he decided to approach Prodeco and to renegotiate the deal, seeking to accommodate the *Consejo\u2019* s recommendation.\n\n*Meeting of the Consejo Directivo* on 26 January 2010\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n713.\n\nThe next meeting of the *Consejo Directivo* was held on 26 January 2010, four days after the execution of the final version of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n714.\n\nThis time it was Mr. Ballesteros himself who informed the board members that the Eighth Amendment had been signed \"*teniendo en cuenta las sugerencias emitidas por ellos en consejos anteriores\".* He then provided detailed information of the agreed changes.673 The minutes do not reflect any reaction from the *Consejeros.*\n\nDoc. C-257, pp. 4-5.\n\n(ii) Contracting Committee\n--------------------------\n\n715.\n\nRespondent says that the Eighth Amendment should have been submitted to and discussed before the so-called Contracting Committee - and that Director Ballesteros, as a result of Claimants' undue influence, failed to do so.\n\n716.\n\nThe *Comit\u00e9 de Contrataci\u00f3n Minera* was created in June 2004 by an Ingeominas Resolution, later amended in September 2004.674 While under the June 2004 Resolution the Contracting Committee was requested to provide advice to the *Director* regarding all contracts affecting *\"medianay gran miner\u00eda\",* the September 2004 Resolution reduced the scope of the Committee's functions. Under the September 2004 Resolution, the Committee was required to provide advice only when the *Direcci\u00f3n del Servicio Minero*, or the *Subdirecciones de Contrataci\u00f3n y Titulaci\u00f3n Minera y Fiscalizaci\u00f3n y Ordenamiento Minero* asked for its participation:675\n\n\"[...] *en los asuntos que por su complejidad o importancia para el sector minero, sean presentados al Comit\u00e9* [...]\".\n\nDoc. R-10; Doc. R-11.\n\nDoc. R-11, Art. 1.\n\n717.\n\nIt seems that Director Ballesteros chose not to convene the Contracting Committee to seek its advice regarding the Eighth Amendment - as he was entitled to do under the September 2004 Resolution. Instead, Director Ballesteros relied on a group of Ingeominas civil servants - comprising engineers, economists, and legal counsel -who participated in the negotiations and advised him. Whether this was or not a wise decision is not for the Tribunal to gauge. What is relevant is that Mr. Ballesteros did not disregard any mandatory regulation.676\n\nThis conclusion is fatal for Respondent's request for negative inferences in para. 995 of R II.\n\n718.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal concludes that Director Ballesteros did not disregard any mandatory regulation in the way that he handled the negotiation and approval of the Eighth Amendment - and consequently this episode constitutes no red flag.\n\n719.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion is shared by the new agencies created to substitute Ingeominas. These agencies - AMN and SGC - filed in 2012 the Procedure for Contractual Annulment of the Eighth Amendment before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca.* The request for annulment was based on the argument that the Eighth Amendment had failed to meet its purpose and was detrimental to the interest of the State677 - not that it had been negotiated and executed in disregard of mandatory regulations.678\n\nDoc. C-140.\n\nRespondent has also mentioned that Ingeominas failed to obtain external advice. The argument carries no weight, since there is no mandatory rule which requires Ingeominas to obtain external advice.\n\ng. **Destination of Payments**\n------------------------------\n\n720.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants have not provided any details regarding the destination to which they transferred their payments for the 3ha Contract.679\n\nR II, para. 419.\n\n721.\n\nThe evidence proves otherwise.\n\n722.\n\nProdeco has established that the payments to Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda were made on-shore, in Colombian Pesos, and deposited into two identified bank accounts opened with Colombian banks, as established in the Assignment Contract.680 There is also evidence on the record that, once payment had been made, CDJ made the appropriate tax withholding required under Colombian tax law.681\n\nDoc. C-301, pp. 1-2, Doc. C-303, Doc. C-307 and Doc. C-308. See also Doc. R-281; Doc. R-322.\n\nDoc. C-315, p. 2; Doc. C-316, p. 2.\n\n**B. Weighing of the Evidence**\n-------------------------------\n\n723.\n\nRespondent asked that the Tribunal adopt the methodology of \"connecting the dots\" between certain \"red flags,\" in order to reach the conclusion that Prodeco had bribed Director Ballesteros, and that the illicit payment had been concealed in the consideration paid for the 3ha Contract. The Tribunal has carefully analysed the alleged red flags but is unable to make the inference proposed by Colombia.\n\n724.\n\n(i) As regards the alleged first red flag, the Tribunal notes that Prodeco became the victim of a case of greenmailing, due to the improper functioning of Colombia\u2019s successive mining agencies, that Prodeco resisted the transaction with all its means, that it complained repeatedly to at least five Governmental authorities, and that it warned the *Ministro de la Presidencia* before yielding to the extortion.\n\n725.\n\nThis behaviour is antagonistic to and incompatible with Respondent\u2019s accusation that Claimants, through the acquisition of the 3ha Contract, were surreptitiously bribing Director Ballesteros.\n\n726.\n\n(ii) As regards the second red flag, Colombia has failed to marshal any evidence linking Mr. Maldonado and Director Ballesteros.\n\n727.\n\nThe only connection proven by Respondent is that Mr. Maldonado had been an employee of a predecessor of Ingeominas, in the southern part of Colombia, five years before Mr. Ballesteros was appointed *Director General* of Ingeominas. Mr. Maldonado\u2019s historic experience in the mining agency might explain why he had the insider knowledge and connections with former colleagues which permitted him to secure the 3ha Contract. But it does not show any link to Mr. Ballesteros.\n\n728.\n\n(iii) The third red flag is based on a chronological sequence, which starts with the Assignment Agreement, leads in a few days to the Commitment to Negotiate and six months thereafter to the execution of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n729.\n\nThis alleged red flag is based on the logical fallacy *post hoc, ergo propter hoc.* This fallacy is a particularly tempting error, because there is an unconcious bias which equates temporal correlation with causality. This may be true in certain situations, but it can be radically false in others. A conclusion cannot be based exclusively on the order of events, but must consider other factors potentially responsible for the result.\n\n730.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that the date of the Assignment Agreement was triggered by the fact that Prodeco\u2019s mining activities were fast approaching the 3ha strip. There is no evidence linking the Assignment Agreement with the Commitment to Negotiate.\n\n731.\n\n(iv) The fourth and fifth red flags also fail to indicate corruption.\n\n732.\n\nThe evidence shows that Prodeco did not adopt any special measures to conceal the 3ha Contract and the payment to Mr. Maldonado and his partner, but that it handled information affecting the 3ha Contract respecting regulations and in accordance with customary practice.\n\n733.\n\n(v) The sixth alleged red flag is also not a proven fact. There is no evidence that Mr. Ballesteros disregarded applicable laws and regulations when negotiating and approving the Eighth Amendment.\n\n734.\n\n(vi) There is a final red flag, which in fact is a \"green flag.\" Contrary to Respondent\u2019s allegation, Prodeco paid Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda not off-shore, not in an obscure jurisdiction or through some scheme for concealment. Prodeco effected payment into two Colombian bank accounts opened in the name of the recipients, in Colombian pesos and thereafter it made the requisite tax withholding.\n\n735.\n\nProdeco\u2019s conduct shows no intention of concealment, nor any impropriety.\n\n736.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal rejects Colombia\u2019s allegation that Prodeco wilfully designed the 3ha Contract as a means to bribe Mr. Ballesteros. The dots simply do not connect.\n\n737.\n\nIf Prodeco\u2019s intention had been to corrupt Ingeominas, it would not have filed multiple administrative appeals to prevent the grant of the 3ha Contract, it would not have repeatedly complained to the highest Colombian authorities, and it would not have made the payments on-shore, subject to the mandatory tax withholding.\n\n738.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the Colombian criminal prosecutor and the Colombian criminal courts, which have a much higher capacity for investigation than this Arbitral Tribunal, have not initiated an investigation into the alleged corrupt practices surrounding the Eighth Amendment either *in tempore insuspecto* or even after the start of this arbitration.\n\n**C. The Probative Value of the Email Chain in Doc. R-100**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n739.\n\nOn the third day of the Hearing the Parties had the opportunity to make allegations on the evidentiary value of Doc. R-100.\n\nClaimants\u2019 position\n-------------------\n\n740.\n\nClaimants submitted that Doc. R-100 showed no link between Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Vargas and Mr. Ballesteros,682 and hence no proof of corruption could be derived from said document.683\n\nHT, Day 3, p. 623, ll. 18-20.\n\nHT, Day 3, p. 622, l. 19 - p. 623, l.7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position\n---------------------\n\n741.\n\nRespondent made four comments regarding Doc. R-100:\n\n- First, that there was no doubt that the \"he\" Mr. Nagle is referring to is Mr. Ballesteros;684\n\n- Second, that Doc. R-100 confirms the direct link between the 3ha Contract and the Commitment to Negotiate, because the subject of the e-mail was \"Royalties-Caducity update\" and Mr. Ballesteros agreed to finalize the *caducidad* proceedings, precisely in the Commitment to Negotiate, the agreement which led to the execution of the Eighth Amendment;685\n\n- Third, regarding the timing of Mr. Nagle\u2019s email, it was sent on 7 May 2009, 72 hours after Mr. Maldonado and Mr. Garc\u00eda requested Mr. Ballesteros to approve the 3ha assignment to CDJ; and two days after Mr. Nagle\u2019s e-mail, the 3ha Contract was assigned to CDJ;686 thus, by 7 May 2009, Mr. Ballesteros must have already known that the 3ha Assignment had been signed;687\n\n- Fourth, regarding the addressees of Mr. Nagle\u2019s email: the email was sent only to Prodeco\u2019s top management (except for Ms. Anaya), and this shows the secrecy red flag.688\n\nMr. Nagle\u2019s testimony\n\nHT, Day 3, p. 627, 18 - p. 628, l. 11.\n\nHT, Day 3, p. 628, l.-12 - p. 629, l. 14.\n\nHT, Day 3, p. 629, ll. 15-22.\n\nHT, Day 3, p. 631, 1. 20 - p. 632, l. 1.\n\nHT, Day 3, p. 632, 1. 10 - p. 633, l. 3.\n\n742.\n\nMr. Nagle testified in the course of the Hearing, and under oath he explained the context and meaning of Doc. R-100:689\n\n\"Q. Thank you. If you could look at the mail above [Doc. R-100], which is your response to that, and could you give us some context as to what your reaction was and explain in context what essentially you're saying in that response to Ms. Anaya.\n\nA. Well, for a long time, Ingeominas were very much against this idea of an escrow. They told us pay, or we are going to declare caducity and cancel your Contract, and they had quite a firm position on it.\n\nAt the same time as you're aware we had an issue of a 3-hectare Concession in La Jagua, which we were very concerned about, and had--and Ingeominas had been unable to resolve our concerns. We, therefore, had been writing to various and many arms of government to ask them to assist. We understand as a result of this, the Head of Ingeominas, Mr. Ballesteros, came under a lot of pressure. My reaction to Natalia's e-mail was on the basis that just before this discussion, we had ultimately found us buying the 3-hectare Concession despite the fact that we didn't want to buy it. We felt it had been awarded inappropriately. It never should have been awarded. We got to a stage where we were forced to buy this Concession, and I felt at the time that by the fact that we had bought the Concession, Mr. Ballesteros had probably figured that all that pressure would go away because now we had the Concession.\n\nIn his mind, I thought this would be over, and we could go back to a normal discussion over this, over, whatever issues we have without him being--feeling under pressure, that there is some other, let's say, complaints to relevant authorities.\n\nQ. Thank you. I'd like you to now look at the last mail in the chain, which is the e-mail from Ms. Anaya of that date reporting on a meeting she had at Ingeominas. If you could just briefly look through that e-mail, particularly focusing, perhaps, on the first few paragraphs.\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. What did you understand Mr. Ballesteros's reaction to the 3-hectare transaction to be from Ms. Anaya's report?\n\nA. Well, originally, I thought that he would be relieved that the 3 -hectare issue had been resolved in his mind because we had bought it, and that's why I felt he would be as I wrote in my e-mail.\n\nHowever, it seems that the opposite had happened. I do recall we had written to the President's Office. I think Claudia Jim\u00e9nez was the Head of that office at that time. Soon before finalizing the 3-hectare transaction, we had advised the President's office of the facts of matter and it urgently needed to be resolved, and in the absence of it being resolved by Government, we would have been forced to effectively buy the Concession.\n\nIt seemed that the fact that we transacted and bought the Concession reflected badly on President Uribe, who was at that time quite vocal in his pursuit of corruption and didn't want anything to taint the name of his Government. He was coming up to the end of his term, and he didn't want anything tainting the name of his Government or anything further.\n\nAs a result of us buying this, this obviously upset President Uribe, and I suspect that he obviously took it out on Mr. Ballesteros because it reflected badly on the President.\n\nSo, what I--what my suspicion was in the original e-mail on the 7th of May turned out to not be true.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nHT, Day 3, p. 658, l. 22 - p. 661, l. 6.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s position\n-----------------------\n\n743.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Mr. Nagle\u2019s explanations convincing.\n\n744.\n\nIn his email, the words used by Mr. Nagle were these: \"Of course he [Director Ballesteros] now supports us, we have bought the 3has.\"\n\n745.\n\nRespondent construes these words to be an acknowledgement that Prodeco had bribed Mr. Ballesteros through the purchase of the 3ha Contract. Mr. Nagle\u2019s construction is totally different. He explains that Prodeco had been writing to various Ministries and authorities within the Colombian public administration, complaining that Ingeominas\u2019 decision to grant the 3ha Contract to Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda was highly irregular and requesting that steps be taken to undo such decision. Eventually, Prodeco gave in, and decided to acquire the 3ha Contract. In that context, Mr. Nagle thought that Mr. Ballesteros would be relieved that Prodeco had \"solved\" the situation by yielding to the greenmail.\n\n746.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Mr. Nagle\u2019s explanation of his words convincing. Such construction is also confirmed by the following messages in the R-100 email chain: Mr. Nagle\u2019s assumption that Mr. Ballesteros would be satisfied proved totally wrong. Ms. Anaya, an employee of Prodeco, held a meeting at Ingeominas a week later and was told that Mr. Ballesteros was not happy at all with the execution of the 3ha Contract, because the matter had reached President Uribe, and the President was not satisfied at all as to how the problem had been solved.\n\n747.\n\nSumming up, Doc. R-100, and particularly Mr. Nagle\u2019s email of 7 May 2009, do not undermine the conclusion reached by the Arbitral Tribunal that Respondent has failed to marshal any evidence proving that Prodeco corrupted Ingeominas\u2019 Director Ballesteros in order to procure the Eighth Amendment.\n\n**(4) Bad Faith**\n-----------------\n\n748.\n\nColombia submits a second argument: that Claimants\u2019 investment was secured through misrepresentation, concealment, and bad faith. Respondent says that Prodeco misrepresented the economic situation of the project in order to persuade Ingeominas that under the Mining Contract expanding coal production beyond 8 MTA was not economically feasible. Claimants deliberately and in bad faith withheld geological, technical, and pricing information from Ingeominas, thus rendering the agency unable to properly assess Prodeco\u2019s economic proposals.690\n\nR II, paras. 447-451.\n\n749.\n\nClaimants deny having misrepresented or concealed any information from Ingeominas. That said, they add, even if Colombia\u2019s mischaracterization of Claimants\u2019 conduct were correct, there would still be no ground for a jurisdictional objection.691\n\nC III, para. 49.\n\n750.\n\nThe Tribunal will first establish the proven facts regarding the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment **(4.1)** and then it will state its decision **(4.2)**.\n\n**(4.1) Proven Facts**\n----------------------\n\n**A. Prodeco\u2019s Initial Proposals**\n----------------------------------\n\n751.\n\nSix months after executing the Seventh Amendment, Prodeco decided to approach Ingeominas and to propose a new amendment to the Mining Contract.692\n\nDoc. C-82.\n\n752.\n\nOn 23 May 2008, Prodeco\u2019s representatives met with Director Ballesteros, and made a presentation, based on an extensive PowerPoint, suggesting a revision of the economic conditions of the Mining Contract.693 A few days later, on 28 May, Prodeco submitted a nine-page formal request.694 Prodeco argued that the existing compensation arrangement compromised the potential expansion and even the viability of the Calenturitas mining project.695\n\nDoc. C-82.\n\nDoc. C-83.\n\nDoc. C-83. See also Doc. C-82 and Nagle I, paras. 41-45.\n\n753.\n\nThus, Prodeco proposed that, in order to guarantee the sustainability of Colombia\u2019s returns and the viability of the mining project, certain conditions agreed upon in the Mining Contract should be amended:696\n\n- Replacing the ICR index by the API2-BCI7 indexes;697\n\n- Calculating Royalties and GIC based on the value of coal at the Mine\u2019s pithead;\n\n- Capping Royalties at 10%;\n\n- Updating the value of the GIC and introducing a formula for indexation.\n\nDoc. C-82; Doc. C-83.\n\nMonthly arithmetic average of the export prices CIF ARA published by Argus/McCloskey in the index known as API2, minus the monthly average price of the maritime freight costs between Puerto Bolivar and Rotterdam published by SSY in the index known as BCI7 (see Doc. C-96, pp. 1-2).\n\n754.\n\nProdeco proposed the creation of a committee to analyse these potential modifications and, in the meantime, the execution of a memorandum of understanding.698\n\nDoc. C-82, p. 25; Doc. C-83, p. 10.\n\nIngeominas\u2019 reaction\n--------------------\n\n755.\n\nA few days thereafter,699 Ingeominas\u2019 *Subdirector de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n y Ordenamiento Minero,* Mr. Edward Franco, prepared an extensive legal and economic report, analysing Prodeco\u2019s proposal. The report was delivered to Mr. Ballesteros, for submission to Ingeominas\u2019 *Consejo Directivo.*700 The main conclusions were the following:701\n\n- Prodeco had agreed to execute the Mining Contract, and its subsequent amendments, fully aware of its underlying economic conditions;\n\n- The economic conditions of the Mining Contract were not discriminatory or contrary to principles of equity, equality or economic balance;\n\n- Prodeco\u2019s proposal would substantially reduce the State\u2019s revenues and would thus be contrary to Colombia\u2019s interests.\n\nThe precise date is difficult to establish, because the copy in the file is undated (Doc. R-79; Doc. R-80).\n\nDoc. R-80. See also Doc. R-79.\n\nDoc. R-80; Doc. R-24.\n\n756.\n\nMr. Franco\u2019s proposal to the *Consejo Directivo* was the following:702\n\n*\"En cuanto a la modificaci\u00f3n propuesta se recomienda no acceder a la misma por ser poco favorable para los intereses de la Naci\u00f3n\".*\n\nDoc. R-80, p. 13.\n\n757.\n\nDespite this unfavourable initial analysis, the negotiations did not break off and Prodeco and Ingeominas held further meetings to discuss the changes proposed by Prodeco.703\n\nDoc. C-86, p. 1.\n\nProdeco\u2019s second approach\n-------------------------\n\n758.\n\nOn 15 July 2008, Prodeco sent to Ingeominas a second formal request for the revision of the economic conditions of the Mining Contract and the reduction of Royalties and GIC. This extensive request further developed Prodeco\u2019s original proposal, adding a new argument. With a new price structure Prodeco would be able to commit additional investments and increase production:704\n\n*\"6.1 Las condiciones actuales pactadas en el contrato de la referencia para regular las contraprestaciones que Prodeco debe pagar, generan una situaci\u00f3n inequitativa para \u00e9sta que puede afectar la viabilidad econ\u00f3mica del proyecto, am\u00e9n de que constituyen un obst\u00e1culo para futuras expansiones que se encuentran en estudio. Adicionalmente, algunas imprecisiones o vac\u00edos pueden repercutir en situaciones perjudiciales para la Naci\u00f3n.*\n\n*6.2 La raz\u00f3n fundamental de la propuesta de Prodeco radica en que los aspectos inequitativos o ambiguos de las cl\u00e1usulas D\u00e9cima Cuarta y D\u00e9cima Quinta, modificadas a lo largo del tiempo, sean revisadas en beneficio de ambas partes, de manera que se asegure un conjunto de contraprestaciones que al mismo tiempo permitan a Prodeco desarrollar el dep\u00f3sito a su m\u00e1ximo potencial de manera competitiva, as\u00ed como a la Naci\u00f3n percibir un mayor monto de ingresos\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-84, p. 19. See also p. 20.\n\n759.\n\nProdeco submitted a precise calculation of two scenarios - one if the Mining Contract was not amended, and the other if Prodeco's proposals were accepted:\n\n- Under the first scenario, based on the 2006 PTI, the Mine's total production would be 117.5 MT, with a maximum annual production of 10 MTA; Royalties and taxes flowing to Colombia would be just USD 1.9 Bn;\n\n- The second scenario would result in a lifetime production of 225.1 MT and a maximum annual production of 15.5 MTA; in this case the Royalties and taxes collected by the Republic would be much higher: USD 5.4 Bn.705\n\nDoc. C-84, Annex 8.\n\n760.\n\nIn essence, Prodeco was proposing to Ingeominas a win-win alternative: if Ingeominas would agree to a reduction of its Royalties, Prodeco would commit to making additional investments, production of the Mine would increase, costs would be slashed, sales would be higher, and at the end of the lifecycle Prodeco would have earned higher profits and Colombia would have received significantly higher Royalties and taxes.\n\nThe Dispute over the Definitive Price\n-------------------------------------\n\n761.\n\nIn the same letter Prodeco also raised for the first time an interpretative issue regarding the definition of the Definitive Price provision in the Seventh Amendment to the Mining Contract.706\n\nC I, para. 51; R I, paras. 61-62. See also Doc. C-84, paras. 1.3-1.15.\n\n762.\n\nProdeco acknowledged that there were two possible interpretations of the term \"Definitive Prices\":707\n\n- The first interpretation would equal \"Definitive Price\" with the actual sale price received by Prodeco, evidenced in the invoices issued to the buyers;\n\n- The second interpretation would define \"Definitive Price\" as the higher of (i) the FOB Price in the week when the coal was shipped and (ii) the actual sale price obtained by Prodeco.\n\nDoc. C-84, para. 1.4.\n\n763.\n\nProdeco recognised that, until then, it had calculated the Definitive Price based on the second alternative; but Prodeco now submitted that this interpretation failed to consider that the market situation had drastically changed. Prodeco proposed that the Mining Contract be modified, so that after the amendment, Royalties and GIC be adjusted based on Prodeco's actual sale price.708\n\nDoc. C-84, paras. 1.5-1.15.\n\nProdeco unilaterally construes the Mining Contract\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n764.\n\nOn 8 September 2008, Prodeco sent a letter to Ingeominas, stating that as of 30 September 2008 it would calculate Royalties and GIC using a Definitive Price equal to that paid by the end consumer.709\n\nDoc. C-86.\n\n765.\n\nAt the end of September Prodeco did as it had anticipated: it paid the adjustment amount corresponding to the Royalties and GIC of the third quarter of 2008, applying the new interpretation of Definitive Prices. This led to an underpayment of USD 6 M in favour of Prodeco.\n\n766.\n\nThis behaviour did not please Ingeominas. On 17 October 2008, Ingeominas enjoined Prodeco to comply with the terms of the Mining Contract.710 Prodeco reacted ten days later, stating that it was aware that any modification of the Mining Contract had to be bilaterally agreed, but that it no longer required an amendment to the Definitive Price clause, given that its meaning was clear.711\n\nDoc. R-84.\n\nDoc. R-85.\n\n**B. The Negotiations**\n-----------------------\n\n767.\n\nOn 23 January 2009, Ingeominas formally put Prodeco on notice through a *Requerimiento bajo apremio de caducidad.* Ingeominas considered that Prodeco\u2019s unilateral interpretation of the Mining Contract amounted to a contractual breach. Ingeominas notified Prodeco that if payment was not made or appropriate justification provided within one month, the Contract would be terminated through a unilateral declaration of *caducidad.*712\n\nDoc. C-88; Doc. C-243.\n\n768.\n\nThe negotiations between Prodeco and Ingeominas continued, and on 21 May 2009, both parties finally executed a Commitment to Negotiate, in an effort to solve their dispute. Pursuant to the Commitment to Negotiate:713\n\n- Prodeco accepted to pay to Ingeominas an additional amount of USD 6.3 M as Royalties and GIC accrued during the third quarter of 2008, accepting (albeit under protest) Ingeominas\u2019 interpretation of the Definitive Price term used in the Mining Contract;\n\n- Prodeco agreed to continue paying Royalties and GIC based on Ingeominas\u2019 interpretation of the Definitive Price provision, until a final agreement was reached between the parties;\n\n- Both parties undertook to negotiate for a period of 90 days (subject to extension), trying to solve the Definitive Price dispute and any other economic issues affecting the Mining Contract raised by Prodeco; should these negotiations fail, Ingeominas and Prodeco agreed to resort to *amiable composition*, and, alternatively, to domestic Colombian arbitration.\n\nDoc. C-91, pp. 7-9.\n\n769.\n\nOn 3 June 2009, Prodeco made the agreed payment of more than USD 6 M, and consequently the 90-day negotiation period started to run.714 The negotiation period was extended three times, in September, October, and November 2009, before finally expiring on 9 December 2009.715\n\nDoc. R-109.\n\nDoc. C-99; Doc. C-105; Doc. C-109.\n\n**a. Kick-off Meeting**\n-----------------------\n\n770.\n\nIngeominas scheduled a kick-off meeting for 12 June 2009, and sent a letter to Prodeco in preparation of that meeting.716 The letter started with a request that Prodeco submit its proposal, with the economic and legal arguments supporting it:717\n\n*\"Para ello y en raz\u00f3n a la importancia que para INGEOMINAS tiene, como ya indicamos, conocer claramente la posici\u00f3n del contratista, (m\u00e1xime cuando por la reciente vinculaci\u00f3n de algunos directivos y asesores, estos no conocen antecedente alguno del proceso) espec\u00edficamente lo propuesto para la revisi\u00f3n de las contraprestaciones, se hace necesario adelantar una primera reuni\u00f3n en la que el contratista exponga dicha posici\u00f3n, con los argumentos econ\u00f3micos y jur\u00eddicos que la sustentan\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. R-110.\n\nDoc. R-110, p. 1.\n\n771.\n\nIngeominas then added a highly relevant condition: Ingeominas must defend \"the interests of the Nation, and it would do so evaluating \"the net present value\" associated with the project in its integrity:718\n\n*\"Como ustedes bien saben, INGEOMINAS tiene que evaluar en forma integral su relaci\u00f3n con el contratista y examinar toda propuesta que reciba conforme resulte m\u00e1s conveniente a los intereses de la Naci\u00f3n, entendidos estos en t\u00e9rminos econ\u00f3micos y de valor presente neto, con estricta sujeci\u00f3n a las normas legales aplicables, raz\u00f3n por la cual solicitamos respetuosamente considerar esos condicionamientos al momento de presentar su propuesta*\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. R-110, p. 1.\n\n772.\n\nThe kick-off meeting took place on 12 June 2009. Prodeco submitted an extensive PowerPoint presentation explaining its position.719 Claimants proposed to replace the existing Compensation Scheme (Royalties and GIC) with a single flat royalty rate based on Prodeco\u2019s actual sale prices. According to Prodeco, this modification would ultimately generate higher revenues for the State, without impairing the NPV of the project for Claimants.720\n\nDoc. C-93; Doc. R-111 (contains a full resolution version of the PowerPoint presentation, in which it is possible to read on the first page *\"Junio 12, 2009\").*\n\nDoc. C-93, pp. 26-29.\n\n773.\n\nIngeominas\u2019 response came on 23 June 2009, requesting that Prodeco provide a numerical, detailed, and concrete proposal of the requested changes to the Compensation Scheme, and the analyses, valuations, and commitments with respect to future investments, expansion and production:721\n\n*\"Tal como entonces tuvimos oportunidad de se\u00f1alar a ustedes, INGEOMINAS considera indispensable la presentaci\u00f3n de una propuesta que contenga en forma num\u00e9rica, detallada y concreta, tanto la propuesta que el contratista formula a la Naci\u00f3n, como los an\u00e1lisis valoraciones y compromisos espec\u00edficos que en materia de inversi\u00f3n, expansi\u00f3n y producci\u00f3n futura asumir\u00eda la sociedad titular de cara a la solicitud de revisi\u00f3n de las contraprestaciones econ\u00f3micas del contrato\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. R-112, p. 1; Doc. BR-5, p. 1.\n\n**b. The Meeting of 2 July 2009**\n---------------------------------\n\n774.\n\nProdeco presented its proposal at the meeting scheduled for 2 July 2009.722 In a PowerPoint presentation,723 Prodeco proposed a single compensation payment of 10% based on the higher of:\n\n- the actual coal sales price, and\n\n- USD 42.43 per tonne (which was the base price of the 2006 PTI).\n\nDoc. R-114.\n\nDoc. C-95.\n\n775.\n\nAccording to Prodeco, the proposal, by guaranteeing a minimum price per tonne, shielded Ingeominas from the risk of potential decreases in coal prices. In a letter sent two days thereafter, Prodeco again represented to Ingeominas that the proposal would permit a further expansion of the Mine and would also be advantageous for Ingeominas and for the Nation:724\n\n\"*La propuesta contenida en la presentaci\u00f3n adjunta adem\u00e1s de representar un ingreso mayor para Ingeominas y para los departamentos y municipios que reciben regal\u00edas y contraprestaciones, representa un ingreso mayor para la Naci\u00f3n ya que la expansi\u00f3n de la mina permitir\u00e1 incrementar: (i) el n\u00famero de empleos directos e indirectos en la mina, (ii) la contribuci\u00f3n al desarrollo regional, (iii) el rubro de exportaciones, (iv) el valor del capital invertido en la mina y en consecuencia, la inversi\u00f3n extranjera directa, (v) el monto de los impuestos a pagar, y (vi) la contribuci\u00f3n al crecimiento del Producto Interno Bruto\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. R-115.\n\n776.\n\nOn 13 July 2009, Ingeominas acknowledged receipt and declared that it was evaluating Prodeco\u2019s proposal *\"bajo la salva guarda [sic]de los intereses de la Naci\u00f3n y por ende de todos los Colombianos\"*.725\n\nDoc. R-116.\n\nc. **The Meeting of 31 July 2009**\n----------------------------------\n\n777.\n\nThe next meeting took place on 31 July 2009.726 In his witness statement, Mr. Nagle records his recollection of the topics which were discussed: Ingeominas had in the meantime analysed the proposal submitted by Prodeco, and suggested a single royalty rate of 13%, with the possibility of increasing it to 15% if prices rose and Prodeco made windfall profits.727\n\nDoc. R-118.\n\nNagle I, para. 60.\n\n778.\n\nSince Mr. Nagle\u2019s \"main takeaway\" from the meeting was that Ingeominas expected an improved offer, Prodeco submitted a revised proposal on 10 August 2009. Prodeco now proposed:728\n\n- As to the Compensation Scheme, a single compensation rate of 13% (instead of 10% as originally proposed), calculated on the pithead coal prices, and a scaled increase in the single compensation rate up to 15% in the event of extraordinarily high prices, exceeding USD 107 per tonne FOB;\n\n- That the Coal Reference Price be determined monthly by a formula based on the API2-BC17 indexes, using certain time lags.\n\nDoc. C-96.\n\n**d. Communications Between Ingeominas and Prodeco**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n779.\n\nOn 27 August 2009, Ingeominas replied to Prodeco\u2019s revised proposal. Ingeominas explained that it had not stated its official position yet, and made the following clarifications:729\n\n- It considered it to be possible, but had not accepted, to replace the existing Compensation Scheme with a unified payment; this unified payment could not be lower than 15% of the FOB price of coal;\n\n- Any amendment to the Compensation Scheme should generate higher yields for Colombia;\n\n- It did not oppose using a minimum Coal Reference Price to calculate royalties, but the USD 42.43 price proposed by Prodeco was too low;\n\n- It found that the price reported by the producer as the final price in its invoices was not always reliable;\n\n- It was necessary to incorporate an internationally recognized coal price index, with certain time lags.\n\nDoc. C-97, pp. 1-2.\n\n780.\n\nIngeominas explained that its officials were assessing Prodeco\u2019s revised proposal and hoped to come back with a response at the following meeting.730\n\nDoc. C-97, p. 3.\n\n781.\n\nProdeco answered on 1 September 2009, explaining that its improved offer was simply aimed at reflecting the parties\u2019 latest discussions. Prodeco declared that it was open to discuss Ingeominas\u2019 proposals at the following meeting, which should also address the fact that the Commitment to Negotiate was about to expire.731\n\nDoc. R-124.\n\n782.\n\nAs foreseen by Prodeco, the 90-day agreed period for negotiations expired, and on 3 September 2009, Ingeominas officially notified Prodeco that it would resort to mediation, as envisaged in the Commitment to Negotiate.732 But on that same day Prodeco and Ingeominas reached an agreement to extend the negotiation period until 30 October 2009, and no mediation was initiated.733\n\nDoc. C-98.\n\nDoc. C-99.\n\nIngeominas\u2019 letter of 23 September 2009\n---------------------------------------\n\n783.\n\nOn 23 September 2009, Ingeominas responded, after analysing Prodeco\u2019s last proposal. Ingeominas\u2019 initial reaction was negative:734\n\n\"[...] *de manera respetuosa nos permitimos precisarles que no se encontraron razones de \u00edndole jur\u00eddica, t\u00e9cnica o financiera que sustenten las modificaciones contractuales solicitadas\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-100, p. 1.\n\n784.\n\nBut Ingeominas did not completely close the door: if Prodeco submitted clear evidence of the fact that expansion was impracticable under the existing Compensation Scheme, Ingeominas would be willing to review Prodeco\u2019s proposal:735\n\n\"*El Instituto considera que en la medida que la premisa fundamental de PRODECO consiste en la alegada inviabilidad econ\u00f3mica del plan de expansi\u00f3n de producci\u00f3n como consecuencia del esquema de contraprestaciones y regal\u00edas, compete a PRODECO allegar prueba suficiente de tal hecho, lo que hasta ahora no ha ocurrido a pesar de nuestras reiteradas solicitudes, haci\u00e9ndose por lo tanto imposible continuar con una negociaci\u00f3n basada exclusivamente en razones de conveniencia.*\n\n*Si PRODECO allega la demostraci\u00f3n clara del hecho antes indicado, el Instituto estar\u00eda dispuesto a revisar la progresi\u00f3n de la escalaci\u00f3n en el sistema de regal\u00edas a partir de los vol\u00famenes en los que PRODECO demuestre que el pago de las mismas torna inviable la explotaci\u00f3n*\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-100, p. 1.\n\nProdeco\u2019s reply on 30 September 2009\n------------------------------------\n\n785.\n\nProdeco replied on 30 September 2009, asking Ingeominas to indicate which specific data were missing or had not been presented by Prodeco, since Prodeco could not find any request for information made by Ingeominas to which Prodeco had not timely answered. Prodeco further cited all the communications and documents which, in its view, demonstrated that an expansion was unviable.736\n\nDoc. C-101; Doc. R-130.\n\n**e. The Meeting of 5 October 2009**\n------------------------------------\n\n786.\n\nIngeominas and Prodeco held a further meeting on 5 October 2009, **.**737 and a few days thereafter, on 9 October, Prodeco submitted a new letter, with additional explanations.738\n\nDoc. C-101, p. 3. See also Nagle I, para. 66.\n\nDoc. C-102.\n\n787.\n\nProdeco started by justifying its view why, under the existing Compensation Scheme, it was not economically feasible to expand the Mine, in terms of NPV. Applying the present system, the maximum NPV was achieved at 8 MTA, and for higher production the NPV started to decrease as a result of the progressive Compensation Scheme agreed upon in the Mining Contract:739\n\n\"*Por tanto, a partir de dicho punto el valor presente neto del proyecto se reduce, motivo por el cual es claro que ning\u00fan inversionista arriesgar\u00eda su capital para que disminuya el valor de su inversi\u00f3n. En tales condiciones, un proyecto cualquiera deja de ser viable econ\u00f3micamente\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-102, p. 1.\n\n788.\n\nProdeco thus averred that beyond 8 MTA it would be uneconomical to further increase the capacity of the Mine, and provided the following graph:740\n\nDoc. C-102, p. 9 (high resolution image of the graphic presented on p. 4 (English version)).\n\n789.\n\nIn accordance with the graph, with the existing Compensation Scheme:\n\n- Prodeco would reach the maximum NPV of the project with an annual production of 8 MTA, and consequently had no interest in making additional investments to increase capacity;\n\n- Assuming this annual production, the income generated in favour of Ingeominas, in NPV at a 12% discount rate, would amount only to USD 360 M.741\n\nDoc. C-102, p. 1.\n\n790.\n\nIn the letter, Prodeco then submitted its alternative proposal, which it said had been discussed in the meeting with Ingeominas held on 5 October.\n\n791.\n\nUnder this proposal, the present Compensation Scheme would be retained for production rates up to 8 MTA; but for higher production rates a unified compensation rate of 13% would be applied.\n\n792.\n\nIn that case an annual production of 15 MTA would become economical, even if the increase in production required a capital investment of USD 1.6 Bn. Prodeco would be prepared to assume such investment, since the NPV of the project increased to slightly more than USD 200 M. Ingeominas would also benefit in Prodeco's view: the NPV of its take would increase to USD 600 M (again at a 12% discount rate).742\n\nDoc. C-102, p. 2.\n\nAnalysis by Ingeominas\n----------------------\n\n793.\n\nIngeominas asked two of its officers - Mr. Balcero and Ms. G\u00f3mez - to analyse Prodeco's latest proposal.\n\n794.\n\nMr. Balcero and Ms. Gomez prepared a three-page memorandum, dated 20 October 2009, which reached the following conclusions:743\n\n- NPV was a proper financial tool to evaluate long term investment projects; if the NPV was higher than the required investment, the investment was feasible;\n\n- The model submitted by Prodeco had a positive NPV for annual production between 8 and 15 MTA and consequently a project foreseeing production in that range would be financially viable;\n\n- Certain aspects of Prodeco\u2019s model required further clarification;\n\n- Prodeco should submit a sensitivity analysis to confirm the financial viability of the project.\n\nDoc. R-134; Doc. R-135.\n\n795.\n\nThe report did not address Prodeco\u2019s argument that the NPV of the project was maximized at a production of 8 MTA, and that for higher production (which require greater investment) the NPV decreased - and that for Prodeco the best alternative, with the existing Compensation Scheme, was to limit production at 8 MTA.\n\nf. **The Meeting of 26 October 2009**\n-------------------------------------\n\n796.\n\nOn 26 October 2009, Ms. Gomez met with Mr. Johnny Campo of Prodeco to discuss her report.\n\n797.\n\nOn that same day, Mr. Campo sent to Mr. Balcero of Ingeominas the sensitivity analysis,744 reflecting the impact of the variation of certain factors on the NPV of the project at different production levels,745 namely:\n\n- The impact of the variation of the discount rate on the NPV of the Project at different production levels:\n\n- The impact of the variation of the coal sales price on the NPV of the Project at different production levels:\n\n- The impact of the variation of labor costs on the NPV of the Project at different production levels:\n\n- The impact of the variation of fuel costs on the NPV of the Project at different production levels:\n\n- The impact of the variation of the costs of explosives on the NPV of the Project at different production levels:\n\nDoc. R-134; Doc. C-103.\n\nDoc. C-103. See also Nagle II, para. 58; Brattle I, para. 39.\n\n798.\n\nTaking into consideration these different scenarios, Prodeco concluded that \"*a partir de 8Mtpy la expansi\u00f3n es inviable ya que el VPN del proyecto se reduce a partir de este nivel de producci\u00f3n\".*\n\n799.\n\nThereafter, officers from Prodeco and Ingeominas met several times and jointly ran different sensitivity models.746\n\nDoc. C-103; Doc. C-134, pp. 5-6.\n\nAdditional NPV information\n--------------------------\n\n800.\n\nOn 29 October 2009, Prodeco's Mr. Campo sent further information to Ingeominas' Mr. Balcero, at the latter's request. The information took the form of a graph illustrating the impact of an expansion of the project on its NPV, where the blue line represents the incremental NPV:747\n\nDoc. C-255.\n\n801.\n\nThe graph confirms that the NPV maximizes for a production of 8 MTA, and that for higher production expenses rise faster than income, resulting in lower NPVs.\n\ng. **Prodeco\u2019s Proposal of 4 November 2009**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n802.\n\nOn 4 November 2009, Prodeco presented yet another revised proposal to Ingeominas, based on the information and projections reviewed jointly by Ingeominas and Prodeco:748\n\nDoc. C-106. See also Nagle I, para. 70 and Brattle I, para. 40.\n\n803.\n\n(i) Prodeco suggested applying the existing Compensation Scheme for production up to 8 MTA, with a few modifications:\n\n- The Coal Reference Price for liquidating Royalties and GIC would be the actual sales prices, instead of a reference index price;\n\n- GIC would apply when production costs were less than 75% of the sales price; the threshold for GIC payments would be updated annually based on national and international indexes.\n\n804.\n\n(ii) For production in excess of 8 MTA, the first 8 MTA would be remunerated in accordance with the Compensation Scheme described in (i), and the excess would be subject to:\n\n- A flat royalty rate of 5% based on the pithead price, which would apply to production levels between 8 to 11 MTA;\n\n- If production exceeded 11 MTA, a flat royalty rate of 10% based on the pithead price would apply to production above 8 MTA;\n\n- The pithead price would be calculated as the final sales price to the consumer less transport and shipment.\n\n805.\n\nOn 11 November 2009, Prodeco submitted two proposed *formulae* to calculate the GIC payments. Prodeco also drew Ingeominas' attention to the fact that it had been almost six months since the execution of the Commitment to Negotiate, and that despite Prodeco's several proposals, Ingeominas had not yet presented any counter-proposals.749\n\nDoc. C-107.\n\n**h. The Meeting of 17 November 2009**\n--------------------------------------\n\n806.\n\nProdeco and Ingeominas met again on 17 November 2009 and Ingeominas provided Prodeco with some feedback:750\n\n- Ingeominas recognized the need to update the GIC threshold;\n\n- But insisted on using the ICR index as the Coal Reference Price to calculate Royalties and GIC - a point which Prodeco accepted;\n\n- Proposed that a flat 12.6% royalty rate apply to all production when production exceeded 8 MTA.\n\nDoc. R-145. See also Nagle I, para. 71.\n\nFurther analyses\n----------------\n\n807.\n\nOn 25 November 2009, Prodeco\u2019s Mr. Campo sent Ingeominas two charts displaying the impact of Ingeominas\u2019 proposals on NPV.\n\n808.\n\nThe first chart showed the impact of a flat 12.6% royalty rate for production volumes above 8 MTA and GIC thresholds, adjusted by a basket of indexes:751\n\nDoc. C-108, p. 3. See also Nagle I, paras. 72-73 and Brattle I, para. 41.\n\n809.\n\nThe net take of this proposal is that the maximum NPV of the Mine (lower green line) is reached with a production of 15 MTA, and that with that production Ingeominas also maximizes the NPV of its royalties stream (higher green line). Consequently, this solution seems to offer a win-win scenario.\n\n810.\n\nThe second chart referred to an \"11/23 rumor proposal,\" where above 8 MTA the Additional Royalty would accrue, but not GIC. In that scenario, the maximum NPV of the Mine was reached at 8 MTA, a production which does not maximize Ingeominas\u2019 income stream (which peaks at 15 MTA):\n\n**i. The Meeting of 3 December 2009**\n-------------------------------------\n\n811.\n\nOn 27 November 2009, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed a third, and last, extension of the Commitment to Negotiate, until 9 December 2009.752\n\nDoc. C-109.\n\n812.\n\nThereafter, the negotiations continued at a meeting held on 3 December 2009.753\n\nNagle I, para. 74.\n\n813.\n\nIn the course of that meeting, agreement seemed within reach. Prodeco accepted Ingeominas' proposals:754\n\n- A 12.6% flat royalty rate would apply on all production in excess of 8 MTA;\n\n- The ICR reference prices should be weighted to determine a Coal Reference Price to calculate Royalties and GIC;\n\n- The GIC tables should be indexed to the Colombian consumer price index and not international indexes;\n\n- Prodeco's proposal that GIC payments be due only where production costs exceed 75% of sales prices was rejected.\n\nNagle I, para. 74.\n\n**C. Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n814.\n\nOn 9 December 2009, representatives of Prodeco and Ingeominas met and executed the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment. Prodeco and Ingeominas initialled and signed three copies of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment.755\n\nDoc. C-111, shows the initials and signatures; the document shows a stamp saying \"*Sin vigencia por falta de inscripci\u00f3n en el Registro Minero al considerarse lesivo para el Estado*\".\n\n815.\n\nThe Initial Version would enter into force upon its registration at the National Mining Registry and would be deemed to take effect on 1 January 2010.756\n\nDoc. C-111, Clauses 9 and 10.\n\n816.\n\nMr. Ballesteros requested that Prodeco leave its signed copy with Ingeominas, stating that, as a courtesy, he wished to explain the contents of the agreement at the *Consejo Directivo* meeting scheduled for the following day. Prodeco acceded to his request.757\n\nDoc. C-112. See also Nagle I, para. 78.\n\nIngeominas denies registration\n------------------------------\n\n817.\n\nOn 18 January 2010, Ingeominas returned to Prodeco a signed copy of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, with multiple stamps stating:758\n\n\"*SIN VIGENCIA POR FALTA DE INSCRIPCI\u00d3N EN EL REGISTRO MINERO NACIONAL AL CONSIDERARSE LESIVO PARA EL ESTADO\".*\n\nDoc. C-115. See also Doc. R-17, with an internal memorandum of Ingeominas dated 14 January 2010.\n\n818.\n\nIn the cover letter, Ingeominas explained that the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment was contrary to the interests of the Nation and that registration at the Mining Registry had been denied:759\n\n\"[...] *me permito indicarle que con el presente oficio estamos adjuntando copia del Otros\u00ed No 8 al Contrato de Gran Miner\u00eda No 044/89 de fecha 9 de diciembre de 2009, sin la correspondiente inscripci\u00f3n en el Registro Minero Nacional, por considerarlo, despu\u00e9s de efectuarse un an\u00e1lisis y evaluaci\u00f3n de las condiciones all\u00ed pactadas, inconveniente para la Naci\u00f3n\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-115, p. 1.\n\n819.\n\nThe agency explained its decision with the following words:760\n\n\"*Finalmente, es pertinente indicar que la decisi\u00f3n adoptada obedece a las pol\u00edticas y directrices institucionales, encaminadas a garantizar la adecuada administraci\u00f3n del recurso minero y la debida ejecuci\u00f3n de las condiciones econ\u00f3micas pactadas en el contrato de concesi\u00f3n respectivo, en pro de los intereses de la Naci\u00f3n, siendo estos \u00faltimos los \u00fanicos que pueden orientar la actividad de quienes prestan sus servicios a INGEOMINAS*\".\n\nDoc. C-115, p. 2.\n\n820.\n\nFinally, Ingeominas invited Prodeco to an immediate and joint review of the pending aspects of the negotiations.761\n\nDoc. C-115, p. 2.\n\n**D. Final Negotiations**\n-------------------------\n\n821.\n\nUpon receipt of Ingeominas\u2019 letter, dated 18 January 2010, negotiations resumed.\n\n822.\n\nIngeominas suggested minor adjustments to the royalty scheme, namely, maintaining the existing Royalty rate up to 8 MTA *(i.e.,* a maximum flat 12.6% rate at 8 MTA), but that each additional MTA be subject to an additional 1% rate (*i.e*., the 9th MTA only would be subject to a 13.6% royalty rate, the 10th MTA only to a 14.6% royalty rate, and so on).762\n\nNagle I, para. 81.\n\n823.\n\nProdeco acquiesced to Ingeominas\u2019 proposed modifications.763\n\nNagle I, para. 81.\n\n824.\n\nHence, four days later, on 22 January 2010, Prodeco and Ingeominas executed the final version of the Eighth Amendment,764 which was registered with the National Mining Registry three days later.\n\nDoc. C-15.\n\n**(4.2) Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n825.\n\nPursuant to Arts. 2 and 4(1) of the Treaty, protection applies only to investments made in accordance with Colombia\u2019s laws and regulations,765 and Colombian law requires that contracts be negotiated and performed in good faith.766 This municipal law principle is echoed at the international law level. The principle was stated in *Inceysa* tribunal, and has been reiterated by other tribunals thereafter:767\n\n*\"La buena fe es un principio supremo al que est\u00e1n sujetas las relaciones jur\u00eddicas en todos sus aspectos y contenido.* [...] *En el \u00e1mbito contractual, la buena fe se manifiesta como la ausencia de enga\u00f1os y artificios durante el proceso de negociaci\u00f3n y otorgamiento de los actos que dieron origen a la inversi\u00f3n, as\u00ed como la lealtad, la verdad y el \u00e1nimo de mantener el equilibrio en las prestaciones rec\u00edprocas de las partes\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-6.\n\nDoc. C-184, Art. 1603.\n\n*Inceysa,* paras. 230-231. See also *Frontier Petroleum,* para. 297.\n\n826.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants secured their investment through bad faith and deceit in three ways:768\n\n- First, as of February 2009 *(i.e.* before the negotiations had commenced), Claimants were already planning to increase production beyond 8 MTA without any change in the Royalty regime (**A.**);\n\n- Second, Claimants misrepresented the economic situation of the project in order to persuade Ingeominas that expanding production beyond 8 MTA was not economically feasible under the then-applicable terms of the Mining Contract (**B.**);\n\n- Third, Claimants deliberately concealed information from Ingeominas, namely geological, technical, and accurate pricing information, thus rendering Ingeominas unable to properly assess Prodeco\u2019s economic proposals (**C.**).\n\nR I, para. 285; R II, paras. 446 and 451.\n\n**A. Pre-Existing Plans**\n-------------------------\n\n827.\n\nRespondent argues that:769\n\n\"[...] as of February 2009 (i.e., before the Negotiations had commenced), Claimants were already planning to increase production beyond 8 MTA/108 MT without any change in the royalty regime.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nR II, para. 152.\n\n828.\n\nAs evidence, Respondent refers to a Circular published on 2 February 2009 by Xstrata (an international mining company) to its shareholders, in the course of a failed sale of Prodeco from Glencore to Xstrata, which reads as follows:770\n\n*\"An expansion of production of export thermal coal to 12 Mtpa is planned to be completed by 2013* [in Calenturitas]. *However, work is still being completed to understand the maximum annual production achievable within the current lease area. This may increase production to approximately 14 Mtpa.\"*\n\nDoc. R-303, p. 32 of the PDF.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s analysis\n-----------------------\n\n829.\n\nThe weakness of Respondent\u2019s argument is that its basic premise is false: Respondent avers that February 2009 was before the \"Negotiations had commenced.\"\n\n830.\n\nIn fact, those negotiations had commenced eight months before, in the middle of 2008 (see Section **V.1.(4.1)****.A**. *supra).*\n\n831.\n\nThe evidence does not prove *quod demonstrandum erat.*\n\n**B. Allegations of Misrepresentation**\n---------------------------------------\n\n832.\n\nRespondent also says that Claimants misrepresented the economics of the Calenturitas Mine, in order to induce Ingeominas to execute the Eighth Amendment.771\n\nR II, paras. 164 and 451.\n\n833.\n\nRespondent argues that Prodeco\u2019s presentations to Ingeominas relied on unduly low coal prices and mine costs, and on unduly high discount rates, misleading Ingeominas into believing that the 8 MTA scenario resulted in the highest NPV to Prodeco.772\n\nR II, para. 156.\n\n834.\n\nColombia specifically refers to Doc. C-103, a document which Prodeco sent to Ingeominas on 26 October 2009.\n\nThe Tribunal's Analysis\n-----------------------\n\n835.\n\nOn 26 October 2009, Prodeco and Ingeominas had held a meeting in the morning. As a follow-up, in the afternoon Prodeco's Mr. Campo sent to Ingeominas' Mr. Balcero Doc. C-103, which contained certain sensitivity analyses. In the cover email, Mr. Campo offered to meet with Mr. Balcero on the following day, \"*para revisarlo r\u00e1pidamente y responder* [a] *las inquietudes que tengas*\".\n\n836.\n\nMr. Campo's offer does not indicate any intention of hiding facts or presenting deceitful information - quite the contrary.\n\n837.\n\n(i) Respondent's first argument that Prodeco acted in bad faith is based on the assertion that the coal price range used in Prodeco's sensitivity analysis was USD 40 to 60 per tonne, and thus too low.773\n\nSee Doc. C-103, p. 4.\n\n838.\n\nThe argument does not stand up to scrutiny.\n\n839.\n\nIngeominas, Colombia's mining agency, could never be deceived by a mining company submitting an incorrect price range for coal prices. Ingeominas has ample information of appropriate price ranges to be applied in NPV valuations of coal mines - its team of experts was continuously reviewing mining PTIs submitted by various mining companies, which included (as one of their main factors) the price range for coal.\n\n840.\n\nIn any case, the 2010 PTI, which was approved by Ingeominas, used a price of USD 55 per tonne -774 and was thus within the same range proposed by Prodeco in 2009, proving that this range was not fabricated by Prodeco.\n\nDoc. C-117, pp. 191, 193 and 200.\n\n841.\n\n(ii) Respondent's second argument is that Claimants' mine costs assumption under the 8 MTA scenario were unduly low, as compared to the cost assumptions used for higher production scenarios.775\n\nR II, para. 182.\n\n842.\n\nThis is a highly technical argument, based on the stripping ratios and truck use factors for three types of trucks used in the 6 MTA, 8 MTA, 9 MTA, and 10 MTA scenarios, and supported by an *ex post* report prepared by Brattle.776\n\nR II, para. 185.\n\n843.\n\nClaimants disagree and say that there is no justification: the strip ratios were directly carried over from the internal mine sequence -777 an averment not contradicted by Respondent.\n\nC III, para. 70(a).\n\n844.\n\nAll in all, the Tribunal sees no element of bad faith, simply a disagreement by Respondent\u2019s expert as to whether the truck utilization rate used in Claimants\u2019 sensitivity analysis was correct - a rate which Claimants also used in their own internal mine sequence.\n\n845.\n\n(iii) Respondent finally says that Claimants overstated the appropriate discount rate to calculate the NPV of various scenarios.778\n\nR II, para. 192.\n\n846.\n\nThe argument is baseless.\n\n847.\n\nClaimants included in their sensitivities for each of the production scenarios discount rates of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15%.779\n\nC II, para. 55(b).\n\n848.\n\nIf Ingeominas thought that any other discount rates would be appropriate, it could without doubt have made the calculation itself, or accept Mr. Campo\u2019s offer to provide additional information.\n\n**C. Allegations of Withholding of Information**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n849.\n\nRespondent further avers that Claimants withheld material information from Ingeominas.780\n\nR II, para. 199.\n\n850.\n\nRespondent\u2019s argument is based on a so-called \"Alternative Expansion Scenario\", which was created by Respondent\u2019s expert, Brattle, pursuant to which Claimants could have expanded the total mine production beyond 8 MTA, even under the existing Royalty scheme, by producing 10 MTA and thus exhausting the reserve base within the term of the concession *(i.e.,* by 2035).781 According to Respondent:782\n\n\"The principal advantage of the Alternative Expansion Scenario is that it would have yielded - under the pre-Eighth Amendment regime - (i) a higher NPV to Prodeco than that of the 8 MTA/108 MT scenario, and (ii) a higher NPV to Colombia than Claimants\u2019 15 MTA/245 MT proposal.\"\n\nR II, para. 199. See also R I, paras. 200-206.\n\nR II, para. 200.\n\n851.\n\nRespondent says that, although Prodeco was certainly aware that it did not need the Eighth Amendment in order to increase production, it deliberately omitted to discuss the Alternative Expansion Scenario with Ingeominas.783\n\nR I, para. 206; R II, paras. 220-221.\n\n852.\n\nClaimants aver that Respondent\u2019s argument is a *non sequitur.*784\n\nC III, para. 74.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s analysis\n-----------------------\n\n853.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants.\n\n854.\n\nThe so-called \"Alternative Expansion Scenario\" did not exist at the time of the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment. It is a scenario created by Brattle, *ex post,* for the purposes of the present arbitration. There is no evidence that Claimants ever developed such a scenario, or that Ingeominas, Colombia\u2019s mining agency, staffed with well-prepared civil servants, ever raised such possibility.\n\n855.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent\u2019s allegation that Claimants secured their investment through bad faith and deceit.\n\n856.\n\nThe evidence on the record does not support Respondent\u2019s proposition that Prodeco deliberately misrepresented the economic situation of the Project or tried to conceal information from Ingeominas.785\n\nThe negative inference requested by Respondent in R II para. 999 is totally without merit. There is no evidence that Claimants\u2019 withheld documents relating to the negotiations between Ingeominas and Prodeco.\n\n857.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that Prodeco and Ingeominas negotiated the Eighth Amendment extensively, in good faith, and at arm\u2019s length. The negotiations, which involved two entities with ample experience in the coal sector, were held for a period of over 20 months, during which there were multiple meetings and exchanges of proposals. Throughout the negotiations, Ingeominas had every opportunity to request information and to question the information provided by Prodeco. There is no evidence that Prodeco failed to address any request submitted by Ingeominas.\n\n858.\n\nThe Tribunal is reassured in its conclusions by two facts:\n\n- First, up until the present arbitration, Colombia never raised any allegations of bad faith or deceit in the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment against Prodeco; in particular, in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, the ANM never questioned Prodeco\u2019s conduct throughout the negotiations of the Eighth Amendment;\n\n- Second, Prodeco\u2019s behaviour in the negotiations actually denotes good faith. Indeed, in December 2009 Prodeco and Ingeominas signed an Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, from which Ingeominas eventually backtracked; Prodeco could have tried to enforce the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, which had been duly executed by Ingeominas; instead, Prodeco accepted to renegotiate, so that Ingeominas could be satisfied that the final version of the Eighth Amendment was favourable to the interests of the Colombian State. Prodeco\u2019s conduct is telling and contradicts Respondent\u2019s criticisms.\n\n**(5) Summary of the Decisions**\n--------------------------------\n\n859.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has failed to prove its accusations that Prodeco acquired the 3ha Contract as a means to bribe Mr. Ballesteros into executing the Eighth Amendment or that it misrepresented the economic situation of the project and deliberately and in bad faith withheld material information from Ingeominas in order to secure the Eighth Amendment.\n\n860.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent's Illegality Objection.\n\n**V.2. FORK IN THE ROAD OBJECTION**\n-----------------------------------\n\n861.\n\nRespondent argues that the fork-in-the-road clause of the Treaty [the \"**FIR Clause**\"] deprives the Centre of jurisdiction and the Tribunal of competence over the \"Claim against the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019\",* since Claimants chose local courts to solve the underlying dispute **(1)**.786\n\nR I, paras. 291-296.\n\n862.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the elements for the application of the FIR Clause are satisfied, and that Colombia seeks unduly to expand the scope of application of this provision **(2)**.787\n\nC III, para. 85.\n\n863.\n\nAfter summarizing the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal will analyse the issues and explain its decision **(3)**.\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n864.\n\nRespondent points out that Art. 11(4) of the Treaty contains an FIR Clause, which determines that once an investor has made the choice to submit a dispute to local courts or to international arbitration, that choice is final.788\n\nR I, para. 291; R II, paras. 454-455.\n\n865.\n\nAccording to Respondent, in the present case Prodeco chose to submit a claim against the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision to the Colombian administrative courts before it submitted such claim to arbitration. Therefore, this Tribunal has no competence over the claim against the *Contralor\u00eda.*789\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 479, ll. 8-11.\n\nThe Request for Conciliation triggered the fork in the road\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n866.\n\nRespondent argues that Prodeco started local administrative proceedings against the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision by filing, on 30 December 2015, a request with the *Procuradur\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n* to start extrajudicial conciliation proceedings [already defined as the \"**Request for Conciliation**\"].790 Respondent explains that under Colombian law, conciliation is a mandatory pre-condition to litigation,791 and that the action before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* could not have been validly commenced without this pre-litigation stage.792\n\nR I, para. 299; R II, para. 456.\n\nR I, para. 298.\n\nR II, para. 502.\n\n867.\n\nThe Request for Conciliation was filed over two months prior to the referral of the same claim to arbitration, on 4 March 2016. Claimants thus chose local courts prior to choosing arbitration.793 Respondent avers that the Request for Conciliation suffices for the purposes of triggering the FIR Clause, which requires only that the proceedings be \"referred\" to domestic courts or to arbitration.794\n\nR II, para. 456.\n\nR II, para. 502.\n\n868.\n\nRespondent also submits that it is irrelevant that the conciliation would be extra-judicial in nature, since the Treaty does not exclude this type of proceedings from the FIR Clause.795\n\nR II, para. 503.\n\nThe Tribunal must apply the fundamental basis test\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n869.\n\nRespondent argues that the test for a fork-in-the-road clause to apply has been established by the *Pantechniki* case, as the \"fundamental basis\" test: the Tribunal must assess whether the claim before the local courts and the arbitration claim share the same fundamental basis, and thus cannot be tolerated to run in parallel.796\n\nR I, paras. 303-306, referring to the *Pantechniki,* para. 53; R II, paras. 459 and 466-468.\n\n870.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the claim submitted by Claimants against the *Contralor\u00eda* in the present arbitration shares the same fundamental basis as the claim filed by Prodeco before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* :797\n\n- The claim presented by Claimants against the *Contralor\u00eda* in the present arbitration and the challenge levied by Prodeco against the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision arise out of the same factual matrix: the imposition of the Fiscal Liability Amount on Prodeco; this is evident from the comparison of the arguments presented, on the one hand, by Claimants in the Statement of Claim and, on the other, by Prodeco in the Request for Conciliation;\n\n- The relief sought is the same in both proceedings and both claims seek the same effect: to wipe out the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision and to return the Fiscal Liability Amount to Claimants;\n\n- Claimants use the same legal terminology to articulate their claims in this arbitration and in the proceedings before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* ;\n\n- Because Glencore indirectly holds 100% of Prodeco\u2019s shares and effectively controls Prodeco, one must consider that the claim filed by Prodeco before the *Tribunal Administrativo* was in fact filed by Glencore.\n\nR I, paras. 307-313, 317 and 323; R II, paras. 456-457, 496 and 499; HT, Day 2, p. 479, l. 11 - p. 480, l. 21.\n\n871.\n\nRespondent argues that since the claim before the Colombian administrative jurisdiction predates the claim against the *Contralor\u00eda* in the present arbitration and both claims share the same fundamental basis, the Tribunal\u2019s competence is barred by the FIR Clause.798\n\nR I, para. 323; R II, para. 499.\n\nClaimants\u2019 counter-arguments are baseless\n-----------------------------------------\n\n872.\n\nAs to the counter-arguments raised by Claimants, Respondent submits that the \"triple identity\" test has fallen in disfavour regarding fork-in-the-road clauses.\n\n873.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that the Treaty and recent case-law do not require the strict identity of parties in order for the FIR Clause to be triggered.799\n\nR I, para. 302; R II, para. 459.\n\n874.\n\nRespondent submits that the Treaty contains no language that could justify a requirement of strict identity of the parties. Fork-in-the-road clauses are aimed at preventing the same issue from being adjudicated twice, by different fora, and the same party from having to defend itself in multiple proceedings. Respondent argues that, in order to be effective, fork-in-the-road clauses must cover non-identical parties; requiring a strict identity of parties would open the door to multiple companies, forming part of the same corporate structure, bringing parallel claims against the same sovereign State.800\n\nR II, paras. 460-463.\n\n875.\n\nRespondent further avers that since the *Pantechniki* award was rendered, recent case-law has favoured the \"fundamental basis\" test and discarded the requirement of strict identity of the parties.801 According to Respondent, a consistent line of cases, such as the *Ampal, Grynberg,* and *Apotex* cases, stands for the proposition that the party\u2019s identity requirement must be applied flexibly, and that it is satisfied as between parties in the same corporate ownership chain. In particular, the *Ampal* tribunal found that the doctrine of *res judicata* was applicable \"to the parties to the prior award and to those persons who are in privity of interest with them\".802\n\nR I, para. 316; R II, paras. 468-478, referring to *H&H Enterprises,* paras. 363-370; *Supervisi\u00f3n y Control*, para. 308.\n\nR II, para. 479, referring to *Ampal-American Israel Corp,* para. 266 and also to *Grynberg et al.,* paras. 7.1.5-7.1.7; *Apotex,* paras. 7.38-7.40.\n\n876.\n\nSecond, Respondent submits that neither the Treaty nor recent case-law require a strict identity of dispute for the fork-in-the-road clause to be triggered.803 Again, the \"fundamental basis\" standard of the *Pantechniki* award has gained increasing traction.804\n\nR II, para. 487.\n\nR II, paras. 488-496, referring to *Supervisi\u00f3n y Control,* para. 308.\n\n877.\n\nRespondent says that in the *Salini Impregilo* case, the tribunal found it sufficient \"that the substantive underpinnings of the dispute have been 'submitted to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction\u2019\".805 Similarly, the *Philip Morris* case established that the term \"dispute\" should be understood broadly, and that it was sufficient for both disputes to be grounded on substantially similar facts and to related investments under the treaty.806\n\nR II, para. 491, referring to *Salini,* para. 133.\n\nR I, paras. 321-322, referring to *Philip Morris (Jurisdiction),* para. 113.\n\n878.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants only rely on case-law which pre-dates the *Pantechniki* award to support their claim that the majority of tribunals have adopted the \"triple identity\" test when interpreting fork-in-the-road provisions.807\n\nR II, para. 493.\n\n879.\n\nThird, Respondent rejects Claimants\u2019 argument that the proceedings before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* would be a defensive action, and that the operation of the FIR Clause would somehow be barred. Claimants chose to impugn the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision before local courts and should not be permitted to pursue the same claim before this Tribunal. In any event, neither the Treaty nor case law exclude the application of the FIR Clause on the basis of the purported defensive nature of domestic litigation.808\n\nR II, paras. 506-508.\n\n880.\n\nFinally, Respondent denies that it is estopped from bringing an objection under the FIR Clause. The fact that in the Colombian court proceedings the *Contralor\u00eda* argued that Glencore had opted for international arbitration, and that this choice excludes the jurisdiction of the Colombian administrative courts, is irrelevant. Such statement was only made during the mandatory conciliation proceedings, and not before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca*. In addition, there is no evidence that Claimants relied on the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* statement, nor that such reliance would have prejudiced them.809\n\nR II, paras. 497-498.\n\n**(2) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n881.\n\nAccording to Claimants, for the FIR Clause of Art. 11(4) of the Treaty to apply, several cumulative conditions must be met:810\n\n- The \"investor\", who must be the same investor that brought the international claim,\n\n- Must have \"referred the dispute\", as defined in Art. 11(4) of the Treaty - *i.e.* a Treaty dispute,\n\n- To a \"national tribunal\",\n\n- Before referring it to international arbitration.\n\nC II, paras. 178-179; C III, para. 84; HT, Day 1, p. 228, ll. 12-21.\n\n882.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Colombia cannot demonstrate that a single one of these elements is satisfied.811\n\nC II, para. 180; C III, para. 85; HT, Day 1, p. 228, l. 22 - p. 229 l. 2.\n\nIdentity of investor\n--------------------\n\n883.\n\nClaimants submit that the Tribunal has a duty to apply the text of the Treaty that Colombia and Switzerland negotiated and executed. The Treaty expressly refers to the strict identity of the investor who has referred the dispute to local courts and to international arbitration.\n\n884.\n\nIn the present arbitration, there are two \"investors\" in the sense of Art. 11(4) of the Treaty: Glencore and Prodeco. Glencore and Prodeco are separate legal entities and Glencore is not a party to any domestic court proceedings or conciliation in Colombia. Even if Colombia were able to establish that Prodeco referred the same dispute to a national court, *quod non,* Colombia cannot invoke the objection against Glencore.812\n\nC II, paras. 181-182; C III, paras. 91-96.\n\n885.\n\nClaimants submit that, in any event, the case law invoked by Respondent does not support its argument:813\n\n- In the *Pantechniki* and the *H&H v. Egypt* cases, the same investor had brought both the domestic and the arbitration proceedings; the tribunals simply found that the identity of the counter-party - the respondent, *i.e.* the State and its entities - was not required;\n\n- The *Supervision y Control* decision, in which Colombia\u2019s lead counsel in this arbitration acted as arbitrator, does not conclude that the reference in a treaty to an investor should be understood to include any controlled entities;\n\n- The *Salini Impregilo* case does not relate to the application of the fork-in-the-road clause, but to a \"pre-arbitral domestic litigation requirement\" that serves a fundamentally different purpose.\n\nC II, paras. 184, 199; C III, paras. 97-99, referring to *H&H Enterprises,* para. 367; *Supervisi\u00f3n y Control,* para. 327.\n\nIdentity of dispute\n-------------------\n\n886.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Tribunal must interpret the text of the Treaty pursuant to Art. 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties [\"**VCLT**\"]. Claimants assert that the term \"dispute\" in Art. 11(4) can only refer to the type of dispute described in Art. 11(1), *i.e.* a dispute regarding a violation of the Treaty by Colombia, which is submitted to two different *fora.*\n\n887.\n\nClaimants argue that the dispute resolution clause of the Treaty does not cover domestic disputes, only disputes relating to Treaty breaches, in particular disputes arising from a party\u2019s view that \"a measure applied by the other Party is inconsistent with an obligation\" under the Treaty.814\n\nC II, paras. 186-187; C III, paras. 88 and 101-103; HT, Day 1, p. 232, l. 21 - p. 235, l. 5.\n\n888.\n\nClaimants argue that Prodeco has never submitted a dispute regarding a violation of the Treaty to the Colombian courts. Prodeco simply started a defensive action in Colombia, to restore the *status quo* and to invalidate the Fiscal Liability Amount.815\n\nC III, para. 100.\n\n889.\n\nClaimants contend that the treaty applicable in the *Pantechniki* case had a fundamentally different text, which broadly defined the investment dispute subject to its dispute settlement clause as \"any dispute [...] concerning investments\". Similarly, the *Philip Morris* case is distinguishable due to the textual differences in the treaty between Uruguay and Switzerland and the one between Colombia and Switzerland. Thus, the findings in those cases do not assist Colombia\u2019s arguments.816\n\nC II, para. 188; C III, para. 104; HT, Day 1, p. 235, ll. 6-16.\n\n890.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants submit that at least five cases decided after the *Pantechniki* award adopted the \"triple-identity test\" when interpreting fork in the road provisions, including the *Charanne* and the *Khan* cases, which rejected the fundamental basis test.817\n\nC III, para. 105.\n\n891.\n\nIrrespective of this, Claimants contend that neither Prodeco\u2019s Request for Conciliation nor the subsequent challenge of the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* concerns a Treaty dispute. Locally, Prodeco seeks a declaration that the Decision is not valid under Colombian law, whereas in this proceeding, Claimants seek relief for Colombia\u2019s breaches of the Treaty, which does not include the nullification of the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision as a matter of Colombian law.818\n\nC III, para. 106.\n\nReferral to arbitration preceded the challenge of the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n892.\n\nClaimants argue that they filed the Request for Arbitration on 4 March 2016, and therefore chose arbitration before submitting a defensive challenge to the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision to the Colombian courts on 31 March 2016.819\n\nC II, para. 190; C III, paras. 86 and 107; HT, Day 1, p. 229, ll. 4-11.\n\n893.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the *Contralor\u00eda* itself acknowledged that the Colombian courts lacked jurisdiction over Prodeco\u2019s challenge because Prodeco had \"opted for international arbitration to resolve this dispute, [and] ha[d] definitively excluded the Colombian Administrative Court\u2019s jurisdiction\". The position adopted by Colombia in the conciliation proceedings precludes Colombia from raising the contrary objection in the present arbitration.820\n\nC II, para. 191; C III, paras. 86 and 108; HT, Day 1, p. 229, l. 13 - p. 230, l. 5.\n\nConciliation is extra-judicial in nature\n----------------------------------------\n\n894.\n\nClaimants note that Art. 11(4) expressly requires the referral of the dispute to a national court. The Request for Conciliation, which is a pre-condition to initiating court proceedings, was submitted to the *Procurador*, a non-judicial authority, and did not entail any court fees.821\n\nC II, para. 193; C III, paras. 87 and 110-111; HT, Day 1, p. 231, ll. 3-14.\n\n895.\n\nClaimants explain that Art. 3 of Law 640 of 2001 states that conciliation is \"extra-judicial\" precisely by virtue of being prior to, or outside of, a court procedure. Similarly, Art. 179 of Law 1437 of 2011 makes clear that the first stage of the relevant court procedure begins with the submission of the complaint before the judge, not with compliance of any pre-requisites.822\n\nC II, para. 192; C III, para. 112; HT, Day 1, p. 231, l. 15 - p. 232, l. 2.\n\n896.\n\nAccordingly, there was no need for the Treaty to exclude pre-litigation conciliation.823\n\nC III, para. 111.\n\n897.\n\nIn reference to Colombia\u2019s argument that referral to a national tribunal occurs when the amicable consultation process is initiated, Claimants submit that if that argument were correct, the same test would have to be accepted for arbitration. Consequently, Respondent\u2019s objection would still fail, since Claimants delivered their notice of dispute triggering the amicable consultation process under the Treaty on 28 August 2015, several months before the Request for Conciliation.824\n\nC III, para. 113; HT, Day 1, p. 232, ll. 3-15.\n\nThe Request for Conciliation was a defensive action to restore the *status quo*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n898.\n\nClaimants argue that Prodeco started a claim against the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision as a defensive action under municipal law, seeking to restore the *status quo.* As this relief could only be sought in Colombia, Prodeco\u2019s challenge constitutes the type of defensive action that tribunals in the *Genin* and *Enron* cases deemed not to trigger a fork-in-the-road clause.825\n\nC III, para. 114.\n\n**(3) Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n899.\n\nArt. 11 of the Treaty, which concerns the settlement of disputes between a State party to the Treaty and an investor of the other State party, provides that:826\n\n\"(1) If an investor of a Party considers that a measure applied by the other Party is inconsistent with an obligation of this Agreement, thus causing loss or damage to him or his investment, he may request consultations with a view to resolving the matter amicably.\n\n(2) Any such matter which has not been settled within a period of six months from the date of written request for consultations may be referred to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party concerned or to international arbitration. [...]\n\n(4) Once the investor has referred the dispute to either a national tribunal or any of the international arbitration mechanisms provided for in paragraph 2 above, the choice of the procedure shall be final\".\n\nDoc. C-6, Art. 11.\n\n900.\n\nArts. 11(2) and (4) contain a so-called \"fork in the road\" provision, which allows the investor to opt between different judicial or arbitral *fora* for the submission of an investment dispute, but prescribes that once that election has been made, it becomes final and irrevocable - *electa una via non datur recursus ad alteram*.\n\n901.\n\nRespondent submits that Prodeco chose to refer the dispute against the *Contralor\u00eda* to the Colombian local courts, and that because of that choice Claimants are barred from resorting to international arbitration.\n\n902.\n\nThe Tribunal will briefly summarise the proven facts (**A.**) and then analyse and eventually dismiss Respondent\u2019s Fork in the Road Objection (**B.**).\n\n**A. Proven Facts**\n-------------------\n\n**a.** ***Contralor\u00eda*****'s Decision and Administrative Recourse**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n903.\n\nOn 30 April 2015, the *Contralora Delegada,* Ms. Vargas, issued the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision, which found that by executing the Eighth Amendment Prodeco had incurred liability and held Prodeco and certain civil servants jointly and severally liable to compensate the State for the damage caused.827\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 231.\n\n904.\n\nOn 11 May 2015, Prodeco filed:\n\n- A *recurso de reposici\u00f3n* before the *Contralora Delegada,* the very authority who had issued the Decision, asking for reconsideration of her Decision, and\n\n- A *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n* to the *Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica,* the superior of the *Contralora Delegada.*828\n\nDoc. C-33.\n\n905.\n\nThese administrative appeals proved to be unsuccessful:\n\n- In July 2015, the *Contralora Delegada* rejected Prodeco\u2019s *recurso de reposici\u00f3n;*829 and\n\n- In August 2015, the *Contralor General* issued the Appeal Decision, which affirmed the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision.830\n\nDoc. C-35.\n\nDoc. C-37.\n\n906.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision thus became binding (\"*firme*\") at the administrative level. Under Colombian administrative law, Prodeco could now resort to challenging the validity of the *Contralor\u00eda's* final administrative act before the Colombian administrative courts. Such a challenge required, as a preliminary but obligatory step, that Prodeco request non-judicial conciliation with the *Contralor\u00eda* ; if the conciliation were to prove unsuccessful, Prodeco would be entitled to file a judicial *proceso de nulidad* with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* [already defined as the \"Annulment Procedure\"].\n\n**b. Notification of the Investment Dispute**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n907.\n\nBut Prodeco did not immediately launch a non-judicial conciliation, as a preliminary step leading to an Annulment Procedure before the Colombian administrative courts. Claimants\u2019 first reaction was to start consultations with the Republic under Art. 11(1) of the Treaty - a measure necessary to start a claim for breach of the BIT.831\n\nDoc. C-38. Art. 11(1) of the Treaty provides that: \"If an investor of a Party considers that a measure applied by the other Party is inconsistent with an obligation of this Agreement, thus causing loss or damage to him or his investment, he may request consultations with a view to resolving the matter amicably\" [Emphasis added] (Doc. C-6).\n\n908.\n\nWith this purpose in mind, on 28 August 2015, Claimants wrote to the President of Colombia, Mr. Juan Manuel Santos, formally notifying a dispute under the Treaty.832 Claimants submitted that certain measures adopted by Colombia, including the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision, had resulted in the Republic breaching its obligations under Art. 4, 6 and 10(2) of the BIT, which entitled Claimants to compensation for the damage caused to their investments in Colombia [the \"**Investment Dispute**\"].\n\nDoc. C-38. Claimants also forwarded this letter to several Ministers of the Colombian Government (see p. 26).\n\n909.\n\nThe 28 August 2015 letter put in motion the mandatory six-month consultation period required by Art. 11(2) of the Treaty. After this mandatory cooling-off period, Claimants would be entitled to refer the Investment Dispute either to the Colombian domestic courts or to international arbitration.\n\nc. **Request for Conciliation of the Annulment Dispute**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n910.\n\nWhile the consultations regarding the Investment Dispute were taking place, Prodeco decided to carry out a further preliminary measure necessary to file a judicial Annulment Procedure against the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision: a request for conciliation before an administrative agency, the *Procuraduria General de la Naci\u00f3n [\"**Procuradur\u00eda\"**].* As noted, under Colombian law conciliation is a pre-requisite for launching judicial proceedings against the State.833\n\nDoc. R-3, Code of Administrative Procedure, Art. 161(1): *\"Lap resentaci\u00f3n de la demanda se someter\u00e1 al cumplimiento de requisitos previos en los siguientes casos: 1. Cuando los asuntos sean conciliables, el tr\u00e1mite de la conciliaci\u00f3n extrajudicial constituir\u00e1 requisito de procedibilidad de toda demanda en que se formulen pretensiones relativas a nulidad con restablecimiento del derecho, reparaci\u00f3n directa y controversias contractuales.* [...]\".\n\n911.\n\nProdeco filed a Request for Conciliation on 30 December 2015,834 and the dispute to be conciliated was defined as the annulment of an administrative act (the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision) and the subsequent \"*restablecimiento de derechos*\", including restitution of amounts paid.835\n\nDoc. R-1.\n\nDoc. R-1, p. 10 and Doc. R-2, pp. 50-51 of the PDF.\n\n**d. Referral of the Investment Dispute to International Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n912.\n\nIn the meantime, the consultations with the Republic of Colombia under the BIT proved unsuccessful, and on 4 March 2016, Claimants exercised the option conferred by Art. 11(2) of the Treaty and decided to submit the Investment Dispute to adjudication by international arbitration. They formalized their decision by submitting a Request for Arbitration to ICSID,836 putting the present arbitration in motion.\n\nRfA, dated 4 March 2016.\n\n**e. Conciliation**\n-------------------\n\n913.\n\nThree weeks thereafter, on 28 March 2016, the *Procuradur\u00eda* convened the oral conciliation meeting [the \"**Conciliation**\"] which had been requested by Prodeco in its Request for Conciliation. The *Contralor\u00eda*, Prodeco, and the other parties to the Fiscal Liability Proceeding were in attendance.837\n\nDoc. C-192, p. 2.\n\n914.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* rejected Prodeco's request for conciliation, arguing that the Colombian Courts lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute which Prodeco was intending to submit, because Glencore and Prodeco had opted to submit such dispute to ICSID arbitration *(pro memoria:* Claimants had indeed submitted the Investment Dispute to ICSID arbitration three weeks before).838\n\nDoc. C-192, p. 6.\n\n**f. Annulment Procedure**\n--------------------------\n\n915.\n\nOn 1 April 2016, three days after the unsuccessful Conciliation, Prodeco filed the Annulment Procedure with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca*839*.* The remedies sought in the judicial claim were analogous to those discussed in the Conciliation:840\n\n- Annulment of the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision,\n\n- With the consequent restitution of the amounts already paid by Prodeco in compliance with the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision,\n\n- Certain ancillary requests plus damages.\n\nDoc. R-2. See also McManus I, para. 45.\n\nSubsidiarily Prodeco also claimed against Messrs. Mart\u00ednez Torres, Ballesteros and Ceballos and the insurance companies, requesting reimbursement of the amounts paid to the *Contralor\u00eda.*\n\n916.\n\nThe reasons invoked by Prodeco in its Annulment Procedure were the following:841\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* had violated Colombian law;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* lacked competence to adopt the Decision;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* breached Prodeco\u2019s due process rights;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* 's accusations and imputations against Prodeco are baseless;\n\n- The Decision is poorly reasoned;\n\n- Prodeco cannot be subjected to a fiscal liability procedure;\n\n- The Republic has suffered no damage;\n\n- Prodeco did not incur in *dolo;*\n\n- There is no causal link between Prodeco\u2019s conduct and the alleged damage;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* has incurred in a misuse of powers *(\"desviaci\u00f3n de poder\").*\n\nDoc. R-2, pp. 58-98.\n\n917.\n\nThe reasons invoked did not include the allegation that Colombia had breached its obligations under the Treaty. To the contrary, Prodeco explicitly reserved all its rights regarding the present ICSID Arbitration.842\n\nDoc. R-2, p. 125.\n\n918.\n\nA decision by the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* remains pending.\n\n**B. Analysis and Decision of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n919.\n\nUnder Art. 11(1) of the Treaty, an investor which considers that \"a measure applied\" by the host State \"is inconsistent with an obligation of the Agreement\", must \"request consultations with a view to resolving the matter amicably\".\n\n920.\n\nIt is undisputed that on 28 August 2015, Claimants requested such consultations, by filing a letter addressed to the President of the Republic. The letter stated the view that certain measures adopted by the Republic, including the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision, had resulted in the Republic breaching its obligations under Art. 4, 6 and 10(2) of the Treaty and that as a consequence thereof an Investment Dispute had arisen.843\n\nDoc. C-38, p. 7.\n\nArt. 11(2) of the Treaty\n------------------------\n\n921.\n\nArt. 11(2) of the Treaty provides that, if the amicable consultation is unsuccessful, after \"a period of six months from the date of the request for consultation\" the investor is afforded an option: it can choose to submit the matter either\n\n- to \"the courts or administrative tribunals\" of the host State, or\n\n- to \"international arbitration\".\n\n922.\n\nIn the present case, the Investment Dispute formalized in the 28 August 2015 letter was not settled within a period of six months, and out of the two options offered by Art. 11(2), Claimants selected international arbitration: they did so on 4 March 2016 *(i.e.* more than six months after the request), by filing a Request for Arbitration with ICSID, and putting this arbitration in motion.\n\nArt. 11(4) of the Treaty\n------------------------\n\n923.\n\nArt. 11(4) of the Treaty contains the so-called \"fork in the road\" provision [previously defined as the **\"FIR Clause\"**]: \"once the investor has referred the dispute\" either to a national court or tribunal or to international arbitration, \"the choice of the procedure shall be final\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s diverging positions\n--------------------------------\n\n924.\n\nRespondent, at different times, has held two diverging positions as regards the option exercised by Claimants under the FIR Clause:\n\n925.\n\n(i) In this arbitration, the Republic argues that, when on 30 December 2015 Prodeco filed a Request for Conciliation before the *Procuraduria*, Claimants exercised the option conferred under Art. 11(2) of the Treaty, and opted to submit the Investment Dispute (as defined in the 28 August 2015 letter addressed to the President of the Republic) to the administrative courts of Colombia.\n\n926.\n\nConsequently - adds Colombia - when on 4 March 2016 Claimants filed the Request for Arbitration with ICSID, they breached the fork-in-the-road provision, with the implication that the Centre lacks jurisdiction and the Tribunal competence to adjudicate the Investment Dispute, and that such Investment Dispute must be adjudicated by the Colombian courts.\n\n927.\n\n(ii) On 28 March 2016, however, Colombia held a contrary position.\n\n928.\n\nIn the Conciliation meeting which was held on that date, the Republic, acting through the *Contralor\u00eda*, formally stated that Claimants had opted to submit the dispute which was being conciliated to ICSID arbitration, and that consequently the Colombian courts in general, and the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* in particular, lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate such dispute.\n\n929.\n\nThe minutes of the Conciliation meeting clearly state Colombia\u2019s position at that time, as expressed by the *Contralor\u00eda* :844\n\n*\"De manera respetuosa me permito informar que la solicitud de conciliaci\u00f3n propuesta por CI PRODECO S.A.* [...] *fue estudiada en la sesi\u00f3n quinta (5a) del comit\u00e9 de conciliaci\u00f3n, resolvi\u00e9ndose por unanimidad, NO CONCILIAR las pretensiones de la convocante, y ordenarle al apoderado designado solicitar que el tr\u00e1mite sea declarado fallido, porque hay ausencia de jurisdicci\u00f3n para conocer del asunto.*\n\n*Lo anterior, porque GLENCORE A.G. propietaria de CI PRODECO S.A. activ\u00f3 el mecanismo de resoluci\u00f3n de disputas contemplado por el art\u00edculo 11*\n\n*del \"Convenio entre la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia y la Confederaci\u00f3n Suiza* [...] *\" y ya present\u00f3 demanda arbitral*,*ante el* [CIADI] [...]\n\n*En tal sentido, conforme a lo dispuesto por el p\u00e1rrafo segundo y su literal a), en concordancia con el p\u00e1rrafo cuarto del referido art\u00edculo 11, surge claro que Glecore A.G.* [*sic*] *al haber optado por el arbitraje internacional para dirimir el conflicto excluy\u00f3 de manera definitiva a la, jurisdicci\u00f3n contencioso administrativa de Colombia* [...]\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-192, p. 6.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n-----------------------\n\n930.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the position now adopted by Respondent in the present arbitration.\n\n931.\n\nThe reason is straightforward: on 4 March 2016, Claimants exercised their rights under the FIR Clause of Art. 11(2) of the Treaty and validly opted to submit the Investment Dispute to international arbitration.\n\n932.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s (present) argument, the non-judicial Request for Conciliation, which Prodeco had filed four months before with the *Procuradur\u00eda*, never constituted the exercise of the option conferred by the FIR Clause: Art. 11(4) of the Treaty requires, for the fork-in-the-road to apply, that the investor \"referred the dispute\" to a \"national tribunal\". Prodeco\u2019s Request for (non-judicial) Conciliation before the *Procuradur\u00eda*, an administrative agency of the Republic, failed to meet this test for two reasons:\n\n- First, the Treaty requires that the investor \"referred the dispute\" to a domestic court or to international arbitration; this implies that the dispute be submitted to binding adjudication by an independent body, and that the decision of such body not be subject to consensual validation by the parties; a request for conciliation does not meet this standard: the request is simply an invitation to the other party, proposing that a meeting be held and a settlement be negotiated and eventually agreed upon;\n\n- Second, referral must be to a \"national tribunal\" [as expressed in Art. 11(4)] or to \"courts or administrative tribunals\" [the analogous expression preferred by Art. 11(2)]; the *Procuradur\u00eda* is neither a court nor a tribunal: it simply is an administrative agency of the Republic, entrusted (*inter alia*) with the organization of prejudicial conciliation procedures.\n\n933.\n\nThese conclusions are confirmed by Colombian law.\n\nColombian Law\n-------------\n\n934.\n\nArt. 161(1) of the Colombian Code of Administrative Procedure provides as follows:845\n\n*\"**Art\u00edculo 161. Requisitos previos para demandar.** La presentaci\u00f3n de la demanda se someter\u00e1 al cumplimiento de requisitos previos en los siguientes casos:*\n\n*1. Cuando los asuntos sean conciliables, el tr\u00e1mite de la conciliaci\u00f3n extrajudicial constituir\u00e1 requisito de procedibilidad de toda demanda en que se formulen pretensiones relativas a nulidad con restablecimiento del derecho, reparaci\u00f3n directa y controversias contractuales\".* [Emphasis added, bold in the original]\n\nDoc. R-3.\n\n935.\n\nUnder Colombian administrative law, conciliation is a mandatory pre-requisite for introducing a judicial claim regarding the nullity of an administrative act. As enshrined in the law, this is an \"extrajudicial\", amicable procedure, which is not filed with any judicial authority, but rather with an administrative agency as the *Procuradur\u00eda.*846\n\nDoc. R-3, Art. 161.\n\n936.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by Art. 3 of Law 640 of 2001, *\"por la cual se modifican normas relativas a la conciliaci\u00f3n y se dictan otras disposiciones*\", which provides that:847\n\n\"*La conciliaci\u00f3n podr\u00e1 ser judicial si se realiza dentro de un proceso judicial, o extrajudicial, si se realiza antes o por fuera de un proceso judicial\"\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-187\n\n937.\n\nIn the present case, the wording of the Request for Conciliation filed by Prodeco further supports its extrajudicial nature:848\n\n*\"**Referencia** : remisi\u00f3n de la solicitud de Audiencia de Conciliaci\u00f3n pre-judicial con destino al **Ministerio P\u00fablico**, formulada por **C.I. PRODECO S.A.,** en condici\u00f3n de Convocante, con citaci\u00f3n tanto de **LA NACI\u00d3N -CONTRALOR\u00cdA GENERAL DE LA REP\u00daBLICA** en calidad de Convocada* [...]\n\n*Agotamiento del requisito de procedibilidad para el ejercicio del medio de control judicial de nulidad y restablecimiento del derecho* [...]\". [Emphasis added, bold in the original]\n\nDoc. R-1, pp. 1 and 3.\n\n938.\n\nSumming up, on 4 March 2016, Claimants, by filing the Request for Arbitration, properly exercised their rights under the FIR Clause of Art. 11(2) of the Treaty and validly opted to submit the Investment Dispute to international arbitration. Prior to that date Claimants had never referred the Investment Dispute to adjudication by the national courts or tribunals of Colombia and hence the FIR Clause of Art. 11(4) of the Treaty had never been triggered.\n\n939.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s arguments, the Request for Conciliation which Prodeco filed with the *Procuradur\u00eda* in December 2015 was incapable of triggering the FIR Clause: the Request did not refer any dispute to adjudication by an independent body, and the *Procuradur\u00eda* in any case does not qualify as \"a national tribunal\".\n\n940.\n\nThe first time that Prodeco referred any dispute to \"a national tribunal\" was on 1 April 2016, when Prodeco filed the Annulment Procedure with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca.*849 As this referral occurred three weeks after Claimants had filed the Request of Arbitration, it could never deprive this Tribunal of competence to adjudicate the Investment Dispute.\n\nDoc. R-2.\n\n941.\n\nThe Tribunal consequently dismisses Respondent\u2019s Fork in the Road Objection. In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider and resolve the issues raised by the Parties related to the identity of parties and the identity of disputes.\n\n942.\n\nLikewise, it is not for the Tribunal to decide:\n\n- whether for the purposes of the Annulment Procedure, the Annulment Dispute referred to in the Request for Conciliation and then formalized in the Annulment Procedure coincides or overlaps with the Investment Dispute which is being adjudicated in this arbitration; or\n\n- whether, in view of the fork-in-the-road provision of Art. 11(4) of the Treaty, and the filing of this arbitration, the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* has or lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the Annulment Procedure filed by Prodeco.\n\n943.\n\nThese issues, raised by Colombia in the Conciliation, are for the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca*, and the Colombian courts in general, to decide*.*\n\n**V.3. UMBRELLA CLAUSE OBJECTION**\n----------------------------------\n\n944.\n\nRespondent submits that, pursuant to Art. 11(3) of the Treaty, the Tribunal is precluded from exercising competence over Claimants\u2019 claims grounded on the Treaty\u2019s \"umbrella clause\", contained in Art. 10(2). Respondent also argues that Claimants\u2019 claim against the ANM based on Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty also falls outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s competence, because it is contractual in nature and the Mining Contract contains its own forum-selection clause **(1)**.850\n\nR II, paras. 512 and 549.\n\n945.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Art. 11(3) is incorrect, and that the Tribunal is competent over the claims based on the umbrella clause of the Treaty. Claimants also submit that all of their claims are based on breaches of the Treaty, not of the Mining Contract, and that Respondent\u2019s objection is groundless **(2)**.851\n\nC II, para. 203.\n\n946.\n\nAfter summarizing the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal will make its decision **(3)**.\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n947.\n\nRespondent explains that Claimants\u2019 claims relate to the conduct of the *Contralor\u00eda* and to the conduct of the ANM:852\n\n- One of Claimants\u2019 claims is that Colombia breached Art. 10(2) of the Treaty, which requires Colombia to observe obligations deriving from a written agreement concluded between its central government, or agencies thereof, and an investor of the other Party, with regard to a specific investment [the \"**Umbrella Clause**\"];853\n\n- Another of Claimants\u2019 claims is that Colombia breached Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.\n\nR II, para. 510.\n\nR II, para. 511.\n\n948.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants\u2019 claims fall outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s competence for two reasons:854\n\n- First, Colombia has not consented to arbitrate claims arising in relation with the Umbrella Clause contained in Art. 10(2) of the Treaty (**A.**);\n\n- Second, the claim against the ANM is contractual in nature and must be tried before the Colombian courts, pursuant to the forum-selection clause contained in the Mining Contract (**B.**).\n\nR I, para. 326; R II, para. 512.\n\n**A. No Competence over Claims Grounded in the Umbrella Clause**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n949.\n\nRespondent submits that Art. 11(3) of the Treaty contains a carve-out: Colombia has not given its consent to submit to international arbitration disputes which may arise on the basis of the Umbrella Clause of Art. 10(2). As a consequence, to the extent that Claimants\u2019 claims against the ANM and the *Contralor\u00eda* are grounded on the Umbrella Clause, they may not be heard in this arbitration.855\n\nR I, para. 327; R II, paras. 513-514.\n\n950.\n\nRespondent refers to two paragraphs of Claimants\u2019 Reply Memorial, and says that the claims in question fall outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction:856\n\n- The claim that \"the *[Contralor\u00eda's* Decision] effectively nullified the commitments in the Eighth Amendment with regard to 2010 by requiring Prodeco to pay royalties and compensation as if the Eighth Amendment did not exist\"; and\n\n- The claim that \"the State Mining Agency\u2019s efforts to abrogate its commitments under the Eighth Amendment [which] breach its obligations to perform the Mining Contract and the Eighth Amendment in good faith\".\n\nR I, paras. 330-331 and 333; R II, para. 514.\n\n951.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants\u2019 position is that the exception contained in Art. 11(3) means that Colombia has given its consent to arbitrate claims which fall under the Umbrella Clause, but that this consent is \"conditional\" and \"revocable\". Respondent finds that Claimants\u2019 position is untenable for four reasons.857\n\nR I, paras. 334-336; R II, para. 515.\n\n952.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that the language of the Treaty is unequivocal and does not call for interpretation: Colombia has not given its consent to arbitrate claims related to the Umbrella Clause. This conclusion has been supported by several commentators of the Treaty.858\n\nR II, paras. 516-517.\n\n953.\n\nRespondent submits that it is a matter of policy for Colombia to exclude umbrella clauses from the scope of its consent to arbitrate, so as to avoid extending the jurisdiction of an international investment tribunal over claims arising out of contract breaches.859\n\nR I, paras. 339-340; R II, paras. 518-519.\n\n954.\n\nSecond*,* even assuming that the wording of Art. 11(3) is unclear and interpretation is necessary, such interpretation must be made in accordance with Art. 31 of the VCLT, considering the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Treaty in their context. According to Art. 31(2) of the VCLT, such context includes the preamble and any annexes to the Treaty. One of these annexes is the Protocol to the Treaty [the \"**Protocol**\"].\n\n955.\n\nThe Protocol provides that on request of a party five years after the entry into force of the Treaty, or at any time thereafter, the parties shall consult to assess whether the provision on consent with respect to Art. 10(2) is still appropriate, in view of the way in which the Treaty has been performed. Respondent finds that the Protocol provides the parties with an opportunity to assess whether the exclusion of consent is still appropriate - and that it is implicit that, should the parties find that it is no longer appropriate to exclude consent, they could consider extending it to disputes related to Art. 10(2).860\n\nR II, paras. 520-522.\n\n956.\n\nThird, Respondent submits that the evolution of the negotiations of the Treaty between Colombia and Switzerland is consistent with their intention to exclude -rather than to qualify - their consent to arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims. A draft version of the Treaty did not contain the limitation to consent, which was later introduced in Art. 11(3).861\n\nR I, para. 341; R II, paras. 524-525.\n\n957.\n\nFourth, Respondent contends that Claimants\u2019 argument, according to which the words \"unconditional and irrevocable\" must be taken to mean that the parties to the Treaty intended to qualify their consent to arbitrate Umbrella Clause disputes, because otherwise such words would be deprived of *effet utile,* is also unavailing.862\n\nR II, para. 526.\n\n958.\n\nRespondent argues that if its offer to arbitrate disputes with regard to Art. 10(2) matters were conditional, it would be expressly conditioned upon a specific uncertain event; Claimants have not even tried to prove that there was such an event.863\n\nR I, para. 345; R II, paras. 527-528.\n\n959.\n\nRespondent avers that, in any event, the terms \"unconditional\" or \"irrevocable\" were simply used to embellish and emphasize the significance of the offer to arbitrate made by the contracting States to the Treaty.864\n\nR II, paras. 529-530.\n\n960.\n\nIn light of the above, Respondent concludes that to the extent that the claim against the *Contralor\u00eda* and the claim against the ANM are grounded on the Umbrella Clause, they fall outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s competence.865\n\nR I, para. 348; R II, para. 531.\n\n**B. Claim against the ANM is Contractual in Nature**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n961.\n\nRespondent submits that, even assuming that the Umbrella Clause were not excluded from the scope of Colombia\u2019s consent to arbitration *(quod non),* the claim against the ANM would still have to be excluded: the claim against the ANM is purely contractual in nature, and the Mining Contract contains its own dispute-resolution clause. Consequently, the claim against the ANM cannot be tried in the present proceedings.866\n\nR I, para. 349; R II, para. 532.\n\n962.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that in this arbitration Claimants are submitting a purely contractual claim against the ANM:867 the contention that the ANM\u2019s pursuit of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment implies a breach of Colombia\u2019s obligations under Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.\n\nR I, paras. 356 *et seq.;* R II, para. 533; Doc. H 2, Vol. 2, slide 5; HT, Day 2, p. 488, ll. 1-18.\n\n963.\n\nRespondent says that in order to determine whether, as a matter of jurisdiction, a claim is contractual in nature or presupposes a Treaty violation, the Tribunal must apply the \"fundamental basis\" test enunciated by the *Vivendi* annulment committee:868\n\n- If the fundamental basis of the claim is \"a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged\", the claim in question is a treaty claim;\n\n- Conversely, when the standard against which conduct must be measured is a contract, the claim is contractual in nature and must be determined in the contractually-selected forum.\n\nR I, para. 353; R II, paras. 534-536, referring to *Vivendi,* para. 96, and to *Pantechniki,* para. 64.\n\n964.\n\nRespondent argues that in the present case, the fundamental basis of the claim against the ANM, as described by Claimants, is the State agency\u2019s alleged attempt to have the Eighth Amendment declared null and void. Claimants view this as a lack of good faith in the performance of contractual obligations, which, under Colombian law, is a breach of a contractual obligation. Claimants do not argue that, in seeking the nullification of the Eighth Amendment, the ANM would have gone beyond acting as an ordinary party to a contract.869\n\nR I, paras. 354-355.\n\n965.\n\nRespondent contends that even if the claim against the ANM is grounded in Art. 10(2) of the Treaty, its fundamental basis is the Eighth Amendment. Even when they seek to frame this claim as a Treaty claim for breach of the fair and equitable standard of treatment, Claimants still only describe it as a contractual breach.870\n\nR II, paras. 539-540.\n\n966.\n\nSecond, Respondent points out that Clause 39 of the Mining Contract contains a contractually agreed upon dispute resolution clause. This means that contractual claims cannot be decided in treaty-based arbitration, but have another contractually-agreed forum. This was confirmed in the *SGS* and *Bureau Veritas* cases.871\n\nR I, paras. 349-352; R II, paras. 543-544, referring to *SGS,* para. 16, and to *Bureau Veritas,* paras. 9 and 13; Doc. H 2, Vol. 2, slides 8-9.\n\n967.\n\nRespondent finds that the fact that the contractual claim against the ANM is submitted by Glencore, instead of Prodeco, does not change this conclusion. It is undisputed that the contractually agreed dispute resolution clause of the Mining Contract does not bind Glencore. However, Glencore cannot raise contractual claims precisely because Glencore is not privy to the Mining Contract.872\n\nR II, para. 548.\n\n968.\n\nIn sum, Respondent argues that the claim against the ANM falls outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s competence, since it is contractual in nature and the Mining Contract contains its own dispute resolution clause.873\n\nR II, paras. 532 and 549.\n\n**(2) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n969.\n\nClaimants argue that Colombia\u2019s objections to the Umbrella Clause claim have no merit and should be dismissed (**A.**). Similarly, Claimants argue that their Treaty claims regarding the ANM\u2019s actions are not contractual in nature, and therefore are not precluded by the forum selection clause in the Mining Contract (**B.**).\n\n**A. Umbrella Clause Objection Lacks Merit**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n970.\n\nClaimants note that Colombia argues that Claimants\u2019 Umbrella Clause claims are excluded from the jurisdiction of the Tribunal pursuant to Art. 11(3) of the Treaty. Claimants find that Colombia\u2019s interpretation of the Treaty is incorrect.874\n\nC III, para. 115.\n\n971.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Parties agree that Art. 11(3) creates an exception for claims regarding breaches of the Umbrella Clause, set out in Art. 10(2) of the Treaty, from the general regime of \"unconditional and irrevocable consent\" to submit investment disputes to international arbitration. However, the Parties disagree on whether the meaning of the text is that the exception relates to the State\u2019s consent itself (Respondent\u2019s position) or to the unconditional and irrevocable nature of the consent (Claimants\u2019 position).875\n\nC II, paras. 205-206; C III, paras. 116-117.\n\n972.\n\nClaimants contend that both Parties acknowledge that the provision of Art. 11(3) of the Treaty must be interpreted in accordance with Art. 31 of the VCLT, considering the ordinary meaning of the terms in their context, which includes the preamble and annexes to the Treaty.876\n\nC III, para. 118.\n\n973.\n\nClaimants submit that the context of the Treaty text is the structure of Art. 11 itself:877\n\n- Art. 11(1) provides that an investor that \"considers that a measure applied by [Colombia] is inconsistent with an obligation of this Agreement\" may request amicable consultations;\n\n- Art. 11(2) provides that if the matter is not settled within six months, it may be referred to arbitration, to a venue to be chosen by the investor, thereby entitling the investor to resort to arbitration;\n\n- Art. 11(3) notes that the consent to resort to arbitration \"in accordance with paragraph 2\" is \"unconditional and irrevocable\", \"except for disputes with regard to Article 10 paragraph 2 [the umbrella clause]\".\n\nC III, para. 119.\n\n974.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the principle of *effet utile* requires that the term \"unconditional and irrevocable\" be given meaning. Claimants submit that the meaning is that Colombia was empowered to condition or revoke its consent to arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims until that consent was perfected.878\n\nC II, para. 206; C III, para. 119.\n\n975.\n\nClaimants find that this interpretation is confirmed by Art. 11(2) of the Protocol of the Treaty, which expressly describes Art. 11(3) as a \"provision on consent with respect to Article 10 of paragraph 2\", over which the parties could consult in the future with a view to assessing its appropriateness. Claimants argue that the text implies that there is \"consent with respect to Article 10 of paragraph 2\".879\n\nC II, para. 207; C III, para. 120.\n\n976.\n\nSimilarly, an early draft of the relevant Umbrella Clause reads that each contracting party gives its consent to the submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration. Claimants say that if Colombia intended to exclude claims under the Umbrella Clause from its consent to arbitrate, it merely needed to add \"except for disputes with regard to [...]\" at the end of this text. However, the text of this provision only changed the reference to the consent by qualifying it as \"unconditional and irrevocable\".880\n\nC II, paras. 208-209.\n\n977.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s submission, Claimants explain that Art. 11(2) of the Protocol does not describe Art. 11(3) as providing qualified consent. If the parties to the Treaty had not consented at all to arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims, they would not have referred to their \"consent with respect to the umbrella clause claims\" in the Protocol.881\n\nC III, para. 120.\n\n978.\n\nClaimants argue that Art. 11(3) would have allowed Colombia to impose conditions to its consent to arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims *(e.g.,* prior resort to the contractual forum) until Claimants provided their reciprocal consent, just as it would have allowed Colombia to revoke its consent to arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims until that consent was perfected.882\n\nC III, para. 122.\n\n**B. No Contractual Claims Against the ANM**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n979.\n\nClaimants find that Respondent\u2019s arguments, according to which the \"Claim against the ANM\" is purely contractual in nature and cannot be heard by this Tribunal, are incorrect.883\n\nC III, para. 123.\n\n980.\n\nFirst, Claimants note that Colombia\u2019s references to the \"Claim against the ANM\" are a mischaracterization of Claimants\u2019 claims. Claimants bring claims under the Treaty against Colombia, not the ANM. These Treaty claims are predicated upon Colombia\u2019s coordinated measures, through the *Contralor\u00eda* and the ANM, to nullify the commitments in the Eighth Amendment upon which Claimants relied to invest in the expansion of the Mine. These are not separate claims and are not \"purely contractual in nature\".884\n\nC III, paras. 124-125.\n\n981.\n\nClaimants explain that the measures taken by Colombia were inconsistent with Colombia\u2019s international obligations under the Treaty (not the ANM\u2019s domestic law obligations under the Mining Contract), including the obligations:885\n\n- To accord Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Art. 4(2) of the Treaty;\n\n- Not to impair the management, use, enjoyment and expansion of Claimants\u2019 investments through unreasonable measures pursuant to Art. 4(1) of the Treaty;\n\n- To \"observe any obligation deriving from a written agreement concluded between its central government or agencies thereof and an investor of the other Party with regard to a specific investment, which the investor could rely on in good faith when establishing, acquiring or expanding the investment\", pursuant to Art. 10(2) of the Treaty.\n\nC II, para. 212.\n\n982.\n\nClaimants submit that the mere reference in Claimants\u2019 Memorial to the State\u2019s obligations under the Eighth Amendment does not affect the characterization of Claimants\u2019 treaty claims. If mere references to contractual obligations were sufficient to render a treaty claim inadmissible, investment treaties would be deprived of meaningful effect, since most foreign investment is made through a contract (and most investment claims concern government interference in contractual rights). According to Claimants, this does not make the claims contractual, particularly where, as here, Colombia is seeking to repudiate the entire contractual amendment and has made no allegations that the amendment has been breached.886\n\nC II, para. 213; Doc. H-1, p. 248.\n\n983.\n\nSecond, Claimants\u2019 claims relating to Colombia\u2019s breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty are not contractual in nature. Claimants argue that the ANM acted inconsistently, unreasonably and in breach of Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations when it initiated the Procedure for Contractual Annulment. The ANM went back on its representations, after negotiating the Eighth Amendment and approving the investment plan for the expansion of the Mine, and after Claimants had already made investments.887\n\nC III, para. 126; HT, Day 1, p. 237, ll. 9-11.\n\n984.\n\nClaimants accept that the relevant test to determine if Claimants\u2019 claims are contract-based or treaty-based is the \"fundamental basis\" test. Claimants submit that the fundamental basis of Claimants\u2019 claims is the Treaty: the claims are brought by reference to Treaty standards - *i.e.* the frustration of legitimate expectations through the unreasonable and arbitrary repudiation of the State\u2019s contractual commitments upon which investors relied to make a massive investment in the expansion of the Mine - not contractual provisions.888\n\nC III, paras. 127-128; Doc. H-1, pp. 246-247; HT, Day 1, p. 237, l. 11 - p. 238, l. 9.\n\n985.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the mere fact that their claims relate to State conduct in relation to a contract does not mean that the claims are contractual in nature, as expressed by the tribunal in the *Crystallex* case. In the *Crystallex* case, the investor did not complain that a State agency breached specific contract provisions, but rather that it sought to repudiate the entire contract upon which the investor had relied in making its investments. The tribunal rejected the State\u2019s assertion that the claim was purely contractual in nature.889\n\nC III, paras. 129-131, referring to *Crystallex,* para. 474; HT, Day 1, p. 238, ll. 10-21.\n\n986.\n\nClaimants admit that the forum-selection clause of the Mining Contract applies to contractual claims; however, this clause is irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes in this case, given that Claimants have not raised contractual claims. In any event, the dispute resolution clause in the Mining Contract does not bind Glencore, as recognised by Colombia.890\n\nC III, paras. 132-135.\n\n987.\n\nThird, Claimants argue that Colombia, through the conduct of the ANM and the *Contralor\u00eda,* failed to observe its obligations under the Eighth Amendment, in violation of the Umbrella Clause of the Treaty. Claimants submit that, as in all umbrella clause claims, these claims are predicated on the State\u2019s failure to observe municipal law and contractual obligations in relation to investments, although the finding of liability under an umbrella clause is ultimately a determination made under international law.891\n\nC III, paras. 136-137.\n\n988.\n\nClaimants explain that when a claimant brings a claim under an umbrella clause, that investor is not bringing the claim under a contract - it remains a claim for the violation of a Treaty standard; otherwise, umbrella clauses would be deprived of meaning.892 In the *SGS* case, the tribunal distinguished between contract claims and treaty claims. Similarly, the tribunal emphatically denied that a contractual forum-selection clause could deprive the tribunal of jurisdiction to hear the investor\u2019s umbrella clause claim under the treaty.893\n\nC III, paras. 137-138; HT, Day 1, p. 239, ll. 1-4.\n\nC III, paras. 138-139, referring to *SGS v. Paraguay,* para. 130, and also to *Garanti Koza,* paras. 331-332; HT, Day 1, p. 239, ll. 4-21.\n\n989.\n\nClaimants conclude that there is no basis for the Tribunal to decline competence over Claimants\u2019 claims.894\n\nC III, para. 140; HT, Day 1, p. 240, ll. 4-7.\n\n**(3) Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n990.\n\nThe Tribunal is tasked with determining whether Claimants can bring a claim against Colombia under the Umbrella Clause of the Treaty: the Tribunal will first establish the relevant provisions **(3.1)** and will then turn to the interpretation of one of these provisions, Art. 11(3) of the Treaty **(3.2)**. Thereafter, the Tribunal will examine the nature of the so-called \"Claim against the ANM\" **(3.3)**\n\n**(3.1) Relevant Provisions**\n-----------------------------\n\n991.\n\nArt. 10 of the Treaty establishes certain obligations of the State parties to the Treaty. One of these obligations is enshrined in paragraph 2 of Art. 10 and reads as follows:895\n\n\"Each Party shall observe any obligation deriving from a written agreement concluded between its central government or agencies thereof and an investor of the other Party with regard to a specific investment, which the investor could rely on in good faith when establishing, acquiring or expanding the investment\".\n\nDoc. C-6, p. 8.\n\n992.\n\nThis Umbrella Clause imposes on the State, as a matter of Treaty law, the observance of obligations stemming from a written agreement concluded between its government or agencies and the investor.896\n\nDoc. RL-164, p. 18 of the PDF.\n\n993.\n\nOn the other hand, Art. 11 of the Treaty provides for the settlement of disputes between a host State and an investor. Art. 11(2) establishes that if such investor considers that a measure applied by the host State is inconsistent with an obligation under the Treaty, it may refer the matter to the national courts of the host State or to international arbitration, once the six-month period for amicable settlement has expired. Pursuant to Art. 11(3):897\n\n\"Each [State] Party hereby gives its unconditional and irrevocable consent to the submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration in accordance with paragraph [11(2)] above, except for disputes with regard to Article 10 paragraph 2 of this Agreement\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-6, p. 9.\n\n994.\n\nRespondent submits that in accordance with Art. 11(3), it has not given its consent to arbitrate disputes which fall under the scope of the Umbrella Clause set out in Art. 10(2) of the Treaty. As a consequence, argues Respondent, the Tribunal lacks competence to decide on Claimants\u2019 claims to the extent they are grounded on Art. 10(2) of the Treaty.\n\n995.\n\nClaimants disagree and argue that Respondent makes an incorrect reading of Art. 11(3): in Claimants\u2019 view, Colombia has given its consent to arbitrate disputes with regard to Art. 10(2), just not an \"unconditional and irrevocable\" consent.\n\n996.\n\nThe Tribunal must interpret the meaning of Art. 11(3). To do so, the Tribunal will resort to the VCLT, which both Parties agree contains the relevant standard for the interpretation of the Treaty.898\n\nR II, paras. 516-522; C III, para. 118.\n\n**(3.2) Interpretation of Art. 11(3) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n997.\n\nArt. 31 of the VCLT provides the \"General Rule of Interpretation\" of treaties:899\n\n\"1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes :\n\n(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty ;\n\n(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. CL-7, p. 340.\n\n998.\n\nIn accordance with the primary rule of interpretation, the Tribunal must interpret the ordinary meaning of the terms (**A.**) in their context; the context is understood as not only the text of the Treaty, but also its preamble and any annexes (**B.**).\n\n999.\n\nArt. 32 of the Treaty contains \"Supplementary Means of Interpretation\":\n\n\"Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable\". [Emphasis added]\n\n1000.\n\nIn order to confirm that the primary interpretation is correct, the Tribunal may avail itself of the preparatory works of the Treaty, including any drafts (**C.**). Before turning to the scholarly interpretation of Art. 11(3) (**E.**), the Tribunal will address Claimants\u2019 *effet utile* counter-argument (**D.**).\n\n**A. Ordinary Meaning**\n-----------------------\n\n1001.\n\nPursuant to Art. 11(3):\n\n\"each Party hereby gives its unconditional and irrevocable consent to the submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration in accordance with paragraph 2 above, except for disputes with regard to Article 10 paragraph 2 of [the Treaty]\".900 [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-6.\n\n1002.\n\nThe plain reading of Art. 11(3) leaves little room for doubts: each State party gives its unconditional and irrevocable consent to have investment disputes submitted to international arbitration, with one exception: disputes with regard to Art. 10(2), the Umbrella Clause.\n\n1003.\n\nThus, in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms, Colombia\u2019s interpretation of Art. 11(3) is correct: Colombia has given its consent to arbitrate investment disputes which may arise from the Treaty, except for those which fall under the Umbrella Clause.\n\n**B. Context**\n--------------\n\n1004.\n\nThe context confirms the ordinary meaning of Art. 11(3).\n\n1005.\n\nPursuant to Art. 31(2) of the VCLT, the context includes the preamble and annexes to the Treaty. One of these annexes is the Protocol of the Treaty, which contains \"provisions which shall be regarded as an integral part of the said Agreement\".901\n\nDoc. C-6, pp. 13 *et seq.*\n\n1006.\n\nAdding to Art. 11 of the Treaty, Art. 11(2) of the Protocol provides that:902\n\n\"(2) With regard to paragraph 3 of the said Article [11], on request of a Party five years after the entry into force of this Agreement or at any time thereafter, the Parties shall consult with a view to assessing whether the provision on consent with respect to Article 10 paragraph 2 is appropriate considering the performance of this Agreement\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-6, pp. 15-16.\n\n1007.\n\nThe Parties disagree on what should be understood from this provision:\n\n- Respondent argues that the Protocol provides the State parties with an opportunity to assess whether the exclusion of consent remains appropriate;903\n\n- Claimants, on the other hand, contend that the Protocol implies that there is \"consent with respect to Article 10 of paragraph 2\"; and they further aver that the qualified nature of consent need not be referenced in the Protocol, since it was already set out in Art. 11(3) itself.904\n\nR II, para. 522.\n\nC III, para. 120.\n\n1008.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent\u2019s argument on this point.\n\n1009.\n\nThe wording of Art. 11(2) of the Protocol, combined with the ordinary meaning of Art. 11(3) of the Treaty, supports only one conclusion: in Art. 11(3) of the Treaty the State parties excluded Umbrella Clause disputes from their consent to arbitrate; but, conscious that such exclusion in practical terms deprived the Umbrella Clause of effectiveness, in Art. 11(2) of the Protocol they agreed to review their decision, after a five-year period of experience, in light of the performance of the Treaty and upon request of one of the State parties.\n\n**C. Preparatory Work**\n-----------------------\n\n1010.\n\nFor the sake of exhaustiveness, the Tribunal will also analyse a draft Treaty of July 1996. Art. 9 of said draft, on \"Disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party\", contained two \"options\" for the relevant text.\n\n1011.\n\nArt. 9(3) of \"Option 1\" provided that:905\n\n\"(3) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration.\"\n\nDoc. R-188.\n\n1012.\n\nThus, in this draft, the State parties agreed to give their consent to the submission of investment disputes to international arbitration, without any exception. It is interesting to note that this draft Treaty did not contain an umbrella clause or any similar provision.\n\n1013.\n\nIt thus seems that in the 1996 negotiations, Switzerland and Colombia did not contemplate the possibility of having an umbrella clause, and consequently did not exclude such disputes from the scope of their consent to international arbitration. This is consistent with Colombia\u2019s policy not to include an umbrella clause in its model bilateral investment treaty;906 and it confirms the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of Art. 11(3) so far.\n\nDoc. RL-46, p. 40 of the PDF: \"As a strict policy matter, the Model does not include an 'umbrella clause\u2019, which arguably could automatically render a breach of a contract related to an investment into a treaty breach, regardless of the failure to comply with any of the usual treaty obligations of an IIA [...]. Reasons not to incorporate an umbrella clause in the Model include the broad and general commitment of accepting investor-State arbitration if an investor alleges a breach [...] of any investment commitment or contract related to an investment, and the unassessed costs that this type of commitment could involve for the State and agencies thereof. [...] The practice of Colombia in rejecting the inclusion of an umbrella clause has been highly consistent [...]\".\n\n**D. Claimants\u2019** ***effet utile*** **Counter-Argument**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n1014.\n\nClaimants argue that the principle of *effet utile* requires that the terms \"unconditional and irrevocable\" used in Art. 11(3) of the Treaty be given meaning. To achieve this aim, Claimants propose to construe the provision as implying that Colombia\u2019s general consent to international arbitration is unconditional and irrevocable, with one exception: Colombia can condition and revoke its consent to arbitrate Umbrella Clause claims before such consent has been perfected.\n\n1015.\n\nClaimants\u2019 argument is premised on the use by the Treaty of the words \"unconditional and irrevocable consent\". Claimants then argue that consent, by its nature, is \"unconditional and irrevocable\", and that, for a proper construction of the Treaty, it is necessary to provide these words with *effet utile.* In an effort to solve this self-imposed riddle, Claimants propose an idiosyncratic interpretation, differentiating two different types of consent:907\n\n- \"conditional and revocable consent\", which applies to Umbrella Clause claims, and\n\n- \"unconditional and irrevocable consent\", which applies to all other types of claims.\n\nC III, para. 119.\n\n1016.\n\nThe Tribunal is unconvinced.\n\n1017.\n\nArt. 11(3) reads as follows:\n\n\"Each [State] Party hereby gives its unconditional and irrevocable consent to the submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration in accordance with paragraph [11(2)] above, except for disputes with regard to Article 10 paragraph 2 of this Agreement.\"\n\n1018.\n\nClaimants\u2019 proposed construction is simply an *a contrario* interpretation of the text. The Treaty says that consent to international arbitration is unconditional and irrevocable - not that consent for Umbrella Clause disputes can be conditioned and even revoked by the State. Claimants\u2019 construction creates more doubts than it dispels: assuming Claimants\u2019 interpretation, how States can condition their consent, and what temporal limits apply to the right of revocation, are questions which remain unanswered.\n\n1019.\n\nIn fact, the proper interpretation of Art. 11(3) is much more straightforward: the parties to the Treaty were simply trying to assert that they consented to international arbitration for all types of investment disputes, except for those deriving from the Umbrella Clause. The terms \"unconditional and irrevocable\" were used to specify the nature of the generic consent that the State parties to the Treaty were making -not to extend a phantom \"conditional and revocable\" consent to Umbrella Clause disputes.\n\n1020.\n\nFurther, Claimants\u2019 *effet utile* argument seems to rest on a false premise, *i.e.* that consent to arbitration is inherently unconditional and irrevocable. That premise is false because, on a blank canvas (that is, without regard to the specific provisions of the Treaty), a State may give its consent to arbitration conditionally. Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention specifically authorizes a Contracting State to require the exhaustion of administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under the Convention.908 Similarly, in principle a State may give its generic consent to arbitration but reserve the right to revoke such consent in the future unilaterally. It is precisely to prevent such unilateral revocation that Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention deprives any such revocation of effect once all parties to the dispute have given their consent in writing to submit their dispute to ICSID arbitration.909 Therefore, the term \"unconditional and irrevocable\" used to qualify the generic consent given by the State parties to the Treaty already has useful effects, and very important ones, without having to postulate additional effects based on Claimants\u2019 *a contrario* argument.\n\nICSID Convention, Art. 26 *in fine.* The extent to which the States Parties to the Treaty availed themselves of this authorization is analysed in section **V.3.(3.2)****.E** *infra.*\n\n*Id.,* Art. 25(1) *in fine.*\n\n**E. Scholarly Opinions**\n-------------------------\n\n1021.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s opinion is confirmed by that of several scholars who have analysed the provisions of the Treaty.\n\n1022.\n\nAs explained by Profs. T. Gazzini and Y. Radi in an article on the \"Practice and Interpretation of 'Umbrella Clauses\u2019 in the Latin American Experience\":910\n\n\"The second category of umbrella clauses, less common than the previous one, imposes upon the parties as a matter of treaty law the observance of obligations stemming from external legal instruments, but excludes the settlement of the related disputes from the procedural provisions of the treaty.\n\n[...]\n\nThe BIT between Colombia and Switzerland contains an interesting drafting variant. According to Article 10(2): [...]\n\nThe arbitral clause contained in Article 11(3) of the same treaty provides for the unconditional and irrevocable consent to the submission of disputes to international arbitration with the express exclusion of those related to Article 10(21).\n\nThis type of provision can be treated as an umbrella clause under the broad definition provided in the introduction. Indeed, the contracting parties undertake to comply as a matter of treaty law with the obligations arising out of legal instruments external to the treaty. Needless to say, the fact that foreign investors have no access to international arbitration with regard to violations of these obligations - as it is potentially the case for the first category of clauses - clearly diminishes the added value of the clause from the standpoint of the protection of foreign investments.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nA. Tanzi *et al.* [eds.], *International Investment Law in Latin America,* Chapter 11, pp. 355-356 (Doc. RL-164).\n\n1023.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rivas, who served as Director of Foreign Direct Investment of the Ministry of Trade of Colombia between 2006 and 2009, and participated in the drafting of the Treaty,911 affirmed in a chapter dedicated to Colombia of the *Commentaries on Selected Model Investment Treaties* that:912\n\n\"The Switzerland-Colombia BIT (2007) and Japan-Colombia BIT (2011) have typical umbrella clauses, but the parties to these treaties have not given their consent to investor-State arbitration when an investor alleges a breach of the respective umbrella clause.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nR II, fn. 775.\n\nDoc. RL-46, p. 41.\n\n1024.\n\nThe opinion of these commentators confirms the Tribunal's interpretation of Art. 11(3): the State parties to the Treaty withheld their consent to solve Umbrella Clause disputes by way of international arbitration.\n\n1025.\n\nFor all the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it lacks competence to adjudicate claims brought under the Umbrella Clause contained in Art. 10(2) of the Treaty.\n\n**(3.3) Competence over the \"Claim against the ANM\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n1026.\n\nRespondent contends that the \"Claim against the ANM\" is purely contractual in nature and thus cannot be heard in the present arbitration, since the Mining Contract contains a dispute resolution clause.913\n\nR II, paras. 512 and 532.\n\n1027.\n\nClause 39 of the Mining Contract indeed provides that:\n\n\"[...] *Este contrato se rige en todas sus partes por la Ley Colombiana y EL CONTRATISTA se somete a la jurisdicci\u00f3n de los tribunales colombianos\".* [Emphasis added]\n\n1028.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s task is then to determine whether in the present arbitration Claimants have indeed filed contractual claims - if they had done so, such claims would fall outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s competence.\n\n1029.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, as a preliminary matter that, contrary to Respondent\u2019s assertion, Claimants have not brought a \"Claim against the ANM\". Claimants have brought claims against Colombia. These claims include Colombia\u2019s decision (adopted through its successive mining agencies, SGC and ANM) to file the Procedure for Contractual Annulment and seek nullification of the Eighth Amendment. Claimants say that this filing resulted in a breach of the FET standard, because the measure\n\n- was an attempt to repudiate the Republic\u2019s commitments and frustrates Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations;914\n\n- was arbitrary, unreasonable and in bad faith.915\n\nC I, para. 198.\n\nC I paras. 201-202 and 216.\n\n1030.\n\nAccording to Claimants, by adopting the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision and starting the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, Colombia breached its obligations under the Treaty.916\n\nSee Section **VI.1** *infra.*\n\n**A. Fundamental Basis Test**\n-----------------------------\n\n1031.\n\nThe Parties agree that in order to determine whether a claim is contractual in nature, the Tribunal must analyse the \"fundamental basis of the claim\", as established by the *Vivendi* annulment committee. In particular, the Tribunal must establish:917\n\n- whether the fundamental basis of the claim is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the Parties is to be judged, or\n\n- whether the standard against which the conduct of the Parties must be measured is a contract.\n\nR II, para. 536; C III, para. 127. See also *Vivendi,* para. 101.\n\n1032.\n\nIn its decision, the *Vivendi* annulment committee explained that:918\n\n\"95. As to the relation between breach of contract and breach of treaty in the present case, it must be stressed that Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not relate directly to breach of a municipal contract. Rather they set an independent standard. A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and *vice versa,* and this is certainly true of these provisions of the BIT. The point is made clear in Article 3 of the ILC Articles, which is entitled \"Characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful\":\n\nThe characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.\n\n96. In accordance with this general principle (which is undoubtedly declaratory of general international law), whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law - in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract, by the proper law of the contract [...].\"\n\n*Vivendi,* paras. 95-96.\n\n1033.\n\nThese conclusions were confirmed by the *Crystallex* tribunal. That tribunal also explained that in order to determine the fundamental basis of the claimant\u2019s claim, it had to start by analysing claimant\u2019s prayers for relief (**B.**) and the formulation of its claims (**C.**).919 Since the Parties have validated the approach of the *Crystallex* tribunal,920 the Arbitral Tribunal will follow the same methodology.\n\n*Crystallex,* paras. 474-475.\n\nR II, para. 538; C III, para. 131.\n\n**B. Claimants\u2019 Prayers for Relief**\n------------------------------------\n\n1034.\n\nClaimants\u2019 main request for relief is a declaration: that Colombia\u2019s measures (including its decision to file the Procedure for Contractual Annulment) have resulted in breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. Claimants also ask for a declaration that Colombia has breached the Umbrella Clause, Art. 10(2) of the Treaty; but the Tribunal has already found in Section **V.3(3.2)** *supra* that it lacks competence to adjudicate any dispute relating to the Umbrella Clause.921\n\nC II, para. 374(a); the request was confirmed in CPHB, para. 92.\n\n1035.\n\nAs a consequence of such declaration, Claimants request that the Tribunal order the Republic of Colombia to procure the cessation of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment with prejudice.922\n\nC II, para. 374(c).\n\n1036.\n\n*Prima facie,* Claimants have made no claims for breach of contractual provisions and none of the above claims is contractual in nature. Claimants\u2019 claims are based on the standards of the Treaty, which Claimants allege have been breached by Colombia.\n\n1037.\n\nYet, as explained by the *Crystallex* tribunal:923\n\n\"[...], it would of course not be sufficient for a claimant to simply label contract breaches as treaty breaches to avoid the jurisdictional hurdles present in a BIT. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional inquiry is a matter of objective determination, and the Tribunal would in case of pure \"labeling\" be at liberty and have the duty to re-characterize the alleged breaches.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n*Crystallex*, para. 475.\n\n1038.\n\nThe Tribunal must thus go further than Claimants\u2019 prayers for relief, in order to determine whether Claimants\u2019 claims are contractual or Treaty-based.\n\n**C. Formulation of Claimants\u2019 Claims**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1039.\n\nAccording to Respondent, even when Claimants\n\n\"seek to frame the Claim against the ANM as a treaty claim for breach of the fair and equitable standard of treatment under Articles 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty, Claimants still only describe it as a contractual breach.\"\n\nTo prove its assertion, Respondent makes reference to para. 223 of Claimants\u2019 Memorial of 16 December 2016.924\n\nR II, para. 540.\n\n1040.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Respondent\u2019s argument unconvincing.\n\n1041.\n\nPara. 223 of Claimants\u2019 Memorial relates to Claimants\u2019 claims which are grounded on the Umbrella Clause, not on Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. The Tribunal has already found that it does not have competence over claims grounded on Art. 10(2).\n\n1042.\n\nThe basis of Claimants\u2019 claim relating to the conduct of the ANM is the State agency\u2019s alleged attempt to have the Eighth Amendment declared null and void by the Colombian administrative courts. Claimants argue that the mere filing of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment breached Colombia\u2019s obligations under Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty, because:925\n\n- it contravened Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations, since the Procedure was started after Claimants had relied on the Eighth Amendment and made significant investments in Colombia;\n\n- it failed to treat Claimants\u2019 investments in a consistent, predictable, and transparent manner, since the Procedure took place after Prodeco and Ingeominas had negotiated extensively, and after Ingeominas had approved Prodeco\u2019s 2010 PTI; and\n\n- it took an arbitrary and unreasonable stance, since it sought unilaterally to withdraw the undertakings and assurances given by Ingeominas to Claimants, without a reasoned judgment.\n\nC II, para. 270.\n\n1043.\n\nClaimants measure Colombia\u2019s conduct against the standards of the Treaty and not against contractual standards: the fundamental basis of Claimants\u2019 claims is the Treaty, not the Mining Contract.\n\n1044.\n\nAs established by the *Crystallex* tribunal, whether the Claimants\u2019 claims are well-founded in law and whether the facts underlying those claims may implicate the Respondent\u2019s liability under the substantive standards of the Treaty are questions to be dealt with in the merits.926\n\nSee *Crystallex,* para. 477.\n\n1045.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the so-called \"Claim against the ANM\" is contractual in nature and falls outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s competence insofar as it is grounded in Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. Therefore, Respondent\u2019s objection is dismissed.\n\n**V.4. INADMISSIBILITY OBJECTION**\n----------------------------------\n\n1047.\n\nRespondent contends that if, *par impossible,* the Tribunal were to decide that either Claimants\u2019 claim against the *Contralor\u00eda,* or the claim against the ANM, fall within the scope of its jurisdiction, such claims are not yet ripe for adjudication and are, thus, inadmissible **(1)**.\n\n1048.\n\nClaimants say that their claims concern measures already adopted by the State, which are in breach of the Treaty, and have caused a loss or damage to Claimants\u2019 investment. These claims are therefore fully ripe for adjudication **(2)**.\n\n1049.\n\nThe Tribunal will start by summarizing the Parties\u2019 positions and then make its decision **(3)**.\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n1050.\n\nRespondent avers that Claimants\u2019 claims are premature and, therefore, inadmissible, for several reasons.\n\n1051.\n\nAs a preliminary point, Respondent notes that Claimants ask that the Tribunal order Colombia to \"continue to perform and observe the Eighth Amendment\". Yet, Respondent argues, Claimants continue to own and operate the Calenturitas Mine and the Parties continue to comply with the Eighth Amendment. In sum, Claimants want to be placed in the same condition in which they are today. According to Respondent, this shows that Claimants\u2019 claims are pre-emptive and hypothetical.927\n\nR I, para. 371. See also HT, Day 2, p. 500, ll. 19-20.\n\nAbsence of a measure by the State\n---------------------------------\n\n1052.\n\nRespondent submits that under the Treaty the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction extends only to \"a measure applied by the other Party [which] is inconsistent with an obligation of this Agreement, thus causing loss or damage to [the investor] or his investment\".928 According to Respondent, a claim based on potential harm to the investment, arising out of a measure which has not yet been implemented, is not admissible under international law.929\n\nR II, paras. 551 and 557.\n\nR I, para. 373; R II, para. 551. See also HT, Day 2, p. 501, ll. 1-22.\n\n1053.\n\nRespondent refers to the *Gab\u010d\u00edkovo -Nagymoros* case, in which the International Court of Justice [\"**ICJ**\"] distinguished between the internationally wrongful act itself, and the conduct which preceded such act, which is of preparatory nature and does not qualify as an internationally wrongful act.930\n\nR I, paras. 374-375 and 377, referring to *Gab\u010d\u00edkovo -Nagymaros,* para. 79.\n\n1054.\n\nRespondent argues that in the present case, the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, which consists in submitting a contract for review and annulment to a court of law, does not constitute an internationally wrongful act, and cannot give rise to any compensable harm;931 indeed, there has been no breach of the State\u2019s obligations.932\n\nR II, para. 559.\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 500, ll. 21-22.\n\nAbsence of harm to the investor\n-------------------------------\n\n1055.\n\nRespondent further contends that the Treaty requires that the State\u2019s measure caused a \"loss or damage\" to the investor or its investment. In the present case, Claimants\u2019 claims are premature and inadmissible, because Claimants have suffered no harm whatsoever.933\n\nR I, para. 378; R II, para. 560.\n\n1056.\n\nFirst, regarding the claim against the ANM\u2019s conduct, Respondent points out that the Procedure for Contractual Annulment is still pending before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* and it is unknown whether the Eighth Amendment will be annulled. Respondent avers that \"loss or damage\" can only occur if and when the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* renders a decision nullifying the Eighth Amendment.934\n\nR II, paras. 560-561.\n\n1057.\n\nRespondent further argues that Claimants\u2019 claim against the ANM\u2019s conduct must fail, since Claimants have not suffered any monetary harm.935 Tellingly, Claimants did not disclose any contingency or record any impairment loss arising out of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment. Instead, Claimants expressed to the market their utmost confidence that the validity of the Eighth Amendment would be confirmed.936\n\nR II, paras. 553-556.\n\nR I, paras. 382-383; R II, para. 558.\n\n1058.\n\nSecond, as to Claimants\u2019 claim against the *Contralor\u00eda,* Respondent argues that it is also inadmissible and not ripe, since Claimants have suffered no harm. The claim against the *Contralor\u00eda* is currently limited to recovering the Fiscal Liability Amount. Respondent notes that Claimants have challenged the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca,* and a decision is pending. In its financial statements, Prodeco has characterized the chance of losing the claim against the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision as remote.937 As a result, assuming that the claim against the *Contralor\u00eda* is not dismissed on the basis of the Fork in the Road Objection, such claim is, in any event, not ripe.938\n\nR I, para. 389; R II, para. 558.\n\nR I, paras. 387-388; R II, paras. 562-564.\n\nReview by the competent State authority\n---------------------------------------\n\n1059.\n\nAccording to Respondent, international case-law shows that the State cannot be held liable for the acts of a State\u2019s official if the investor has not attempted, when possible, to have the act reviewed by the competent State authority. This approach was adopted by the *Generation Ukraine* and by the *EnCana* tribunals.939 Respondent submits that in the present case, this condition for a claim to be ripe has even more impact, since the Treaty requires that the investor show that it has suffered \"loss or harm\" before submitting a claim.940\n\nR II, paras. 565-567, referring to *Generation Ukraine,* para. 20.30 and to *EnCana,* para. 194.\n\nR II, para. 568.\n\n1060.\n\nRespondent notes that this requirement is not the same as a requirement to exhaust local remedies. Respondent points to the award in *Generation Ukraine*, in which the tribunal found that exhaustion of local remedies is entirely distinct from the principle that a State official\u2019s conduct cannot ripen into an international delict, absent an effective attempt by the investor to have such act reviewed by the competent State authority.941\n\nR II, para. 569. See also HT, Day 2, p. 504, ll. 4-15.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\n1061.\n\nIn sum, Respondent argues that the local proceedings that Claimants have commenced must run their course as a pre-condition to the ripeness of Claimants\u2019 claims against the *Contralor\u00eda* and the ANM. For now, Claimants have suffered no definitive harm as a result of the conduct of any organs of the Colombian State.942\n\nR II, paras. 570-571.\n\nAlternative argument: abuse of process\n--------------------------------------\n\n1062.\n\n*Ex abundante cautela,* Respondent submits that if the Tribunal were to consider that Claimants\u2019 claims are ripe for adjudication, the Tribunal should decline to hear such claims because their introduction constitutes an abuse of process. Indeed, Claimants are trying to block or inhibit the operation of Colombia\u2019s judiciary process. In the *Rompetrol* case, the tribunal found that such type of pre-emptive action was not permitted.943\n\nR II, paras. 572-574, referring to *Rompetrol,* para. 152.\n\n1063.\n\nRespondent concludes that Claimants\u2019 claims are not ripe for adjudication and calls for the dismissal of such claims by the Tribunal.944\n\nR I, para. 393; R II, para. 576.\n\n**(2) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n1064.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent\u2019s Inadmissibility Objection is unfounded.\n\nRelief sought by Claimants\n--------------------------\n\n1065.\n\nClaimants explained at the Hearing that:945\n\n- The primary remedies sought are restitutionary in nature - *i.e.* that Colombia give appropriate guarantees of non-repetition and make restitution of the Fiscal Liability Amount within 90 days;\n\n- Alternatively, if Colombia does not comply with the restitutionary relief, Claimants ask the Tribunal to order Colombia to pay, as monetary damages, the Fiscal Liability Amount, and to hold Claimants harmless of all retroactive Royalty and GIC payments;\n\n- Finally, Claimants claim forward-looking damages from the date of the Award, which would be the NPV of the investment, estimated at USD 336 million.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 241, l. 7 - p. 242, l. 19.\n\nExistence of a loss or damage\n-----------------------------\n\n1066.\n\nClaimants acknowledge that the Treaty establishes the requirements that claimants must satisfy to submit an investment claim. Of those requirements, Respondent mainly disputes that Claimants have suffered \"loss or damage\" with respect to the conduct of the ANM and the *Contralor\u00eda*. Claimants find that Respondent\u2019s argument is flawed.946\n\nC III, para. 142; HT, Day 1, p. 247, ll. 8-10.\n\n1067.\n\nFirst, Respondent contends that Claimants have not suffered any monetary harm as a result of the ANM\u2019s conduct because the Eighth Amendment remains in force. Claimants counter-argue that the Treaty does not require that the relevant \"loss or damage\" involve an outlay of funds, for instance in the form of the payment of higher royalties as a result of the annulment of the Eighth Amendment. The majority of investment cases do not involve an outlay of funds, but rather a loss in the fair market value of the investment.947\n\nC II, paras. 221-222; C III, para. 143; HT, Day 1, p. 247, ll. 11-13.\n\n1068.\n\nClaimants say that the ANM\u2019s actions, together with other conduct attributable to Colombia, have already negatively affected the NPV of their investments; the extent of that loss in value is a matter to be determined in the merits.948 Indeed, the ANM has adopted the position that the Eighth Amendment should be annulled, and has commenced legal proceedings in that respect, in essence copying the reasons of the *Contralor\u00eda*, with the consequent impact that such action by the regulator has on the fair market value of Claimants\u2019 investment.949\n\nC II, para. 222; C III, para. 143.\n\nC II, para. 222.\n\n1069.\n\nClaimants also say that Respondent\u2019s argument that Claimants did not disclose any contingency or impairment as a result of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, is unavailing. Such a disclosure has no bearing on the market value of Claimants\u2019 investment and the independent views of a third-party buyer.950\n\nC III, para. 144.\n\n1070.\n\nSecond, Claimants note that as to the *Contralor\u00eda's* measures, Claimants have already paid the Fiscal Liability Amount, and therefore Claimants have already suffered a so-called \"monetary harm\".951\n\nC III, para. 145.\n\n1071.\n\nIn addition, Claimants find that Respondent\u2019s Inadmissibility Objection contradicts the FIR Objection:\n\n- Under the Inadmissibility Objection, Respondent argues that Claimants could not bring a claim under the Treaty, before having challenged the impugned measure before the local courts;\n\n- At the same time, under the FIR Objection, Respondent says that if Claimants first submitted a claim to local courts, they are barred from submitting a claim under the Treaty.\n\n1072.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent\u2019s position would deprive them of any legal remedies.952\n\nC III, para. 141(a).\n\nNo requirement of exhaustion of local remedies\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1073.\n\nClaimants also find that Colombia is trying to write into the Treaty a non-existent requirement of exhaustion of local remedies. Art. 11(3) of the Protocol provides that before submitting a claim for settlement in Colombia, \"domestic administrative remedies\" have to be exhausted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; and Claimants have complied with this requirement. There is no requirement of exhaustion of judicial local remedies.953\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 248, l. 2 - p. 249, l. 18.\n\n1074.\n\nClaimants note that they do not claim a denial of justice that will only be perfected once internal remedies are exhausted or justice is sufficiently delayed; nor do they claim an expropriation. Rather, Claimants claim a breach of the fair and equitable treatment and other standards of the Treaty on the basis of measures that have already been adopted by Respondent.954\n\nC II, paras. 225-226; C III, para. 141(b); HT, Day 1, p. 249, l. 20 - p. 250, l. 16.\n\n1075.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the case law invoked by Respondent does not support its case. Both the *Generation Ukraine* and the *EnCana* cases related to expropriations.955\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 256, l. 7 - p. 257, l. 16.\n\nAbsence of an abuse of process\n------------------------------\n\n1076.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s abuse of process claim, Claimants note that Respondent merely invokes the relief sought by Claimants, which, according to Respondent, is intended to block or inhibit the operation of Colombia\u2019s judiciary process. Claimants disagree: Claimants seek a declaration of breach, restitution, and an order that Colombia ceases its wrongful acts, a relief which does not require that the courts act or omit to act in any manner, since the wrongful acts are the acts of non-judicial actors.956\n\nC III, para. 146.\n\n1077.\n\nAs to the *Rompetrol* case, Claimants point out that the tribunal recognised that \"the pursuit of crime - or even its mere invocation - cannot serve on its own as a justification for conduct that breaches the rights of foreign investors under applicable treaties\". Claimants say that in this particular case they are not asking the Tribunal to stop the Colombian authorities from investigating crimes or pursuing criminal procedures.957\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 258, l. 2 - p. 259, l. 10.\n\n1078.\n\nIn any event, Claimants say that Colombia has not explained how a mere request for relief could be considered so abusive as to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction altogether. The appropriateness of the relief that Claimants seek is a matter for the merits, not jurisdiction.958\n\nC III, par. 147.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\n1079.\n\nClaimants conclude that the primary relief they are seeking is prescriptive in nature, designed to ensure:\n\n- (i) the cessation of wrongful measures already taken by Colombia in breach of the Treaty,\n\n- (ii) the non-repetition of such measures, and\n\n- (iii) continued compliance with the Eighth Amendment.\n\n**(3) Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1080.\n\nThe Tribunal will first establish the proven facts (**A.**), and then explain its decision (**B.**).\n\n**A. Proven Facts**\n-------------------\n\n1081.\n\nAs previously explained,959 it is important to bear in mind that under Colombian law there is a clear distinction between the (i) Administrative Fiscal Liability Proceeding and the (ii) Procedures for Judicial Annulment of administrative contracts.960\n\nSee sections **III****.(7)** and **III****.(8)** *supra.*\n\nThe distinction is clearly explained by the *Contralor\u00eda* in the Reconsideration Decision (Doc. C-35, p. 41).\n\nFiscal Liability Proceeding\n---------------------------\n\n1082.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* is an agency of the Republic of Colombia. It is empowered to decide whether civil servants and private individuals incurred so-called \"fiscal liability\", premised on the fulfilment of three conditions:961\n\n- A *\"conducta dolosa o culposa\",* committed by such civil servant or private individual,\n\n- Which causes damage to the Colombian State or any of its agencies,\n\n- And a causal link between conduct and damage.\n\nDoc. C-71, Arts. 4 to 6.\n\n1083.\n\nIt is noteworthy that in a contractual environment fiscal liability does not require the violation of any norm, the breach of any contractual commitment, or any illegality affecting the contract. It is engaged whenever a civil servant or private individual incurs in *conducta dolosa o culposa (e.g.,* when negotiating, executing, or performing a contract), and such behaviour provokes damage to the State.\n\n1084.\n\nIf the investigation by the *Contralor\u00eda* concludes that the three requirements are met, the *Contralor\u00eda* will issue an administrative act, deciding that the civil servant or private individual has incurred fiscal liability, and simultaneously ordering that such person pay compensation equal to the damage suffered by Colombia or its agency.962\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 4.\n\n1085.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda'* s decision *(\"declaratoria de responsabilidad fiscal\"\")* has no impact on the contract, which continues in full force and effect, and has to be complied with both by the private party and by the public party.963\n\nDoc. C-35, p. 41.\n\n1086.\n\nA first-instance administrative decision adopted by the *Contralor\u00eda* can be appealed within the *Contralor\u00eda* itself *(\"recursos en via gubernativa\"),* by submitting a *recurso de reposici\u00f3n* or a *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n;* once these appeals have been exhausted, the *acto administrativo* becomes *firme* and the *via gubernativa* is closed. But this is not the end of the story: it is still possible to seek annulment of the *acto administrativo firme* by filing an Annulment Procedure *(\"recurso judicial contencioso-administrativo\"*) before the courts of justice*.*\n\nProcedure for Contractual Annulment\n-----------------------------------\n\n1087.\n\nAnnulment of an administrative contract entered into with the Republic or any of its agencies is a completely different institution: such nullifications require a judicial Procedure for Contractual Annulment (\"*declaratoria de nulidad*\"), at the request of any of the parties to the Contract. The requesting party bears the burden of proving that a cause of nullity under Colombian law (*e.g*., illegality or lack of consent) has occurred.\n\n1088.\n\nUpon the decision rendered by the judge, the contract is annulled and ceases to produce effects. Depending on the circumstances, the cessation may have retroactive effects (*ex tunc)* or not (*ex nunc),* and the party *in bonis* may be entitled to claim compensation.964\n\nDoc. C-35, p. 41.\n\n1089.\n\nThe proven facts regarding the Fiscal Liability Proceeding have already been detailed in Section **V.3(3.1)** *supra* and will be briefly recalled here (**a.**); the facts surrounding the Procedure for Contractual Annulment will be summarized thereafter (**b.**).\n\n**a. Fiscal Liability Proceeding**\n----------------------------------\n\n1090.\n\nOn 30 April 2015, the *Contralora Delegada,* Ms. Vargas, issued the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision, which found that by executing the Eighth Amendment Prodeco had incurred in liability and ordered Prodeco and certain civil servants jointly and severally to compensate the State for the damage caused.965\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 231.\n\n1091.\n\nOn 11 May 2015, Prodeco filed:\n\n- A *recurso de reposici\u00f3n* before the *Contralora Delegada,* the very authority who had issued Decision, asking for reconsideration of her Decision, and\n\n- A *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n* before the *Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica,* the supervisor of the *Contralora Delegada.*966\n\nDoc. C-33.\n\n1092.\n\nThese administrative appeals proved unsuccessful:\n\n- In July 2015, the *Contralora Delegada* rejected Prodeco\u2019s *recurso de reposici\u00f3n;*967 and\n\n- In August 2015, the *Contralor General* issued the Appeal Decision, thereby confirming the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision.968\n\nDoc. C-35.\n\nDoc. C-37.\n\n1093.\n\nAfter a mandatory Request for Conciliation and an unsuccessful Conciliation with the *Contralor\u00eda*, on 1 April 2016, Prodeco filed the Annulment Procedure against the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca969* seeking\n\n- annulment of the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision,\n\n- restitution of the amounts already paid by Prodeco in compliance with the *Contralor\u00eda'* s Decision, and\n\n- certain ancillary requests plus damages.970\n\nDoc. R-2. See also McManus I, para. 45.\n\nSubsidiarily Prodeco also claimed against Messrs. Mart\u00ednez Torres, Ballesteros and Ceballos and the insurance companies, requesting reimbursement of the amounts paid to the *Contralor\u00eda.*\n\n1094.\n\nA decision by the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* remains pending.\n\n**b. Procedure for Contractual Annulment**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1095.\n\nPursuant to clause 39 of the Mining Contract, the Mining Contract is subject to Colombian law and to the jurisdiction of Colombian courts.971 Colombian courts are thus empowered to adjudicate all disputes arising out of the Mining Contract -including any dispute as regards the validity of the Contract or of its Amendments.\n\nDoc. C-2, clause 39, p. 38.\n\n1096.\n\nOn 30 March 2012, the SGC, invoking clause 39 of the Mining Contract, and after an unsuccessful request for mandatory conciliation, filed the Procedure for Contractual Annulment with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca.* The SGC requested that the court declare the nullity of the Eighth Amendment, arguing that such Amendment was detrimental to the general interest of the State: the Amendment had been executed on the assumption that it would generate benefits for the State, but this scenario had not materialized.972\n\nDoc. C-140, pp. 3 and 34-35.\n\n1097.\n\nSubsidiarily, the SGC requested that the *Tribunal Administrativo* revise the Eighth Amendment, \"*de tal manera que se preserve el inter\u00e9s general, recuperando y manteniendo a un futuro el equilibrio de la ecuaci\u00f3n financiera del Contrato 044/89, perdido con el desarrollo del Otros\u00ed No. 8\".*\n\n1098.\n\nThe SGC\u2019s claim was served on Prodeco in October 2012.973\n\nDoc. C-149, p. 1.\n\n1099.\n\nOn 15 May 2013, the ANM (which had replaced the SGC) resubmitted its claim before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca,*974 in terms which were practically identical to the initial ones. The ANM however updated the amount of the State's alleged losses resulting to USD 99 M.975\n\nDoc. C-158.\n\nDoc. C-158, p. 46.\n\n1100.\n\nOn 7 October 2013, Prodeco filed its response to the ANM\u2019s resubmitted claim,976 together with a report by KPMG.977\n\nDoc. C-170. It should be noted that Prodeco had already submitted a response to the SGC\u2019s initial claim on 21 May 2013 (Doc. C-160).\n\nDoc. C-168.\n\n1101.\n\nProdeco said that the Eighth Amendment had been executed in accordance with Colombia\u2019s legislation and had been necessary to permit an expansion of the Mine. Prodeco also argued that the Eighth Amendment would increase Colombia\u2019s benefits in the long-term. According to Prodeco, the impact of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s on the State\u2019s finances could be determined only at the end of the life of the Mining Contract.978\n\nDoc. C-170.\n\n1102.\n\nOn 22 October 2013, the ANM filed its reply submission.979\n\nDoc. C-172.\n\n1103.\n\nThe Parties agree that to this day, the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* has not issued a decision in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment.980\n\nC I, para. 143; Compass Lexecon I, para. 58; R I, para. 261; R II, para. 383; HT, Day 1, p. 155, l. 4.\n\n**B. Analysis and Decision of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1104.\n\nClaimants\u2019 main request for relief is a declaration that Colombia\u2019s measures have resulted in breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.981 As a consequence of such declaration, Claimants request that the Tribunal order the Republic of Colombia\n\n- to continue to perform and observe the Eighth Amendment;982\n\n- to procure the cessation of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment with prejudice;983\n\n- to provide appropriate assurances and guarantees from the *Contralor\u00eda* that it will refrain from initiating any new proceedings in relation to the Eighth Amendment;984 and\n\n- to repay to Prodeco the Fiscal Liability Amount of USD 19.1 M plus interest.985\n\nC II, para. 374(a); the request was confirmed in CPHB para. 92. Claimants also ask for a declaration that Colombia has breached the Umbrella Clause, Art. 10(2) of the Treaty; but the Tribunal has already found in Section **V.3****.(3.2)** *supra* that it lacks competence to adjudicate any dispute relating to the Umbrella Clause.\n\nC II, para. 374(b).\n\nC II, para. 374(c).\n\nC II, para. 374(d-e).\n\nC II, para. 374(f). If Colombia does not comply with this order within 90 days, Claimants subsidiarily request *(inter alia)* forward-looking damages in an amount of USD 336.1 million, plus certain indemnifications.\n\n1105.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants\u2019 claims against the *Contralor\u00eda* and the ANM are not yet ripe for adjudication and are, thus, inadmissible.\n\n1106.\n\nRespondent argues that:986\n\n- The local proceedings must run their course as a pre-condition to the ripeness of Claimants\u2019 claims against the *Contralor\u00eda* and the ANM;\n\n- Claimants have suffered no harm and a claim based on potential harm to the investment is not admissible under the Treaty;\n\n- Alternatively, Claimants\u2019 claims constitute an abuse of process, their aim being to effectively block Colombia\u2019s judiciary process.\n\nSee section **V.4****.(1)** *supra.*\n\n1107.\n\nClaimants say that their claims concern measures already adopted by the State, which are in breach of the Treaty, and have caused a loss or damage to Claimants\u2019 investment. These claims are therefore fully ripe for adjudication.\n\n1108.\n\nClaimants allege that:987\n\n- The extent of the loss or damage sustained by Claimants is a matter to be determined in the merits;\n\n- Claimants have already paid the Fiscal Liability Amount and have, therefore suffered a monetary harm;\n\n- There is no requirement of exhaustion of local remedies, because Claimants are not claiming denial of justice; and\n\n- As to the abuse of process, Claimants are not asking the Tribunal to stop the Colombian authorities from investigating crimes or pursuing criminal procedures; in any case, the mere request of relief can never be an abuse of process.\n\nSee section **V.4****.(2)** *supra.*\n\n1109.\n\nClaimants\u2019 case is that by adopting two distinct measures the Republic has breached the assurances given in the Treaty: the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision (**a.**) and the Procedure for Contractual Annulment (**b.**). The Tribunal will analyse each separately. Thereafter it will devote short sub-sections to two subsidiary arguments advanced by Respondent: non-existence of loss or damage (**c.**) and abuse of process (**d.**). Eventually, the Tribunal will dismiss Respondent\u2019s Inadmissibility Objection.\n\n**a. The** ***Contralor\u00eda'*****s Decision**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1110.\n\nClaimants argue that the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision violates Arts. 4(1) (unreasonable or discriminatory measures) and 4(2) (FET) of the Treaty. In essence, Claimants say that:988\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda'* s Decision effectively revoked the State\u2019s commitments under the Eighth Amendment, thereby frustrating Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations;989\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision is arbitrary, unreasonable and was issued in bad faith:990\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda'* s Decision required Prodeco to pay the Fiscal Liability Amount in order to avoid forfeiture of the Mining Contract as a whole; this amounted to a unilateral and coercive attempt to rewrite the negotiated terms of the Mining Contract;991\n\n- Colombia has denied Claimants due process in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, because Prodeco could not properly defend itself and the *Contralor\u00eda* did not act even-handedly in its conduct of the proceedings.\n\nC I, para. 204.\n\nC I, paras. 192-195.\n\nC I, para. 202.\n\nC I, para. 203.\n\n1111.\n\nRespondent argues that such claims are premature and, thus, inadmissible.\n\n1112.\n\nOn 30 April 2015, the *Contralora Delegada,* Ms. Vargas, issued the *Contralor\u00eda'* s Decision. Thereafter, Prodeco filed a *recurso de reposici\u00f3n* before the *Contralora Delegada* and a *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n* to the *Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica,* the superior of the *Contralora Delegada.992* Both appeals have been dismissed and the administrative act is now final (*firme en v\u00eda gubernativa*). Prodeco has filed a judicial Annulment Procedure with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca*, seeking to impeach the *Contralor\u00eda'* s Decision. The *Tribunal Administrativo* has not yet issued its decision.\n\nDoc. C-33.\n\n1113.\n\nThe matter which the Tribunal must address is whether a dispute arising from an administrative act which is already final *en via gubernativa*, but where the judicial recourse is still pending, is already ripe for adjudication before an international arbitration tribunal.\n\nArt. 11(3) of the Protocol\n--------------------------\n\n1114.\n\nThis very question is addressed in Art. 11(3) of the Protocol. The Spanish and English versions of the text read as follows:\n\n*\"Con respecto a Colombia, para poder someter una reclamaci\u00f3n para su soluci\u00f3n bajo dicho Art\u00edculo [11(3) del Tratado], se debe agotar la v\u00eda gubernativa de acuerdo a las leyes y regulaciones aplicables. Ese procedimiento en ning\u00fan caso deber\u00e1 exceder seis meses desde la fecha de su inicio por el inversionista* [...]\".\n\n\"With respect to Colombia, in order to submit a claim for settlement under the said Article [11(3) of the Treaty], domestic administrative remedies shall be exhausted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Such procedure shall in no case exceed six months from the date of its initiation by the investor [...].\"\n\n1115.\n\nArt. 11(3) of the Protocol is applicable only to investments in Colombia *(\"Con respecto a Colombia*...\"). It must have been inserted at the request of Colombia, to take account of its *\"leyes y regulaciones\";* the Spanish text of the provision uses Colombian legal terminology and is of special relevance for its proper construction.\n\n1116.\n\nThe rule covers claims which an investor intends to submit, based on *actos administrativos* performed by the Republic or its agencies. Admissibility of such claims is subject to a special requirement:\n\n- The *via gubernativa* must be exhausted, *i.e.* all appeals within the public administration itself against the administrative act must have been filed and dismissed, so that the *acto administrativo* has become *firme en via gubernativa;*\n\n- Alternatively, more than six months must have elapsed since the investor filed the administrative appeal, without a final decision, which exhausts the *v\u00eda gubernativa*, having been rendered.\n\n1117.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda'* s Decision complies with the first alternative: all administrative appeals have been lodged and dismissed; it is *firme en via gubernativa*, and consequently Art. 11(3) of the Protocol entitles Claimants to file a claim that the FET standard (including the prohibition of unreasonable or discriminatory measures) has been breached.\n\n1118.\n\nThe fact that Prodeco has also filed an Annulment Procedure against the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* is irrelevant. The Treaty does not require that investors, before filing claims based on breaches of Art. 4(1) or (2) of the Treaty, must exhaust local judicial remedies.993\n\nArt. 11(3) of the Protocol only requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n\n1119.\n\nIn this case, there is an additional reason to dismiss Respondent\u2019s argument that Claimants\u2019 claims regarding the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision are not ripe for adjudication: in the mandatory Conciliation which preceded the filing of the Annulment Procedure, Colombia argued that the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* lacked jurisdiction to hear such Annulment Procedure, Glencore and Prodeco having opted to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration.994 It is a *volte face* when Colombia now argues that Claimants, in order to gain access to international arbitration, must first exhaust the Annulment Procedure.\n\nDoc. C-192, p. 6.\n\n**b. The Procedure for Contractual Annulment**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1120.\n\nClaimants additionally submit that Colombia\u2019s decision to file the Procedure for Contractual Annulment and seek nullification of the Eighth Amendment\n\n- is an attempt to repudiate the Republic\u2019s commitments and frustrates Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations;995\n\n- is arbitrary, unreasonable and in bad faith.996\n\nC I, para. 198.\n\nC I paras. 201-202; para. 216\n\n1121.\n\nRespondent again argues that such claims are premature and inadmissible.\n\n1122.\n\nThe Tribunal would agree with Respondent\u2019s line of reasoning if Claimants were arguing that the judicial Procedure for Contractual Annulment had resulted in a denial of justice. A claim for denial of justice would indeed be premature - the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* not having issued the first instance decision and local judicial remedies not having been exhausted.\n\n1123.\n\nClaimants do not deny that claims for denial of justice \"will only be perfected once internal remedies are exhausted and/or justice sufficiently delayed\".997 But they assert that they are not making a claim for denial of justice, their case being that Colombia\u2019s mere decision to file the judicial Procedure for Contractual Annulment already resulted in a breach of the of the FET standard.998\n\nC II, para. 225.\n\nC II, paras. 225-226; C III, para. 141(b); HT, Day 1, p. 249, l. 20 - p. 250, l. 16.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n-----------------------\n\n1124.\n\nThe matter which the Tribunal must address in order to accept or to dismiss the Inadmissibility Objection is whether Claimants\u2019 claims are already ripe for adjudication, or whether under the BIT an investor is bound to perform certain activity before being entitled to gain access to international arbitration.\n\n1125.\n\nWhen the Tribunal approached the same issue regarding the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision, it was able to rely on the guidance provided by Art. 11(3) of the Protocol. This rule is inapposite for the present discussion: Colombia\u2019s decision to file the judicial Procedure for Contractual Annulment does not constitute an *acto administrativo*, and cannot be impugned in *via gubernativa.*\n\n1126.\n\nIn the absence of any specific provision in the Treaty, of any guidance in the Protocol or any rule of general application deriving from international law, the Tribunal finds that access to international arbitration, in situations other than those covered by Art. 11(3) of the Protocol, is not burdened by any admissibility requirement. Colombia adopted a measure consisting in the filing of the judicial Procedure for Contractual Annulment; Claimants claim that this measure breached the Treaty; the claim is admissible, there being no further requirements which have to be complied with (whether the claim is ultimately accepted or dismissed is of course a question for the merits).\n\n*Lemire*\n--------\n\n1127.\n\nThe tribunal in *Lemire,* when faced with a similar situation, reached the same conclusion as the present Tribunal, but added the following *caveat* :999\n\n\"This does not mean that an investor can come before an ICSID tribunal with any complaint, no matter how trivial, about any decision, no matter how routine, taken by any civil servant, no matter how modest his hierarchical place.\"\n\n*Lemire*, para. 278.\n\n1128.\n\nIn this case, however, the claim is not trivial, since it affects the validity of the Eighth Amendment. And the decision was not taken by a modest civil servant, but by the SGC, the agency entrusted by the Republic with the supervision of the mining sector. The test predicated by *Lemire* is fully met.\n\n*Generation Ukraine*\n--------------------\n\n1129.\n\nRespondent has invoked *Generation Ukraine* to support its case.\n\n1130.\n\nThe present arbitration has significant differences with *Generation Ukraine,*1000 a case where the claimant abandoned the country as soon as the impugned measures were adopted and claimed that an expropriation had occurred. In the present arbitration, the situation is quite different: Claimants are not claiming an expropriation, and they have initiated this arbitration to ensure that they continue to enjoy their investment.\n\n*Generation Ukraine*, para. 20.30.\n\n1131.\n\nIn any case, the test proposed by *Generation Ukraine* is based on reasonableness: a claimant is required to put in a reasonable effort to obtain a correction of the wrong decision within the domestic legal system, before gaining access to international protection. In the present case, there is no reasonable measure which Claimants could have adopted to resist or correct Colombia\u2019s decision to file the Procedure for Contractual Annulment.\n\n**c. Loss or Damage**\n---------------------\n\n1132.\n\nArt. 11(1) of the Treaty provides that an investor may request consultations, as a preliminary step to arbitration, if the measure applied by the host State is inconsistent with a Treaty obligation \"thus causing loss or damage to him or his investment\".\n\n1133.\n\nRespondent argues that the measures adopted by Colombia have caused no loss or damage to Claimants.\n\n1134.\n\nThe argument is without merit.\n\n1135.\n\nDetermination of loss and damage is a question which can only be adjudicated once the merits of the claim have been established. In any case, Prodeco was forced to pay to the Republic the Fiscal Liability Amount, as required by the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision. *Prima facie,* Claimants seem to have suffered certain \"loss or damage\", and one of Claimants\u2019 requests in this arbitration is precisely repayment of such sum plus interest.\n\n**d. Abuse of Process**\n-----------------------\n\n1136.\n\nRespondent finally submits that the Tribunal should decline to hear Claimants\u2019 claims, because by trying to inhibit the operation of Colombia\u2019s judiciary process, an abuse of process is being committed.1001\n\nSee section **V.4****.(1)** *supra.*\n\n1137.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees.\n\n1138.\n\nClaimants\u2019 claim is that certain measures adopted by Colombia\u2019s public administration (the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision and the filing of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment) breached the FET standard established in the BIT. The allegedly wrongful measures were performed by agencies of the Republic, and allegedly breached international law guarantees afforded by the Treaty. Claimants\u2019 allegations may be right or wrong - that is a question for the merits. But there is no indication that Claimants committed an abuse of process which would permit an early disposal of the claims.\n\n1139.\n\nRespondent cites the *Rompetrol* award*.* That tribunal held the following:1002\n\n\"The Tribunal wishes to make it plain from the outset that it would be acutely sensitive to any well-founded allegation that the investment arbitration process before it was intended to (or was in fact operating in such a way as to) block or inhibit the legitimate operation of the State\u2019s inherent function in the investigation, repression and punishment of crime, including economic crime and corruption.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n*Rompetrol*, para. 152.\n\n1140.\n\nThe *Rompetrol* tribunal then went on to dismiss the respondent\u2019s inadmissibility objection.1003\n\n*Rompetrol*, para. 161.\n\n1141.\n\nThe findings in *Rompetrol* are *obiter dicta*, relate to criminal investigations, and resulted in the dismissal of Romania\u2019s inadmissibility objection1004- they do not support Respondent\u2019s case.\n\n*Rompetrol,* paras. 152-161.\n\n1142.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent\u2019s Inadmissibility Objection-\n\n**VI. MERITS OF THE CLAIMS**\n----------------------------\n\n1143.\n\nThe Tribunal has rejected three of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional and inadmissibility objections and must now turn to the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n1144.\n\nAt the Hearing, Claimants described that what they seek in the present arbitration \"is very simple\":1005\n\n\"That Colombia honor its word when it signed with Prodeco a contractual amendment which formed the incentive for a mine expansion and related infrastructure which cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Having received the benefit of that investment, Colombia cannot now turn its back on its solemn contractual commitments, put on its sovereign hat, and seek to unilaterally abrogate the rights contained in that Contract. If that were not the case, no contract signed with a sovereign State would be worth the paper it is written on. Such conduct is a textbook breach of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard.\"\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 18, l. 22 - p. 19, l. 13.\n\n1145.\n\nMore specifically, Claimants argue that by\n\n- (i) starting the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and adopting the *Contralor\u00eda' s* decision and\n\n- (ii) filing the Procedure for Contractual Annulment and thereby seeking annulment of the Eighth Amendment\n\nColombia failed to provide Claimants with treatment consistent with the obligations set forth in Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.1006\n\nC I, para. 187; Doc. H-1, p. 156.\n\n1146.\n\nClaimants also contend that Colombia has failed to observe its obligations with regard to Claimants\u2019 investment under Art. 10(2) of the Treaty.1007 The Tribunal has already ruled, however, that it does not have competence to adjudicate claims to the extent they are grounded on the Umbrella Clause of the Treaty.1008\n\nC I, Section IV.C; C II, Section IV.C; HT, Day 1, p. 160, ll. 9-10.\n\nSee section **V.3****.(3.2)** *supra.*\n\n1147.\n\nThe Tribunal will first summarize Claimants\u2019 position (**VI.1.**) and then Respondent\u2019s position (**VI.2.**) before analysing the issues and setting forth the reasons for its decision (**VI.3.**).\n\n**VI.1. CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n-----------------------------\n\n1148.\n\nClaimants explain that Art. 4(2) of the Treaty requires Colombia to accord FET to Claimants\u2019 investments.1009 The Treaty does not define what constitutes FET. Claimants argue, however, that pursuant to Art. 31(1) of the VCLT, Art. 4(2) must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms, and in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty.1010\n\nC I, section IV.B.1; C II, para. 230.\n\nC I, para. 178.\n\n1149.\n\nClaimants point out that the contours of the FET standard have been developed by investment treaty tribunals over time. For instance, in the *Saluka* case,1011 the tribunal concluded that the ordinary meaning of \"fair\" and \"equitable\" is \"just\", \"even-handed\", \"unbiased\", or \"legitimate\". Investment tribunals have also established that pursuant to the FET standard, the host State is required to ensure some essential features in its investment environment:1012\n\n- Protection of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations (1.) : tribunals have held that when the host State creates expectations in the investor, these expectations are legitimate and are subject to protection. As held by the *Total* tribunal, legitimate expectations can arise from a variety of sources, including a contract, a concession or other commitments on which the investor is entitled to rely.1013\n\n- Appropriate investment environment (2.) : the host State must ensure an appropriate investment environment, by treating the foreign investment in a manner that is consistent, predictable, transparent, and not arbitrary.1014 As enshrined in Art. 4(1) of the Treaty, the host State must not interfere with investments through unreasonable or discriminatory conduct.1015 Finally, the State must act in accordance with the principle of good faith.1016\n\n- Due process (3.) : the host State must ensure that due process is accorded; this entails enabling an investor to present its case and to defend itself. A breach of due process must be objectively assessed and can occur even if there is no bias on the part of the State.1017\n\nC I, para. 179, referring to *Saluka*, para. 298.\n\nC I, paras. 180-186; C II, para. 231; HT, Day 1, p. 161, ll. 3-14.\n\nC I, paras. 180-181; C II, paras. 232-234; HT, Day 1, p. 161, l. 15 - p. 162, l. 15, referring to *Saluka* and *Total*.\n\nC I, para. 182, referring to *Metalclad,* para. 99; *MTD,* para. 163; *Tecmed,* para. 154; C II, paras. 246-248; HT, Day 1, p. 164, ll. 5-21.\n\nC I, para. 184, referring to *CMS,* para. 290.\n\nC I, para. 185, referring to *Tecmed,* para. 153.\n\nC I, para. 183; C II, paras. 254-256.\n\n1150.\n\nClaimants explain that the determination of \"unreasonableness\" or \"unfairness\" is not dependent upon the State\u2019s motivation for taking the offending measures. FET is an objective standard that can be breached even if the State acted in good faith.1018\n\nC I, para. 186.\n\n1151.\n\nClaimants submit that Colombia treated Claimants\u2019 investment unfairly and inequitably and impaired it through unreasonable treatment, in violation of its obligations under the Treaty and customary international law.\n\n(1) **Frustration of Legitimate Expectations**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1152.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Colombia made specific commitments and assurances with respect to Claimants\u2019 investments, which generated legitimate expectations, only then to breach those expectations.1019\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 162, ll. 16-19.\n\n1153.\n\nClaimants contend that the Eighth Amendment constituted Colombia\u2019s core commitment, and that Claimants relied upon it to invest over USD 1 billion in Colombia since 2010. This Amendment was negotiated over a period of 20 months, was executed by Colombia\u2019s Mining Agency and was registered with the national mining registry. The State Mining Agency gave three explicit commitments to Claimants in the Eighth Amendment:1020\n\n- That Royalties on every additional 1 MTA of coal produced beyond 8 MTA would be subject to a marginal prorated 1% increase;\n\n- That thresholds for the GIC payments would be indexed;\n\n- That the Coal Reference Price for the liquidation of Royalties and GIC payments would be established using a lagging price formula reflecting reference prices from the previous three to eighteen months.\n\nC I, paras. 188-191; HT, Day 1, p. 162, ll. 16-19.\n\n1154.\n\nThe State Mining Agency reinforced these expectations by approving Prodeco\u2019s 2010 PTI.\n\n1155.\n\nClaimants argue that they legitimately expected that Colombia would honour these contractual commitments and act consistently with the representations given to Prodeco.1021 Instead, through the actions of the *Contralor\u00eda* and the Mining Agency, Colombia repudiated and destroyed the commitments that it had negotiated and enshrined in the Eighth Amendment, after Claimants had made significant investments in reliance upon said Amendment, thereby frustrating Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.1022\n\nC I, para. 191.\n\nC I, paras. 192-194, 198; HT, Day 1, p. 162, l. 20 - p. 163, l. 8.\n\n**A. The** ***Contralor\u00eda*****\u2019s Conduct Contravened Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1156.\n\nClaimants argue that the *Contralor\u00eda's* decision to initiate and conduct the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, ultimately holding Prodeco fiscally liable, contravened Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations, specifically that their investments would be treated in a consistent, predictable, and transparent manner.1023\n\nC II, para. 259.\n\n1157.\n\nFirst, the *Contralor\u00eda'* s Decision revoked the State\u2019s commitments under the Eighth Amendment for the year 2020. Colombia did not use its fiscal control powers in conformity with its usual function of supervising fiscal management of State resources, but rather to nullify, in effect, the commitments made in the Eighth Amendment.1024\n\nC II, para. 259(a).\n\n1158.\n\nSecond, the *Contralor\u00eda* acted unpredictably by adopting a decision which was radically incoherent and inconsistent with the conduct of other Colombian authorities. According to Claimants, there is no precedent for the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s decision to nullify an agreement with a specialized state entity concerning a large project like Prodeco\u2019s. Colombia also unilaterally withdrew the undertakings and assurances it gave Claimants to incentivize the investment in the expansion of the Mine.1025\n\nC II, para. 259(b).\n\n1159.\n\nThird, the *Contralor\u00eda* applied different criteria to evaluate the Eighth Amendment from those considered by Ingeominas when negotiating and agreeing to it. The *Contralor\u00eda* also ignored that the Eighth Amendment had enabled the expansion of the Mine and that this expansion had been the basis of the negotiation between the parties.1026\n\nC II, para. 259(c).\n\n**B. The ANM\u2019s Conduct Contravened Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1160.\n\nClaimants argue that the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, filed by the SGC/ANM, also repudiated the State\u2019s commitments under the Eighth Amendment and breached Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.\n\n1161.\n\nThis Procedure was started after Claimants, relying on the Eighth Amendment, had made significant investments. In the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, the Mining Agency argues that the Amendment should be nullified as being contrary to the State\u2019s general interest. According to Claimants, this directly contradicts the express representations given by Ingeominas upon the execution of the Eighth Amendment.1027\n\nC I, paras. 196-198; C II, para. 270(a); HT, Day 1, p. 163, l. 9 - p. 164, l. 1.\n\n**C. Rebuttal of Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1162.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s argument that contracts do not give rise to legitimate expectations, and that the breach of contractual expectations does not violate the FET provision, Claimants disagree. Investment case law has consistently recognised that contracts with a host State can give rise to legitimate expectations.1028\n\nC II, paras. 236-237, referring to *Noble Ventures,* para. 182; *Toto Costruzioni,* para. 159; *Clayton et al.,* para. 282; *Murphy II,* para. 248.\n\n1163.\n\nClaimants recognise that not all contractual breaches violate the FET standard. Claimants argue, however, that in the present case the State did not just fail to perform a contract that it had previously recognised as binding; it sought the annulment of said contract. Claimants do not rely on \"contractual expectations\", but on the legitimate expectations protected under the Treaty, that Colombia generated by assuming explicit commitments and assurances towards the Claimants.1029\n\nC II, paras. 238-239.\n\n1164.\n\nRespondent also asserts that the State\u2019s enforcement of its legal, regulatory or control measures cannot amount to a breach of legitimate expectations. Claimants consider this allegation to be incorrect, since the VCLT expressly provides that a State may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. In addition, as held by the *Tecmed* tribunal, a State will frustrate an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations if it uses its legal and regulatory powers for a purpose other than that for which it was intended, to impair or deprive the investor of its investment.1030\n\nC II, paras. 240-242, referring to *Tecmed,* para. 154.\n\n**(2) Failure to Provide Investment Environment Required by FET**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1165.\n\nClaimants further submit that Colombia has also breached the FET standard by frustrating Claimants\u2019 general expectation that Colombia would treat Claimants\u2019 investment in a transparent, consistent, and predictable manner, that Colombia would act in good faith, and that it would refrain from arbitrary or unreasonable treatment.1031\n\nC I, para. 199.\n\n1166.\n\nClaimants note that the State has to act consistently between the branches of its government, as found in the *MTD* case. This means that the State as a whole must act coherently vis-\u00e0-vis the foreign investor.1032 Claimants argue that this did not happen in the present case: Ingeominas executed the Eighth Amendment on the basis that it was in the interest of the State, only for the *Contralor\u00eda* arbitrarily to abrogate it on the basis of an opposite conclusion.1033\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 165, ll. 6-13.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 165, ll. 14-19.\n\n1167.\n\nClaimants contend that these findings are also supported by the finding of the *Occidental* decision, which held that confusion and lack of clarity in the actions of an administrative agency may result in some form of arbitrariness, even if not intended.1034\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 166, l. 21 - p. 167, l. 5.\n\n1168.\n\nClaimants aver that Colombia's agencies did not act consistently, predictably, and in good faith, for several reasons.\n\n**A. The** ***Contralor\u00eda*****'s Decision was Non-Transparent, Arbitrary and Unreasonable**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1169.\n\nClaimants argue that the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019 s* Decision, which led to the reversal of the Eighth Amendment, was non-transparent, arbitrary, unreasonable, and taken in bad faith for several reasons.1035\n\nC I, para. 202; C II, para. 259(d); HT, Day 1, p. 168, l. 6 - p. 170, l. 17.\n\n1170.\n\nFirst, the *Contralor\u00eda* found Prodeco guilty of negotiating and proposing the Eighth Amendment, and of not ensuring that Ingeominas properly analysed the consequences of the Eighth Amendment, as if Prodeco's role was that of the Colombian State's supervisory guardian and not that of a contractual counterparty. Ultimately, the *Contralor\u00eda* held Prodeco liable for the alleged misconduct of the State's mining agency. According to Claimants, holding a private company responsible for alleged failures of a State entity to perform its duties properly is unreasonable and arbitrary.\n\n1171.\n\nSecond, the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision was based on the fact that several public officers allegedly failed to fulfil their duties. The Mining Agency never investigated any of those alleged wrongdoings, however. Only Prodeco was held liable by the *Contralor\u00eda*.\n\n1172.\n\nThird, the *Contralor\u00eda* held that the Eighth Amendment was not in the State's interest, based on a narrow analysis of the first year of a long-term contract. This conclusion was reached despite the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* institutional guidelines requiring long-term analysis of long-term contracts; here the *Contralor\u00eda* illogically relied on the definition of \"Transition Period\" in the Mining Contract. Claimants submit that making a short-term analysis of the operation of a long-term contract is arbitrary and unreasonable.\n\n1173.\n\nFourth, the *Contralor\u00eda* reached its conclusions long before issuing the Decision and did not allow Prodeco to submit key evidence. Claimants argue that the *Contralor\u00eda* 's actions involved prejudice, preference, and bias.\n\n1174.\n\nIn particular, the *Contralor\u00eda* committed many procedural irregularities in blatant disregard of Colombian law and the best practices reflected in the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Evidence Manual. The *Contralor\u00eda* sought to manipulate the evidence so as to reach a pre-ordained and arbitrary conclusion.\n\n1175.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* ignored the testimony of Ingeominas' officers, given under oath, that Ingeominas had properly analysed the Eighth Amendment. Instead, it relied almost exclusively on testimony from those same officers that contradicted their testimony given under oath. The *Contralor\u00eda* seems to have rewarded the officers who changed their testimony by dropping charges against them. Accordingly, Claimants submit that the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision was biased, rendered in bad faith, and subjective:\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* did not act on the basis of legal standards, but repeatedly relied on its own discretion and preference to justify a finding of fiscal liability against Prodeco;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* exercised jurisdiction over Prodeco when it did not have such jurisdiction;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* did not base its actions on reasoned judgement.\n\n1176.\n\nFinally, the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision required Prodeco to pay the Fiscal Liability Amount in order to avoid forfeiture of the Mining Contract as a whole. This amounted to a unilateral and coercive attempt to rewrite the negotiated terms of the Mining Contract.1036\n\nC I, para. 203.\n\n**B. The State Mining Agency\u2019s Conduct was Arbitrary, Unpredictable, and Non-Transparent**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1177.\n\nClaimants also argue that the Mining Agency has conducted itself in an inconsistent, arbitrary, unpredictable, and non-transparent manner:1037\n\n- On the one hand, after 20 months of negotiations, the State Mining Agency signed the Eighth Amendment in order to induce Claimants to make significant investments, claiming that the Amendment was in the State\u2019s interest because it would allow the expansion of the Mine; it registered the Eighth Amendment with the national mining registry, approved Prodeco\u2019s 2010 PTI and its officers then testified as to the benefits of the Eighth Amendment in the context of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding;\n\n- On the other hand, after Claimants had made massive investments to expand the Mine, the Mining Agency, in direct contradiction with its prior conduct, sought to annul the Eighth Amendment, arguing that it reduced Colombia\u2019s royalty revenues for 2010 and 2011, even though it knew that the Amendment would bring significant benefits to the State in the medium to long term.\n\nC I, paras. 200-201; C II, para. 270(b); HT, Day 1, p. 170, l. 18 - p. 172, l. 8.\n\n1178.\n\nClaimants further argue that the initiation of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment was non-transparent and arbitrary, since the Mining Agency sought unilaterally to withdraw the undertakings and assurances given to Claimants, without a reasoned judgement. The Mining Agency decided to request the nullity of the Eighth Amendment on the ground that it was not in the interest of the State, reneging its prior representations. There was no attempt to consult with Prodeco in good faith before taking such a drastic step.1038\n\nC II, para. 270(c).\n\n1179.\n\nIn light of these actions, Claimants submit that Colombia has failed to provide them with the investment environment required by the FET standard, in breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.1039\n\nC I, section IV.B.3.b; HT, Day 1, p. 172, ll. 9-16.\n\n**C. Rebuttal of Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1180.\n\nClaimants note that, contrary to what Respondent alleges, a State can breach the FET standard even if the measures it took were taken in good faith, for a legitimate purpose, and in accordance with its laws and regulations.1040 Equally, a State may take measures which are arbitrary, even if not taken in bad faith.1041\n\nC II, paras. 244-245.\n\nC II, para. 248; HT, Day 1, p. 173, ll. 10-19.\n\n1181.\n\nClaimants contend that it is not necessary to establish that Colombia acted in bad faith for this Tribunal to conclude that Colombia failed to accord FET to Claimants\u2019 investment. If Colombia had acted in bad faith, however, that would in itself evidence a breach of the FET.1042\n\nC II, para. 251, referring to *Frontier Petroleum,* para. 300.\n\n1182.\n\nFinally, Claimants admit that there is no question that Colombia has a general right to exercise legal or regulatory review, but argue that such review, even if fully compliant with Colombian law and conducted in good faith, must be consistent with the international law obligation to provide FET. FET requires Colombia to act in a consistent, predictable, and transparent manner, and to refrain from arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious conduct.1043\n\nC II, para. 252.\n\n(3) **Denial of Due Process**\n-----------------------------\n\n1183.\n\nClaimants submit that due process is another essential feature of the investment environment required by the FET standard. This is an objective standard of treatment, by which a host State\u2019s legal and administrative system may be judged.1044\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 173, l. 20 - p. 174, l. 12.\n\n1184.\n\nClaimants contend that Colombia has denied Claimants due process in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, in two primary ways.1045\n\nC I, para. 204; C II, para. 260. See also, HT, Day 1, p. 174, l. 13 - p. 176, l. 17.\n\n**A. Prodeco Lacked a Proper Opportunity to Defend Itself**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1185.\n\nClaimants first argue that Prodeco was denied the opportunity to present evidence and to question witnesses, and consequently, to defend itself properly:1046\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* refused to admit the oral testimony of the independent experts presented by Prodeco, even though their testimony was directly relevant;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* refused to allow Prodeco to question the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s technical team;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* refused to admit the testimony of Prodeco's employees who had carried out the technical analyses of the proposed Eighth Amendment, which Prodeco shared with the State's Mining Agency during negotiations.\n\nC I, para. 205; C II, para. 260.\n\n**B. The** ***Contralor\u00eda's*** **Decision was Biased**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1186.\n\nClaimants submit that the *Contralor\u00eda* did not act in an even-handed manner in its conduct of the proceedings. In fact, it conducted the proceedings with the aim of reaching a pre-ordained conclusion. This is evidenced by several facts:1047\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* unfairly joined to the proceedings, and attached the assets and bank accounts of four civil servants; after those civil servants subsequently changed their prior sworn testimony by unsworn statements, the *Contralor\u00eda* released them on the grounds that their positions had not vested them with the requisite fiscal management powers to fall under the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* jurisdiction in the first place; the *Contralor\u00eda* thus appears to have rewarded those officers who changed their testimony;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* ignored testimony given under oath in Prodeco's favour, and relied almost exclusively on unsworn testimony that was at odds with the testimony given under oath, but which supported the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* charges; the *Contralor\u00eda* also failed to ask questions to seek the material truth regarding these testimonies;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* refused to allow Prodeco to present statements regarding the analysis of the impact of the Eighth Amendment on the basis that it was \"superfluous\", but admitted the testimony of a witness who had already testified multiple times before the *Contralor\u00eda* ; in her fourth appearance, the witness changed her testimony so as to support the charges laid by the *Contralor\u00eda*.\n\nC I, paras. 206-209; C II, para. 260.\n\n1187.\n\nFurthermore, according to Claimants, the *Contralor\u00eda* conducted the Fiscal Liability Proceeding in a partial and non-transparent manner. Claimants argue that the *Contralor\u00eda* and Ms. Vargas had made up their minds to find Prodeco fiscally liable and were ready to bend applicable rules to achieve that outcome.1048 Claimants suggest that the *Contralor\u00eda* wanted to \"clean up\" the irregularities surrounding the State Mining Agency. The *Contralor\u00eda* found, however, that other Colombian authorities were competent to investigate the irregularities concerning the Drummond and Cerro Matoso contracts, and Prodeco was the only mining company remaining under the *Contralor\u00eda* 's purview.1049\n\nC II, paras. 261-262.\n\nC II, paras. 263-264.\n\n1188.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Ms. Morelli suggested in an interview of December 2013 that she had already decided that Prodeco was fiscally liable.1050 Ms. Morelli had hand-picked Ms. Vargas to lead the Fiscal Liability Proceeding. In January 2014, after Ms. Morelli\u2019s declaration, Ms. Vargas rejected nearly all of Prodeco\u2019s requests to submit evidence. Claimants contend that both Ms. Morelli and Ms Vargas ensured that Prodeco could not proffer exculpatory evidence that could change the determined outcome of the case.1051\n\nReferring to Doc. C-266.\n\nC II, paras. 265-267.\n\n1189.\n\nFinally, the *Contralor\u00eda's* conduct was inconsistent with that of other State entities, such as the State Mining Agency and the decision of the Attorney General\u2019s office.1052\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 177, ll. 6-19.\n\n1190.\n\nClaimants conclude that this conduct, which is attributable to Colombia, destroyed Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations, since Claimants saw their contractual rights nullified in a proceeding devoid of due process. It was the exact opposite of an even-handed and unbiased process based on appropriate and relevant considerations.\n\n**C. Rebuttal of Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1191.\n\nClaimants note that Colombia does not dispute that a violation of due process may breach the FET standard. Colombia argues, however, that for a breach of FET to have occurred, the breach requires \"severe bias\", \"must be manifest and it must offend judicial propriety\". Colombia adds that administrative proceedings are subject to less demanding standards of due process than judicial proceedings.1053\n\nC II, paras. 253-254.\n\n1192.\n\nClaimants disagree. Case law cited by Claimants in their Memorial *(Deutsche Bank, Metalclad* and *Tecmed)* independently found that the host States had failed to provide due process in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard and acted on the basis of bias. Commentary cited by Colombia confirms that due process reflects an objective standard of treatment, by which a host State\u2019s \"legal and administrative system may be judged\".1054\n\nC II, para. 255.\n\n1193.\n\nClaimants further aver that Colombia\u2019s assertions regarding the due process standard allegedly applicable to this case are misguided, since they are based on cases concerning denial of justice **.**1055 or regulatory decision-making by administrative agencies1056- not administrative adjudication. Claimants deny that administrative proceedings are subject to less demanding standards of due process. Claimants refer to the conclusions of the *Apotex* tribunal to support their position.1057\n\nC II, para. 256, referring to *Arif,* para. 446 and to *Jan de Nul,* para. 195.\n\nC II, para. 256, referring to *AES,* para. 9.3.41 and to *Tokios Tokeles,* para. 133.\n\nC II, para. 257, referring to *Apotex*, para. 9.22.\n\n1194.\n\nAccording to Claimants, investment treaty case law has identified other due process failures that can amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, such as \"conduct [...] involving] lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with [...] a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process\",1058 \"total lack of reasoning\" **.**1059 or a State \"disregarding] its own rules\".1060\n\nC II, para. 258, referring to *Jan de Nul,* para. 187.\n\nC II, para. 258, referring to *TECO Guatemala,* para. 458.\n\nC II, para. 258, referring to *TECO Guatemala,* para. 457.\n\n1195.\n\nClaimants conclude, in any event, that the analysis of a potential breach of the FET standard for failure to provide due process largely depends upon and must be adapted to the circumstances of each specific case.1061\n\nC II, para. 258.\n\n1196.\n\nIn sum, Claimants argue that Colombia breached the FET standard and is liable to Claimants.1062\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 177, ll. 20-21.\n\n**VI.2. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n-------------------------------\n\n1197.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 case rests on the assumption that Colombia\u2019s ordinary enforcement of its legal, regulatory, and control framework, which was already in place at the time of Claimants\u2019 investment, constitutes a breach of the Treaty. Respondent says that, essentially, Claimants\u2019 position is that:1063\n\n- Claimants should not be subject to Colombia\u2019s ordinary control regime because \"a large project like the Calenturitas mine\" somehow deserves special treatment;\n\n- Any review of the Eighth Amendment by an organ of the Colombia State, whether the *Contralor\u00eda* or the courts, constitutes a breach of international law.\n\nR II, para. 579; HT, Day 2, p. 505, l. 14 - p. 506, l. 1.\n\n1198.\n\nAccording to Respondent, if Claimants\u2019 position were true, any state action to enforce its legal, regulatory, and control framework would constitute a breach of the FET or non-impairment clauses.1064 Respondent argues that foreign investors are not immunized from enforcement of domestic laws and regulations,1065 especially not sophisticated multinational businesses such as Claimants, who knew about the Colombian legal, regulatory, and control environment.1066\n\nR II, para. 579.\n\nR I, para. 482; R II, para. 582; HT, Day 2, p. 508, ll. 4-13.\n\nR I, para. 399.\n\n1199.\n\nThus, Respondent submits that Colombia\u2019s ordinary and reasonable actions in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment could not and did not breach Arts. 4(1) or 4(2) of the Treaty.1067\n\nR II, para. 579; HT, Day 2, p. 507, ll. 18-20.\n\nPreliminary issue: new claims\n-----------------------------\n\n1200.\n\nRespondent argues that in the Reply, Claimants have matched the various legal standards identified in the initial Memorial, with facts, and produced a largely new constellation of claims. These new claims include Claimants\u2019 allegations that:1068\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision was inconsistent, unpredictable, and non-transparent;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision unreasonably withdrew the undertakings and assurances that Claimants had received;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision was not reasoned; and\n\n- Mr. Paredes did not consult with Prodeco prior to initiating the Procedure for Contractual Annulment.\n\nR II, paras. 583-584.\n\n1201.\n\nAccording to Respondent, all of Claimants\u2019 new allegations in the Reply are inadmissible, since ICSID Rule 31 establishes that the proper time to make allegations of fact and law is in the Memorial. Since Claimants\u2019 new allegations are untimely, they must be disregarded pursuant to ICSID Rule 26(3). Failure to do so would be contrary to Colombia\u2019s right to have two opportunities to respond with evidence.1069\n\nR II, paras. 585-586.\n\n1202.\n\nRespondent also argues that all of Claimants\u2019 allegations made in the Memorial that Claimants chose not to defend in the Reply must also be rejected, since it would be contrary to Colombia\u2019s procedural rights if Claimants were now allowed to introduce further arguments in defence of these claims, following their failure to do so in the Reply.1070\n\nR II, para. 587.\n\n1203.\n\nIn any event, Respondent considers that Claimants\u2019 case must fail since:1071\n\n- Colombia acted in full compliance with Claimants\u2019 alleged legitimate expectations at all times **(1)** ;\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision and the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, as ordinary regulatory and control measures, satisfied all requirements of the FET and impairment clauses **(2)** ;\n\n- The conduct of the *Contralor\u00eda* in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding fully respected any relevant standard of due process **(3)** ; and\n\n- Respondent finally adds that there was no violation of FET or of the impairment clauses on account of the ANDJE\u2019s submission of the Criminal Complaint.\n\nR II, para. 588.\n\n**(1) No Breach of Legitimate Expectations**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1204.\n\nRespondent notes that the concept of legitimate expectations does not appear in the terms of the Treaty and that Claimants have not explained how it could fall within the ordinary meaning of FET.1072 Even if customary international law should be taken into account when interpreting the ordinary meaning of a Treaty term, according to customary international law, FET does not cover legitimate expectations.1073\n\nR I, paras. 403-404; R II, para. 592.\n\nR I, para. 405.\n\n1205.\n\nRespondent avers that even if the FET clause extended protection to legitimate expectations, Claimants\u2019 allegations would be no more availing, for two reasons:1074\n\n- First, because the allegations of a breach of FET are found solely on contractual expectations, and these cannot give rise to a Treaty breach (**A.**);\n\n- Second, because any expectations that Claimants might have had from the Eighth Amendment must have included the possibility that Colombia would subject that contract to ordinary measures to enforce its legal and regulatory framework (**B.**).\n\nR I, para. 406; R II, para. 593.\n\n**A. No Breach of Mere Contractual Expectations**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1206.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations arise directly from the Eighth Amendment and the contractual obligations it allegedly contained. However, contractual expectations are not protected by the FET clause of the Treaty.1075\n\nR I, paras. 407-408.\n\n1207.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that an FET clause is not an umbrella clause, which would elevate any contractual breach into a Treaty breach.1076 According to Respondent, Prof. Schreuer has established that if contractual expectations were admitted, the FET standard would be a broadly interpreted umbrella clause.1077\n\nR II, paras. 594-595.\n\nR I, para. 409; R II, para. 596.\n\n1208.\n\nRespondent says that a FET clause cannot be a broadly interpreted umbrella clause. That is even more so in a Treaty which contains an Umbrella Clause but excludes the Tribunal\u2019s competence to adjudicate disputes under said Clause.1078\n\nR I, para. 410; R II, paras. 596-597.\n\n1209.\n\nAccording to Respondent, these conclusions are confirmed by the *SAUR* tribunal and the line of decisions of which it forms a part, including *Parkering-Compagniets, Hamester, Bayindir,* and *Impregilo.*1079 Similarly, the *UAB* tribunal rejected a claim for breach of FET on the ground that it was a contractual claim, brought under the veil of a breach of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.1080\n\nR I, para. 411; R II, para. 599, referring to *SAUR,* para. 483; *Parkerings,* para. 344; *Hamester,* paras. 334-337; *Bayindir*, para. 180; *Impregilo*, para. 294.\n\nR II, para. 600, referring to *UAB,* paras. 846 and 853; and also to *Urbaser.*\n\n1210.\n\nSecond, Respondent holds that investors do not enjoy an unconditional right to legal or contractual stability absent a stabilization clause.1081 Respondent recognizes that many investments are made through the vehicle of contracts. Yet Respondent argues, it does not follow that contractual expectations are the fundamental basis of FET claims in every international arbitration.1082\n\nR II, para. 601; HT, Day 2, p. 511, ll. 13-16.\n\nR II, para. 602.\n\n1211.\n\nFinally, Respondent finds that the case law invoked by Claimants - namely the *Noble Ventures,* and *Murphy* decisions - does not support the argument that virtually every foreign investment and investment claim is based on a breach of contractual expectations.1083\n\nR II, paras. 603-606.\n\n1212.\n\nRespondent concludes that since Claimants have not put forth any supposed legitimate expectation other than the contractual expectations arising from the Eighth Amendment, Claimants do not have a claim under the FET standard.1084 Indeed, the Eighth Amendment did not give rise to any expectations entitled to Treaty protection.1085\n\nR I, paras. 413-414; R II, paras. 607-610.\n\nR I, para. 414.\n\n**B. No Breach Through Ordinary Legal, Regulatory and Control Measures**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1213.\n\nRespondent maintains, in any event, that the investor\u2019s expectations (if any) must include the possibility that the State will enforce its legal and regulatory framework.1086\n\nR I, para. 417; R II, para. 611.\n\n1214.\n\nAccording to Respondent, not every ordinary measure of regulatory or legal enforcement carried out against a foreign investor can be considered to be an FET breach. If legitimate expectations exist at all, they must take into account the entire legal and regulatory framework of the State, including any ordinary review mechanisms, as well as the broader economic and social context in which the expectations were formed. These conclusions are supported by the *Total* and *Roussalis* tribunals.1087\n\nR I, paras. 416-417; R II, para. 612, referring to *Total*, para. 149; *Roussalis*, para. 691; HT, Day 2, p. 509, ll. 3-16.\n\n1215.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants rely on the *ECE* decision to try to demonstrate that they legitimately expected that the Colombian authorities would refrain from implementing the legal and regulatory framework. However, the *ECE* tribunal rejected the proposition that an administrative decision, even an erroneous one, can breach legitimate expectations.1088\n\nR II, para. 613, referring to *ECE,* para. 4,764; HT, Day 2, p. 509, l. 17 - p. 510, l. 1.\n\n1216.\n\nRespondent further submits that, since investors should not be treated by investment tribunals as if they were legally incapable, Claimants are presumed to have known the contents of the Colombian legal and regulatory system when investing in Colombia.1089\n\nR II, para. 614.\n\n1217.\n\nRespondent finds that Claimants\u2019 argument pursuant to which the VCLT precludes Colombia from invoking the provisions of its internal law to justify a breach of the Treaty is unavailing. Respondent does not argue that its internal law is a circumstance that justifies or precludes the wrongfulness of the alleged Treaty breach. Colombia\u2019s argument is that the FET provision of the Treaty, when properly interpreted, cannot preclude the State parties from the ordinary enforcement of their legal and regulatory frameworks.1090\n\nR II, paras. 616-618; HT, Day 2, p. 510, ll. 13-18.\n\n1218.\n\nRespondent stresses that its argument is that an investor can have no legitimate expectation that the State will refrain from reasonable enforcement of its legal and regulatory framework, not that the State is exempted from a duty to respect legitimate expectations (although Colombia denies that any such duty is part of the FET standard).1091\n\nR II, para. 619.\n\n1219.\n\nRespondent thus submits that it did not breach Claimants\u2019 expectations, because it merely took ordinary measures to enforce its legal and regulatory framework.1092\n\nR I, para. 418; R II, para. 621.\n\nThe Fiscal Liability Proceeding was an Ordinary Measure\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1220.\n\nRespondent submits that the Fiscal Liability Proceeding was an ordinary legal and regulatory enforcement measure, which did not breach Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations. Proceedings of fiscal liability are common within the Colombian legal framework and in other frameworks across Latin America. Claimants have submitted no evidence that they had expectations that they would not be subject to a review by the *Contralor\u00eda.*1093\n\nR I, para. 419; HT, Day 2, p. 512, l. 16 - p. 514, l. 9.\n\n1221.\n\nIn a 234-page long reasoned decision, the *Contralor\u00eda* found that Prodeco\u2019s actions satisfied all of the elements of fiscal liability, namely that it had exercised *\"gesti\u00f3n fiscal*\" over public resources and had contributed through the Eighth Amendment to the *\"lesi\u00f3n a los intereses del Estado\"*.1094\n\nR I, paras. 420-424; R II, paras. 622-325.\n\n1222.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision was correctly based on two premises:1095\n\n- First, that under Colombian law, the exploitation of non-renewable natural resources cannot be dissociated from the royalties that the private contractor has to pay to the State as consideration; this is why the *Contralor\u00eda* found that Prodeco was a fiscal manager of public goods;\n\n- Second, that the *Contralor\u00eda* may initiate Fiscal Liability Proceeding against anyone who directly causes or contributes to damage to the public patrimony of the State; this is why the *Contralor\u00eda* made a reasoned judgement and concluded that it has jurisdiction over Prodeco.\n\nR I, paras. 428-431; R II, paras. 626-628.\n\n1223.\n\nRespondent submits that even if it were true (which it is not) that Prodeco had no \"decision-making power\" over royalties and compensation, the *Contralor\u00eda* would nevertheless have had jurisdiction. Its jurisdiction extends not only to those who exercise *\"gesti\u00f3n fiscal\"* but also to those who contribute to harming to the public patrimony of the State *\"con ocasi\u00f3n de la gesti\u00f3n fiscal\"*.1096\n\nR I, paras. 425-427; R II, para. 630; HT, Day 2, p. 512, l. 20 - p. 513, l. 18.\n\n1224.\n\nRespondent says that, in any event, according to the *ECE* tribunal, it is not the role of an international tribunal to sit on appeal against the legal correctness or substantive reasonableness of individual administrative acts.1097\n\nR I, para. 424; R II, para. 628, referring to *ECE,* para. 4,764.\n\nProcedure for Contractual Annulment was an Ordinary Measure\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1225.\n\nRespondent argues that a state action before the courts to nullify a state contract is equally foreseeable in Colombian legislation and practice. The Procedure for Contractual Annulment involved ordinary legal recourse to the courts to review state contracts and so could not be contrary to Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.1098\n\nR I, para. 433; R II, para. 632.\n\n1226.\n\nAbsent actions tantamount to denial of justice, it is no breach of FET to submit a contract for nullification, as follows from the *Azinian* tribunal\u2019s conclusions.1099 According to Respondent, this is simply the application of the general principle that domestic courts are competent to decide on questions of domestic law, absent a denial of justice.1100\n\nR I, para. 434; R II, para. 633 referring to *Azinian,* para. 100; and to *Alghanim & Sons,* para. 350; HT, Day 2, p. 525, l. 10 - p. 526, l. 1.\n\nR I, para. 435; R II, para. 634, referring to *OI European,* para. 491 and *Eli Lilly and Co.,* para. 224.\n\n1227.\n\nIn any event, Respondent argues that the Procedure for Contractual Annulment could be expected under Colombian law and therefore could not breach Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations. Claimants do not deny that Colombian law, as most legal systems do, provides for the absolute nullity of a contract that is found to be contrary to mandatory law; and it permits the counterparty to a contract, whether the State or the private individual, to seek a declaration of its absolute nullity before the courts.1101\n\nR I, para. 433; R II, paras. 636-637.\n\n1228.\n\nRespondent submits that pursuant to the Colombian Code of Administrative Procedure, either party to a state contract (such as the Mining Contract) is expressly entitled to request a declaration of its absolute nullity. And Claimants have failed to deny that the Eighth Amendment would be null if it was contrary to Art. 84 of the 1988 Mining Code, which provides for equitable remuneration in exchange for mining rights.1102\n\nR I, para. 437-439; R II, para. 638; HT, Day 2, p. 525, ll. 2-9.\n\n1229.\n\nFinally, Respondent notes that only after the State Mining Agency sought conciliation of the controversy did it initiate its actions before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca.* The decision was taken after the Mining Agency was informed by the *Contralor\u00eda* that the Eighth Amendment had reduced the income under the Mining Contract and that the necessary studies had not been performed.1103\n\nR II, para. 639.\n\n1230.\n\nIn sum, Respondent says that there is no substance to the complaint that either the Fiscal Liability Proceeding or the Procedure for Contractual Annulment breached Claimants\u2019 alleged legitimate expectations.1104\n\nR I, para. 442; R II, paras. 631 and 640.\n\n**(2) Colombia Took Ordinary Legal, Regulatory and Control Measures**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1231.\n\nRespondent also contests Claimants\u2019 allegations of arbitrariness, unreasonableness, or non-transparent conduct.\n\n**A. The** ***Contralor\u00eda's*** **Decision was Consistent, Predictable, and Transparent**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1232.\n\nPreliminarily, Respondent reiterates its position that Claimants\u2019 arguments that the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision was inconsistent, unpredictable, and non-transparent are inadmissible because they were advanced in an untimely manner. But even if Claimants\u2019 belated arguments were admissible, Respondent considers that they should be unsuccessful.1105\n\nR II, paras. 644-645.\n\n1233.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the enforcement of the existing legal and regulatory framework can be inconsistent, unpredictable, and non-transparent only when it is arbitrary and unreasonable.1106 Respondent points out that Claimants are unable to define, much less to prove, when an ordinary enforcement measure is inconsistent, unpredictable, or non-transparent. In each of the cases cited by Claimants *(Lemire, MTD, Crystallex)* the enforcement actions were found to be inconsistent, non-predictable, and non-transparent only because the actions had been arbitrary or unreasonable.1107\n\nR II, para. 645.\n\nR II, paras. 649-650.\n\n1234.\n\nRespondent explains that the *UAB* tribunal recently held that actions to enforce laws and regulations do not violate the requirements of stability and predictability.1108 Similarly, Respondent maintains that as the *Unglaube* tribunal concluded, investment tribunals should defer to state measures taken in furtherance of valid public policies, in the present case expressed in the legal and regulatory framework.1109\n\nR II, para. 647, referring to *UAB,* para. 836.\n\nR I, para. 477; R II, para. 648, referring to *Unglaube,* para. 246.\n\n1235.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants have left unaddressed and unrebutted Colombia\u2019s actual positions, having instead relied on an inaccurate account of Colombia\u2019s position:1110\n\n- Colombia\u2019s position is that, whenever an ordinary enforcement action is consistent with the legal and regulatory framework, it is consistent, predictable, and transparent;\n\n- Contrary to what Claimants say, Colombia does not try to justify failure to perform the Treaty; instead, it argues that the Treaty does not and cannot require a State to refrain from enforcement actions consistent with its legal and regulatory framework (unless arbitrary or unreasonable);\n\n- Colombia does not argue that the FET standard includes only protections against arbitrary actions; it argues that consistency, predictability, and transparency standards, when applied to state enforcement actions, do not and cannot require more than reasonable and non-arbitrary conduct.\n\nR II, para. 651.\n\n1236.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the relevant test to determine whether the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision was predictable and consistent is to determine whether it acted in accord with the applicable legal and regulatory framework. And Respondent says it did. The fact that the *Contralor\u00eda* may have reached a different conclusion from other state authorities and based this decision on criteria of fiscal control is no indication of wrongdoing. It simply means that the *Contralor\u00eda* was doing its job.1111\n\nR I, paras. 449-452; R II, paras. 653-654.\n\n1237.\n\nRespondent notes, in addition, that the officials from Ingeominas never represented that the *Contralor\u00eda* would refrain from reviewing the Eighth Amendment pursuant to its criteria for fiscal review.1112 This review was entirely predictable (as well as coherent, consistent, and transparent) given the Colombian legal and regulatory framework. Given that Prodeco\u2019s actions caused illicit harm to state income, it was predictable that it would be subject to Fiscal Liability Proceeding.1113\n\nR II, para. 655.\n\nR II, para. 656.\n\n1238.\n\nRespondent submits that it was also predictable that the *Contralor\u00eda* would evaluate the Eighth Amendment as it did. The Colombian legal framework permitted the *Contralor\u00eda* to analyse the economic effects of the Transition Period under the Eighth Amendment. Prodeco failed to prove an expansion of the Mine and consequent higher revenues. Nor had Ingeominas prepared a prior viability report on the potential future benefits from the Eighth Amendment, leaving it unestablished whether production levels would, in fact, increase, as Prodeco claimed.1114\n\nR II, paras. 657-658.\n\n1239.\n\nAs to the lack of pursuit of officers by the Mining Agency, Respondent argues that this is irrelevant. The *Contralor\u00eda* held some of Ingeominas\u2019 decision-makers fiscally liable. And the Prosecutor, without questioning the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision, concluded that the facts underlying the fiscal liability did not rise to the level of criminal action (although he did not have access to the Disputed Documents).1115\n\nR II, para. 659.\n\n1240.\n\nIn sum, Respondent argues that the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision was consistent, predictable, and transparent with the legal and regulatory framework and the actions of other state entities.\n\n**B. The** ***Contralor\u00eda*****'*****s*** **Decision was Transparent, Non-Arbitrary, Reasonable and Afforded Due Process**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1241.\n\nRespondent contends that the standard for demonstrating arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious conduct is a very high one, requiring a demonstration of conduct that shocks or surprises a sense of judicial propriety, as is clear from the conclusions of the *Crystallex* tribunal.1116\n\nR I, para. 447; R II, paras. 661-662, referring to *Crystallex,* para. 577; HT, Day 2, p. 514, l. 19 - p. 515, l. 8.\n\n1242.\n\nRespondent also points to the *Lemire* decision, in which that tribunal found that an arbitrary action substitutes \"prejudice, preference or bias\" \"for the rule of law\". And put together, an action is arbitrary or unreasonable if its prejudice, preference or bias shocks or surprises a sense of juridical propriety.1117\n\nR I, paras. 446-447; HT, Day 2, p. 515, ll. 9-14.\n\n1243.\n\nAccording to Respondent, it is difficult to discharge the burden of proving this. Arbitrariness is especially difficult to prove when, as observed by the *Cargill* tribunal,1118 it requires the second-guessing of state legal, regulatory, or control measures. Respondent says that the recent *Cervin* award further confirms that an application of the national normative framework is arbitrary only if it constitutes a deliberate repudiation of that framework, and even then, only if there are no domestic means available to correct that application.1119\n\nR I, para. 460; R II, para. 663, referring to *Cargill,* para. 292; see also, HT, Day 2, p. 515, l. 20 - p. 516, l. 5.\n\nR II, para. 664, referring to *Cervin,* para. 527.\n\n1244.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants had an obligation to prove prejudice, preference or bias that shocks or surprises a sense of judicial propriety, in order to determine that Respondent\u2019s conduct was arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious. Yet, Claimants failed to do so. By any standard, the Fiscal Liability Proceeding were transparent, reasonable, and non-arbitrary.1120\n\nR II, paras. 665-669.\n\n1245.\n\nFirst, Claimants argue that Colombia unilaterally withdrew the undertakings and assurances it had given Claimants to incentivize an investment in the Mine. This is nothing more than a repackaging of Claimants\u2019 arguments on legitimate expectations. As the Fiscal Liability Proceeding did not breach any such legitimate expectations, they were not unreasonable.1121\n\nR II, paras. 671-672.\n\n1246.\n\nSecond*,* Respondent submits that it is false that the *Contralor\u00eda* did not act based on legal standards, but instead relied on its own discretion. Prodeco\u2019s conduct with respect to the Eighth Amendment was within the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s jurisdiction. In addition, Respondent argues that the *Contralor\u00eda* was legally permitted to focus its analysis on the economic effects of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Transition Period. The economic terms for the Transition Period were not supported by any legal or economic justification. The appropriateness of relying on this period is confirmed by the fact that Prodeco did not provide evidence of a significant expansion of the Mine.1122 In any event, the Tribunal cannot second-guess the economic reasoning of the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision.1123\n\nR I, paras. 459-463; R II, paras. 673-675.\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 517, ll. 5-11.\n\n1247.\n\nThird, Respondent finds that Claimants wrongly alleges that the *Contralor\u00eda* failed to base its actions on reasoned judgement. This argument should be dismissed because it is untimely. In any event, it is frivolous. The Fiscal Liability Proceeding concluded after a four-year proceeding that generated a record that is 4349 pages long. The *Contralor\u00eda* issued several reasoned evidentiary decisions. The *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision was a 234-page document, with detailed and careful factual and legal analysis. Claimants do not dispute that the *Contralor\u00eda* did provide reasoning; they seem simply to disagree with the substance of that reasoning.1124\n\nR II, paras. 676-678; HT, Day 2, p. 516, l. 11 - p. 517, l. 4.\n\n1248.\n\nFourth, Claimants\u2019 allegation that the *Contralor\u00eda* was biased for its refusal to hear witness evidence, or that it reached conclusions before issuing the Decision, is unavailing. The *Contralor\u00eda* did not breach international or domestic norms when it excluded some of Prodeco\u2019s proposed evidence on a reasoned basis and in accordance with applicable evidentiary rules. The Colombian Supreme Court ultimately upheld all of the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s evidentiary determinations.1125\n\nR II, paras. 679-682.\n\n1249.\n\nEven if the *Contralor\u00eda* had formed preliminary views at the time of its evidentiary decision, it hardly follows that it was biased or prejudged the matter. According to Respondent, it is normal for an adjudicator to form preliminary views during the course of a proceeding, especially when such proceeding lasts for three years.1126\n\nR II, para. 684.\n\n1250.\n\nFinally, Respondent notes that Prodeco was not held liable for failure to act as the Colombian state\u2019s supervisor, but for its own conduct in negotiating the Eighth Amendment.1127\n\nR I, paras. 455-458; R II, para. 685.\n\n1251.\n\nRespondent also notes that in the Reply, Claimants seem to have abandoned their argument in the Memorial that the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision was made in bad faith because it \"required Prodeco to pay the Fiscal Liability Amount [...] in order to avoid the forfeiture of the Mining Contract as a whole\". Having abandoned this argument, Claimants should not be permitted to resuscitate it in the future.1128\n\nR II, para. 680. See also R I, paras. 464-469.\n\n**C. The Procedure for Contractual Annulment is Consistent, Predictable and Transparent**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1252.\n\nRespondent claims that it is no breach of the applicable FET standard for a state to submit a contract to its courts for review and possible annulment, unless such an ordinary action were arbitrary or unreasonable.1129 Respondent argues that none of the Claimants\u2019 allegations about the Procedure for Contractual Annulment can succeed.\n\nR I, para. 472; R II, paras. 687-688; HT, Day 2, p. 524, ll. 7-21.\n\n1253.\n\nFirst, Respondent notes that the core of Claimants\u2019 complaint is that the Mining Agency entered into the Eighth Amendment and then subsequently sought to have it annulled. This is nothing else than a restatement that the Mining Agency violated Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.1130\n\nR II, para. 689.\n\n1254.\n\nIn any event, the mere fact of concluding a contract cannot make it unfair and inequitable to subsequently seek annulment of that contract, especially for a counterparty that discovers a ground for nullity. The same applies to state contracts. The Colombian legislation allows state contracts to be submitted to the courts for review and possible annulment.1131\n\nR I, para. 481; R II, paras. 690-693.\n\n1255.\n\nIn addition, Respondent argues that there was a fundamental change of circumstances between the moment when the Eighth Amendment was concluded and when the Mining Agency submitted it to the courts for annulment: the *Contralor\u00eda* had commenced its Fiscal Liability Proceeding, and found that there was a harm to the state income. It was on this basis that the Mining Agency challenged the validity of the Amendment.1132\n\nR I, paras. 473-475; R II, para. 693.\n\n1256.\n\nSecond, Claimants\u2019 allegations that the Mining Agency failed to base its actions on a reasoned judgement should also be dismissed. The Mining Agency based its decision on evidence from the *Contralor\u00eda* that the Eighth Amendment had reduced state income and had not been subject to proper economic and technical studies.1133\n\nR II, paras. 695-697 and 702-703; HT, Day 2, p. 527, ll. 2-22.\n\n1257.\n\nThird, Respondent contests Claimants\u2019 argument that the Mining Agency failed to consult with Prodeco prior to submitting the Eighth Amendment to the courts for annulment. The Mining Agency had no obligation to consult Prodeco. The *Swisslion* tribunal considered that the failure to engage the investor in and of itself was not sufficient to constitute a breach of FET.1134\n\nR II, paras. 698-699, referring to *Swisslion,* para. 291.\n\n1258.\n\nIn any event, the Mining Agency commenced a formal conciliation procedure before the *Procuradur\u00eda.* During this procedure, the parties met to discuss a settlement, but to no avail.1135\n\nR II, paras. 700-701.\n\n1259.\n\nIn sum, Respondent argues that the actions of the State Mining Agency were entirely reasonable under the circumstances.1136\n\nR II, para. 705.\n\n(3) **The Fiscal Liability Proceeding Respected Due Process**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1260.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants allege that the *Contralor\u00eda* conducted the Fiscal Liability Proceeding without according due process to Claimants, because of its treatment of evidence, the inclusion of civil servants in the proceedings and its bias. According to Respondent, none of these allegations make out a breach of international due process.1137\n\nR II, paras. 706-707.\n\n1261.\n\nRespondent says that the international due process standard is clear: FET is breached only by a \"manifest disrespect of due process that [...] offend[s] a sense of judicial propriety\".1138 Respondent submits that the high standard applies whether or not reference is made to denial of justice.1139\n\nR I, para. 484; R II, para. 707, referring to *Arif,* para. 447; HT, Day 2, p. 518, ll. 6-11.\n\nR II, para. 712, referring to *Jan de Nul,* para. 187; *Cervin,* para. 655; *Deutsche Bank,* para. 420; *Tokios Tokeles,* para. 133.\n\n1262.\n\nRespondent further argues that it is particularly difficult for administrative proceedings to breach the due process standard. According to Respondent, Claimants have not been able to deny this proposition.1140 Respondent submits that it is perfectly logical that administrative due process is less demanding than judicial due process, since administrative proceedings are designed to be more agile and efficient and are typically subject to subsequent review by courts. This was confirmed by the *Thunderbird* tribunal,1141 cited with approval by the *Cervin, Philip Morris,* and *Convial Callao* tribunals.1142\n\nR I, para. 485; R II, paras. 713-714.\n\nR II, para. 715, referring to *Thunderbird,* para. 200; HT, Day 2, p. 518, ll. 12-22.\n\nR II, para. 715, referring to *Cervin,* para. 655; *Philip Morris,* para. 569; *Convial Callao,* fn. 427.\n\n1263.\n\nIn addition, Respondent notes that Claimants have appealed the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision and are actively pursuing its annulment before the Colombian administrative courts. The Colombian courts are positioned to correct any deviations from Colombian procedural norms applicable to the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.1143\n\nR II, para. 717; HT, Day 2, p. 519, ll. 1-14.\n\n**A. No Breach of Due Process for Rejecting Evidence**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1264.\n\nRespondent finds that Claimants\u2019 argument, according to which the *Contralor\u00eda* breached due process because it did not allow Prodeco to submit additional evidence, is false.1144\n\nR II, para. 720.\n\n1265.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants had extensive opportunities to present evidence and question witnesses during the four years of the proceeding, and that they took advantage of these opportunities. According to Respondent, the applicable standard requires that Claimants demonstrate a complete lack of any opportunity to present evidence or to question witnesses, or otherwise a severe bias, and Claimants have failed to demonstrate any of these elements of breach.1145\n\nR I, paras. 488 and 490; R II, paras. 720-723; HT, Day 2, p. 520, ll. 3-12.\n\n1266.\n\nEven cases invoked by Claimants *(Deutsche Bank, Metalclad, Tecmed)* found that due process was only breached when there was a complete lack of opportunity to be heard.1146\n\nR I, para. 489; R II, para. 723, referring to *Deutsche Bank,* para. 478; *Metalclad,* para. 91; *Tecmed,* para. 162.\n\n1267.\n\nIn sum, the administrative due process standard is breached only when there is a complete lack of any opportunity to present evidence or question witnesses. Respondent submits that it granted Claimants extensive opportunities to argue, to present evidence, and even to challenge the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision over the course of a multiyear process:1147\n\n- Prodeco made at least seven distinct written submissions (and multiple oral submissions) to the *Contralor\u00eda* during the Fiscal Liability Proceeding; at least four of these were made after the *Contralor\u00eda* filed formal charges on August 2013;\n\n- Prodeco submitted extensive evidence into the record of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, including witness testimony, expert reports, and technical opinions.\n\nR I, paras. 490-491; R II, paras. 725-726; HT, Day 2, p. 520, l. 21 - p. 521, l. 5.\n\n1268.\n\nAs to Claimants\u2019 complaint that the *Contralor\u00eda* did not admit into the record a handful of additional pieces of evidence, Respondent notes that the *Contralor\u00eda* admitted Claimants\u2019 proffered testimony from Ms. Natalia Amaya and declined to admit the rest of the new evidence in an extensively reasoned decision from 2014. These reasons included that the requests were legally impermissible, lacked legal basis, or were manifestly superfluous. In any event, Respondent finds that for an administrative adjudication to reject some, but not all, evidentiary submissions in a reasoned decision, does not violate international law.1148\n\nR I, paras. 492-494; R II, para. 728.\n\n1269.\n\nRespondent further notes that, at Prodeco\u2019s request, the Colombian Supreme Court reviewed and upheld the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* reasoned decision on evidence, finding that Prodeco had been granted a proper opportunity to present evidence. The Supreme Court\u2019s judgment definitively establishes that the *Contralor\u00eda's* evidentiary decision was legal and correct under Colombian law. It also definitively buries Claimants\u2019 allegation of violation of due process.1149\n\nR I, para. 495; R II, paras. 731-733; HT, Day 2, p. 521, ll. 6-15.\n\n1270.\n\nFinally, Respondent avers that Claimants\u2019 reliance on the so-called *Contralor\u00eda's* Evidence Manual is unavailing, since this manual did not even exist at the time of the *Contralor\u00eda's* evidentiary determination (and was rejected as legally erroneous shortly after its enactment).1150\n\nR II, paras. 729-730.\n\n**B. No breach of Due Process for Joining Public Servants to the Proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1271.\n\nRespondent argues that it is untrue that due process was breached by the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s decision to join four civil servants as defendants in the proceeding and to attach their assets.1151\n\nR II, paras. 734-735.\n\n1272.\n\nRespondent explains that the initial statements of the Ingeominas\u2019 officials were ordered at the request of Mr. Ceballos, who was a defendant in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding. During these statements, the officials made extensive reference to the Viability Report as justification for the conclusion of the Eighth Amendment. These four officials were subsequently joined to the Proceeding because they had authored the Viability Report. Indeed, the *Contralor\u00eda* determined that the Viability Report contained a poor and unsubstantiated feasibility analysis, referred to no other official documents for support, and contradicted prior reports that recommended against accepting the Eighth Amendment. All this indicated that the officials had possibly contributed to patrimonial harm to Colombia, which was sufficient to satisfy the standard under Colombian law to join them as defendants in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.1152\n\nR II, paras. 735-736; HT, Day 2, p. 522, ll. 3-9.\n\n1273.\n\nRespondent submits that the mere fact of consolidating proceedings does not breach the international due-process standard.1153 Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2019 additional arguments should also be dismissed:\n\n- Contrary to Claimants\u2019 assertions, the *Contralor\u00eda* did not fail to ask questions to seek the truth regarding the officials\u2019 testimonies; Law 610 of 2000 requires that anyone potentially subject to fiscal liability must be permitted to provide a *\"libre y espont\u00e1nea\"* declaration, which is what the *Contralor\u00eda* allowed them to do;1154\n\n- Before this arbitration, Claimants had never argued that the *Contralor\u00eda* relied only on unsworn statements which were prejudicial for Prodeco;\n\n- In any event, the *Contralor\u00eda* did not base its decision to hold Prodeco liable on the statements of the Ingeominas\u2019 officers, but rather on extensive documentary evidence; the statement of Ms. Aristizabal, for instance, is not once mentioned in the section of the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision on Prodeco\u2019s liability; as to the limited references in the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision to the other three officials\u2019 statements, these were not the basis of the decision.1155\n\nR II, para. 737; HT, Day 2, p. 521, l. 16 - p. 522, l. 2.\n\nR II, paras. 739-740.\n\nR I, paras. 500-501; R II, paras. 741-743.\n\n1274.\n\nRespondent concludes that Claimants\u2019 allegations concerning the *Contralor\u00eda's* treatment of evidence lack merit.1156\n\nR II, para. 744.\n\n**C. Absence of Bias**\n----------------------\n\n1275.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants allege that the Fiscal Liability Proceeding were carried out \"in a partial and non-transparent manner\" and \"in bad faith in order to reach its desired result [...]\". Respondent considers that Claimants appear to be saying that the Fiscal Liability Proceeding breached due process as a result of bias.1157\n\nR II, para. 745.\n\n1276.\n\nColombia explains that \"severe bias is necessary to breach the due process strand of the FET clause\" and Claimants have failed to show any bias at all, much less severe bias.1158\n\nR I, paras. 498-504; R II, paras. 746-747, referring to *Deutsche Bank, Metalclad,* and *Tecmed.*\n\n1277.\n\nRespondent contends that it is impossible to infer any bias from the *Contralor\u00eda's* actions: the *Contralor\u00eda* exercised jurisdiction over Prodeco in accordance with Colombian law principles, conducted the Proceeding consistently with both international and domestic procedural norms, and determined in a reasoned decision applying the relevant law and regulations that the Transition Period of the Eighth Amendment was unlawful. There is no bias in these ordinary and legal actions.1159\n\nR II, para. 748.\n\n1278.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants\u2019 primary argument for bias is that the Fiscal Liability Proceeding were in such gross violation of Colombian law that it could not be explained except by a conspiracy to \"get\" Prodeco. Yet, Claimants have failed to satisfy their burden of proof in respect of this contention.1160\n\nR II, para. 750.\n\n1279.\n\nRespondent finds that Claimants\u2019 accusations against Ms. Morelli and Ms. Vargas are devoid of any substance; the only evidence to which Claimants point is the other alleged breaches of due process that the *Contralor\u00eda* supposedly committed.1161 Respondent avers that Claimants\u2019 made-for-arbitration argument that the Fiscal Liability Proceeding was in fact a conspiracy against them by Ms. Morelli and Ms. Vargas makes no sense:1162\n\n- Ms. Morelli is a prominent and respected Colombian lawyer who has also sat as an arbitrator in three different ICSID proceedings; Ms. Vargas is an accomplished lawyer and public servant in her own right;\n\n- Ms. Morelli was not even working at the *Contralor\u00eda* when the *Contralor\u00eda* Decision was issued on 30 April 2015;\n\n- Ms. Vargas had not yet become involved in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding at the time when the Ingeominas\u2019 civil servants were joined to the Proceeding;\n\n- Ms. Morelli\u2019s declarations in December 2013 prove nothing; by that time, the *Contralor\u00eda* had already issued formal charges against Prodeco.\n\nR II, para. 749.\n\nR II, paras. 751-755; HT, Day 2, p. 522, l. 10 - p. 523, l. 8.\n\n1280.\n\nRespondent submits that, in any event, false conspiracy theories cannot satisfy the international standard for a due process breach, which is very high.1163\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 518, ll. 4-6.\n\n1281.\n\nIn sum, Respondent submits that Claimants have concocted a conspiracy against them in order to give a modicum of plausibility to their claims of bias. But the conspiracy theory is implausible and no breach of due process can be found on this basis.1164\n\nR II, para. 756.\n\n**VI.3. DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1282.\n\nClaimants argue that Colombia breached its international law obligations assumed under Arts. 4 (1) and 4(2) of the Treaty by adopting two measures:\n\n- the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, instituted by the *Contralor\u00eda* and resolved in the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision, which declared that Prodeco, by executing the Eighth Amendment, had incurred fiscal liability, and\n\n- the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, filed by SGC/ANM (Ingeominas' successors) against Prodeco with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca,* seeking annulment of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n1283.\n\nThe Republic denies any wrongdoing.\n\n1284.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider Respondent's procedural objections **(1)** and then will devote separate subchapters to the alleged responsibility of Colombia resulting from the actions of the *Contralor\u00eda***(2)** and those of the SGC/ANM **(3)**.\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Procedural Objections**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1285.\n\nRespondent argues that in the Reply Claimants rewrote \"the claims previously presented\"1165.\n\nR II, para. 584.\n\n1286.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants introduced the following untimely new allegations:\n\n- The claim that the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision was inconsistent, unpredictable, and non-transparent;\n\n- The claim that the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision unreasonably withdrew the undertakings and assurances Claimants had received;\n\n- The claim that the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision was not reasoned; and\n\n- The factual allegation that Mr. Paredes did not consult with Prodeco before initiating the Mining Agency Proceedings.\n\n1287.\n\nRespondent further argues that those new claims are inadmissible, because ICSID Rule 31 establishes that the proper time to make allegations of fact and law is in the Memorial. Claimants' new allegations are untimely and must be disregarded pursuant to ICSID Rule 26(3). Failure to do so would be contrary to Colombia's rights to have two opportunities to respond with evidence.1166\n\nR II, paras. 585-586.\n\n1288.\n\nRespondent also argues that all of Claimants' allegations from the Memorial that Claimants chose not to defend in the Reply must also be rejected, since it would be contrary to Colombia\u2019s procedural rights if Claimants were now allowed to introduce further arguments in defence of these claims, following their failure to do so in the Reply.1167\n\nR II, para. 587.\n\nICSID Rules\n-----------\n\n1289.\n\nICSID Rule 31 establishes the content of the parties\u2019 main pleadings:\n\n\"**Rule 31- The Written Procedure**\n\n\"(1) In addition to the request for arbitration, the written procedure shall consist of the following pleadings, filed within time limits set by the Tribunal:\n\n(a) a memorial by the requesting party;\n\n(b) a counter-memorial by the other party;\n\nand, if the parties so agree or the Tribunal deems it necessary:\n\n(c) a reply by the requesting party; and\n\n(d) a rejoinder by the other party.\n\n[...]\n\n(3) A memorial shall contain: a statement of the relevant facts; a statement of law; and the submissions. A counter-memorial, reply or rejoinder shall contain an admission or denial of the facts stated in the last previous pleading; any additional facts, if necessary; observations concerning the statement of law in the last previous pleading; a statement of law in answer thereto; and the submissions\".\n\n1290.\n\nAnd ICSID Rule 26(3) provides as follows:\n\n\"**Rule 26 - Time Limits**\n\n[...]\n\n(3) Any step taken after expiration of the applicable time limit shall be disregarded unless the Tribunal, in special circumstances and after giving the other party an opportunity of stating its views, decides otherwise\".\n\n1291.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties agreed on the presentation of two rounds of pleadings.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n1292.\n\nRespondent\u2019s objection is dismissed for being totally devoid of merit.\n\n1293.\n\nThe objection is presented in a confusing manner: Respondent first complained that in the Reply Claimants submitted new claims, but later appeared to limit its complaint to Claimants\u2019 introduction of new legal and factual allegations.\n\n1294.\n\nFirst, Respondent says that in their Reply Claimants introduced new claims with regard to FET and impairment.\n\n1295.\n\nThat is not so: Claimants\u2019 claims with regard to FET and impairment in the Memorial and in the Reply are identical.1168 There is also no indication that Claimants have abandoned any claim.\n\nC I, para. 310 and C II para. 375; there is no difference regarding the merits claims; differences relate to the amounts of compensation claimed and the applicable interest rate.\n\n1296.\n\nIn a surprising contradiction, Respondent itself admits in the Rejoinder (the same document in which the procedural objection is argued) that in their essence Claimants\u2019 claims have not changed between Memorial and Reply:1169\n\n\"The heart of Claimants\u2019 case in the Reply remains the same as it was in the Memorial. Claimants complain that Colombia breached FET and impairment clauses of the Treaty because it failed to refrain from enforcing its legal and regulatory framework in the ordinary manner.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nR II, para. 581.\n\n1297.\n\nSecond, Respondent additionally submits that Claimants introduced in their Reply three legal allegation and one factual allegation, which (Respondent says) are new, thus breaching ICSID Rule 31(3).\n\n1298.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees.\n\n1299.\n\nEven if the four allegations were new, as Respondent submits, the introduction of those allegations in Claimants\u2019 Reply would not constitute a breach of ICSID Rule 31(3).\n\n1300.\n\nICSID Rule 31(3) defines on broad terms the content of a reply memorial. The Rule provides that a reply \"shall contain\":\n\n- an admission or denial of the facts stated in the last previous pleading,\n\n- any additional facts,\n\n- observations on the statement of law in the last previous pleading,\n\n- statements of law in answer thereto, and\n\n- submissions.\n\n1301.\n\nThe three legal and one factual allegation impugned by Respondent fit within the scope of a reply memorial, as authorized by ICSID Rule 31(3),\n\n- because the legal allegations constitute \"observations concerning the statement of law\" in Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, or \"statement of law\" in answer to Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, and\n\n- because the factual allegation fits within the category of \"additional facts\".\n\n**(2) The Alleged Responsibility of Colombia Arising out of Conduct of the** ***Contralor\u00eda***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1302.\n\nClaimants argue that the *Contralor\u00eda* treated Claimants\u2019 investment unfairly and inequitably, in violation of the FET standard, and impaired such investment through unreasonable measures, resulting in a breach by Colombia of its obligations under Arts. 4(1) and (2) of the Treaty.1170\n\nC I, para. 187.\n\n1303.\n\nArt. 4(1) of the Treaty requires Colombia to refrain from impairing the management, use, enjoyment and expansion of Claimants\u2019 investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures:1171\n\n\"Each Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and, should it so happen, liquidation of such investments\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-6, Art. 4(1).\n\n1304.\n\nArt. 4(2) imposes a second obligation. Colombia must accord fair and equitable treatment [already defined as \"FET\"] within its territory to the investments of Swiss investors:1172\n\n\"Each Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory of the investments of investors of the other Party. [...].\"\n\nDoc. C-6, Art. 4(2).\n\n1305.\n\nArt. 4(2) provides an additional rule: the FET treatment must not be less favourable than the treatment granted to investments made by Colombian investors, or by investors of the most favoured nation, if this latter treatment is more favourable. Since Claimants do not allege a violation of this rule, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to discuss it further.\n\n1306.\n\nThe Tribunal will separately analyse the claims that, through the conduct of the *Contralor\u00eda,* Respondent breached the FET obligation imposed by Art. 4(2) **(2.1)** and adopted unreasonable measures in violation of Art. 4(1) **(2.2)**.\n\n**(2.1) Breach of the FET Standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n1307.\n\nArt. 4 of the Treaty is headed \"Protection and treatment\". Paragraph (2) of Art. 4 simply says that each State party \"shall ensure fair and equitable treatment\" to protected investments.\n\n1308.\n\nAbsent any further guidance from the Treaty itself, it is generally accepted that the obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment (FET) contained in a treaty is a requirement that host States abide by a certain standard of conduct *vis-\u00e0-vis* protected investors. The fair and equitable standard is a legal concept which, though typically not further defined, has a content that can be established by the rules of interpretation of the VCLT, aided by the jurisprudence of international tribunals. A host State breaches such minimum standard and incurs international responsibility if its actions (or in certain circumstances omissions) violate certain thresholds of propriety or contravene basic requirements of the rule of law, causing harm to the investor.1173\n\n*Rusoro,* para. 523; *Glamis,* para. 616; *OI European,* para. 491.\n\n1309.\n\nThe obligation to provide FET binds the State, and accordingly can be breached by the conduct of any branch of government. In principle, then, the FET standard *can* be breached *inter alia*\n\n- By the executive or administrative branch or its separate agencies, by means of administrative acts that directly target the investor or the investment;\n\n- By the State\u2019s judicial system, as a whole, when it commits a denial of justice; or\n\n- By legislation or regulation of general application which modifies the applicable legal framework to the detriment of the investor or the investment.\n\n1310.\n\nThe threshold of propriety required by FET must be determined by the tribunal in light of all the relevant circumstances of the case. To this end, the tribunal must carefully analyse and take into consideration all the relevant facts, among them the following factors:\n\n- whether the host State has engaged in harassment, coercion, abuse of power, or other bad-faith conduct against the investor;\n\n- whether the State made specific representations to the investor before the investment was made and then acted contrary to such representations;\n\n- whether the State has respected the principles of due process, consistency, and transparency when adopting the measures at issue;\n\n- whether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal framework, in breach of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n1311.\n\nIn evaluating the State\u2019s conduct, the Tribunal must balance the investor\u2019s right to be protected from improper state conduct against other legally relevant interests and countervailing factors. First among these factors is the principle that legislation and regulation are dynamic, and that (absent a treaty obligation to the contrary) States enjoy a sovereign right to amend their laws and regulations and to adopt new ones in furtherance of public interest, the conception of which can change over time. Other countervailing factors affect the investor: it is the investor\u2019s duty to perform an appropriate pre-investment due diligence review and to observe a proper conduct both before and during the investment.1174\n\n*Rusoro,* para. 525; *Lemire,* para. 285.\n\n1312.\n\nClaimants plead that Colombia, acting through the *Contralor\u00eda,* breached the FET standard in three ways:\n\n- by denying Prodeco due process in the course of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding (**A.**)\n\n- by acting with bias and bad faith (**B.**) and\n\n- by breaching Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations (**C.**).\n\n**A. Due Process**\n------------------\n\n1313.\n\nAs a first line of argumentation, Claimants say that the *Contralor\u00eda's* conduct of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding denied Claimants\u2019 due process:\n\n- First, the *Contralor\u00eda* decided to join four junior civil servants to the Proceedings, then attached their assets, and then agreed to release them once those civil servants had changed their prior sworn witness statements and in their new depositions incriminated Prodeco;\n\n- Second, the *Contralor\u00eda* improperly denied Prodeco the opportunity to submit certain additional evidence in its defence.1175\n\nR II, para. 260.\n\n1314.\n\nRespondent disagrees.\n\n1315.\n\nThe Republic argues that the *Contralor\u00eda* did not flout procedural rules in order to force Ingeominas\u2019 officials to change their testimony against Prodeco:1176 it properly joined the officials to the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and then reasonably released them.1177 Furthermore, to conclude the Prodeco had incurred fiscal liability Dra. Vargas relied on extensive documentary evidence - not on the versions *libres y espont\u00e1neas* of the civil servants.1178\n\nR II, para. 284\n\nR II, para. 302.\n\nR II, para. 272\n\n1316.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 second argument, Respondent says that that the *Contralor\u00eda* excluded some of Prodeco\u2019s requests to adduce further evidence on a reasoned basis and in accordance with applicable evidentiary rules and such exclusions did not breach international law.1179\n\nR II, para. 682.\n\n1317.\n\nThe Tribunal will first analyse whether breaches of due process amount to a violation of the FET standard (**a.**), and then apply the principle to the present factual situation (**b.** and **c.**).\n\n**a. Due Process as a Breach of FET**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1318.\n\nThe rule of law requires that in judicial proceedings (administered by a court of law or a tribunal) and in administrative proceedings (administered by the public administration) due process be respected: the adjudicator, be it a judge, tribunal member, or administrative authority, must give each party a fair opportunity to present its case and to marshal appropriate evidence, and then must assess the submissions and the evidence in a reasoned, even-handed, and unbiased decision.1180\n\nC I, para. 183; *Deutsche Bank,* paras. 476-478; *Metalclad,* paras. 92-93; *Tecmed,* para. 162; *Mondev,* para. 127.\n\n1319.\n\nIt is undisputed that a breach of due process, whether in judicial proceedings or in administrative proceedings, may result in the violation of the FET standard.1181 But the due process standard operates differently in different settings. In administrative proceedings, like those before the *Contralor\u00eda*, the decision-maker is often the investigator, the accuser, and the adjudicator, and a related officer (who may be the senior officer of the decision-maker) is often the one who rules on appeal. Due process does not require strict separation of these functions - provided that the final administrative decision is subject to full judicial review. The private individual must have an opportunity to have the case revisited, this time by an independent and impartial judge, with the guarantee of a formal adversarial procedure.\n\n*Jan de Nul,* para. 187.\n\n1320.\n\nOther investment arbitration tribunals have reached similar conclusions. In *Thunderbird,* the tribunal rejected the proposition that the due process standard necessarily requires a formal adversarial procedure.1182 In *AES,* the tribunal accepted that the due process standard \"is not one of perfection\" and stated that\n\n\"[I]t is only when a state\u2019s acts or procedural omissions are [...] manifestly unfair or unreasonable (such as would shock, or at least surprise a sense of juridical propriety) [...] that the standard can be said to have been infringed.\" **.**1183\n\nC. McLachlan, L. Shore, M. Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles,* 2nd ed., 2017, para. 7,193 (Doc. RL-44). In *Thunderbird* (para. 200) the tribunal reached the conclusion that the due process standard in an administrative process is lower than in a judicial process, an issue that this Tribunal need not reach.\n\n*AES*, para. 9.3.40; C. McLachlan, L. Shore, M. Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles,* 2nd ed., 2017, para. 7,196 (Doc. RL-44).\n\n1321.\n\nClaimants argue that two measures adopted by the *Contralor\u00eda* breached Prodeco's right to due process:\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* decision to join four civil servants to the Proceedings and to attach their assets, in order to force them to change their prior statements (**b.**);\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* decision to deny Prodeco the right to submit additional evidence after Prodeco's formal indictment (**c.**).1184\n\nR II, para. 260.\n\n**b. The** ***Contralor\u00eda's*** **Behaviour vis-\u00e0-vis Four Civil Servants**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Proven Facts\n----------------\n\n1322.\n\nThe facts can be summarized as follows:\n\n1323.\n\nOn 11 July 2012, the *Contralor\u00eda* took the decision to extend the investigation not only to the former Minister of Mines and to the former Director of Ingeominas, but also to four junior civil servants of Ingeominas (Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal, Ms. Cabezas, Mr. Balcero, and Ms. G\u00f3mez). A few days thereafter, the *Contralor\u00eda* ordered the attachment of the personal assets of each accused person, including the junior civil servants, for the totality of the allegedly outstanding damage - USD 29 M.\n\n1324.\n\nOne year later, between April and May 2013, Dra Vargas, the *Contralora Delegada* who was conducting the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, received the depositions of the four civil servants. Because those individuals were no longer witnesses but defendants in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, under Colombian law they were not required to swear to tell the truth, lest they be placed in a position where they might incriminate themselves - they presented what in Colombian practice is known as a *\"versi\u00f3n libre y espont\u00e1nea\".*\n\n1325.\n\nExcept in the case of Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal, these *versiones libres y espont\u00e1neas* (which have been summarized in section **III.(7)****.G** *supra*) were different, in important respects, from the officials' prior sworn witness declarations, made in the initial phase of the procedure. The *versiones libres y espont\u00e1neas* of Ms. Cabezas, Mr. Balcero, and Ms. G\u00f3mez confirmed that the Viability Report had been prepared after the signature of the Eighth Amendment and in general they incriminated Director Ballesteros.\n\n1326.\n\nIn August 2013, Dra. Vargas issued the *auto de imputaci\u00f3n.* She dismissed the accusation and closed the file with respect to Ms. Cabezas, Mr. Balcero, and Ms. G\u00f3mez, but not with regard to Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal, who was now formally indicted.\n\n1327.\n\nNine months later, in April 2014, Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal made a new deposition before Dra. Vargas, this time also incriminating Director Ballesteros.\n\n1328.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision was issued in 2015. It convicted Director Ballesteros and acquitted Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal.\n\n(ii) Discussion\n---------------\n\n1329.\n\nThe *proceso de responsabilidad fiscal* is a purely inquisitorial procedure, in which the *Contralor\u00eda* investigates the facts and then issues a decision. The inquisitorial character is reinforced by the fact that the same officer - in the present case Dra. Vargas - led the (major part of the) investigation, decided to indict or release individuals, and ordered preliminary attachments of the assets.1185\n\nSee section **III.(7).E** *supra;* Doc. C-18; Doc. C-19; Doc. C-20.\n\n1330.\n\nDra. Vargas indeed made full use of the extensive powers which the law vested in her. But Claimants have failed to prove that she used these powers in a manner to cause a a breach of *Prodeco's* right to due process.\n\n1331.\n\nFirst, the persons affected by Dra. Vargas\u2019 decisions were primarily the four junior civil servants (who suffered the indictment and the attachment of their assets), and Dr. Ballesteros (who was incriminated by the new depositions and eventually was found guilty of fiscal liability) - but not Prodeco. The *Contralor\u00eda* did not support its decision to hold Prodeco fiscally liable on the *versiones libre y espont\u00e1neas* of the four junior civil servants. The *fallo* against Prodeco is based on documentary evidence, not on depositions by witnesses.\n\n1332.\n\nSecond, this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that, in the course of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, Prodeco never voiced concerns about the changes in the successive depositions made by the civil servants.\n\n1333.\n\nIt follows that Prodeco\u2019s due-process rights were not violated by Dra. Vargas\u2019 decision to join the junior civil servants and attach their assets or by the particular treatment given to Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal. The right to be afforded due process, which is a component of the right to be afforded FET under the Treaty, is a personal right of Prodeco. Actions allegedly directed against and causing injury to third parties, even if those parties were co-defendants in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, could not have breached Colombia\u2019s obligations owed to Prodeco under the Treaty.\n\n1334.\n\nThird, the Tribunal additionally considers, by a majority, that Claimants have failed to prove that the *Contralor\u00eda's* conduct regarding the four junior civil servants breached due process.1186 Claimants imply that, after having joined the four junior civil servants to the case, Dra. Vargas offered them a *quid por quo:* if you provide incriminating depositions against Director Ballesteros, the *Contralor\u00eda* will release you.\n\nArbitrator Garibaldi disagrees with the majority\u2019s conclusion on this point and the supporting analysis in paragraphs 1334-1337. In Mr. Garibaldi\u2019s view, once the Tribunal has established that the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s conduct regarding the four junior civil servants did not breach *Prodeco's* due-process rights under the Treaty (paragraph 1333), it is unnecessary and inappropriate for the Tribunal to consider whether such conduct might have breached the applicable due-process standard in the abstract or Prodeco\u2019s due-process rights if the conduct had been directed against or caused harm to Prodeco. In addition, the Tribunal has no competence to determine whether such conduct might have breached the due-process rights of Prodeco\u2019s co-defendants.\n\n1335.\n\nThere are only two indicia in the file which support this allegation:\n\n- The case of Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal: she initially failed to submit an incriminating deposition, was not released with the other three junior civil servants, and was eventually acquitted after having changed her deposition;\n\n- The deposition of Minister Hern\u00e1ndez: he stated under oath that, towards the end of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, he received a phone call from \"Jeswaldo Villeros\", who identified himself as a Director in the *Contralor\u00eda* and who proposed to meet Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez outside of his office; Minister Hern\u00e1ndez added: \"I never wanted to agree to such a meeting, and a week later they found me guilty\".1187\n\nHT, Day 4, p. 1128, ll. 10-17.\n\n1336.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, by majority, the first indication is undermined by the fact that Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal indeed had a more senior role in the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment than her colleagues: it was she who regularly briefed the *Consejo Directivo* of the progress of the negotiations and of Ingeominas\u2019 views.\n\n1337.\n\nAs regards the second indication, the Tribunal agrees that it was highly irregular for a Director of the *Contralor\u00eda* to propose a secret meeting with a former Minister who had been indicted. Testifying under oath, Dra. Vargas denied having any involvement in or knowledge of Mr. Villeros\u2019 telephone call.1188 The meeting in any case never happened, according to the former Minister, and the mere telephone call is insufficient to prove Claimants\u2019 allegation.\n\nHT, Day 5, p. 1359, l. 13 - p. 1360, l. 1.\n\nc. **Denial of Request to Marshal Evidence**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1338.\n\nClaimants say that a second measure by the *Contralor\u00eda* infringed its due-process rights: the denial of a request to marshal additional evidence.\n\n(i) Proven Facts\n----------------\n\n1339.\n\nThe facts can be summarized as follows:\n\n1340.\n\nAfter being indicted, Prodeco requested that some additional evidence be marshalled: a new expert report and the deposition of several witnesses. In a reasoned decision, the *Contralor\u00eda* rejected most of the request, accepting only the deposition of a single witness, with the argument that the new evidence was either superfluous or useless.\n\n1341.\n\nProdeco unsuccessfully challenged the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s decision *en v\u00eda gubernativa* first before the *Contralora Delegada,* and then before the *Contralora General.* Thereafter, Prodeco filed an *acci\u00f3n de tutela* before the Colombian courts, which proved unsuccesful in first instance. Prodeco eventually appealed to the *Corte Suprema,* which reviewed the case and concluded:1189\n\n\"[...] *dentro del proceso de responsabilidad fiscal no se ha vulnerado el derecho al debido proceso y a la defensa de la accionante;\"* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-31, p. 9.\n\n(ii) Discussion\n---------------\n\n1342.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants\u2019 argument.\n\n1343.\n\nThe Tribunal understands Prodeco\u2019s dissatisfaction with the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* stance. The request for the opportunity to submit additional evidence was made at the beginning of 2014, and the final Decision was not issued until April 2015. There would thus have been ample time to depose the witnesses proposed by Prodeco and to analyse the expert report which Prodeco proposed to incorporate. In hindsight, the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* decision unnecessarily limited Prodeco\u2019s right to defend itself.\n\n1344.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal does not see any wilful or otherwise egregious breach of the foreign investor\u2019s due-process rights for which Colombia should assume international responsibility. The *Contralor\u00eda* duly reasoned its decision, the legal system permitted Prodeco to challenge the decision before the courts, which Prodeco did, and there is no allegation that, in finally dismissing Prodeco\u2019s appeals, the Colombian courts committed a denial of justice.\n\n**B. Bias and Bad Faith**\n-------------------------\n\n1345.\n\nClaimants further submit that the *Contralor\u00eda* and Dra. Vargas had made up their minds to find Prodeco fiscally liable and were ready to bend applicable rules to achieve that outcome. In August 2010, immediately after President Santos took office, a new *Contralora General*, Ms. Morelli Rico, was appointed. The new *Contralora* took it upon herself to clean up alleged irregularities in Ingeominas, and reviewed contracts with Drummond, Cerro Matoso, and Prodeco. After excluding the first two, Prodeco was the only mining company remaining within the purview of Ms. Morelli\u2019s initiative. Claimants contend that Ms. Morelli hand-picked Ms. Vargas to run the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and to obtain a conviction of Prodeco.1190\n\nC II, para. 261.\n\n1346.\n\nClaimants invoke a public interview in December 2013, in which Ms. Morelli Rico indicated that she had already prejudged her decision in the Prodeco investigation.\n\n1347.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants\u2019 accusations, labels them evidence-free character assassination, and explains that in the public interview Ms. Morelli simply explained that the *Contralor\u00eda* had already issued charges against Prodeco and that there was at least some evidence of fiscal liability.1191\n\nR II, paras. 751-755.\n\n**a. Bias as a Breach of FET**\n------------------------------\n\n1348.\n\nBias of a decision maker results in a breach of the FET standard.1192 A decision based on prejudice for or against a person or a group cannot be said to be fair and equitable. Case law confirms this conclusion, regardless of whether the biased decision maker is a court or an administrative authority. In *Deutsche Bank*, the Chief Justice acknowledged that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in question had been issued for political motives - and the tribunal found that the FET standard had indeed been breached.1193 In *Metalclad*1194 the bias affected an administrative authority, the Town Council, and was caused by popular opposition to the investor\u2019s hazardous-waste landfill project.\n\nC I, para. 183; R I, para. 498.\n\nDoc. CL-92, para. 479.\n\nDoc. CL-19, para. 92.\n\n1349.\n\nWhile the principle that bias is inconsistent with the FET standard is clear, applying that principle in a particular case is not always easy, because it must be established that the offending decision was substantially based on spurious inclination and prejudice, and not on other (valid) reasons. As in other cases of inherent difficulty in proving facts, the existence and effects of bias can be proved by direct evidence or by reasonable inferences drawn from proven indicia. Claimants base their allegation of bias on the public interview given by the *Contralora General* while the Fiscal Proceeding was underway.\n\n**b. Proven Facts**\n-------------------\n\n1350.\n\nOn 12 December 2013, the *Contralora General,* Ms. Sandra Morelli, gave an interview to the weekly *Semana Sostenible,* which published a report of her activities and quoted several of her statements *verbatim*1195*.* The timing of the interview is relevant: the *Contralor\u00eda* had already issued the *auto de imputaci\u00f3n* against Prodeco, and Prodeco had already filed its defence in October 2013. The final decision of the *Contralora Delegada* was still pending; it would be issued in 2015.\n\nDoc. C-266.\n\n1351.\n\nAnother important consideration is that the decision to be made by the *Contralora Delegada* might be subject to a *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n*, which would be decided by the *Contralora General* herself. Hence it was for Ms. Morelli to have the final say regarding Prodeco\u2019s fiscal liability.\n\n1352.\n\nThe *Semana Sostenible* article refers to a variety of policies and measures adopted by the *Contralor\u00eda.* It devotes a single paragraph to the Prodeco file:1196\n\n*\"asi mismo, encontr\u00f3 que Prodeco, propiedad de Glencore Xstrata International y cuya actividad est\u00e1 basada en el carb\u00f3n, no pagaba efectivamente las regal\u00edas y la suma, de acuerdo con el proceso que est\u00e1 en curso, asciende a cerca de 50 mil millones de pesos. \u00abEl tema es sorprendente, porque lo que hace la empresa es demandar al Estado por cobrar lo que aparentemente debi\u00f3 hab\u00e9rsele pagado. Y digo aparentemente porque hay un principio de prueba, pero esto se definir\u00e1 procesalmente\u00bb, afirma Morelli\"*.\n\nDoc. C-266, p. 2.\n\n1353.\n\nThere is no evidence in the file that Ms. Morelli ever publicly denied the information provided by *Semana Sostenible* or the statements attributed to her.\n\n1354.\n\nThe paragraph quoted from the press article contains three statements attributed to the *Contralora General* :\n\n- A first statement, where the newspaper states Ms. Morelli\u2019s opinion that Prodeco was not properly paying the royalties due under the Mining Contract, in an amount of almost COP 50 billion,\n\n- A second statement, attributed *verbatim* to Ms. Morelli, expressing surprise that Prodeco was suing the state (presumably by filing this investment arbitration),\n\n- A third statement, again literally attributed to her, that there was *\"un principio de prueba*\" against Prodeco, \"*pero esto se definir\u00e1 procesalmente*\".\n\nc. **Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1355.\n\nIt is unfortunate that Ms. Morelli, the highest authority within the *Contralor\u00eda*, saw fit to make a public statement with regard to a file which was still being investigated, and where she would be called upon to make the final decision*.* It is even more unfortunate that she disclosed that Prodeco had failed to pay royalties (in an amount that almost reached COP 50 billion), and that there was *\"un principio de prueba\"\"* against Prodeco. Ms. Morelli did qualify her comments by saying *\"esto se definir\u00e1 procesalmente*\", that is, the matter will be definitively settled in the administrative process.\n\n1356.\n\nRespondent tries to justify Ms. Morelli\u2019s public statement by arguing that the *Contralor\u00eda* had already indicted Prodeco, that there was at least some evidence of fiscal liability, and that Ms. Morelli was stating nothing more.1197\n\nR II, para. 755.\n\n1357.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that an indictment can be issued only if the investigating officer of the *Contralor\u00eda* finds \"*indicios*\" (*i.e.* a \"*principio de prueba*\" or preliminary evidence) of malfeasance. But the existence of preliminary evidence in the file supporting the indictment of Prodeco does not justify Ms. Morelli\u2019s public comments, which reveal not only her knowledge of the file but also her opinion that Prodeco was not properly paying royalties and owed almost COP 50 billion. Since that opinion dealt with the very issue that Ms. Morelli, as the highest authority within the *Contralor\u00eda*, was called upon to adjudicate on appeal, it appears that Ms. Morelli had already made up her mind, without having properly analysed Prodeco\u2019s defences and its arguments on appeal.\n\n1358.\n\nMs. Morelli\u2019s public statements were reprehensible and ill-advised, and if she had indeed ruled on appeal they might have breached the FET standard, but in the end they were inconsequential. In August 2014, Ms. Morelli left office, and was replaced by Mr. Maya as new *Contralor General.*1198 It was Mr. Maya who reviewed and decided Prodeco\u2019s *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n.*\n\nR II, para. 753.\n\n1359.\n\nClaimants have not marshalled any evidence proving that either Ms. Vargas, the *Contralora Delegada* who approved the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision*,* or her superior, the *Contralor General*, Mr. Maya, who dismissed the *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n*, had any bias against Prodeco or otherwise incurred in conduct which can be considered as acting in bad faith.\n\n1360.\n\nFor these reasons, Claimants\u2019 bias claim must be dismissed.\n\n**C. Legitimate Expectations**\n------------------------------\n\n1361.\n\nClaimants argue that the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* decision to initiate and conduct the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, ultimately holding Prodeco fiscally liable, contravened Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations:1199\n\n- First, Colombia did not use its fiscal control powers in conformity with its usual function of supervising fiscal management of state resources, but to nullify, in effect, the commitments made in the Eighth Amendment for the first year;1200\n\n- Second, the *Contralor\u00eda* adopted a decision that was radically incoherent and inconsistent with the conduct of other Colombian authorities, for which there is no precedent, and applied criteria to evaluate the Eighth Amendment different from those considered by Ingeominas when negotiating and concluding the Amendment;1201\n\n- Third, the *Contralor\u00eda* ignored the fact that the Eighth Amendment had enabled the expansion of the Mine, that this expansion had been the basis of the negotiation between the parties, and that in the Eighth Amendment Ingeominas represented to Prodeco that the amendment \"guarantees the interests of the State\".1202\n\nC II, para. 259.\n\nC II, para. 259(a).\n\nC II, para. 259(b).\n\nC II, para. 259(c).\n\n1362.\n\nRespondent says *in limine* that legitimate expectations do not fall within the ordinary meaning of FET.1203\n\nR II, para. 592.\n\n1363.\n\nRespondent then argues that Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations arise directly from the Eighth Amendment and the contractual obligations it allegedly contained; however, contractual expectations are not protected by the FET clause of the Treaty.1204\n\nR II, para. 594.\n\n1364.\n\nColombia adds that Claimants must be presumed to know the contents of the Colombian legal and regulatory system and cannot plead that their legitimate expectations did not take into account the ordinary functioning of that system.1205\n\nR II, para. 614.\n\n1365.\n\nThe Tribunal will first analyse the concept of legitimate expectations in general (**a.**); then it will summarize the legal framework which Colombia applies to administrative contracts in general and mining contracts in particular (**b.**); and thereafter it will discuss in separate sub-sections the three breaches alleged by Claimants: misuse of the *Contralor\u00eda's* powers (**c.**), incoherence between different Colombian authorities (**d.**), and incoherence in the criteria used by Ingeominas and the *Contralor\u00eda* regarding the expansion of the Mine (**e.**).\n\n**a. Legitimate Expectations Within the FET Standard**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1366.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established that a State breaches the FET standard guaranteed in Art. 4(2) of the Treaty if it adopts measures that violate certain thresholds of propriety (including basic requirements of the rule of law), causing harm to the investor\u2019s investment. The appropriate threshold of propriety requires a careful analysis of all the relevant circumstances, and the consideration of a number of factors.\n\n1367.\n\nAmong these factors are the frustration of an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.1206 Such expectations arise when a State (or its agencies) makes representations or commitments or gives assurances, upon which the foreign investor (in the exercise of an objectively reasonable business judgement) relies, and the frustration occurs when the State thereafter changes its position as against those expectations in a way that causes injury to the investor.1207 The protection of legitimate expectations is closely connected with the principles of good faith, estoppel, and the prohibition of *venire contra factum proprium.*1208\n\nArbitrator Garibaldi concurs in the use of the term \"legitimate expectations\" only in the understanding that it means the same as \"objectively reasonable expectations.\" Mr. Garibaldi does not accept the applicability of any unstated criterion of legitimacy other than objective reasonableness. In his view, the term \"legitimate expectations\", though commonly used, is singularly infelicitous, because \"legitimate\" presupposes a criterion of legitimacy that is not always made explicit in the discussion of expectations protected by the FET standard. In ordinary language, a reference to \"legitimacy\" presupposes, expressly or tacitly, a legal, political, moral, religious, etc. criterion of legitimacy. Using the expression \"legitimate expectations\" without anchoring it to a criterion of legitimacy based on objective reasonableness leaves the term open to redefinition by changing the criterion of legitimacy to include or exclude expectations (on moral, political, religious or other grounds) and so distort the original meaning of the term. Mr. Garibaldi understands that when an investor\u2019s expectations began to be considered as a factor in the FET analysis, the original idea was to refer to an investor's reasonable expectations, that is, expectations that an (objective) investor of ordinary prudence would have, as distinguished from the actual expectations of a particular investor. He believes that this is still the right concept, and this is the sense in which he understands the term \"legitimate expectations\".\n\nC F Dugan, D Wallace Jr, N D Rubins and B Sabahi, *Investor-State Arbitration* (2008), p. 510 (Doc. CL-54); *Tecmed,* para. 154; *Cervin,* para. 509; *ECE,* paras. 4.762; *Parkerings,* para. 331.\n\n*Thunderbird*, para. 147.\n\n1368.\n\nA State can create legitimate expectations *vis-\u00e0-vis* a foreign investor in two different contexts. In the first context, the State makes representations, assurances, or commitments directly to the investor (or to a narrow class of investors or potential investors). But legal expectations can also be created in some cases by the State's general legislative and regulatory framework: an investor may make an investment in reasonable reliance upon the stability of that framework, so that in certain circumstances a reform of the framework may breach the investor's legitimate expectations.\n\n1369.\n\nIn the present case, this second type of legitimate expectations is not at issue, as Claimants do not allege that the general Colombian legal framework gave rise to legitimate expectations. Claimants' case is much more specific: when Colombia agreed to sign the Mining Contract, it is said to have created the legitimate expectation that the Republic would not repudiate the obligations assumed therein. These legitimate expectations were violated by an administrative act, the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision, for which Colombia should assume international responsibility.\n\nRespondent's first counter-argument\n-----------------------------------\n\n1370.\n\nRespondent says that the ordinary meaning of FET excludes any protection for legitimate expectations and invokes, as support, the separate opinion of Judge Nikken in *Suez.*1209\n\nR I, para. 404; *Suez (Separate opinion by Judge Nikken),* para. 21.\n\n1371.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with Colombia's position.\n\n1372.\n\nVirtually unanimous case law identifies legitimate expectations of the investor as an important element of the FET standard.1210 So does scholarly opinion.1211 The only dissenting opinion seems to be that of Judge Nikken, who acknowledges that his position is contrary to the finding in \"recent awards\".1212\n\nC I, para. 180; see e.g. *Saluka,* paras. 301-302 (calling legitimate expectations the \"dominant element\" of the fair and equitable treatment standard); *Lemire,* para. 264; *Suez,* para. 203.\n\nC F Dugan, D Wallace Jr, N D Rubins and B Sabahi, *Investor-State Arbitration* (2008), p. 513 (Doc. CL-54); C. McLachlan, L. Shore, M. Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles,* 2nd ed., 2017, para. 7,179 (Doc. RL-44).\n\n*Suez (Separate opinion by Judge Nikken),* para. 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s second counter-argument\n------------------------------------\n\n1373.\n\nRespondent submits a second counter-argument: Colombia contends that contracts between the investor and the State are incapable of creating legitimate expectations, and that consequently no treaty breach can result from an investor\u2019s mere contractual expectations.1213\n\nR I, para. 408.\n\n1374.\n\nLegitimate expectations arise out of representations, assurances, or commitments made by the State, on which the investor reasonably relies. The Tribunal has already concluded that, depending on the circumstances, such representations, assurances, or commitments can be generated by acts specifically addressed to the investor or by the general legislative framework. The Tribunal sees no difficulty in including State-investor contracts among the instruments which can generate such representations, assurances, and commitments:1214 the essence of any contract is a reciprocal undertaking that each party will comply with the obligations stated therein.\n\n*Clayton et al*, para. 282.\n\n1375.\n\nThe question is not so much whether representations and assurances formalized in contracts generate legitimate expectations (they do), but rather whether the subsequent breach by the State of obligations undertaken by contract results in a violation of the FET standard.\n\n1376.\n\nThe *status quaestionis* has been summarized by Schreuer:1215\n\n\"It is unlikely that a view will prevail that sees each and every violation of a contract as a breach of the FET standard. Where the outer limits of FET with regard to contracts will be drawn is another matter. A formal repudiation of the contract by way of a sovereign act may not be the best criterion. In fact, an action that abrogates a contract through an act of *puissance publique* would probably more accurately be described as an expropriation. A more relevant test for the violation of the FET standard with respect to contracts would be whether the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations regarding a secure and stable legal framework are affected. Not every violation of a contract would trigger a finding to this effect. [...].\" [Emphasis added]\n\nCh. Schreuer, \"Fair and Equitable Treatment: Interactions with other Standards\", *Transnational Dispute Management*, Vol. 4, Issue 5, 2007, p. 20 (Doc. RL-56).\n\n1377.\n\nThe tribunal in *SAUK*1216 reached a similar conclusion:\n\n*\"El est\u00e1ndar de TJE [...] es diferente del deber de los Estados de atenerse a su propia legislaci\u00f3n y de cumplir los compromisos contractualmente asumidos frente a terceros. [...]. El Derecho internacional no cubre todo incumplimiento normativo o contractual de un Estado en todas las circunstancias - en estos casos el perjudicado debe buscar protecci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s del sistema judicial interno; la protecci\u00f3n del APRI solo entra en vigor cuando la conducta del Estado, por su gravedad y trascendencia, y por el car\u00e1cter soberano de los actos, es incompatible con el est\u00e1ndar internacional.\"* [Emphasis added]\n\n*Saur*, para. 483 (RL-14).\n\n1378.\n\nSumming up, different kinds of acts and measures, including contracts between the investor and the State, can give rise to an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. But a mere contractual breach by the State will not *per se* result in a violation of the international law FET standard.1217 An additional element (be it the special significance of the breach, an act of *puissance publique,* loss of a secure and stable legal framework, and so on) is required to trigger international responsibility.\n\n*UAB,* paras. 846 and 853. see also *Waste Management II,* paras. 73 and 139.\n\n**b. Colombian Legal Regime Applicable to State Contracts**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1379.\n\nTo analyse Claimants\u2019 argument that Colombia\u2019s actions breached their legitimate expectations, it is necessary, as a preliminary step, to summarize the legal framework applicable to Colombian administrative contracts in general, and mining contracts in particular.\n\n1380.\n\nThe Colombian legal framework for mining contracts is idiosyncratic. The contractual relationship between a private party and the Republic (or any of its agencies) is simultaneously subject to two starkly different systems, ruled by different laws, administered by separate agencies, which wield different levels of power and pursue different (and sometimes conflicting) objectives:\n\n- the first system is the law of contracts, administered by the Mining Agency, and subject to the competence of the *tribunales contencioso-administrativos (i)*, and\n\n- the second system is the fiscal liability regime, under the aegis of the *Contralor\u00eda (ii)*.\n\n(i) Law of Contracts\n--------------------\n\n1381.\n\nUnder the law of (administrative) contracts, the Mining Contract is considered as a *\"contrato de aporte\",* governed primarily by the 1988 Mining Code1218 and subsidiarily by the general rules on civil and commercial contracts,1219 which cover (*inter alia*) the parties\u2019 obligations, the consequences of a breach of such obligations, and the causes and effects of annulment*.*\n\nDoc. C-1; Doc. R-16; CPHB, para. 8; *Contratos de aporte* continued to be generally governed by the 1988 Mining Code notwithstanding its derogation by Law 685 of 2001, Doc R-196, Art 351.\n\nConsejo de Estado, Judgement of 2 December 2015 (Carbocol and Drummond), p. 21, Doc. R-300.\n\n1382.\n\n*Contratos de aporte* may include dispute resolution clauses. In the Mining Contract, the parties agreed that all disputes deriving from the Contract would be settled by the Colombian courts (\"*rama jurisdiccional del poder p\u00fablico colombiano\"),* unless the parties agreed *ex post* to submit a dispute to domestic arbitration.1220\n\nDoc. C-2, Clause 32.1.\n\n(ii) Fiscal Liability Regime\n----------------------------\n\n1383.\n\nOne of the unusual characteristics of Colombian law is that administrative contracts, including *contratos de aporte*, are also subject to the so-called \"*control fiscal*\" (best translated into English as \"treasury control\") by a specialized agency, the *Contralor\u00eda.*\n\n1384.\n\nThe requirement that the Republic\u2019s use of public funds be subj ect to special control derives from the Constitution: pursuant to Art. 267 of the *Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica,* fiscal control is a public function exercised by the *Contralor\u00eda,1221* an autonomous organ of the Colombian State, in charge of supervising the use of funds by the state treasury.1222\n\nDoc. C-68, Art. 267: *\"El control fiscal es una funci\u00f3n p\u00fablica que ejercer\u00e1 la Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica, la cual vigila la gesti\u00f3n fiscal de la administraci\u00f3n y de los particulares o entidades que manejen fondos o bienes de la Naci\u00f3n\"\u2019.*\n\nDoc. C-68, Art. 267; Doc. C-72, Arts. 1 and 3.\n\n1385.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda,* which is governed by Law 610 of 2000, has sweeping powers to initiate and conduct a so-called \"Fiscal Liability Proceeding\", not only against civil servants, but also against private individuals, provided that these individuals exercise public functions or use assets of the Nation:1223\n\n\"[...] *determinar y establecer la responsabilidad de los servidores p\u00fablicos y de los particulares, cuando en el ejercicio de la gesti\u00f3n fiscal o con ocasi\u00f3n de \u00e9sta, causen por acci\u00f3n u omisi\u00f3n y en forma dolosa o culposa un da\u00f1o al patrimonio del Estado\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 1; Doc. C-72, Art. 4.12.\n\n1386.\n\nThe extension of fiscal liability to private individuals has been upheld by the Colombian Constitutional Court.1224\n\nThe Colombian Constitutional Court explained in Judgment T-1012/08 (Doc. R-192, p. 2), *\"En relaci\u00f3n con la interpretaci\u00f3n de las normas constitucionales y legales y, en especial, respecto de la calidad de destinatario del proceso fiscal del particular contratista con el Estado, tanto la jurisprudencia de la Corte Constitucional como la del Consejo de Estado, ha sido enf\u00e1tica en sostener no s\u00f3lo que los contratistas con el Estado son sujetos de vigilancia fiscal, sino tambi\u00e9n que el control sobre la gesti\u00f3n adelantada por las autoridades p\u00fablicas y los particulares en la contrataci\u00f3n p\u00fablica se justifica por la naturaleza misma del control fiscal que fue dise\u00f1ado para defender el erario p\u00fablico y garantizar la eficiencia y eficacia los recursos p\u00fablicos\"\u2019.* Similarly, the Constitutional Court in Judgment C-840/01 (Doc. R-37, p. 18) held that \"*la esfera de la gesti\u00f3n fiscal constituye el elemento vinculante y determinante de las responsabilidades inherentes al manejo de fondos y bienes del Estado por parte de los servidores p\u00fablicos y de los particulares. Siendo por tanto indiferente la condici\u00f3n p\u00fablica o privada del respectivo responsable, cuando de establecer responsabilidades fiscales se trata\"\u2019.*\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n1387.\n\nThe requirements for the establishment of fiscal liability mirror those for extra-contractual responsibility:\n\n- (i) a \"*conducta dolosa o culposa*\" by the civil servant or the private individual engaged in \"*gesti\u00f3n fiscal*\",\n\n- (ii) which causes patrimonial damage to the Republic, and\n\n- (iii) a causal link between the conduct and the damage.1225\n\nDoc. C-71, Arts. 4 and 6.\n\n1388.\n\nThis derives from Art. 5 of Law 610 of 2000, which provides that: **.**1226\n\n*\"La responsabilidad fiscal estar\u00e1 integrada por los siguientes elementos:*\n\n*- Una conducta dolosa o culposa atribuible a una persona que realiza gesti\u00f3n fiscal.*\n\n*- Un da\u00f1o patrimonial al Estado.*\n\n*- Un nexo causal entre los dos elementos anteriores\".*\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 5.\n\n1389.\n\nThe fiscal liability procedure is a purely administrative and inquisitorial procedure, in which the *Contralor\u00eda* investigates the facts and then issues a decision (*fallo*), which can be appealed first *\"en via gubernativa\"* (before the administration) and thereafter to the *tribunales contencioso-administrativos* (specialized courts having competence on administrative matters).\n\n1390.\n\nIf the investigation by the *Contralor\u00eda* concludes that fiscal liability has indeed been engaged, the consequence is that the civil servant or private individual must pay compensation equal to the damage suffered by the State.1227\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 4.\n\n(iii) Fiscal Liability in Administrative Contracts\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1391.\n\nFiscal liability can also arise when a private individual enters into a contract with the Colombian State or with any of its agencies. Liability will extend not only to the civil servants and other officers who authorized the contract, but potentially also to the private counterparty - even if the counterparty has duly performed its side of the bargain.\n\n1392.\n\nFiscal liability does not require the violation of any norm, the breach of any contractual commitment, or any illegality affecting the contract. Its requirements are the same as those of a generic tort *(damnum injuria datum):* liability is engaged whenever a private individual incurs in *conducta dolosa o culposa* when negotiating, executing, or performing a contract, and such behaviour causes damage to the State.\n\n1393.\n\nConversely, the *Contralor\u00eda's* decision has no impact on the contract, which continues in full force and effect, and has to be complied with by the private party and by the public party.1228\n\nDoc. C-35, p. 41.\n\n(iv) Precedents\n---------------\n\n1394.\n\nThe Tribunal asked the parties to identify published precedents where the *Contralor\u00eda* declared the fiscal liability of a private counter-party which had entered into a contract with the Colombian State and had ordered such counter-party to restitute to the State amounts accrued and paid under the contract.\n\n1395.\n\nRespondent has drawn the attention of the Tribunal to the following precedents: Decision 015\n\n1396.\n\nThe leading case in this matter seems to be Decision 015 of 15 April 2002,  [\"**Decision 015**\"], issued two years after the enactment of Law 610 of 2000.1229 In that case the *Contralor\u00eda* analysed two separate contracts:\n\nDoc. RL-208.\n\n1397.\n\nFirst : the company Aurea Ltda. had signed a contract with the *C\u00e1mara de los Representantes* for the creation of an inventory of assets. The *Contralor\u00eda* initiated a fiscal liability procedure against Aurea Ltda., the President of the *C\u00e1mara de Representantes*, and certain civil servants. The *Contralor\u00eda* concluded that Aurea Ltda. had breached its contractual obligations, and that such breach implied \"*conducta culposa*\", causing the *C\u00e1mara de Representantes* to forfeit the advance payment.1230 Aurea Ltda. (together with the President and certain civil servants of the *C\u00e1mara*) was ordered to pay the damage caused to the Republic.\n\nDoc. RL-208, p. 48.\n\n1398.\n\nSecond : Implegr\u00e1ficas Cabrini, a firm owned by a certain Mr. Cabrera, had sold paper to the *C\u00e1mara de Representantes* and, taking advantage of the lack of knowledge and diligence of the civil servants, had applied a price which exceeded market prices by 100%.1231 The *Contralor\u00eda* found that the firm had incurred in *mala fe* and *dolo*, by quoting prices which were exaggerated. The *Contralor\u00eda* made the following statements:\n\n*\"El se\u00f1or CABRERA VEGA no estaba en ejercicio de su actividad privada o particular, estaba contratando con el Estado y esto le generaba obligaciones, las que consist\u00edan en coadyuvar a cumplir los fines esenciales del Estado, tenia esa important\u00edsima funci\u00f3n social y por ende era su obligaci\u00f3n actuar con lealtad; lealtad hacia el Estado en el que \u00e9l mismo se desenvuelve y respecto del cual \u00e9l mismo se sirve. Colombia es un Estado Social de Derecho y como tal impone obligaciones y deberes no solo a sus servidores sino tambi\u00e9n a los particulares que se desenvuelven dentro del territorio nacional. Por eso, el art\u00edculo 3 de la ley 80 de 1,993, preceptua como obligaci\u00f3n para los particulares cuando contratan con el Estado, adem\u00e1s de su derecho a obtener utilidades, las que est\u00e1n protegidas por el mismo Estado, colaborar en el logro de sus fines sociales, **cumpliendo una funci\u00f3n social que como tal, implica obligaciones**\"*. [Emphasis added, bold in the original]\n\nDoc. RL-208, p. 50.\n\n1399.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* used the following definition of *dolo:*1232\n\n*\"Pregunta [el Sr. Cabrera] d\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la mala fe, se le responde que es precisamente en esa actitud mezquina y de desapego en donde est\u00e1 la mala fe, en donde est\u00e1 el dolo, su mala intenci\u00f3n de aprovecharse de unas circunstancias erradas para sacar mayor provecho y mayor lucro del que las reglas del mercado en ese momento le estaban ofreciendo*\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. RL-208, p. 50.\n\n1400.\n\nThe consequence of the *Contralor\u00eda\"* s finding was that the President of the *C\u00e1mara,* certain civil servants, Implegr\u00e1ficas Cabrini, and Mr. Cabrera himself were jointly ordered to compensate the damage caused to the State.\n\nOther Decisions\n---------------\n\n1401.\n\nDecision 015 became a leading case and led to numerous decisions in which the *Contralor\u00eda* held private parties fiscally liable for failing to provide the services for which they had been retained by public entities or for embezzling funds advanced by public entities.1233\n\nCases are summarized in RPHB, para. 86 (Doc. RL-211; Doc. RL-204; Doc. RL-219; Doc. RL-220).\n\n1402.\n\nOne of the cases is Decision 013 of 2011, in which the *Contralor\u00eda* held a bank fiscally liable for breach of a checking account contract. The *Consejo Superior de la Judicatura -* the owner of the checking account - had expressly requested that significant checks be confirmed before payment. Banco Popular failed to do so, and was made responsible of the damage caused:1234\n\n\"[...] *el actuar negligente del Banco al incumplir con los deberes contractuales establecidos para la operaci\u00f3n cambiaria, como lo era la confirmaci\u00f3n de los cheques previa a su monetizaci\u00f3n*\".\n\nDoc. RL-207, p. 27.\n\n1403.\n\nAnother group of cases refers to construction contracts. The *Contralor\u00eda* repeatedly held private contractors responsible for the damage to the State, caused by breach of contractual obligations.1235\n\nCases are summarized in RPHB, paras. 99-101. In CPHB, para. 50 Claimants submit that, further to Decision 015 there is only one further precedent, namely Decision 130 of 2012 (Doc. RL-200), in which the *Contralor\u00eda* criticized the price set out in a State contract, adding that \"importantly in that decision the *Contralor\u00eda* only held the agent of the State party liable\". This conclusion is contradicted by Decision 130, which on p. 55 and on p. 103 (the very pages quoted by Claimants) comes to the opposite conclusion and declares the fiscal responsibility of the private party. Given the clear wording of the Decision, the Tribunal wonders how this apparent mistake could creep into Claimants' submission.\n\n1404.\n\nSumming up, at least since Decision 015, adopted in 2002, the *Contralor\u00eda* has been regularly using its fiscal powers to review administrative contracts entered into between the State, including its agencies, and private individuals.\n\n1405.\n\nIn this process of review, the *Contralor\u00eda* has frequently focused not only on the officials who negotiated or authorized the transaction, but also against the private party that contracted with the State. The *Contralor\u00eda* has concluded that the private counterparty had indeed incurred fiscal liability (jointly with the officials) when obligations were breached, excessive prices were applied, or public funds were embezzled.\n\n1406.\n\nIn reaching these conclusions, the *Contralor\u00eda* adopted an expansive interpretation of the concepts of *culpa* and *dolo*, and of the good faith obligation owed by private contractors *vis-\u00e0-vis* the State.\n\n1407.\n\nThe Tribunal will now analyse Claimants' claim that the *Contralor\u00eda* violated their legitimate expectations in three ways: misuse of fiscal powers (**c.**), inconsistent conduct (**d.**), and expansion of the Mine (**e.**).\n\n**c. First Alleged Violation: Misuse of Fiscal Control Powers**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1408.\n\nClaimants argue that Colombia violated their legitimate expectations because the Republic did not use its fiscal control powers in conformity with their usual function of supervising fiscal management of state resources, but rather effectively to nullify the commitments in the Eighth Amendment for the year 2010.1236\n\nC II, para. 259(a).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n1409.\n\nClaimants' contention has two aspects: (i) that they had legitimate expectations that the fiscal control regime would not be applied to Prodeco or the Eighth Amendment, and (ii) that they had legitimate expectations that the fiscal control regime would not be applied to Prodeco in an abusive, improper, or unreasonable manner.\n\n1410.\n\nWith regard to the first aspect of Claimants' contention, the Tribunal considers that Claimants have failed to prove that their legitimate expectations were frustrated by the mere fact that the fiscal control regime was applied to Prodeco and the Eighth Amendment.\n\n1411.\n\nProdeco and Ingeominas discussed the content of the Eighth Amendment between 2008 and January 2010. During those negotiations, Prodeco, a sophisticated company using in-house and outside counsel, was aware (or must be deemed to have been aware) of the idiosyncratic nature of the Colombian legal regime applicable to administrative contracts in general and to *contratos de aporte* and their amendments in particular:\n\n- On one side, Prodeco must be taken to have assumed that in due course Ingeominas (or its successor) could raise disputes against Prodeco, including claims regarding the validity of the contract, before the domestic administrative courts, as agreed upon in the dispute-resolution clause of the Mining Contract;\n\n- On the other side, Prodeco (after enactment of Law 610 of 2000 and adoption by the *Contralor\u00eda* of Decision 015 in 2002 and the line of decisions which follow this precedent) must be taken to have envisaged the possibility that the supervisory agency might review the Eighth Amendment, find that Prodeco acted with *dolo* or *culpa* in the negotiation or execution of the Amendment, and order Prodeco to compensate the damage caused to the State.\n\n1412.\n\nClaimants\u2019 allegation that they had a legitimate expectation that the *Contralor\u00eda* would abstain from using its fiscal powers and filing a Fiscal Liability Proceeding is baseless. Colombia never made a representation to that effect. To the contrary: Claimants were aware that Ingeominas denied registration of the Initial Version of the Eighth Amendment, precisely because it considered the terms of such agreement *\"lesivo[s] para el Estado\"* The requirement that the Eighth Amendment be favourable to the interests of Ingeominas, and hence the State, had been a constant contention during the negotiation.1237\n\nSee section **III****.(4)** *supra.*\n\n1413.\n\nThe same conclusion applies to the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision as applied to Prodeco. By subjecting Prodeco to the Fiscal Liability Proceeding Colombia used its fiscal control powers in a way which was not materially different from that applied in previous cases. In this respect, the Decision was not an unexpected outlier: it follows interpretations of the law and uses arguments which the *Contralor\u00eda* had already applied in numerous precedents. That the Prodeco Decision was not unexpected, and follows a long line of similar resolutions, is confirmed by the *Cerro Matoso* decision, a case involving another mining company. This decision was adopted in 2018, and the criteria applied by the *Contralor\u00eda* are similar to those in the present case.1238\n\nRPHB, paras. 102-108, referring to Doc. RL-235.\n\n1414.\n\nSumming up, Colombia\u2019s dual legal framework for administrative contracts permits that disputes be adjudicated either\n\n- by a court, applying the law of contract,\n\n- and/or by the *Contralor\u00eda,* applying its idiosyncratic law, akin to the law of tort.\n\n1415.\n\nWhen Prodeco and Ingeominas negotiated and executed the Eighth Amendment, Colombia\u2019s dual legal framework for administrative contracts had been in existence for more than a decade. Prodeco was aware (or with minimal due diligence could have been aware) of its existence and implications.1239 As the Republic rightly says:1240\n\n\"Claimants must accept that they are presumed to know the contents of the Colombian legal and regulatory system. They cannot be heard to plead that their legitimate expectations did not take into account the ordinary functioning of the system\".\n\n*UAB,* para. 837.\n\nR II, para. 614.\n\n1416.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants\u2019 argument that the mere fact that such legal framework was applied to the Eighth Amendment violated their legitimate expectations.\n\n1417.\n\nThe second aspect to Claimants\u2019 argument is that the *Contralor\u00eda* frustrated their legitimate expectations that the fiscal control regime would not be applied to Prodeco in an abusive, improper, or unreasonable manner. This second aspect of Claimants\u2019 FET claim coincides with Claimants\u2019 separate claim that their investment in Colombia was impaired by Colombia adopting \"unreasonable measures\" in breach of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty. Section **VI.3.(2.2).***infra* will analyse these arguments in depth.\n\n**d. Second Alleged Violation: Inconsistent Conduct of Colombia**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1418.\n\nClaimants also argue that Colombia breached their legitimate expectations because various Colombian authorities, and specifically Ingeominas and the *Contralor\u00eda*, adopted decisions that were radically incoherent and inconsistent with each other.1241\n\nC II, para. 259 (b).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n1419.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that an investor may legitimately hold the expectation that different branches of government will not take inconsistent actions affecting the investment: a government agency should not make a decision that contradicts a prior decision made by the same or another agency, acting within the same sphere of powers, on which the investor has relied, causing harm to the investor.1242 This is part of the core meaning of the FET standard.\n\n*MTD,* paras. 163-167.\n\n1420.\n\nThere is no insconsistency and no breach of legitimate expectations, however, when the second agency, applying substantive legal criteria established in a pre-existing legal framework, takes a decision which diverges from that previously adopted by another agency. The reason is simple: The modern nation-state typically endows different agencies with different legal and policy responsibilities and objectives.\n\n1421.\n\nClaimants say that, to evaluate the Eighth Amendment, the *Contralor\u00eda* applied criteria different from those considered by Ingeominas when negotiating and agreeing to such amendment, resulting in a breach of their legitimate expectations.\n\n1422.\n\nThat is not the proper test.\n\n1423.\n\nClaimants' legitimate expectations to consistent conduct on the part of Colombia could have been violated if the *Contralor\u00eda* had made its decision on the basis of criteria different from those set forth in the pre-existing legal framework. In fact, the *Contralor\u00eda* did base its decision on the pre-existing fiscal-liability regime. Whether the *Contralor\u00eda* applied those pre-existing criteria in an abusive, unreasonable, or improper manner is a separate question, to be analysed in Section **VI.3.(2.2).***infra*.\n\n1424.\n\nIngeominas approved and executed the Mining Contract, and then the *Contralor\u00eda* reviewed Ingeominas' decision, applying its powers under the Colombian fiscal liability regime, as it had stood at least since 2002 (and which has been described in detail in Section **VI.3.(2.1).C.b.** *supra).*\n\n1425.\n\nClaimants' legitimate expectations of consistency were not breached by the application of the fiscal liability regime: every diligent investor must be assumed to know and to accept that Colombia has implemented a dual framework for administrative contracts, submitting such contracts (and their amendments) not only to the law of contract, but also to the fiscal liability regime entrusted to the *Contralor\u00eda.*\n\n**e. Third Alleged Violation: Expansion of the Mine**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n1426.\n\nFinally, Claimants say that their legitimate expectations were breached, because Ingeominas expressly acknowledged that the expansion of the Mine was \"the basis of the negotiations among the parties\", and the *Contralor\u00eda* ignored this acknowledgement.1243\n\nC I, paras. 196-198; C II, para. 270(b).\n\n1427.\n\nThe Tribunal again disagrees. Claimants' argument in this respect is a variant of its consistency argument, already addressed, and must be dismissed for the same reason.\n\n1428.\n\nThere is abundant evidence that the expansion of the Mine was indeed the principal basis for the negotiations between Prodeco and Ingeominas and the execution of the Eighth Amendment. This is also reflected in *Considerando 6* of the Eighth Amendment, which reads as follows:\n\n\"6. *Que con el presente acuerdo se garantizan los intereses del Estado y la viabilidad de la expansi\u00f3n del proyecto minero, lo cual ha sido el fundamento de la negociaci\u00f3n entre las partes*\".\n\n1429.\n\nBut this established fact did not create a legitimate expectation that, in applying pre-existing substantive legal criteria, the *Contralor\u00eda* would not review the Eighth Amendment, applying the fiscal liability regime.\n\n1430.\n\nA separate question is whether, in calculating damages, the *Contralor\u00eda* should have taken into consideration the agreed expansion of the Mine capacity. This issue is addressed in section **VI.3.(2.2).B.c.(iv)** *infra.*\n\n**(2.2) Unreasonable Measures**\n-------------------------------\n\n1431.\n\nIn accordance with the Treaty, Colombia has assumed not only a positive obligation\n\n- to provide FET - but also a negative one: to abstain from unreasonable or discriminatory measures affecting protected investments.\n\n1432.\n\nClaimants are not pleading discrimination, and consequently it is not necessary that the Tribunal delve into its meaning.\n\n1433.\n\nClaimants however plead that the measures adopted by Colombia were not only unreasonable but also \"arbitrary\" - a concept not mentioned in the Treaty.1244 In essence, Claimants say that the *Contralor\u00eda's* findings\n\n- that Prodeco acted with *dolo* with the intention of causing damage to the State,1245 and\n\n- that the damage caused to the State should be calculated based on the Transition Period, the first year of the long-term Mining Contract1246\n\nconstitute an \"arbitrary and unreasonable\" measure,1247 contrary to Art. 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\nC I, para. 184.\n\nC II, para. 259(d), (iii) and (v).\n\nC I, para. 202(b).\n\nC II, para. 259.\n\n1434.\n\nRespondent disagrees on the following grounds:\n\n- The *Contralor\u00eda* properly decided that Prodeco satisfied the elements for fiscal liability in a 234-page reasoned opinion after four years of proceedings, and found that Prodeco had acted with *dolo;* after extensive analysis of Prodeco\u2019s bad-faith negotiations of the Eighth Amendment, the *Contralor\u00eda* concluded that Prodeco had performed a number of manoeuvers to reduce the compensation and thus failed to comply with its duties as a collaborator of the State; **.**1248\n\n- Claimants\u2019 disagreement with the calculation of damage in the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision must be rejected because it interferes with the right of domestic authorities to regulate within the State\u2019s territory;1249 additionally, the calculation is based on the Transition Period of the Mining Contract because it constituted a distinct contractual period with its own economic formula.1250\n\nR I, paras. 421-422.\n\nR I, para. 460.\n\nR I, para. 463.\n\n1435.\n\nThe Tribunal will first establish the meaning of \"unreasonable measure\" as used in Art. 4(1) of the Treaty (**A.**), then it will discuss whether two specific findings of the *Contralor\u00eda* meet the test of reasonability: the calculation of damages (**B.**) and the finding that Prodeco acted with *dolo* (**C.**). Finally, the Tribunal will address the postponed question whether the way in which the *Contralor\u00eda* applied the Fiscal Control Regime to Prodeco frustrated the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations in violation of the FET standard of the Treaty (**D.**)\n\n**A. Impairment of an Investment by Unreasonable Measures**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1436.\n\nThe Parties have discussed the precise meaning of the term \"unreasonable measures\" as used in Art. 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n1437.\n\nClaimants accepts Respondent\u2019s proposition that unreasonable conduct includes actions involving prejudice, preference, or bias that shocks a sense of judicial propriety.1251\n\nC II, para. 247.\n\n1438.\n\nBut Claimants add that measures are also arbitrary when they inflict damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose, are not based on legal standards but rather on discretion, are taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision-maker, or are in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.1252\n\nC II, para. 247.\n\n1439.\n\nClaimants finally submit that confusion and lack of clarity, even if unintended, may result in arbitrariness. It follows that measures may be arbitrary even if not adopted in bad faith. Measures may also be arbitrary when they are adopted without engaging in a rational decision-making process or when the State fails to base its actions on reasoned judgement.1253\n\nC II, para. 248.\n\n1440.\n\nClaimants finally say that that the actions of the *Contralor\u00eda* are not entitled to automatic and unlimited deference as to their conformity with the Treaty.1254\n\nC II, para. 250.\n\nRespondent\n----------\n\n1441.\n\nRespondent argues that the standard for arbitrary conduct is a high one, requiring a showing of conduct tainted by prejudice, preference or bias that shocks or surprises a sense of judicial propriety.1255 Satisfying that standard is still more difficult when it comes to second-guessing legitimate regulatory or control measures, because States enjoy a high level of deference.1256 The application of the national normative framework is arbitrary only if it constitutes a deliberate repudiation of that framework, and even then, only if there are no domestic resources available to correct the application.1257\n\nR I, paras. 446-448; R II, para. 662.\n\nR I, para. 448.\n\nR II, para. 664.\n\n1442.\n\nIn summary, Respondent submits that the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision does not come close to being arbitrary according to the international standard. Claimants have not alleged any improper motive behind the actions of the *Contralor\u00eda.* To the contrary, the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision complied with the agency\u2019s mandate.1258\n\nR I, para. 449.\n\nArt. 4(1) of the Treaty\n-----------------------\n\n1443.\n\nArt. 4(1) of the Treaty obliges the contracting State not to:\n\n\"[...] impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and, should it so happen, liquidation of such [protected] investments.\"\n\n1444.\n\nAn interesting feature of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty is its drafters\u2019 choice of terminology. Other BITs - including certain treaties signed by Colombia-1259 include a prohibition against \"arbitrary or discriminatory\" measures. The Swiss-Colombian BIT however uses the expression \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" measures (in Spanish, *\"medidas no razonables o discriminatorias\u2019\").* Are \"unreasonable measures\" and \"arbitrary measures\" synonyms?\n\nColombia-France BIT (2014), Art. 4(1): *\"[...] Para mayor certeza, la obligaci\u00f3n de otorgar un trato justo y equitativo, incluye, inter alia: (...) b) La obligaci\u00f3n de actuar de una manera transparente, no discriminatoria y no arbitraria...*\" [emphasis added]; Colombia-Spain BIT (2005), Art. 2(3): *\"Las inversiones realizadas por inversionistas de una Parte Contratante en el territorio de la otra Parte Contratante recibir\u00e1n un tratamiento justo y equitativo y disfrutar\u00e1n de plena protecci\u00f3n y seguridad, no obstaculizando en modo alguno, mediante medidas arbitrarias o discriminatorias, la gesti\u00f3n, el mantenimiento, el uso, el disfrute y la venta o liquidaci\u00f3n de tales inversiones\"\u2019.* [Emphasis added]\n\n1445.\n\nAs a matter of ordinary meaning, the term \"unreasonable measures\" seems to define a set of actions which is wider than \"arbitrary measures\".\n\n1446.\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, arbitrary decisions are based on random choice or personal whim, rather than reason.1260 If a measure is arbitrary, it cannot simultaneously conform to reason. It follows that all measures which are arbitrary are also unreasonable - but not *vice-versa.* The set of unreasonable measures is wider than that of arbitrary measures.\n\nOxford Learner\u2019s Dictionaries.

Arbitrary Measures**\n-------------------------\n\n1447.\n\nWhat does \"arbitrary\" mean?\n\n1448.\n\nArbitrariness has been described as \"founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact\"; **.**1261 \"[...] contrary to the law because...[it] shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety;1262\" or \"wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises a sense of judicial propriety\";1263 or conduct which \"manifestly violate[s] the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination\".1264\n\n*Occidental,* para. 162; *Lauder,* para. 221.\n\n*ELSI,* para. 128; *Tecmed,* para. 154.\n\n*ELSI,* para. 128; *Loewen,* para. 131.\n\n*Saluka,* para. 307.\n\n1449.\n\nIn *EDF,* Professor Schreuer, appearing as an expert, defined as \"arbitrary\",\n\n\"a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose;\n\nb. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;\n\nc. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker;\n\nd. a measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.\"\n\nAnd the Tribunal seemed to accept such definition when it analysed and ultimately rejected the claimant\u2019s claim that Romania had taken unreasonable or discriminatory measures.1265\n\n*EDF*, para. 303.\n\n1450.\n\nSumming up, the underlying notion of arbitrariness is that prejudice, preference, or bias is substituted for the rule of law.1266\n\n*Lemire*, paras. 262-263.\n\n**b. Unreasonable Measures**\n----------------------------\n\n1451.\n\nThe Parties have discussed whether the prohibition of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty extends not only to arbitrary measures, but also to those adopted without reasoned judgement or without a rational decision-making process.\n\n1452.\n\nThe very wording of the Treaty provides the answer to this question. The Treaty does not refer to \"arbitrary measures\". It prohibits the wider set of \"unreasonable measures\". As already found, \"unreasonable measures\" include not only \"arbitrary measures\" but also measures that are irrational in themselves or result from an irrational decision-making process.\n\n1453.\n\nIn this question, the Tribunal subscribes to the finding of the tribunal in *LG&E,* when it said that the contracting states (in that case Argentina and the United States)1267\n\n\"wanted to prohibit themselves from implementing measures that affect the investments of nationals of the other Party without engaging in a rational decision-making process\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. CL-46, para. 158; *LG&E* applies a treaty where the words used were \"arbitrary or discriminatory measures\"; the reasoning of *LG&E* is even more appropriate in a Treaty like the Swiss-Colombian BIT which refers to \"unreasonable or arbitrary measures\".\n\n1454.\n\nThe *LG&E* tribunal added:\n\n\"Certainly a State that fails to base its actions on reasoned judgement, and uses abusive arguments instead, would not 'stimulate the flow of private capital\u2019.\" **.**1268\n\n*LG&E,* para. 158. Contrary to Respondent\u2019s submission, the *LG&E* award does not state that a finding of unreasonable measures requires a showing of conduct that shocks or surprises a sense of judicial propriety. *LG&E* mentions this requirement when analyzing discrimination - not when referring to measures not based on reasoned judgement.\n\nHigh Threshold\n--------------\n\n1455.\n\nRespondent insists that the threshold for proving that conduct is unreasonable should be a high one.\n\n1456.\n\nThe Tribunal, by majority, tends to agree.\n\n1457.\n\nInvestment arbitration tribunals are not called to adjudicate appeals against measures adopted by States or their agencies. Their task is to establish whether the state\u2019s conduct *vis-\u00e0-vis* protected foreign investors is tainted by prejudice, preference or bias or is so totally incompatible with reason that it constitutes an international wrong.\n\n1458.\n\nThe Tribunal, by majority, also agrees with the Republic that satisfying the standard is more difficult when it comes to reviewing regulatory or control measures, because States, and especially supervisory agencies, should enjoy deference. Supervisors are frequently required to take decision in short timeframes, making complex assessments of countervailing interests. Arbitral tribunals, sitting comfortably in the future, with full knowledge of the supervening events, must take the individual circumstances of each decision into consideration and avoid the temptation of using hindsight as the basis for assessing reasonableness.1269\n\nArbitrator Garibaldi disagrees with the majority\u2019s position stated in paragraphs 1456 and 1458. First, he does not agree with the characterization of the standard of unreasonableness as a high one (or low or medium one, for that matter). He considers that such characterizations are useless in the absence of comparators or an agreed yardstick; they are rhetorical devices that have their proper place in counsel\u2019s arguments, not in a tribunal\u2019s decision. A tribunal\u2019s duty is to apply the standard laid down in the applicable treaty, whatever that standard is and however it might be characterized. Second, Mr. Garibaldi does not agree that \"satisfying the standard is more difficult when it comes to reviewing regulatory or control measures, because states, and especially supervisory agencies, should enjoy deference\" (paragraph 1458). He is unable to find anything in the Treaty or in general international law requiring this Tribunal to defer in any way to state agencies in matters concerning the application of the Treaty standards. This is not to say that the Tribunal is free to impose its own conception of reasonableness or to ignore the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1458. This and any other treaty standard must be interpreted and applied in good faith under the rules of the VCLT. But the interpretation and application process must be impartial, not influenced by any sense of deference to one party to the dispute or solicitude to the other.\n\n**B. Damages**\n--------------\n\n1459.\n\nClaimants finally say that the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision constitutes an unreasonable measure because the determination of the existence of damage to the State is based on a narrow analysis of the first year of the long-term Mining Contract, illogically relying on the Transition Period.1270\n\nC I, para. 202(b); C II, para. 259(d)(ii).\n\n1460.\n\nRespondent disagrees: the Transition Period constitutes a distinct contractual period with its own economic formula, and this justifies the use of such period for the calculation of damages.1271\n\nR I, para. 463.\n\n1461.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarize the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* calculation of damages (**a.**), including the Tovar-Silva Report (**b.**), will then analyse the meaning of the Transition Period within the Mining Contract (**c.**), and finally it will reach its conclusions applying the standards of the Treaty (**d.**)\n\n**a. The Methodology of the Tovar-Silva Report**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1462.\n\nThe methodology for the calculation of damages in the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision is based on the Tovar-Silva Report. This report was prepared in March 2011, *i.e.* four years before the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision was issued, by a junior officer of the *Contralor\u00eda,* Ms. Johanna Tovar Silva.\n\n1463.\n\nThe Tovar-Silva Report based its finding on the Eighth Amendment's so-called Transition Period, which was the period between 1 January and 31 December 2010.1272 Ms. Tovar Silva explained that:1273\n\n\"*Los presentes c\u00e1lculos fueron efectuados sobre los embarques realizados durante el per\u00edodo de transici\u00f3n pactado por las partes* [...] *sin perjuicio del c\u00e1lculo que pueda presentarse con posterioridad al embarque 555-2010 de 03 de noviembre de 2010, toda vez que de acuerdo con las directrices institucionales el da\u00f1o causado habr\u00e1 de ser determinable y por extensi\u00f3n cuantificable, situaci\u00f3n que en los contratos de tracto sucesivo se diluye ante la posibilidad de compensaci\u00f3n de cargas contractuales, pero que en el caso objeto de estudio se ha consolidado plenamente como da\u00f1os por haber vencido el t\u00e9rmino definido por las partes como 'per\u00edodo de transici\u00f3n\u2019\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nIn the additional report to the Tovar-Silva Report, Ms. Tovar Silva explains that she calculated the Royalties for the period 1 January through 31 December 2010, and the Additional Royalty from 7 November 2009 through 6 November 2010; Doc. C-147, p. 4.\n\nDoc. C-125, p. 26.\n\n1464.\n\nMs. Tovar Silva\u2019s analysis draws attention to one of the main problems in the *Contralor\u00eda* 's analysis: how to calculate the existence and amount of damage caused to the State in a long-term contract.\n\n1465.\n\nAs Ms. Tovar Silva explains, in this type of contract there is a possibility that losses in one year are set-off by gains in succeeding years - making the calculation more uncertain. To solve this difficulty, Ms. Tovar Silva decided to focus on the one-year *\"periodo de transici\u00f3n\"* foreseen in the Eighth Amendment, which in her opinion \"*se ha consolidado plenamente*\", and then to calculate the damage as the loss of income suffered by the Republic in that period - disregarding all possible events in subsequent years.\n\nClarifications by Ms. Tovar Silva\n---------------------------------\n\n1466.\n\nAs a consequence of Prodeco\u2019s challenge to the Tovar Silva Report, on 29 October 2012, the *Contralor\u00eda* asked Ms. Tovar Silva to provide clarifications.1274 Accordingly, on 9 November 2012, Ms. Tovar Silva explained that she had examined the impact of the Eighth Amendment on the State\u2019s finances only during the Transition Period because this was the only period for which there was actual data.1275 This is her precise explanation:1276\n\n\"[...] *es de aclarar que en el caso de regal\u00edas se tom\u00f3 este per\u00edodo, que coincide con el definido contractualmente como \"per\u00edodo de transici\u00f3n\" en el numeral 14.3 de la Cl\u00e1usula D\u00e9cima Cuarta del Contrato 044-89, en raz\u00f3n a que es el per\u00edodo en el que se encontraban materializados los hechos generadores de regal\u00edas y contraprestaciones econ\u00f3micas ; y a que dentro de la Indagaci\u00f3n Preliminar correspondiente al Auto No. 000720 del 19 de octubre de 2010 y a la fecha de elaboraci\u00f3n del informe de apoyo t\u00e9cnico se cont\u00f3 \u00fanicamente con los soportes de los embarques debidamente **efectuados** y reportados por C.I. Prodeco a Ingeominas de los cuatro (4) trimestres de 2010* [...]\". [Emphasis added, bold in the original]\n\nDoc. C-146.\n\nDoc. C-147.\n\nDoc. C-147, p. 4.\n\n**b. The Transition Period**\n----------------------------\n\n1467.\n\nThe *\"periodo de transici\u00f3n\"* is defined in clause 3 of the Eighth Amendment. This clause amended the agreed procedure for the calculation of Royalties and provided a new formula.\n\n1468.\n\nUnder the new pricing formula, on each given date the Coal Reference Price is established by considering not only the FOB Price on such date, but also the FOB Prices in the previous 18 months, weighted by Prodeco\u2019s sales in the respective periods, on the basis of annual weighting coefficients, established *ex ante* (before 15 January of each year) by an independent auditor. The auditor must be appointed by Ingeominas at the end of October of each year, and the auditor\u2019s weightings are applied throughout the next year.\n\n1469.\n\nThis new system created a difficulty: how to determine the weighting coefficient for the first year, a period preceding the appointment of the independent auditor.\n\n1470.\n\nTo solve this problem, Clause 3 of the Eighth Amendment includes the following sub-section:\n\n**Per\u00edodo de Transici\u00f3n:** Toda vez que la aplicaci\u00f3n de la formula indicada en el presente otros\u00ed, implicar\u00eda la utilizaci\u00f3n de \u00edndices anteriores a la fecha de suscripci\u00f3n del mismo, se hace necesario establecer un periodo de transici\u00f3n. Por lo tanto entre la fecha de inicio de vigencia del presente otros\u00ed y el 31 de diciembre de 2010, el c\u00e1lculo de las regal\u00edas de que trata el numeral 14.1 se har\u00e1 tomando como precio FOB de referencia el resultado de la siguiente f\u00f3rmula:\n\n**PdeR (m) = 0.3333 x ICR(m-3) + 0.3333 x ICR(m-6) + 0.3334 x ICR(m-9)**\n\nEl precio asi determinado se ajustar\u00e1 al poder calor\u00edfico de cada embarque del mes (m). Para ello se tomar\u00e1 el poder calor\u00edfico certificado, de conformidad con lo dispuesto en el numeral 14.5 de la Cl\u00e1usula D\u00e9cima Cuarta del Contrato. Dicho precio para el per\u00edodo de transici\u00f3n no ser\u00e1 objeto de ajuste retroactivo con base en el concepto de la auditor\u00eda que se emita en enero de 2011; por lo que el primer ajuste retroactivo al que se refiere este numeral 14.3 se efectuar\u00e1 con base en el concepto de la auditor\u00eda que se emita en enero de 2012.\n\n1471.\n\nThe solution agreed upon by the parties to solve the lack of auditor consisted in establishing a *periodo de transici\u00f3n* during the first year of the Eighth Amendment (*i.e*. during the year 2010). During this Transition Period the parties agreed that\n\n- the weighting coefficients would be a fixed factor of 0,333; and\n\n- these coefficients were to be applied to the FOB Price applicable three, six, and nine months before each determination date.\n\n1472.\n\nOnce the Transition Period elapsed at the end of 2010, the standard system of weighting would apply, using those established *ex ante* by the independent auditor, who was to be appointed at the end of 2010.\n\n**c. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1473.\n\nClaimants say that the *Contralor\u00eda's* calculation of damages constitutes an unreasonable or arbitrary measure in violation of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty.1277\n\nC II, para. 259(d)(ii).\n\n1474.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees.\n\n1475.\n\nThe determination of the existence and quantum of damages made by the *Contralor\u00eda* in its Decision is biased, contrary to basic principles of legal reasoning and financial logic, and incompatible with the standard of conduct which Colombia undertook to provide to protected Swiss investors under Art. 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n1476.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of its own majority conclusions, namely that the standard for labelling the conduct of a State as unreasonable or arbitrary should be high, and that regulatory agencies, when performing the mission entrusted to them by law, should enjoy a high level of deference.1278\n\nArbitrator Garibaldi does not agree with the conclusions to which this paragraph refers, for the reasons stated in footnote 1269.\n\n1477.\n\nBut even applying these reinforced thresholds, the conclusion does not change. The calculation of damages is arbitrary and unreasonable.1279\n\nArbitrator Garibaldi agrees with this conclusion, on the ground that the calculation of damages is arbitrary and unreasonable to the point of shocking, or at least surprising, a sense of juridical propriety.\n\n1478.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has found the following arguments to be compelling:\n\n(i) Failure to Update and Improve the Tovar-Silva Report\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n1479.\n\nFirst, the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* Decision expressly states that the basis for the calculation of damages is the Tovar-Silva Report - a report which had been prepared four years before, at the start of the investigation, and a few months after the Transition Period had ended. It is difficult to understand why the *Contralor\u00eda* failed to update the Report by integrating and evaluating the market and production data that had been generated since the Report was first written.\n\n(ii) Flaws in the Methodology\n-----------------------------\n\n1480.\n\nSecond, the methodology applied by the Tovar-Silva Report is of startling simplicity: Ms. Tovar Silva simply calculated\n\n- (i) the Royalties which Colombia would have received during the Transition Period applying the formula agreed upon before the Eighth Amendment, and\n\n- (ii) those which it actually received applying the formula agreed upon in the Eighth Amendment.\n\nThe calculation was performed for the 12 months of the year 2010 (except for the Additional Royalties, where the calculation was from November 2009 through November 2010). The difference between both calculations was the amount of damage that Colombia was found to have incurred.\n\nFirst explanation\n-----------------\n\n1481.\n\nMs. Tovar Silva herself was aware of the weakness of her methodology. She understood that in long-term contracts like the Mining Contract, which was to run until 2032, it is legally improper and financially illogical to base the calculation of damages exclusively on the results for the first year in the life of the agreement.\n\n1482.\n\nTo solve this problem, in her report Ms. Tovar Silva gave the following reasoning:1280\n\n*\"[...] de acuerdo con las directrices institucionales el da\u00f1o causado habr\u00e1 de ser determinable y por extensi\u00f3n cuantificable, situaci\u00f3n que en los contratos de tracto sucesivo se diluye ante la posibilidad de compensaci\u00f3n de cargas contractuales, pero que en el caso objeto de estudio se ha consolidado plenamente como da\u00f1os por haber vencido el t\u00e9rmino definido por las partes como 'per\u00edodo de transici\u00f3n'\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-125, p. 26.\n\n1483.\n\nThe sole argument proffered by Ms. Tovar Silva, to justify her use of the one-year \"*periodo de transici\u00f3n*\" was that\n\n*\"[el da\u00f1o causado] se ha consolidado plenamente como da\u00f1os por haber vencido el t\u00e9rmino definido por las partes como 'periodo de transici\u00f3n'\".*\n\n1484.\n\nThis argument is difficult to follow. Once the one-year term agreed upon by the parties passed, the Transition Period expired. This is self-evident. What remains unexplained is why this self-evident occurrence should produce the effect that the damage allegedly suffered is \"fully consolidated\" as damages.\n\nSecond Explanation\n------------------\n\n1485.\n\nIn November 2012, Ms. Tovar Silva was asked by the *Contralor\u00eda* to provide a second report, clarifying her initial findings. In this supplementary report, Ms. Tovar Silva explained that she had examined the impact of the Eighth Amendment on the State\u2019s finances only during the Transition Period because this was the only period for which there was actual data.1281 This is her precise explanation:1282\n\n\"[...] *es de aclarar que en el caso de regalias se tom\u00f3 este periodo, que coincide con el definido contractualmente como \"per\u00edodo de transici\u00f3n\" en el numeral 14.3 de la Cl\u00e1usula D\u00e9cima Cuarta del Contrato 044-89, en raz\u00f3n a que es el per\u00edodo en el que se encontraban materializados los hechos generadores de regal\u00edas y contraprestaciones econ\u00f3micas; y a que dentro de la Indagaci\u00f3n Preliminar correspondiente al Auto No. 000720 del 19 de octubre de 2010 y a la fecha de elaboraci\u00f3n del informe de apoyo t\u00e9cnico se cont\u00f3 \u00fanicamente con los soportes de los embarques debidamente **efectuados** y reportados por C.I. Prodeco a Ingeominas en los cuatro (4) trimestres de 2010* [...]\". [Emphasis added, bold in the original]\n\nDoc. C-147.\n\nDoc. C-147, p. 4.\n\n1486.\n\nIn other words: Ms. Tovar Silva used the data from the Transition Period simply because these were the only available when she issued her Report in March 2011.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Opinion\n----------------------\n\n1487.\n\nMs. Tovar Silva failed to submit any remotely persuasive argument justifying her position, *i.e.* that the relevant period for the calculation of damages should be limited to the Transition Period.\n\n1488.\n\nWithin the structure of the Eighth Amendment, the Transition Period does not represent a time segment with a separate content. Prodeco\u2019s and Ingeominas\u2019 obligations during the Transition Period are the same as those during the remainder of the Contract life. So is the methodology for calculating the Coal Price.\n\n1489.\n\nThe *raison d\u2019etre* for the Transition Period is ancillary. The calculation of the Coal Reference Price requires that certain weighting coefficients be verified *ex ante* by an independent auditor. Ingeominas had not designated such auditors when the Eighth Amendment was executed in January of 2010. To solve this timing issue, the parties simply agreed to take three quarterly readings during 2010, and to give equal weight to each of them.\n\n1490.\n\nSumming up, neither the Tovar-Silva Report, nor the *Contralor\u00eda.\u2019* s Decision, nor the Reconsideration Decision, nor the Appeal Decision proffer any reasonable justification explaining why the one-year Transition Period, defined in the Eighth Amendment to solve the delay in Ingeominas\u2019 designating an independent auditor, should have any impact at all on the methodology used to calculate the damages suffered by Colombia as a consequence of Prodeco\u2019s actions.\n\n(iii) Failure to Use Simulations\n--------------------------------\n\n1491.\n\nThird, if damage is not to to be assessed at the very end of a long-term contract, the proper methodology for establishing damages prior to that time must be forward-looking and take into account the total duration of the agreement.\n\n1492.\n\nThis does not imply that the calculation cannot be performed until the end of the contract. It is also possible to run one or more simulations of the future development of a long-term contract, to make comparisons between different scenarios, and to discount the predicted cash flows to a common date. This was acknowledged by Ingeominas in its letter to Prodeco dated 12 June 2009, where it undertook to evaluate the interests of the Nation, measured in terms of \"the net present value\" of the project in its integrity.1283\n\nDoc. R-110, p. 1.\n\n1493.\n\nIn the course of the Hearing, Dra. Vargas was specifically asked by the Tribunal whether the *Contralor\u00eda* had followed the approach of using simulations. Her answer was that the economists within the *Contralor\u00eda* had indeed performed such simulations and that they were included in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.1284 If such simulations were indeed performed, it is totally incomprehensible why the Decision failed to take them into account, and instead settled for the deeply flawed calculation used in the Tovar-Silva Report.\n\nHT, Day 5, p. 1407, ll. 15-17.\n\n(iv) Additional Investment and Expansion of the Mine\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n1494.\n\nFourth, the methodology for calculation of damages used in the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision is not only unreasonable; it is also biased.\n\n1495.\n\nThe proven facts show that, as a *quid pro quo* for the reduction of the Royalties, Prodeco undertook the obligation to carry out additional investments and to expand the capacity of the Mine.\n\n1496.\n\nThe evidence is compelling:\n\n- *Considerando 6* of the Eighth Amendment makes a reference to the fact that its execution guarantees \"*la viabilidad de la expansi\u00f3n del proyecto minero*\";\n\n- Mr. Nagle, Prodeco's CEO, said in his deposition that the investments and production levels projected in the 2010 PTI were \"negotiation commitment(s)\" that \"led to them [Ingeominas] agreeing and us [Prodeco] agreeing to this *Otros\u00ed*\";1285\n\n- The final piece of evidence comes from former Minister Mart\u00ednez Torres himself; he confirmed in his deposition before the Tribunal that through the Eighth Amendment, Prodeco committed to increase production of the Mine beyond 8 MTA.1286\n\nHT, Day 3, (Mr. Nagle's deposition), p. 875, l. 22 - p. 876, l. 2.\n\nHT, Day 4, p. 1129, l. 5 - p. 1130, l. 7.\n\n1497.\n\nThe precise increase in investment was not formalized in the Eighth Amendment, but rather in the 2010 PTI, a quasi-contractual document, proposed by Prodeco and approved by Ingeominas, which included all the relevant figures.\n\n1498.\n\nA simple comparison between the 2006 PTI and the 2010 PTI shows the additional investment and expansion promised by Prodeco, and the additional Royalties which it was expected Ingeominas would receive:1287\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **2006 PTI** | **2010 PTI** |\n| Mine-life production | 116 MT | 254 MT |\n| Mine-life investment | USD 1,184 M | USD 1,477 M |\n| Mine-life Royalties | USD 671 M | USD 1,782 M |\n\nDoc. C-117, pp. 61, 191 and 200; Doc. C-78, p. 173. See paras. 368, 370 and 372 *supra*.\n\n1499.\n\nTo be proper, any calculation of damages must take into account the expansion of the Mine undertaken by Prodeco in exchange for the reduction of the Royalties, and the impact that such expansion would cause on the Royalties earned by Ingeominas.\n\n1500.\n\nIt is not appropriate to compare - as the *Contralor\u00eda* did - the Royalties which Ingeominas is receiving applying the Eighth Amendment *vis-\u00e0-vis* those it would have received if the Eighth Amendment had not been executed.\n\n1501.\n\nThe proper comparison is between\n\n- the Royalties which Prodeco would have paid, under the original Mining Contract *(i.e.* excluding the Eighth Amendment), assuming the production of coal deriving from the 2006 PTI, and\n\n- the Royalties Prodeco undertook to pay under the Eighth Amendment, assuming the increased production foreseen in the 2010 PTI.\n\n1502.\n\nThe methodology used in the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision totally disregarded the fact that, under the 2010 PTI, Prodeco assumed an obligation to increase its investment and to expand the Mine, resulting in an increased production of coal. Any evenhanded and fair calculation of the damage suffered by Colombia cannot obviate this commitment - especially because the proven facts show that Prodeco not only achieved the levels of investment promised in the 2010 PTI, but even substantially exceeded them.1288 These levels of investment led to an increase in the amount of coal mined, and eventually to an increase in the Royalties paid to Colombia.1289\n\nIn Section **III.(6).D** the Tribunal includes the details: Prodeco invested in the period 2011-2014 USD 885 M, exceding the investment anticipated in the 2010 PTI by USD 231 M.\n\nSee Section **III.(6).****E** with precise figures.\n\n1503.\n\nIn essence, the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision blew hot and cold at the same time:\n\n- To calculate the roayalties owed, it took into consideration increased production of coal resulting from the expansion of the mine;\n\n- But it disregarded the financial effort made by Prodeco precisely to find those increased levels of production.\n\n**d. Decision**\n---------------\n\n1504.\n\nSumming up, Claimants argue that the *Contralor\u00eda's* decision, establishing that the Eighth Amendment had caused damage to Colombia, is arbitrary and unreasonable. The Tribunal finds that the methodology on which the *Contralor\u00eda* based its decision to establish the damages allegedly caused to Colombia under the Eighth Amendment was indeed arbitrary and unreasonable. The level of arbitrariness and unreasonability is high and cannot be protected by the deference accorded to state agencies when performing supervisory tasks entrusted by law.1290\n\nArbitrator Garibaldi agrees with the conclusions reached in this paragraph (as well as the supporting analysis) but not, for the reasons set forth in footnote 1269, with the reference to \"deference accorded to state agencies\".\n\n1505.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls, however, that the standard to be applied under Art. 4(1) of the Treaty is \"unreasonable measures\", not \"arbitrary measures\". Consequently, the finding of arbitrariness has in itself no effects under the Treaty, except to the extent that, as already pointed out, arbitrariness implies unreasonableness. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that Colombia adopted an unreasonable measure, which impaired the investment in Colombia belonging to a protected Swiss investor, in breach of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n**C. Dolo**\n-----------\n\n1506.\n\nClaimants submit that the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision was unreasonable when it found that Prodeco acted wilfully to cause damage to the State; while the Republic argues the contrary: that in a well-reasoned decision the *Contralor\u00eda* found that Prodeco, a collaborator of the State, incurred in *conducta dolosa* and thus managed to reduce the compensation owed to Ingeominas.\n\n1507.\n\nThe Tribunal will first explore the concept of *dolo* in Colombian law (**a.**), it will then summarize the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* findings with regard to Prodeco's *dolo* (**b.**), and finally it will analyse whether the finding of *dolo* in the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s Decision can be labelled as arbitrary or unreasonable (**c.**).\n\n**a. The Concept of** ***Dolo***\n--------------------------------\n\n1508.\n\nArt. 5 of Law 610 of 2000 defines the requirements for incurring in fiscal liability:1291\n\n\"*La responsabilidad fiscal estar\u00e1 integrada por los siguientes elementos:*\n\n*- Una conducta dolosa o culposa atribuible a una persona que realiza gesti\u00f3n fiscal.*\n\n*- Un da\u00f1o patrimonial al Estado.*\n\n*- Un nexo causal entro los dos elementos anteriores\".*\n\nDoc. C-71, Art. 5.\n\n1509.\n\nThe first requirement is *dolo.*1292\n\nOr *culpa.* There is no discussion in the present case that Prodeco might have incurred in *culpa.*\n\n1510.\n\nAs Law 610 does not contain an independent definition of *dolo,* the meaning of this concept must be sought in the general principles of law.1293 Art. 63 of the Civil Code defines *dolo:*1294\n\n*\"El dolo consiste en la intenci\u00f3n positiva de inferir injuria a la persona o propiedad de otro\".*\n\nRPHB, para. 59, citing Colombian Constitutional Court Judgement C-619/02 (Doc. R-198).\n\nDoc. CL-172, p. 38.\n\n1511.\n\nThis notion of *dolo,* enshrined in the Civil Code, has been formally adopted by the *Contralor\u00eda* (and by the *Consejo de Estado* when reviewing such decisions) **.**1295; but in the fiscal liability decisions the interpretation given by the *Contralor\u00eda* has been expansive, and has tended to connect *dolo* with the contractor\u2019s fiduciary duties towards the State (blurring the distinction between *dolo* and *culpa,* the alternative requirement for the existence of fiscal liability).\n\nRPHB, pp. 61-62, quoting numerous supporting decisions.\n\n1512.\n\nIn its leading case, Decisi\u00f3n 015, the *Contralor\u00eda* followed this approach, stressing the contractor\u2019s duty to defend the *funci\u00f3n social* of the public contract: **.**1296\n\n\"Pregunta [el Sr. Cabrera] d\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la mala fe, se le responde que es precisamente en esa actitud mezquina y de desapego en donde est\u00e1 la mala fe, en donde est\u00e1 el dolo, su mala intenci\u00f3n de aprovecharse de unas circunstancias erradas para sacar mayor provecho y mayor lucro del que las reglas del mercado en ese momento le estaban ofreciendo.\n\nEs precisamente su conducta dolosa, su enga\u00f1o, de aprovecharse de las condiciones ofrecidas por la C\u00e1mara de Representantes para contratar, de transgredir su funci\u00f3n social que como contratista del Estado le obligaba a cumplir, que se le endilga y se le impone responsabilidad fiscal\". [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. RL-208, p. 50.\n\n1513.\n\nMr. Cabrera, the private individual who had contracted with the public administration, had delivered paper at the price offered by the *C\u00e1mara de los Diputados,* but the *Contralor\u00eda* found that he had acted with *dolo,* because he should have known that the price was excessive, and by not denouncing the situation he breached the \"*funci\u00f3n social*\" which he was bound to respect as a state contractor.\n\n**b. The** ***Contralor\u00eda*****'s Finding of** ***Dolo***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) The *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision\n--------------------------------\n\n1514.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision was issued in April 2015 and confirmed that Prodeco had incurred fiscal responsibility based on *dolo*.\n\n1515.\n\nThe starting point of the *Contralor\u00eda's* analysis was that Prodeco had wilfully permitted damage to the State\u2019s financial interests, in order to obtain more benefits, thereby acting with *dolo.*1297 Although the *Contralor\u00eda* recognized that any private contractor had the right to receive benefits from its economic activity, it found that it was improper for a contractor to try to receive higher benefits to the detriment of the State\u2019s interests.1298\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 109.\n\nDoc. C-32, pp. 85, 93 and 106.\n\n1516.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* additionally found that Prodeco had put in place a series of manoeuvres to pay a lower compensation to the State,1299 in particular:1300\n\n*\"El grado de culpabilidad que se le ha endilgado a PRODECO no se basa en la intenci\u00f3n legitima de impedir o detener p\u00e9rdidas, ni en la obtenci\u00f3n de mayores ingresos, circunstancias que por si solas no constituyen irregularidad alguna, como bien lo ha dicho el apoderado. Se fundamenta en la serie de maniobras desplegadas por PRODECO que se materializan, en c\u00f3mo rechazadas sus propuestas por INGEOMINAS, planteaba diferentes escenarios, c\u00f3mo [sic] pas\u00f3 entre otros, de desequilibrio econ\u00f3mico contractual, desacuerdo en la interpretaci\u00f3n de cl\u00e1usulas contractuales, falta de competitividad en el mercado aduci\u00e9ndose entonces desigualdad con otras empresas explotadoras de carb\u00f3n en Colombia, hasta expansi\u00f3n, pero con \u00e9sta disminuyendo el porcentaje de regalias a favor del Estado con el argumento de que entre mayor producci\u00f3n mayores ingresos a favor del mismo. En este \u00faltimo escenario se sostiene que tal disminuci\u00f3n se compensar\u00e1 m\u00e1s adelante, sin que se hubiese determinado de antemano forma y t\u00e9rmino para ello, salvo enunciados abstractos y gen\u00e9ricos\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 106.\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 85.\n\n1517.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* added that Prodeco was Ingeominas\u2019 \"collaborator\":1301\n\n\"*Pasa por alto el se\u00f1or apoderado que PRODECO tiene una relaci\u00f3n contractual sui generis, producto del contrato estatal suscrito mediante el cual se busca el cumplimiento de los fines del Estado, vinculo juridico en el que est\u00e1 involucrado el inter\u00e9s general, y por tal raz\u00f3n, adquiri\u00f3 la calidad o condici\u00f3n de 'colaborador' en el cumplimiento de tales fines\".*\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 87.\n\n1518.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* concluded that Prodeco had indeed incurred in *dolo* and justified its decision with the following argument:1302\n\n*\"asi las cosas, como se puede deducir de las pruebas, PRODECO desarroll\u00f3 una serie de maniobras con el fin de obtener la disminuci\u00f3n de las contraprestaciones econ\u00f3micas, maniobras de las cuales se desprende, entre otras circunstancias, que esta firma queria obtener el resultado sin parar en mientes en que podria ocasionarle una [sic] da\u00f1o a los intereses patrimoniales del Estado. Significa esto, que su inter\u00e9s primordial era obtener su propio beneficio, para lo cual desatendi\u00f3 en grado sumo su condici\u00f3n de colaborador en la consecuci\u00f3n de los fines estatales y teniendo al otro contratante (INGEOMINAS) como un particular, por lo que su conducta se califica de manera definitiva a t\u00edtulo de DOLO.\"* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 106.\n\n(ii) Reconsideration Decision\n-----------------------------\n\n1519.\n\nIn July 2015, the *Contralora Delegada* rejected Prodeco's *recurso de reposici\u00f3n.*1303\n\nDoc. C-35.\n\n1520.\n\nThe Reconsideration Decision insisted that Prodeco was a collaborator of the public administration and that the contractual relationship with the State implied a heightened responsibility for Prodeco.1304\n\nDoc. C-35, p. 54.\n\n1521.\n\nFinally, in an extensive sub-section the Reconsideration Decision gave a further explanation of the reasons which led to the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* conclusion that Prodeco had acted with *dolo.*1305\n\nDoc. C-35, pp. 58-70.\n\n1522.\n\nFirst, the Reconsideration Decision details the manoeuvres which gave rise to *dolo:*1306\n\n- First, in fabricating interpretative differences and forcing Ingeominas to the negotiation table;\n\n- Second, in presenting successive alternatives, once the previous alternative had been rejected by Ingeominas;\n\n- Third, in submitting different alternatives, which all implied a reduction of the income for the state.\n\nDoc. C-35, p. 60.\n\n1523.\n\nThe conclusion is the following: **.**1307\n\n*\"Ahora, \u00bfen qu\u00e9 consiste el dolo entonces en este caso? Tanto PRODECO como algunos funcionarios de INGEOMINAS estaban tan conscientes que una disminuci\u00f3n en las regal\u00edas ya pactadas en el contrato era lesivo [sic] a los intereses patrimoniales del Estado, que tuvieron que acudir a un argumento como un mayor volumen de explotaci\u00f3n cuando ni siquiera se hab\u00eda alcanzado el volumen acordado en el contrato inicial. Tal propuesta necesariamente tendr\u00eda que parecer razonable en la medida que para la mayor explotaci\u00f3n se requerir\u00eda, seg\u00fan los argumentos de los implicados una mayor inversi\u00f3n. Pero es de advertir que tampoco esa mayor producci\u00f3n ni la inversi\u00f3n se dio en el periodo de transici\u00f3n tal como se soport\u00f3 en fallo\".* [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. C-35, p. 61.\n\n1524.\n\nThe Reconsideration Decision thus gives a different reasoning to support its finding of *dolo:* Prodeco and Ingeominas were aware that a reduction of Royalties would injure the interests of the State. Consequently, Prodeco and Ingeominas had to resort to the argument of a higher production, when the volume agreed upon in the initial Contract had been achieved. But this higher production and investment did not materialize during the Transition Period.\n\n(iii) Appeal Decision\n---------------------\n\n1525.\n\nIn August 2015, the *Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica* issued the Appeal Decision in the *recurso de apelaci\u00f3n,* confirming the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision.1308\n\nDoc. C-37.\n\n1526.\n\nAs to the issue of *dolo,* the *Contralor General* noted the following:\n\n1527.\n\nFirst, Prodeco, by signing a contract with the public administration, became its collaborator and entered into a special relationship.1309\n\nDoc. C-37, p. 61.\n\n1528.\n\nSecond, Prodeco failed to adhere to this heightened level of responsibility. It imposed its desire to obtain profits over the collective interests of society, and it took advantage of the institutional frailty of Ingeominas.1310\n\nDoc. C-37, p. 62.\n\n1529.\n\nThird, the characterization of Prodeco\u2019s conduct as *dolosa* in the *Contralor\u00eda* 's Decision was accurate.1311 There were two fundamental reasons why Prodeco acted with *dolo* :\n\n- Its actions showed *\"una intenci\u00f3n de incrementar ileg\u00edtimamente sus ganancias derivadas del negocio, sin hacer un minimo esfuerzo por armonizarlas con los intereses estatales, obligaci\u00f3n que se deriva de su condici\u00f3n de colaborador de la administraci\u00f3n\";*\n\n- Additionally, *dolo* derives from the fact that Prodeco resorted to the argument that it would increase its investments and the volume of coal mined, but such increases did not materialize during the Transition Period (*i.e.* during the year 2010).1312\n\nDoc. C-37, pp. 62-64.\n\nDoc. C-37, pp. 63-64.\n\n**c. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1530.\n\nThe question before the Tribunal is whether the finding of the *Contralor\u00eda* that Prodeco acted with *dolo* constitutes an \"unreasonable measure\", which impairs Claimants\u2019 use and enjoyment of its investment and violates Art. 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n1531.\n\nArt. 63 of the Civil Code provides the general definition of *dolo* in Colombian law\n\n- a definition which is also relevant for the purposes of establishing fiscal liability: **.**1313\n\n*\"El dolo consiste en la intenci\u00f3n positiva de inferir injuria a la persona o propiedad de otro\".*\n\nDoc. CL-172, p. 38.\n\n1532.\n\n*Dolo* is thus intimately associated with the actor\u2019s intention of causing harm or damage to the counterparty or its assets.\n\nFiscal Liability Proceeding\n---------------------------\n\n1533.\n\nIn the various decisions adopted in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, the *Contralor\u00eda* developed three separate lines of reasoning to support its finding of *dolo;* all three are based on Prodeco\u2019s alleged intention of reducing its Royalty payments, thus causing damage to the Republic:\n\n- In the *Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n* the *Contralor\u00eda* finds that Prodeco had acted \"*a sabiendas de que con esta modificaci\u00f3n se disminuir\u00edan los ingresos\"* for the State;1314 the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision took up the same argument, adding that as a collaborator of the State, Prodeco had a heightened responsibility in avoiding that the State suffers damages;1315\n\n- The Decision also argued that Prodeco had had carried out \"a number of maneuvers\" to achieve a reduction in Royalties and to maximize its own profits;1316\n\n- The Reconsideration Decision reiterated and further developed the argument that Prodeco had carried out manoeuvres with the aim of causing damage to the financial interests of the State,1317 but then gave a twist to the argument: the *dolo* consisted in that Prodeco promised an increase in production and investment, but that increase had not materialized during the Transition Period.1318\n\nDoc C-24, p. 186.\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 109.\n\nDoc. C-32, p. 85.\n\nDoc. C-35, p. 60.\n\nDoc. C-35, p. 61.\n\n1534.\n\nThe three lines of reasoning developed by the *Contralor\u00eda* require, as a condition for the existence of *dolo,* that Prodeco sought to cause damage to the Republic by reducing its Royalty payments. The *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s position echoes Art. 63 of the Civil Code, which defines *dolo* by reference to the intention of causing harm or damage to a person or its assets.\n\n1535.\n\nIn the previous section, the Tribunal has already established that, as regards the determination of damages, the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision constituted an unreasonable measure, in breach of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty. The *Contralor\u00eda* has thus failed to prove that the execution of the Eighth Amendment caused any damage to Colombia.\n\n1536.\n\nThe Tribunal is now called to decide whether the *Contralor\u00eda* 's finding that Prodeco acted with *dolo* also implied an unreasonable measure, contrary to Art. 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n1537.\n\nIn the present case, there is no certainty that Prodeco\u2019s conduct caused any damage to the Republic. Since no damage has been validly established, the question whether Prodeco acted with *dolo, i.e.* with the intention to cause damage to the Republic, and whether in so finding the *Contralor\u00eda* acted unreasonably, is moot. Such question will only become relevant if and when the *Contralor\u00eda* properly determines that the Eighth Amendment actually was harmful to the interests of the Republic.\n\n**D. Legitimate Expectations to a Non-Arbitrary and Not Unreasonable Application of the Fiscal Control Regime**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1538.\n\n*Pro memoria:* Claimants allege that:\n\n- they had legitimate expectations that the fiscal control regime, if applied to Prodeco, would be applied fairly, that is, in applying the criteria of liability of that regime the *Contralor\u00eda* would not act in an abusive, improper, or unreasonable manner, and that\n\n- the *Contralor\u00eda* frustrated those expectations, in breach of Art. 4(2) of the Treaty.\n\nThe Tribunal postponed consideration of this claim, because the issue rests on considerations that largely coincide with those best examined in respect of the claim based on unreasonable measures.\n\n1539.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the *Contralor\u00eda* applied an unreasonable methodology to establish the damages allegedly caused to Colombia by the Eighth Amendment and, accordingly, Respondent took an unreasonable measure that impaired Claimants\u2019 investment, in violation of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty. In light of this conclusion, the analysis of Claimants\u2019 remaining claim for breach of Art. 4(2) can be brief.\n\n1540.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, although Claimants did not have legitimate expectations that the fiscal liability regime would not be applicable to Prodeco, they did have legitimate expectations that the regime, if applied at all, would be applied in a reasonable manner. Since the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* finding of damage caused by Prodeco to the State was unreasonable, Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations were frustrated. In this respect, then, the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019s* actions also breached the FET standard of Art. 4(2) of the Treaty.\n\n(3) **The Alleged Responsibility of Colombia Arising from the Conduct of the SGC/ANM**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1541.\n\nClaimants submit that, apart from their claim based on the conduct of the *Contralor\u00eda*, Colombia incurred responsibility as a consequence of the conduct of the SGC/ANM. The conduct of the SGC/ANM that allegedly gave rise to such responsibility was filing the Procedure for Contractual Annulment with the Colombian courts:\n\n- First, Claimants submit that the conduct of the SGC/ANM breached their legitimate expectations: such conduct directly contradicted the express representation given by Ingeominas in the Eighth Amendment, stating that such Amendment was in the interest of the State; **.**1319\n\n- Second, Claimants also argue that the SGC/ANM has conducted itself in an inconsistent, arbitrary, unpredictable, and non-transparent manner, because the Eighth Amendment induced Prodeco to make investments and expand the Mine, and the Mining Agency is now reneging on the commitments assumed therein.1320\n\nC I, paras. 196-198; C II, para. 270(a); HT, Day 1, p. 163, l. 9 - p. 164, l. 1.\n\nC II, para. 270(b) and (c).\n\n1542.\n\nRespondent counters that the filing of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment involves an ordinary legal recourse to state courts, which cannot be contrary to Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations. Absent denial of justice, which Claimants are not pleading, it is no breach of the FET standard to submit a contract for nullification by the courts.1321\n\nR II, paras. 632-633, referring to *Azinian,* para. 100 and to *Alghanim & Sons,* para. 350.\n\nFacts\n-----\n\n1543.\n\nPursuant to clause 39, the Mining Contract is subject to Colombian law and to the jurisdiction of the Colombian courts.1322 Colombian courts are thus empowered to adjudicate all disputes arising out of the Mining Contract - including any dispute as regards the validity of the Contract or of its Amendments.\n\nDoc. C-2, clause 39, p. 38.\n\n1544.\n\nOn 30 March 2012, after an unsuccessful request for mandatory conciliation, the SGC filed the Procedure for Contractual Annulment with the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca,* invoking clause 39 of the Mining Contract. The SGC requested that the court declare the nullity of the Eighth Amendment, arguing that such Amendment was detrimental to the general interest of the State: the Amendment had been executed on the assumption that it would generate benefits for the State, but this scenario had not materialized.1323\n\nDoc. C-140, pp. 3 and 34-35.\n\n1545.\n\nSubsidiarily, the SGC requested that the *Tribunal Administrativo* revise the Eighth Amendment, *\"de tal manera que se preserve el inter\u00e9s general, recuperando y manteniendo a un futuro el equilibrio de la ecuaci\u00f3n financiera del Contrato 044/89, perdido con el desarrollo del otros\u00ed No. 8\".*\n\n1546.\n\nIt is undisputed that in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca* has not issued a decision on the merits of the case.1324\n\nC I, para. 143; Compass Lexecon I, para. 58; R I, para. 261; R II, para. 383; HT, Day 1, p. 155, l. 4.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n1547.\n\nThe Tribunal finds for Respondent: the filing of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment does not constitute a violation of Art. 4 of the Treaty.\n\n1548.\n\nClaimants say that their legitimate expectations have been breached (**A.**), and that the conduct of the SGC/ANM was unreasonable (**B.**). The Tribunal considers these arguments to be without merit.\n\n**A. Legitimate Expectations**\n------------------------------\n\n1549.\n\nThe conduct imputed to the SGC/ANM simply consists in the filing of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment, an action before the domestic court with jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes arising from the Mining Contract. The SGC/ANM is entitled to do so under clause 39 of the Contract.\n\n1550.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the conduct of the SGC/ANM does not breach Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations: Colombia never made any representation or gave any assurance to Claimants that its Mining Agency would abstain from enforcing such rights as it might have under the Contract or under Colombian law.\n\n1551.\n\nIt is true that Ingeominas executed, registered and initially complied with the Eighth Amendment, while its successor organizations are now seeking annulment of the Amendment before the Colombian courts. It is also true that in *Considerando 6* Ingeominas represented that \"*con el presente acuerdo se garantizan los intereses del Estado*\".\n\n1552.\n\nBut the execution of a contract, even if such contract includes a representation that it is valid and binding, does not create a legitimate expectation that, if subsequently one of the parties discovers that an alleged cause for annulment pre-existed or has arisen, such party will abstain from raising a dispute in the proper forum. To understand the contrary would lead to the untenable general conclusion that actions requesting annulment of a contract are barred because such actions will breach the counter-party\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n**B. Arbitrariness or Unreasonableness**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1553.\n\nClaimants also submit that the SGC/ANM\u2019s conduct was arbitrary and unreasonable.\n\n1554.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share this opinion.\n\n1555.\n\nUnder the Mining Contract, the SGC/ANM is obligated to submit disputes to the jurisdiction of the Colombian courts. It is a fact that a dispute has arisen: the SGC/ANM now takes the view that the Mining Contract executed by Ingeominas is null and void (or subsidiarily that it must be revised). In such case, the proper conduct, in accordance with the very provisions of the Contract, is to submit the case to adjudication in the agreed forum. That is precisely what the SGC/ANM has done - as it was entitled to and obliged under the Mining Contract.\n\n1556.\n\nThere is a second argument. The Colombian courts have not yet ruled on the merits in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment. Consequently, there can be no argument that Claimants have already suffered a denial of justice - and Claimants acknowledge that no claim for denial of justice is being pursued in this procedure.1325\n\nC II, para. 225.\n\n1557.\n\nRespondent says that, absent an action tantamount to denial of justice, it is no breach of FET to submit a contract for nullification before the proper court.1326 The Tribunal concurs: the mere filing by the SGC/ANM of the Procedure for Contractual Annulment cannot give rise to a violation of Art. 4 of the Treaty.\n\nR II para. 633, invoking *Azinian;* para. 100 and *Alghanim & Sons,* para. 350.\n\n1558.\n\nIt is important to note that the conduct of SGC/ANM of which Claimants complain is merely filing with the competent Colombian court a claim for the annulment of the Eighth Amendment. As the Colombian judiciary has not made a decision on the matter, Claimants cannot (and in fact do not) make a claim for breach of the FET standard in the form of denial of justice. And since the Eighth Amendment has not been annulled, but remains in full force and effect, Claimants have suffered no damage attributable to the actions of the Colombian judiciary or the filing of the claim for annulment by the SGC/ANM.\n\n**VII. REPARATION**\n-------------------\n\n1559.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal must establish the reparation to which Claimants are entitled to offset the effects of Colombia\u2019s international wrong on Claimants\u2019 investment. The Tribunal will first briefly summarize the Parties\u2019 positions (**(1)** and **(2)**) and will then decide the issue **(3)**.\n\n**(1) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n1560.\n\nClaimants are claiming by way of restitution an order that Respondent: **.**1327\n\n- repay to Prodeco the Fiscal Liability Amount, and\n\n- any other sums that Colombia may, up to the date of the Award, have ordered Prodeco to pay by way of Royalties or GIC calculated on the basis that the Eighth Amendment should not apply,\n\nC I, para. 310(f); C II, para. 374(f).\n\n1561.\n\nThey are also claiming as compensation that the above payments be:\n\n- adjusted from the date of payment to the time of the date of the award at an annual rate of 9.69%, compounded semi-annually.\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n1562.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants cannot be compensated for the Fiscal Liability Amount paid for three reasons:\n\n- First, because Claimants and their legal advisors have expressed their utmost confidence that the *Contralor\u00eda* Decision will be revoked and Prodeco will be fully reimbursed for the amount paid; this has been stated in Prodeco\u2019s 2015 financial statements; **.**1328\n\n- Second, even if the judicial recourse against the *Contralor\u00eda* s Decision were not successful, Prodeco could recover the amounts paid from the Government officers who were held jointly and severally liable by the *Contralor\u00eda;* Prodeco\u2019s failure to do so is contrary to its duty to mitigate damages; **.**1329\n\n- Third, Prodeco could have requested the suspension of the effects of the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision, which would have enabled them to delay payment until a decision in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment is rendered.1330\n\nR I, para. 563, R II, para. 854.\n\nR I, para. 567, R II, para. 858.\n\nR I, para. 568.\n\n1563.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that any recovery by Claimants must be significantly reduced to reflect Claimants\u2019 contribution to their own losses. Claimants\u2019 behaviour materially contributed to the losses, providing Ingeominas with misleading information, influencing Ingeominas\u2019 Director Ballesteros and breaching mandatory procedures for amending *Contratos de Gran Miner\u00eda.*1331\n\nR I, paras. 700-710.\n\n(3) **Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1564.\n\nThe Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the *Contralor\u00eda* applied an unreasonable and arbitrary methodology to establish the damages allegedly suffered by Colombia due to the execution of the Eighth Amendment. This conduct of the *Contralor\u00eda* is attributable to the Republic of Colombia and implies a violation of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.1332\n\nSee para. **VI.3.(2.2).B****.d** *supra.*\n\n1565.\n\nThe Tribunal must now determine the appropriate reparation for Claimants\u2019 loss.\n\n**A. The Standard of Full Reparation**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1566.\n\nThe legal standard which the Tribunal must apply is not disputed by the Parties: it is the principle of full reparation of the injury caused, firmly established in jurisprudence since the PCIJ\u2019s seminal *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* decision.1333 The PCIJ held that full reparation was an essential and consistent principle of customary international law and should be applied even in the absence of any specific provision setting forth an indemnification obligation in the treaty underlying the dispute:1334\n\n\"It is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form. Reparation therefore is the indispensable complement of a failure to apply a convention and there is no necessity for this to be stated in the convention itself.\"\n\n*Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany v. Poland), PCIJ, Claim for Indemnity (Jurisdiction), 26 July 1927, Series A, No. 9 (1927).\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory* (as quoted in Art. 31 of the ILC Articles, Doc. CL-24).\n\n1567.\n\nThe principle of full reparation, as adopted by the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* decision, was subsequently codified in the International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts [\"**ILC Articles**\"].1335\n\nInternational Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries (2001), Doc. CL-24.\n\n1568.\n\nArt. 11(1) of the Treaty permits an investor to claim for breaches of the Treaty if those breaches cause \"loss or damage to him or his investment\". However, the only compensation standard expressly set out in the Treaty is that for lawful expropriation (Art. 6). The Treaty provides no compensation formula for non-expropriatory breaches of the Treaty. This gap must be covered applying customary international law, and, to the extent possible, extending by analogy certain rules, which the Treaty provides for expropriation, to other violations.\n\n1569.\n\nCustomary international law rules on reparation for breaches of international law are set out in the ILC Articles **.**1336.\n\nDoc. CL-24.\n\n1570.\n\nArt. 31 of the ILC Articles states the principle that the injury caused by internationally wrongful acts must give rise to full reparation **.**1337:\n\n\"1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\"\n\nDoc. CL-24, Art. 31.\n\n1571.\n\nThis principle of full reparation has been consistently applied by investment tribunals - including in cases of non-expropriatory breaches **.**1338.\n\n*Azurix,* paras. 421-422; *S.D. Myers,* paras. 303-319; *MTD,* para. 238; and *Feldman,* para. 197.\n\nRestitution\n-----------\n\n1572.\n\nPursuant to Art. 35 of the ILC Articles, restitution - as opposed to compensation -is the first of the forms of reparation available to a party injured by an internationally wrongful act. It involves the re-establishment, as far as possible, of the situation which existed prior to to the commission of the internationally wrongful act:\n\n\"A State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make restitution, that is, to re-establish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided and to the extent that restitution:\n\n(a) is not materially impossible;\n\n(b) does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation.\"\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n1573.\n\nClaimants\u2019 basic claim is straightforward: Claimants request that, by way of restitution, Colombia repay to Prodeco de Fiscal Liability Amount, which is the only amount that Prodeco paid to the *Contralor\u00eda.*\n\n1574.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees.\n\n1575.\n\nRespondent\u2019s treaty breach - the *Contralor\u00eda's* wrongful calculation of the damage caused by the execution of the Eighth Amendment - resulted in Prodeco paying to the *Contralor\u00eda* the Fiscal Liability Amount, on 19 January 2016. Consequently, in order to re-establish the situation that existed before Colombia violated the Treaty, the Republic is under an obligation to repay to Prodeco the amount improperly collected.\n\n1576.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in this case restitution is not materially impossible nor does it impose a disproportionate burden on the party in breach - the two factors which exclude the possibility of restitution pursuant to Art. 34 of the ILC Articles.\n\n1577.\n\nIn certain cases, to ensure full reparation restitution must be completed by compensation. Art. 36 of the ILC Articles provides further guidance **.**1339:\n\n\"1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution.\n\n2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\"\n\nDoc. CL-24, Art. 36.\n\n1578.\n\nThis rule is relevant in this case since the Tribunal must supplement restitution with compensation in the form of interest in order to achieve full reparation. Claimants\u2019 proven damage resulting from Colombia\u2019s breach of the Treaty is limited to the payment of the Fiscal Liability Amount (and the payment of interest - a question addressed in Section **VIII** *infra).*\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Counter-Arguments**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1579.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimants should not be awarded the Fiscal Liability Amount for three reasons:\n\n- That Claimants are confident that the Annulment Procedure will be successful and, as a result the *Contralor\u00eda's* Decision will be revoked and Prodeco will be reimbursed the Fiscal Liability Amount;1340\n\n- Prodeco can recover the Fiscal Liability Amount from the government officials who were held jointly and severally liable by the *Contralor\u00eda;*1341 and\n\n- Claimants could have requested the suspension of the effects of the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s Decision, and this would have enabled Claimants to delay payment until a decision in the Procedure for Contractual Annulment but decided not to do so.1342\n\nR I, paras. 563-566.\n\nR I, para. 567.\n\nR I, paras. 568-569.\n\n1580.\n\nRespondent\u2019s counter-arguments have no merit.\n\n1581.\n\nFirst, whether Claimants are confident that the Annulment Procedure will be successful and that the *Contralor\u00eda* will reimburse the Fiscal Liability Amount, is irrelevant. Colombia has committed an international wrong, and Claimants are entitled to full reparation. The hypothetical future outcome of the Annulment Procedure does not affect Claimants\u2019 right *hic et nunc* to have their existing damage compensated*.*\n\n1582.\n\nSecond, Colombia\u2019s second argument is also without merit. Prodeco may or not have the right under Colombian law to claim against the civil servants who were found guilty in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.1343 But this right, even if it exists, does not permit Colombia to evade responsibility for its own Treaty breaches. Based on a demand that has been found to be inconsistent with Colombia\u2019s international obligations, Prodeco paid the alleged damages to the *Contralor\u00eda* ; the legal consequence under international law is that Claimants are entitled to restitution of such damages from Colombia, regardless of whether Prodeco may have an action under Colombian law against the other civil servants, who incidentally cannot be held responsible for Colombia\u2019s wrongdoing under the Treaty.\n\nThe right is doubtful: Claimants initially added Mr. Ballesteros, Mr. Mart\u00ednez, Mr. Ceballos, and Ms. Aristiz\u00e1bal as potential co-defendants in their request for annulment filed before Colombian Courts in March 2016. However, the Court refused to admit Prodeco\u2019s request unless it excluded such parties (see Doc. R -2, p. 7 and Doc. C-273, p. 7).\n\n1583.\n\nThird, Prodeco took the decision to pay the Fiscal Liability Amount in January 2016, under protest and in order to avoid forfeiture of the Mining Contract:1344\n\n*\"De manera expresa aclaro que el pago aludido lo efectu\u00f3 **PRODECO** con el \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito de mitigar los efectos asociados a la responsabilidad fiscal que incorrecta e indebidamente se le atribuy\u00f3 [...] lo cual de ninguna manera minimiza, ni afecta y menos puede entenderse como una renuncia a los argumentos de **PRODECO** y de sus accionistas [...]*\". [Emphasis in the original]\n\nDoc. C-180, p. 3.\n\n1584.\n\nProdeco then filed the Annulment Procedure with the *tribunal contencioso-administrativo* in April 2016. Respondent\u2019s argument that Prodeco could have asked the Court for the suspension of the payment is factually wrong: Prodeco had already paid the Fiscal Liability Amount four months before. Legally, the argument is irrelevant: the possibility of asking a local judge for the suspension of a payment does not relieve Colombia from its international-law obligation to repair in full the harm caused.\n\n1585.\n\nFinally, Respondent also argues that any recovery by Claimants must be significantly reduced to reflect Claimants\u2019 contribution to their own losses.\n\n1586.\n\nThe argument is without merit. The wrongful act committed by Colombia was the unreasonable calculation of damage by the *Contralor\u00eda.* Respondent argues that Claimants\u2019 allegedly contributory behaviour was to provide Ingeominas with misleading information, to influence Ingeominas\u2019 Director Ballesteros and to breach mandatory procedures for amending *Contratos de Gran Miner\u00eda.*1345 These assertions remain unproven,1346 but even if proven the alleged facts did not contribute to Respondent\u2019s wrongful behaviour.\n\nR I, paras. 700-710.\n\nSee section **V.1****.(5)** *supra.*\n\n**C. Summary**\n--------------\n\n1587.\n\nSumming up, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that, by way of restitution for Colombia\u2019s breach of Arts. 4(1) and (2) of the Treaty, the Republic must repay Prodeco the Fiscal Liability Amount.\n\n1588.\n\nThe amount claimed by the *Contralor\u00eda* in its Decision was denominated in COP, and amounted to COP 60.0 billion.1347 Prodeco paid this amount, plus 12% interest accrued until the actual date of payment on 19 January 2016, resulting in a total amount of COP 63 billion.1348 In accordance with Claimants\u2019 expert, this amount in COP equated to USD 19.1 million, based on the exchange rate on the date of payment.1349 The calculation is not disputed. Respondent has explicitly accepted that the amount paid by Prodeco amounted to USD 19.1 million.1350\n\nThe precise amount is COP 60,023,730,368,33; see Doc. C-32.\n\nThe precise amount is COP 63,003,538,571,82; see Doc. CLEX-4.\n\nCompass Lexecon I, para. 96.\n\nR I, para. 560.\n\n1589.\n\nClaimants are asking the Tribunal in its Reply that it order repayment of the Fiscal Liability Amount denominated in USD.1351\n\nC II, para. 374(f).\n\n1590.\n\nArt. 6 of the Treaty says that compensation for expropriation shall be paid in \"freely convertible currency\". This rule can be extended by analogy to compensation due for other breaches of the Treaty. Claimants ask that the compensation be denominated in US currency. The USD indeed being the primary \"freely convertible currency\" in the world, and Respondent having accepted that the Fiscal Liability Amount equals USD 19.1 million, the Tribunal sees no difficulty in accepting the request.\n\n1591.\n\nThe impact of currency denomination on the calculation of interest will be addressed in Section **VIII** *infra.*\n\n**VIII. INTEREST**\n------------------\n\n1592.\n\nClaimants claim pre and post-award interest at a rate equivalent to Prodeco\u2019s cost of capital as reflected in its WACC, compounded semi-annually, on all amounts awarded. Respondent does not agree with Claimants\u2019 proposed calculation of the applicable interest rate. The Tribunal will briefly summarize the Parties\u2019 positions (**1.** and **2.**) and will render its decision (**3.**)\n\n**(1) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n1593.\n\nClaimants submit that interest is a component of full compensation under customary international law.1352 Claimants explain that a State\u2019s duty to make reparation arises immediately after its unlawful actions cause harm. Thus, to the extent that payment is delayed, the investor loses the opportunity to invest the compensation.1353\n\nC I, para. 293.\n\nC I, para. 293.\n\n1594.\n\nClaimants have requested that the Fiscal Liability Amount be adjusted from the date of payment of such amount to the Colombian authorities until the date of the Award, at an annual rate of 9.69%, compounded semi-annually.1354 Claimants also request post-award interest on the same terms, or at such other rate and compounding period as the Tribunal determines will ensure full reparation.1355\n\nC I, para. 310(f); C II, para. 374(f).\n\nCII, para. 374(i).\n\n1595.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the rate at which interest should accrue must ensure full reparation; therefore, the applicable rate should be equivalent to the return that Claimants would have earned had they been able to invest the funds of which they were deprived.1356 In Claimants\u2019 submission, interest should accrue at Prodeco\u2019s WACC (calculated by Claimants\u2019 expert to be 8.5% and later updated to 9.69%), because:\n\n- Claimants\u2019 cost of capital is a reasonable proxy for the return that Claimants would otherwise have earned on the amounts owed to them as a result of Colombia\u2019s Treaty breaches;1357 and\n\n- The cost of raising funds to replace the Fiscal Liability Amount is Prodeco\u2019s cost of capital, not a risk-free rate.1358\n\nC I, paras. 297-298.\n\nC I, para. 305.\n\nCII, para. 354.\n\n1596.\n\nInterest is not an award in addition to reparation, it is rather a component of full reparation which gives effect to that principle.1359 This full reparation would not be achieved if the award were to deprive Claimants of compound interest. For this reason, Claimants request that any interest awarded be subject to reasonable compounding.1360\n\nC I, para. 296.\n\nC I, para. 306; CII, paras. 356-357.\n\n1597.\n\nAs regards the periodicity of the compounding, Claimants assert, on the basis of case law, that a commercially reasonable period for compounding both pre-and post-award interest would be six months.1361\n\nC I, para. 308; C II para. 357.\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n1598.\n\nRespondent does not dispute that interest is due in this case but claims that the applicable interest rate should not be Prodeco\u2019s cost of capital but a risk-free rate. Moreover, the Tribunal should award simple interest, and if it were to award compound interest, compounding should be made annually.\n\n1599.\n\nColombia argues that the Tribunal should not use the Project\u2019s WACC to calculate interest but a risk-free rate because the Fiscal Liability Amount does not represent an investment (or bore any risk) that warrants compensating them for risk.1362 Alternatively, if the Tribunal considers that Claimants should be awarded pre-award interest at a rate that compensates for risk, interest should be calculated based on Colombia\u2019s sovereign default risk because by paying the Fiscal Liability Amount to Colombia, Prodeco has effectively extended a loan to the State.1363\n\nR I, paras. 676-685; R II paras. 953-959.\n\nR I, paras. 686-690; R II, paras. 961-963.\n\n1600.\n\nAs regards compounding, although increasingly used in investment arbitration, Respondent submits that it cannot be considered as a principle of international law,1364 and it is banned by Art. 2235 of Colombian Civil Code.1365 Thus, Colombia requests that simple interest is awarded, and if the Tribunal were to award compound interest, compounding be carried out annually.1366\n\nR I, para. 692.\n\nR I, para. 695; R II, paras. 964-972.\n\nR I, paras. 698-699; R II, paras. 973-974.\n\n**(3) Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1601.\n\nEvery decision on interest must distinguish the rate, calculation methodology, *dies a quo, dies ad quem,* and principal amount.\n\n1602.\n\nSince the Tribunal has determined that the compensation due to Claimants is equivalent to the Fiscal Liability Amount, *i.e.* USD 19.1 million, that is the principal amount.\n\nRate\n----\n\n1603.\n\nClaimants have requested that interest be granted over the Fiscal Liability Amount from the date of payment at an annual rate of 9.69%, because they consider that Prodeco could have invested the Fiscal Liability Amount in their mining operations, which would have generated an expected return equal to the cost of capital of the project.1367\n\nCompass Lexecon I, para. 96.\n\n1604.\n\nRespondent says that, if the Tribunal were to award restitution, interest should be calculated at a risk-free rate, or alternatively, based on Colombia\u2019s sovereign default risk.\n\n1605.\n\nArt. VI of the BIT provides that compensation for expropriation shall include \"interest at a normal commercial rate\". Although the rule refers to expropriation, it can be extended by analogy to compensation for violations of other provisions of the BIT.1368\n\n*Lemire (Award),* para. 352.\n\n1606.\n\nNone of the interest rates proposed by the Parties can be said to fit into the definition of \"normal commercial rates\". Claimants\u2019 proposal that the interest rate be equivalent to its WACC would over-compensate Prodeco, since it would allow it to earn a return without bearing commensurate risk. Respondent\u2019s proposal that interest be calculated applying the short-term rate on US treasury bills also fails to qualify as \"normal commercial rates\" - US treasury bills finance the US Government, not commercial enterprises.\n\n1607.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that LIBOR is the most widely used \"normal commercial rate\", since it is universally accepted as a valid reference for the calculation of variable interest rates. LIBOR is determined by the equilibrium between supply and demand, representing the interest rate at which banks can borrow funds from other banks in the London interbank market; it is fixed daily by the British Bankers\u2019 Association for different maturities and for different currencies.\n\n1608.\n\nSince the compensation is expressed in USD, the appropriate rate of reference for the calculation of interest should be the LIBOR rates for six-month deposits denominated in USD.\n\n1609.\n\nLoans to customers invariably include a surcharge, which must be inserted in the calculation of interest to reflect the financial loss caused to Prodeco by the temporary withholding of money. Claimants would not be fully compensated if the interest rate applied did not include an appropriate margin.1369 The Tribunal considers that 2% is a reasonable margin, reflecting the surcharge that an average borrower would have to pay for obtaining financing based on LIBOR.1370\n\nRespondent admits as much when it points to the fact that Claimants have obtained financing at LIBOR + 0.87% (R II, para. 956).\n\nR III, para. 31; *Lemire (Award),* para. 356; *PSEG,* para. 90; *Sempra,* para. 137; and *Rumeli,* para. 227.\n\nCalculation methodology\n-----------------------\n\n1610.\n\nClaimants have requested that interest should be compounded semi -annually, while Respondent proposes that simple interest be applied, alleging that capitali sation is banned by Art. 2235 of Colombian Civil Code.1371 Alternatively, Colombia requests that if the Tribunal were to award compound interest, compounding ought to be carried out annually.1372\n\nR I, para. 695; R II, paras. 964-972.\n\nR I, paras. 698-699; R II, paras. 973-974.\n\n1611.\n\nThe question whether interest should be accumulated periodically to the principal has been the subject of diverging decisions in international investment case law. Older case law1373 tended to repudiate this possibility, but more recent case law tends to accept annual or semi-annual capitalisation of unpaid interest.1374\n\n*CMS,* paras. 470-471.\n\n*MTD,* para. 251; *PSEG,* para. 348; *Lemire (Award),* para. 361.\n\n1612.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the more recent decisions. Loan agreements in which interest is calculated on the basis of LIBOR plus a margin usually include a provision that unpaid interest must be capitalised at the end of the interest period, and will thereafter be considered as capital and accrue interest. The financial reason for this provision is that an unpaid lender has to resort to the LIBOR market in order to fund the amounts due but defaulted, and the lender\u2019s additional funding costs have to be covered by the defaulting borrower.\n\n1613.\n\nThis principle implies that, if Claimants had taken out a LIBOR loan to pay the Fiscal Liability Amount, the bank would have insisted that unpaid interest be capitalised at the end of each interest period. Consequently, if Claimants are to be kept fully indemnified for the harm suffered, interest owed under the Award should be capitalised at the end of each six-month interest period.\n\n1614.\n\nRespondent has alleged that compound interest is prohibited under Art. 2235 of Colombian Civil Code.1375 The rule is inapposite, because the accrual of interest on compensation due under the Treaty is a question of international law.1376\n\n*\"La regla tercera del art\u00edculo 1617 del C.C. [...]prohibe el cobro de intereses sobre aqu\u00e9llos \"atrasados\", es decir, aplicando el criterio del articulo 28 ib., lo pendiente, lo insatisfecho o no cumplido en su oportunidad, vale decir, para el caso sub-lite, los intereses que no fueron cubiertos en el tiempo u oportunidad se\u00f1alado para ello en el respectivo negocio juridico. Y, la raz\u00f3n de la disposici\u00f3n, es el querer del legislador de evitar que se sancione doblemente el incumplimiento contractual, lo que aconteceria si se permitiese el cobro de intereses sobre intereses atrasados pendientes de pago.*\n\nR I, para. 695; R II, paras. 964-972.\n\nMoreover, Article 2235 of the Colombian Civil Code refers to mutual or consumer loans, which have no bearing for the present case. Furthermore, the Judgment of the Colombian State Council - which was materially misquoted by Respondent - clarifies that Colombian law only bans compound interest if the interest is due and accrued, but otherwise compound interest is allowed. Colombian Council of State, Judgment of 27 March 1992, Doc. R-348, p. 9-10. In the paragraph immediately below the one quoted by Respondent the State Council states:\n\n1615.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal decides that due and unpaid interest shall be capitalised semi-annually, from the *dies a quo.*\n\n*Dies a quo*\n------------\n\n1616.\n\nClaimants request that interest be awarded since the date of payment of the Fiscal Liability Amount. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees. Interest should start accruing from the date of payment of the Fiscal Liability Amount, *i.e.* 19 January 2016, the date when Claimants\u2019 damage materialized, and consequently the appropriate date for interest to start accruing.\n\n*Dies ad quem*\n--------------\n\n1617.\n\nInterest shall accrue until all amounts owed in accordance with this Award have been finally paid.\n\n1618.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal decides that from 19 January 2016 until the date of payment, the principal amount of USD 19.1 million shall accrue interest at rate of LIBOR for six- month deposits plus a margin of 2% capitalised semi-annually.\n\n*Por consiguiente, son estos intereses colocados en condiciones moratorias los que no permiten, de conformidad con la norma reglamentada del C. C. el cobro de nuevos intereses. Pero, a contrario sensu, los intereses no atrasados si pueden llegar a producir intereses.*\n\n*Ahora bien; no se opone a lo anterior, [...] la norma establecida en el art\u00edculo 2235 del mismo C\u00f3digo Civil, seg\u00fan la cual \"se prohibe estipular intereses de intereses\" que se refiere espec\u00edficamente al mutuo o pr\u00e9stamo de consumo, La \"armon\u00eda legis\" impone la necesidad de concluir, para evitar la oposici\u00f3n entre los dos art\u00edculos del mismo Estatuto o el sometimiento del contrato de mutuo a un criterio diferente a aqu\u00e9l que opera para el resto de las obligaciones dinerarias provenientes de fuente distinta, lo cual no parece razonable, que el art\u00edculo 2235, en cuanto prohibe cobrar intereses de intereses, debe entenderse y aplicarse teniendo en cuenta el criterio sentado por la regla tercera del art\u00edculo 1617 del mismo C\u00f3digo Civil. Y, sirve tambi\u00e9n de fuente de interpretaci\u00f3n, para determinar los alcances del art\u00edculo 2235 del C. C., la estipulaci\u00f3n que contiene el art\u00edculo 886 del C\u00f3digo de Comercio, en cuanto marca claramente una voluntad del legislador en el sentido de prohibir el cobro de intereses sobre intereses \u00fanicamente respecto de aqu\u00e9llos que sean exigibles, en la medida en que la precitada norma emplea la expresi\u00f3n \"pendientes\", es decir, lo que se debe, lo exigible, que no es equivalente a lo \"causado\", que s\u00f3lo se, debe, cuando se, dan los supuestos para que se produzca su exigibilidad, y con ello la consiguiente situaci\u00f3n de mora, si es que no se cancelan; prohibici\u00f3n que, por lo dem\u00e1s, no es absoluta sino relativa, ya que los permite en las relaciones jur\u00eddicas entre comerciantes, cuando a causa de la mora se produce demanda judicial del acreedor, caus\u00e1ndose en tal evento desde la presentaci\u00f3n de aqu\u00e9lla: cuando se trate de intereses debidos con un a\u00f1o de anterioridad, por lo menos: o, cuando se produce un acuerdo posterior al vencimiento.* [Emphasis added]\n\n**IX. TAXATION**\n----------------\n\n1619.\n\nClaimants submit that they are entitled to a tax indemnification. Colombia rejects Claimants\u2019 contention and submits that the Tribunal should deny this request.\n\n1620.\n\nThe Tribunal will advance the Parties\u2019 positions with respect to Claimants\u2019 claim for tax indemnification (**1.**) and adopt a decision (**2.**).\n\n**(1) The Parties\u2019 Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n1621.\n\nIn their request for relief, Claimants ask that the Tribunal:1377\n\n- declare that the award of damages and interest granted to Claimants is net of all applicable Colombian taxes;1378\n\n- declare that Colombia may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of damages and interest; **.**1379\n\n- order Colombia to indemnify Claimants in full for any Colombian taxes imposed on the compensation awarded to the extent that such compensation has been calculated net of Colombian taxes;1380 and\n\n- order Colombia to indemnify Claimants in respect of any double taxation liability that would arise in Switzerland or elsewhere that would not have arisen but for Colombia\u2019s adverse measures.1381\n\nSee section **IV****.(1)** *supra.*\n\nC I, para. 374(j)(i).\n\nC I, para. 374(j)(ii).\n\nC I, para. 374(k).\n\nC I, para. 374(l).\n\n1622.\n\nClaimants have not made any further allegations and Respondent has submitted no defences regarding Claimants\u2019 tax indemnity requests.\n\n**(2) Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1623.\n\nClaimants make two distinct requests:\n\n- that the Tribunal declare that the amounts awarded be net of Colombian taxes, so that Colombia may not deduct any taxes in respect of such amount and would have to indemnify Claimants for any Colombian taxes imposed thereon;\n\n- that the Tribunal order Colombia to indemnify Claimants in respect of any double taxation liability that would arise in Switzerland or elsewhere as a result of Colombia\u2019s Treaty breaches.\n\n1624.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants as regards the first set of claims, but not as regards the latter.\n\n1625.\n\nThe BIT specifies that the compensation for expropriation must be \"prompt, effective and adequate\" **.**1382 and \"shall be settled in freely convertible currency, be paid without delay and be freely transferable\".1383 The Tribunal has already mentioned that although the rule refers to expropriation, it can be extended by analogy to compensation for violations of other provisions of the BIT.1384\n\nArt. VI of the BIT. Emphasis by the Tribunal.\n\nArt. VII.1 of the BIT.\n\nSee para. 1605 *supra*.\n\n1626.\n\nThese rules support Claimants\u2019 position. Colombia is a sovereign State that can tax any assets or payments located in or originating from its territory. If Colombia were to impose or deduct a tax on Claimants\u2019 award, Colombia could reduce the compensation \"effectively\" received by Prodeco. A *reductio ad absurdum* proves the point: Colombia could practically avoid the obligation to pay Claimants the restitution awarded by fixing a 99% tax rate on income derived from compensations issued by international tribunals, thereby ensuring that Prodeco would only effectively receive a restitution of 1% of the amount granted.\n\n1627.\n\nThus, in order to guarantee that Claimants receive full reparation for Colombia\u2019s international wrong, the restitution and interest awarded to Prodeco by this Tribunal must be tax neutral. This implies that neither\n\n- (i) the payment of the Fiscal Liability Amount by Prodeco to the *Contralor\u00eda* and the State\u2019s repayment of such amount to Prodeco, taken together, nor\n\n- (ii) the interest awarded in this procedure must result in any tax liability to Prodeco.\n\n1628.\n\nClaimants also seek indemnity in respect of any double taxation of the Award that may rise in Switzerland (or elsewhere), to the extent that such liability would not have arisen had Colombia observed its international commitments under the Treaty.\n\n1629.\n\nThe claim is moot, because the compensation is awarded to Prodeco, not to Glencore. Furthermore, any tax liability arising under Swiss tax laws (or any other fiscal regime, save for that of Colombia), would not qualify as consequential loss arising from Colombia\u2019s breach of the Treaty and would not engage Colombia\u2019s liability.\n\n1630.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal, in order to guarantee that Claimants receive full reparation for Colombia\u2019s international wrong, declares that the restitution and interest awarded to Prodeco in accordance with this Award must be neutral with regard to Colombian taxes (with the consequences set forth above), and orders Respondent to indemnify Claimants with respect to any Colombian taxes in breach of such principle.\n\n**X. COSTS**\n------------\n\n1631.\n\nRule 47(1)(j) of the Arbitration Rules establishes that\n\n\"The award shall be in writing and shall contain [...] (j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding\".\n\n1632.\n\nThe Parties submitted their statements of cost on 24 September 2018. None of the Parties challenged the items or the amounts claimed by the counterparty.\n\n1633.\n\nThe Parties have incurred two main categories of costs:\n\n- the lodging fee and advance on costs paid to ICSID [the \"**Costs of the Proceeding**\"]; and\n\n- the expenses incurred by the Parties to further their position in the arbitration [the \"**Defense Expenses**\"].\n\n**(1) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n1634.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal order Colombia to bear Claimants\u2019 costs in their entirety, plus interest from the date at which such costs were incurred until the date of payment by Colombia.1385\n\nC IV, paras. 2 and 44.\n\n1635.\n\nClaimants request the following amounts: **.**1386\n\nCosts of the Proceeding\n\n- ICSID administrative costs: USD 625,000.\n\nDefense Expenses\n\n- Legal Fees: USD 8,5 64,3 03.43,1387 and COP 3 98,480,5 03.1388  \n- Expert Fees and expenses: USD 1,604,858.49.1389  \n- Reasonable travel costs and other expenses incurred by Claimants\u2019 witnesses and respresentatives: USD 61,093.83; ZAR **.**1390 249,934.05 and CHF1391 7,170.75.  \n- Miscellaneous costs: USD 39,288.68.1392\n\nC IV, para. 44.\n\nFees and disbursements of Claimants\u2019 international counsel, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP.\n\nFees and disbursements of Claimants\u2019 Colombian counsel, Alvarez Z\u00e1rate & Asociados.\n\nCompass Lexecon.\n\nSouth African Rand.\n\nSwiss Francs.\n\nFees and disbursements of Claimants\u2019 graphics and technology consultant, RLM | TrialGraphix.\n\n1636.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Costs of the Proceeding amount to a total of USD 625,000 and its Defense Expenses amount to USD 10,819,544.43; COP 398,480,503; ZAR 249,934.05; and CHF 7,170.75.\n\n1637.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal order Colombia to pay all these amounts including interest from the date at which such costs were incurred until the date of payment by Colombia.1393\n\nC IV, para. 44(a).\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n1638.\n\nColombia requests that Claimants be ordered to cover the entire cost of the proceedings.1394 Speciafically, Colombia requests the reimbursement of the following costs and expenses, plus simple interest on costs at the economically reasonable rate of LIBOR + 2%, or alternatively at another commercially reasonable rate from the date Colombia incurred such costs until de date of full payment:1395\n\nCosts of the Proceeding\n\n- ICSID administrative costs: USD 600,000 (of which USD 75,000 were yet to be paid as of the date of the Award).\n\nDefense Expenses\n\n- Legal Fees: USD 1,808,7031396 and COP 214,566,385.40.1397  \n- Miscellaneous costs: USD 168,112.01 and COP 1,062,000.  \n- Expert Fees and expenses: USD 794,024.1398  \n- Travel costs for witnesses and counsel: USD 129,032.25 and COP 145,500,763.75.\n\nR III, para. 29.\n\nR III, para. 31.\n\nFees and disbursements of Respondent\u2019s international counsel, Dechert (Paris) LLP.\n\nFees and disbursements of Respondent\u2019s Colombian counsel, ANDJE.\n\nBrattle.\n\n1639.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Cost of the Proceeding amount to USD 600,000 (of which USD 75,000 were yet to be paid as of the date of the Award), and its Defense Expenses to a total of USD 3,424,871.26 and COP 361,129,149.15.\n\n**(3) Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1640.\n\nArt. 61(2) of ICSID Convention establishes that:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\"\n\n**A. Criteria for the Decision on Costs**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1641.\n\nNeither the Arbitration Rules nor the BIT contain any guidelines for the apportionment of costs. Therefore, the Tribunal has wide discretion to decide on how the costs of this proceeding shall be apportioned.\n\n1642.\n\nBoth Parties have requested that the other bear the costs of the proceedings **.**1399 based on the principle that \"costs follow the event\"1400. Each Party additionally argues that the counterparty needlessly complicated the proceedings and engaged in procedural misconduct.1401\n\nC IV, paras. 2 and 44(a); R III, paras. 29 and 31.\n\nC IV, para. 7; R III, para. 2.\n\nC IV, para. 8; R III, para. 12.\n\n1643.\n\nThe Tribunal will follow the principle that costs follow the event, which is the customary principle in arbitral practice. The Tribunal will disregard the Parties\u2019 allegations of procedural misconduct - the Mining Contract being still in force for many years, the Tribunal does not wish unnecessarily to disrupt the future relationship between the Republic of Colombia and Claimants.\n\n1644.\n\nAs regards the outcome of this procedure, each Party can legitimately claim that it has succeeded in part:\n\n- Claimants have succeeded, to the extent that three of Respondent\u2019s four jurisdictional objections have been dismissed and that Claimants have prevailed in their main claim that Colombia breached the BIT and Claimants ought to be awarded restitution;\n\n- But Respondent has also succeeded, because the Tribunal accepted their Umbrella Clause Objection and has dismissed Claimants\u2019 ancillary petitions.\n\n**B. Application of the \"Costs Follow the Event\" Principle**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1645.\n\nThe Tribunal will apply the principle that costs follow the event to the two main categories of costs: the Costs of the Proceeding and the Defense Expenses.\n\n**a. Costs of the Proceeding**\n------------------------------\n\n1646.\n\nClaimants claim the Costs of the Proceedings paid to ICSID, i.e. the advances made by Claimants to cover the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and administrative fees of ICSID.\n\n1647.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that these costs should be assumed by Respondent, given that Claimants have prevailed in the majority of the jurisdictional objections and the Tribunal has found a breach by Colombia of the BIT.\n\n1648.\n\nThus, Colombia must reimburse Claimants the totality of the Costs of the Proceeding made to ICSID (net of any final reimbursements made by ICSID).\n\n**b. Defense Expenses**\n-----------------------\n\n1649.\n\nAs a first step, the Tribunal must establish the amount of reasonable defense expenses which a standard claimant has to incur, in order properly to present and defend its claim [\"**Reasonable Defense Expenses**\"]. Taking into consideration the complexity of the case, the amount in dispute and the work of legal counsel and experts, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimants\u2019 Reasonable Defense Expenses amount to USD 3.3 million.\n\n1650.\n\nColombia must only assume that part of the Claimants\u2019 Reasonable Defense Expenses that results from applying the principle that cost follow the event. To determine such amount, the Tribunal must:\n\n- First, determine the main legal issues that have been decided;\n\n- Second, give each legal issue a ponderation; and\n\n- Third, determine the success rate of Claimants\u2019 claims in each legal issue and apply it to Claimants\u2019 Reasonable Defense Expenses.\n\n1651.\n\nIn this arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal has had to make three significant decisions:\n\n- whether the Disputed Documents ought to be admitted into the record in Respondent\u2019s Counter-memorial on the Merits and through document production,\n\n- whether it had jurisdiction,\n\n- whether Colombia had violated the Treaty and the consequences thereof.\n\n1652.\n\nThe Parties declare to have dedicated approximately 60% of their costs to the merits of the case, approximately 30% to jurisdiction and approximately to 10% to document production. Thus, the Tribunal will assign each of the legal issues the weight given by the Parties.\n\n1653.\n\nAs a consequence, Claimants\u2019 Reasonable Defense Expenses must be divided as follows:\n\n- Jurisdiction: 30% of USD 3.3 million amounts to USD 990,000;\n\n- Merits: 60% of USD 3.3 million amounts to USD 1,980,000;\n\n- Document Production: 10% of USD 3.3 million amounts to USD 330,000.\n\n1654.\n\nThe Tribunal must now determine Claimants\u2019 rate of success in each legal issue:\n\n- Jurisdiction: Since Claimants were successful in 3/4 of the jurisdictional objections, their success rate was 75%.\n\n- Merits: Claimants were successful in two (partially on letters a) and f) of their request for relief) out of the six main claims requested; they were successful in 33% of their claims.\n\n- Document Production: Claimants succeeded in their general petition that the Disputed Documents be excluded in PO No. 2, where the Tribunal found that the \"proper procedure to obtain evidence from the counterparty is through the agreed document production exercise\" **.**1402; in the Revised Document Production exercise both parties made use of their right to request documents: Claimants submitted a total of seven requests, while Respondent presented 39; in PO No. 3 the Tribunal denied 11 and reduced the scope of 19 of the 22 requests granted to Colombia; the Tribunal granted all of Claimants\u2019 requests; the Tribunal subsequently ruled in PO No. 4 that Claimants\u2019 invocation of privilege for all of the Disputed Documents was admissible and settlement privilege over certain of the Disputed Documents was properly asserted; in summary, the Tribunal considers that Claimants\u2019 success rate as regard Document Production was of 90%.\n\nPO No. 2, para. 70.\n\n1655.\n\nThe Tribunal will now apply the success rate to Claimants\u2019 Reasonable Defense Expenses for each legal issue:\n\n- Jurisdiction: 75% of USD 990,000, which amounts to USD 742,500;\n\n- Merits: 33% of USD 1,980,000, which amounts to USD 653,400;\n\n- Document Production: 90% of USD 330,000, which amounts to USD 297,000.\n\n**(4) Interest**\n----------------\n\n1656.\n\nThe Parties have requested that interest be awarded over the amounts awarded as costs.1403 And the Tribunal agrees.\n\nC IV, para. 44(a); R III, para. 31 (The Tribunal notes that Respondent considers that LIBOR +2% is a commercially reasonable interest rate).\n\n1657.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that the restitution awarded to Claimants shall accrue interest at a LIBOR rate for six months deposits denominated in USD plus a 2% surcharge compounded semi-annually*.*\n\n1658.\n\nThe same shall be applied to the amounts that Respondent is ordered to reimburse as costs.\n\n1659.\n\nThe *dies a quo* shall be the date of issuance of this award.\n\n1660.\n\nThe *dies ad quem* shall be the date of effective payment.\n\n1661.\n\nIn summary, Colombia must reimburse Claimants (i) the Costs of the Proceedings (net of any final reimbursements by ICSID) and (ii) USD 1,692,900 as Defense Expenses, plus (iii) interest on both amounts at a rate of LIBOR for six-month deposits with a margin of 2% capitalised semi-annually from the date of this award until the date of payment.\n\n**XI. SUMMARY**\n---------------\n\n1662.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will review Claimants\u2019 and Respondent\u2019s requests for relief (which have been set-forth in detail in Section **IV** *supra*, and compare such requests with the Tribunal\u2019s findings.\n\n**(1) CLAIMANTS\u2019 REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1663.\n\nClaimants have made nine requests for relief, identified as (a) through (n).\n\n**A. Request (a)**\n------------------\n\n(a) DECLARE that Colombia has breached Articles 4(1), 4(2) and 10(2) of the Treaty.\n\n1664.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Colombia breached Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty, and that the improper measure consisted in the *Contralor\u00eda* applying an unreasonable methodology to establish the damages allegedly caused to Colombia by the Eighth Amendment.\n\n**B. Request (b)**\n------------------\n\n(b) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM or any other government agency that may in due course become the contractual counterparty of Prodeco under the Mining Contract, continue to perform and observe the Eighth Amendment and further that all organs of the Colombian state take any and all actions necessary to ensure and not interfere with such continued performance and observance.\n\n1665.\n\nIn this Request Claimants ask the Tribunal to order Colombia that it continue to perform and observe the Eighth Amendment.\n\n1666.\n\nThe Parties have discussed whether, from a theoretical point of view, an international arbitration tribunal constituted under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention is authorized to issue an order of this type to a sovereign State like Colombia.1404\n\nCI, paras. 228-243; C II, para. 281-295; R I, paras. 525-547; R II, paras. 775-797.\n\n1667.\n\nThe theoretical question may remain unanswered, because in the present case, there is no cause-effect relationship between the Tribunal\u2019s findings (that the *Contralor\u00eda* wrongly calculated the damage caused to the Republic by the Eighth Amendment) and Claimants\u2019 request that Colombia be ordered to continue to perform the Eighth Amendment. Reparation of the international wrong committed by Colombia requires full reparation, and full reparation is achieved by restitution plus interest of the amounts improperly demanded and paid - not by ordering Colombia to perform the Eighth Amendment.\n\n**C. Requests (c) and (e)**\n---------------------------\n\n(c) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM, procure the immediate and unconditional cessation of the ANM Proceedings with prejudice.\n\n(e) ORDER that Colombia, through the ANM, give appropriate assurances and guarantees that it will refrain from initiating any new proceedings in relation to the Eighth Amendment.\n\n1668.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Requests (c) and (e) cannot succeed, because the Tribunal has found that a breach of the Treaty did not arise when the SGC/ANM filed with the competent Colombian court a claim for the annulment of the Eighth Amendment. Since the *tribunal contencioso-administrativo* has not yet made any decision on the SGC/ANM\u2019s request for annulment, Claimants cannot and in fact do not make a claim for breach of the FET standard in the form of denial of justice. Any hypothetical future claim for denial of justice would have to be adjudicated in a new proceeding.\n\n1669.\n\nFurthermore, Request (e) is drafted in terms which are too broad: the Tribunal\u2019s findings do not support a blanket order to Colombia not to initiate new proceedings of any kind in relation to the Eighth Amendment. If, for example, Prodeco breaches the Eighth Amendment, there is no reason why the Mining Agency should be prohibited to start appropriate proceedings.\n\n**D. Request (d)**\n------------------\n\n(d) ORDER that Colombia provide appropriate assurances and guarantees from the *[Contralor\u00eda]* that it will refrain from initiating any new proceedings in relation to the Eighth Amendment.\n\n1670.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the *Contralor\u00eda\u2019* s methodology for calculating the damage suffered by Colombia was unreasonable and in breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.\n\n1671.\n\nThe Tribunal has provided a number of reasons which justify its findings of unreasonableness:1405\n\n- The methodology of the Tover-Silva Report, based on a simple analysis of the Transition Period, is flawed;\n\n- The methodology to be used by the *Contralor\u00eda* must be forward looking and be based on simulations as of the date of the Eighth Amendment;\n\n- That methodology must take into account the fact that under the 2010 PTI Prodeco assumed an obligation to increase investment and to expand the Mine, resulting in an increased production of coal.\n\nFor details see Section **VI.3.(2.2).B****.c** *supra.*\n\n1672.\n\nShould the *Contralor\u00eda* decide to initiate new proceedings against Prodeco in relation to the Eighth Amendment, it will be bound to respect these findings \u2014 otherwise the new calculation of damages will be unreasonable for the same reasons and Colombia will again incur in breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.\n\n1673.\n\nIn the operative part of this Award, the Tribunal will declare that the *Contralor\u00eda's* conduct in calculating the damage suffered by the Republic was in breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty. Not only does the Tribunal\u2019s decision legally obligate Colombia to repair the harm caused as a consequence of the wrongful conduct in the past; it also implies that the *Contralor\u00eda* (and Colombia) are required by the Treaty to abstain from incurring in the same wrongful conduct in the future. The Tribunal considers that, in the circumstances of this case, the specific assurances or guarantees by the Republic that Claimants request in their Request (d) are unnecessary.\n\n**E. Request (f)**\n------------------\n\n(f) ORDER that, by way of restitution, Colombia repay to Prodeco the Fiscal Liability Amount of US$19.1 million1406 paid by Prodeco to Colombia on 19 January 2016 in the context of the Fiscal Liability Proceedings, and any sums that the GCO or any other organ of the Colombian State or Colombian court may, up to the date of the Tribunal\u2019s Award, have ordered Prodeco to pay by way of royalties or GIC calculated on the purported basis that the Eighth Amendment should not apply, adjusted from the date of payment to the date of the Award at an annual rate of 9.69%, compounded semi-annually;\n\nC II, fn. 991: *\"Ie* 63 billion Colombian Pesos converted into US Dollars at the 19 January 2016 date of payment. *See* Compass Lexecon I, para. 96; Compass Lexecon II, para. 92\".\n\n1674.\n\nAs regards this Request, the Tribunal will find in favour of Claimants, and will order Colombia to repay to Prodeco, by way of restitution, USD 19.1 million, *i.e.* the totality of the Fiscal Liability Amount, denominated in USD, plus interest as set forth in Section VIII.\n\n**F. Requests (g), (h) and (i)**\n--------------------------------\n\n(g) ORDER that if Colombia does not comply with orders requested in (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) above within 90 days of the date of the Award, Colombia:\n\n(A) pay Claimants the Fiscal Liability Amount of US$19.1 million plus interest to the date of the Award;\n\n(B) pay Claimants forward-looking damages as of the date of the Award computed as the difference in expected net revenues between a scenario with and without the royalty and GIC provisions in the Eighth Amendment between the date of Award and the end of the Calenturitas mine life as assessed by Claimants\u2019 experts at US$336.1 million as of 31 December 2017; and\n\n(C) fully indemnify and hold harmless Claimants in respect of all retroactive royalty and GIC amounts that Claimants are ordered to pay in relation to the years 2011 to the date of the Award as a consequence of a failure to apply the Eighth Amendment, assessed at US$238.6 million as of 31 December 2017.\n\n(h) In order to avoid double recovery, in the event that subsection (g) is triggered, and solely upon Colombia\u2019s payment and Claimants\u2019 effective receipt of all of the compensation set out in (g)(A) and g(B) above (duly updated to the date of the Award), and in light of the indemnification ordered in g(C) above, ORDER Claimants to pay royalties and GIC from the date of the Award onwards based on the regime that existed prior to the Eighth Amendment.\n\n(i) ORDER Colombia to pay post-award interest on (f), or, alternatively, (g) above, at a rate of 9.69% **.**1407 per annum from the date of the Award, compounded semi-annually, or at such other rate and compounding period as the Tribunal determines will ensure full reparation.\n\nThis figure was updated in Claimants\u2019 Reply Memorial, C II, para. 374(i).\n\n1675.\n\nRequests (g), (h) and (i) assume that Colombia has failed to respect Requests (b), (c), (d) or (e). Since the Tribunal has already dismissed Requests (b), (c), (d) and (e), the necessary consequence is that Requests (g), (h) and (i) have become moot.\n\n**G. Requests (j) and (k)**\n---------------------------\n\n(j) DECLARE that:\n\n(i) The award of damages and interest in (f), (g) and (h) is made net of applicable Colombian taxes; and\n\n(ii) Colombia may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of damages and interest in (f), (g) or (h);\n\n(k) ORDER Colombia to indemnify the Claimants in full with respect to any Colombian taxes imposed on the compensation awarded to the extent that such compensation has been calculated net of Colombian taxes;\n\n1676.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the restitution and interest awarded to Prodeco in accordance with this Award must be neutral with regard to Colombian taxes and has ordered Respondent to indemnify Claimants with respect to any Colombian taxes in breach of such principle.\n\n**H. Request (l)**\n------------------\n\n(l) ORDER Colombia to indemnify Claimants in respect of any double taxation liability that would arise in Switzerland or elsewhere that would not have arisen but for Colombia\u2019s adverse measures;\n\n1677.\n\nThis Request (l) is inapposite: the Tribunal is ordering that Colombia repay the Fiscal Liability Award to Prodeco, not to Glencore. Claimants have failed to prove that restitution to Prodeco will result in any double taxation liability in Switzerland or elsewhere.\n\n**I. Request (m)**\n------------------\n\n(m) ORDER Colombia to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including Claimants\u2019 legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and ICSID\u2019s costs.\n\n1678.\n\nThe Tribunal has ordered that Colombia reimburse Claimants the amount of USD 625,000 (net of reimbursement by ICSID) as Costs of the Proceeding and USD 1,692,900 as Defense Expenses.\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Requests for Relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1679.\n\nRespondent submits requests for relief on jurisdiction and admissibility and on the merits.\n\n**A. Requests on Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1004. To declare:\n\n\u2022 That it lacks jurisdiction over all of Claimants\u2019 claims; and\n\n\u2022 That all of Claimants\u2019 claims are, in any event, inadmissible;\n\n\u2022 That Claimants\u2019 claims newly raised in the Reply are untimely and hence inadmissible\n\n1680.\n\nThe Tribunal has dismissed Respondent\u2019s\n\n- Illegality Objection,\n\n- Fork in the Road Objection, and\n\n- Inadmissibility Objection,\n\nbut has accepted Respondent\u2019s Umbrella Clause Objection.\n\n1681.\n\nThe necessary consequence is that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal is competent to adjudicate claims grounded on breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.\n\n1682.\n\nThe Tribunal has also dismissed Respondent\u2019s additional request that certain claims allegedly raised for the first time in the Reply be declared untimely and inadmissible.\n\n**B. Merits**\n-------------\n\n1006. If, *par impossible*, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction on Claimants' claims and that such claims are admissible, to declare:\n\n\u2022 That Colombia complied with its international obligations under the Treaty and international law;\n\n\u2022 That Colombia did not breach Article 4(1) of the Treaty and that all Claimants' claims grounded therein are therefore dismissed;\n\n\u2022 That Colombia did not breach Article 4(2) of the Treaty and that all Claimants' claims grounded therein are therefore dismissed;\n\n\u2022 That Colombia did not breach Article 10(2) of the Treaty and that all Claimants' claims grounded therein are therefore dismissed; and\n\n1683.\n\nThe Tribunal has already set forth its findings: Respondent has indeed breached Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty, and consequently, the Tribunal has ordered that Claimants are compensated with the restitution of the amounts improperly paid, plus interest. As regards the breach of Art. 10(2), the Tribunal accepted Respondent's Umbrella Clause Objection, and consequently declared that it lacks competence (and the Centre jurisdiction) to adjudicate that claim.\n\n**C. Quantum**\n--------------\n\n1008. If, *par impossible*, the Tribunal finds that Colombia has breached its international obligations under the Treaty and/or international law, to declare:\n\n\u2022 That Claimants' non-monetary claims are beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction and powers, or are inadmissible;\n\n\u2022 That Claimants have not suffered any damages warranting compensation; and\n\n\u2022 That, in any event, Claimants materially contributed to their alleged losses, and that any amounts the Tribunal may award to Claimants are to be reduced accordingly by, at least, 75%.\n\n1684.\n\nAs regards *quantum,* the Tribunal has found that Claimants have suffered harm as caused by Colombia's wrongful acts and has ordered full reparation in the form of restitution of the Fiscal Liability Amount - the sum which Prodeco had wrongly paid to the *Contralor\u00eda*, plus interest.\n\n1685.\n\nThe Tribunal has not accepted any of Claimants' non-monetary claims (except for the declaration of breach), for the reasons set forth in this section.\n\n1686.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has dismissed Respondent's argument that Claimants materially contributed to their own losses.\n\n**XII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n1687.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously1408 rules as follows:\n\n1. Dismisses Respondent\u2019s Illegality Objection, Fork in the Road Objection, and Inadmissibility Objection, upholds Respondent\u2019s Umbrella Clause Objection, and declares that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal is competent to adjudicate claims grounded on breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.\n\n2. Declares that that the *Contralor\u00eda*\u2019s conduct in calculating the damage allegedly suffered by the Republic of Colombia as a result of the execution of the Eighth Amendment constitutes (i) an unreasonable measure which has impaired Claimants\u2019 investment in Colombia in breach of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty and (ii) a breach of fair and equitable treatment, in violation of Art. 4(2) of the Treaty.\n\n3. Orders the Republic of Colombia to restitute to C.I. Prodeco S.A. the Fiscal Liability Amount in the sum of USD 19,100,000.\n\n4. Orders the Republic of Colombia to pay interest over the amount established in para. 3 from 19 January 2016 until the date of actual payment, at the rate of LIBOR for six-month deposits plus a margin of 2%, capitalised semi-annually.\n\n5. Declares that the payment of restitution and interest awarded to Prodeco in accordance with this Award must be neutral as regards Colombian taxes, with the consequences set forth in para. 1630 of this Award, and orders the Republic of Colombia to indemnify Prodeco with respect to any Colombian taxes in breach of such principle.\n\n6. Orders the Republic of Colombia to reimburse Claimants (i) the Costs of the Proceedings (net of any final reimbursements by ICSID) and (ii) USD 1,692,900 as Defense Expenses, plus interest on both amounts at a rate of LIBOR for six-month deposits with a margin of 2%, capitalised semi-annually from the date of this award until the date of actual payment.\n\n7. Dismisses all other claims, objections and defences.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s decision is (i) unanimous on the result and (ii) unanimous on the supporting reasoning, except for Arbitrator Garibaldi\u2019s disagreement with certain aspects of the reasoning adopted by the majority, as explained in footnotes in the appropriate places."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2021-09-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**T****able of** **S****elected** **A****bbreviations and** **D****efined** **T****erms**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| AAE-[#] | Applicant's Exhibit |\n| AAL-[#] | Applicant's Legal Authority |\n| C-Mem. on Ann. | Respondents on Annulment's Counter- Memorial dated 12 June 2020 |\n| Annulment Hearing | Hearing on Annulment held 6 November 2020 |\n| Mem. on Ann. | Applicant's Memorial on Annulment dated 10 April 2020 |\n| Rej. on Ann. | Respondents on Annulment's Rejoinder dated 9 October 2020 |\n| Reply on Ann. | Applicant's Reply dated 7 August 2020 |\n| Annulment Applicant's SoC | Applicant' Statement of Costs dated 24 November 2020 |\n| Annulment Respondents' SoC | Respondents on Annulment's Statement of Costs dated 24 November 2020 |\n| Applicant | Republic of Colombia |\n| Application | Application for Annulment filed on 23 December 2019 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| Award | *Glencore International A.G. and C.I.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis proceeding concerns an Application for Annulment (the \"**Application**\") of the award rendered on 27 August 2019 in *Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6) (the \"**Award\")**.\n\n2.\n\nThe Applicant for Annulment is the Republic of Colombia (\"**Colombia**\"), the Respondent in the proceedings before the Tribunal. The Respondents on Annulment, and Claimants before the Tribunal, are Glencore International A.G. (\"**Glencore**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of, and having its seat in, Switzerland, and C.I. Prodeco S.A*.* (\"**Prodeco**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of Colombia and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore.\n\n3.\n\nThe proceedings before the Tribunal had been instituted by Glencore and Prodeco under the Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Colombia on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, signed on 17 May 2006 and entering into force on 6 October 2009 (the \"**BIT**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 14 October 1966, which entered into force between Colombia and Switzerland on 6 October 2009 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n4.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal held (a) that it possessed jurisdiction; (b) that Glencore and Prodeco had been the victims of an unreasonable measure contrary to Article 4(1) of the BIT and had been subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment contrary to Article 4(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal ordered Colombia to restore to Glencore and Prodeco the sum of USD 19,100,000 plus costs of USD 625,000 and defence expenses of USD 1,692,900.\n\n5.\n\nColombia seeks annulment of the Award pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention on the grounds that (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention); (ii) there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention); and (iii) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n6.\n\nColombia maintains that the Tribunal erred in two important respects (each of which involves all three of the grounds invoked under Article 52): first, by excluding critical documents relating to allegations of corruption (the \"**Documents Issue**\"), and, secondly, by rejecting Colombia's argument that Glencore and Prodeco's investment was illegal and thus fell outside the scope of the BIT (the \"**Illegality Issue**\"). While the two issues are closely related, as will be seen, Colombia maintains that they are discrete and, in particular, that the Committee would be justified in finding in favour of Colombia on the Illegality Issue and annulling the Award even if it rejected Colombia's arguments on the Documents Issue.\n\n7.\n\nThe factual background is set out in greater detail in paras. 135 to 545 of the Award and those parts relevant to the annulment proceedings are summarized below (paras. 31 -62).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 23 December 2019, ICSID received the Application for annulment filed by the Republic of Colombia and dated 23 December 2019. The Application contained a request under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules\")**\u00a0for the stay of enforcement of the Award pending a decision on the Application (the \"**Stay Request**\").\n\n9.\n\nOn 30 December 2019, pursuant to Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties that ICSID had registered the Application. On the same date, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the enforcement of the Award had been provisionally stayed.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 6 March 2020, in accordance with Rules 6 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Parties were notified that Sir Christopher Greenwood, a national of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and designated as President of the Committee, Ms Bertha Cooper-Rousseau, a national of The Bahamas, and Professor Doug Jones, a national of Australia and Ireland, had accepted their appointments by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, and that the *ad hoc* Committee was therefore deemed to have been constituted, and the annulment proceeding to have begun, as of that date. On the same date, the Parties were notified that Ms Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n11.\n\nIn response to a question by the Committee, on 20 and 26 March 2020, the Parties confirmed their agreement that the Respondents on Annulment would not oppose Colombia's Stay Request in exchange for an accelerated timetable for these proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nOn 10 April 2020, the Committee informed the Parties that, without prejudice to the agreement of the Parties on the procedural calendar, and given the time difference between the various geographical locations of counsel and the Committee members, the Committee had decided to separate the first session from the preliminary procedural consultation of the President with the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 13(1), the Committee held its first session on 20 April 2020 by videoconference.\n\n14.\n\nOn 20 April 2020, the President inquired whether the Parties would agree to the appointment of Ms Rosalind Anne Elphick, a national of South Africa and Ireland, as an assistant to the President in this case. On 23 and 24 April 2020, the Parties confirmed that they had no objection to the appointment of Ms Elphick as an assistant to the President, or to the terms of her appointment. Ms Elphick's appointment was confirmed by the President on 22 May 2020.\n\n15.\n\nOn 10 April 2020, Colombia filed its Memorial on Annulment (the \"**Annulment Memorial**\" or \"**Mem. on Ann.\"**), along with Exhibits AAE-1 to AAE-35, Legal Authorities AAL-1 to AAL-100, and several exhibits and legal authorities from the underlying arbitration.\n\n16.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 20(1), on 27 April 2020, the President of the Committee held a preliminary procedural consultation with the Parties by videoconference.\n\n17.\n\nOn 28 April 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreements of the Parties and the Committee's decisions on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provided, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in force from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of the proceeding would be Washington, D.C., United States of America. Regarding the Stay Request, Procedural Order No. 1 established as follows:\n\n*The Parties agreed that the Respondents on Annulment would not oppose the Applicant's request for a stay of enforcement of the Award in exchange for the accelerated timetable in Annex A. The Committee finds that these circumstances require that enforcement be stayed in accordance with Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, and therefore decides to continue the stay of enforcement that had been provisionally in place pursuant to the second sentence of Article 52(5).*\n\n18.\n\nOn 12 June 2020, Glencore and Prodeco filed their Counter-Memorial on Annulment (the \"**Annulment Counter-Memorial**\" or \"**C-Mem. on Ann.**\"), accompanied by Exhibit RAE-1, Legal Authorities RAL-1 to RAL-28, and several exhibits and legal authorities from the underlying arbitration.\n\n19.\n\nOn 7 August 2020, Colombia filed its Reply on Annulment (the \"**Annulment Reply**\" or \"**Reply on Ann.**\"), along with Exhibits AAE-36 to AAE-37, Legal Authorities AAL-101 to AAL-133, and several exhibits and legal authorities from the underlying arbitration.\n\n20.\n\nOn 21 August 2020, the Committee consulted with the Parties regarding the possibility of holding the hearing by video link.\n\n21.\n\nOn 3 September 2020, the Parties informed the Committee that they did not have any objection to holding the hearing on annulment by videoconference. On the same day, the Committee confirmed that the hearing would be held by videoconference rather than in person.\n\n22.\n\nOn 9 September 2020, Colombia wrote to inform the Committee \"*of a recent development relevant to the annulment proceeding*\". Colombia noted that it was not bringing this information to the attention of the Committee in order to request leave to introduce new evidence within the meaning of Section 15.3 of Procedural Order No. 2, although it reserved its right to do so if and when appropriate.\n\n23.\n\nOn 15 September 2020, the Committee referred to the Applicant's communication of 9 September, noted that the Republic of Colombia had made no request to admit any new material to the record of the annulment proceedings, and therefore considered that no action was required at that stage.\n\n24.\n\nOn 9 October 2020, Glencore and Prodeco filed their Rejoinder on Annulment (the \"**Annulment Rejoinder**\" or \"**Rej. on Ann.**\") accompanied by Exhibit RAE-2, Legal Authorities RAL-29 to RAL-38, and several exhibits from the underlying arbitration.\n\n25.\n\nOn 26 October 2020, the Committee informed the Parties that the pre-hearing organizational meeting had been cancelled following the Parties' agreement that it was not necessary.\n\n26.\n\nOn 2 November 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the organization of the hearing on annulment (\"**Annulment Hearing**\").\n\n27.\n\nThe Annulment Hearing was held on 6 November 2020 by videoconference. The list of participants was as follows:\n\nCommittee:  \nSir Christopher Greenwood President of the Committee  \nMs Bertha Cooper-Rousseau Member of the Committee  \nProfessor Doug Jones Member of the Committee  \nAssistant to the President:  \nMs Rosalind Anne Elphick Assistant to the President  \nICSID Secretariat:  \nMs Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco Secretary of the Committee  \nFor Colombia:  \nProfessor Eduardo Silva Romero Dechert LLP  \nMr Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa Dechert LLP  \nMr Juan Felipe Merizalde Urdaneta Dechert LLP  \nMr Amir Ardelan Farhadi Dechert LLP  \nDr Camilo G\u00f3mez Alzate *Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado*  \nMs Ana Mar\u00eda Ordo\u00f1ez Puentes *Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado*  \nMs Elizabeth Prado Lopez *Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado*  \nMr Andres Felipe Esteban Tovar *Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado*  \nMr Giovanny Andr\u00e9s Vega *Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado*  \nFor Glencore and Prodeco:  \nMr Nigel Blackaby Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP  \nMr Elliot Friedman Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP  \nMs Jessica Moscoso Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP  \nMs Paige von Mehren Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP  \nMs Elvira Sihvola Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP  \nMr Gustavo Topalian Dechamps International Law  \nMr Jos\u00e9 Manuel \u00c1lvarez Z\u00e1rate \u00c1lvarez Z\u00e1rate & Asociados  \nMr Oscar Eduardo G\u00f3mez C.I.

S****ummary of the** **F****actual** **B****ackground**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) The Mining Contract***\n-----------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe background to the case before the Tribunal concerned the contracts between Prodeco and the relevant Colombian State entities for coal mining at the Calenturitas mine, \"*one of the largest thermal coal mines in Colombia*\".1 The Colombian entity with which Prodeco contracted changed over time due to changes in Colombian law. In 1989 Prodeco concluded a contract (the \"**Mining Contract**\") with Carbones de Colombia SA (\"**Carbocol**\"),2 a State-owned company to which the Colombian Ministry of Mines and Energy had granted mineral rights.3 In 1993 Carbocol became the Empresa Colombiana de Carb\u00f3n Ltda. (\"**Ecocarb\u00f3n**\"),4 which was later succeeded by the Empresa Nacional Minera Ltda., Minercol Ltda. (\"**Minercol**\").5 In 2004 the Colombian Ministry of Mines and Energy designated the Instituto Colombiano de Geolog\u00eda y Miner\u00eda (\"**Ingeominas**\")6 as Minercol's successor. In 1995 Prodeco was acquired by Glencore.7\n\nAward, para. 142.\n\nAward, para. 145.\n\nAward, para. 141.\n\nAward, para. 155.\n\nAward, para. 159.\n\nAward, para. 169.\n\nAward, para. 157.\n\n32.\n\nUnder the original terms of the Mining Contract, Prodeco obtained the right to carry out the extraction, processing, transport, and sale of up to three million tonnes of coal per year (\"**MTA**\") for a period of 30 years.8 In return, Prodeco agreed to pay compensation to Carbocol, the calculation of which was based on two elements:\n\na. A royalty of 5 per cent for each tonne of coal sold, to increase progressively up to 7.6 per cent for the fifth year of production and beyond (the \"**Base Royalty**\");9\n\nb. and a \"*supplementary compensation*\", calculated as a percentage of Prodeco's revenue and a fixed amount per tonne of coal sold.10 The supplementary compensation was payable only if the price of coal rose above USD 40 per tonne, at which point it was determined, based on the market price of Colombian thermal coal as it was in 1989, that Prodeco would be in receipt of \"*extraordinary profits*\".11\n\nAward, paras. 146-148.\n\nAward, paras. 149.\n\nAward, para. 149.\n\nAward, para. 149.\n\n33.\n\nThe basis for calculating the remuneration payable by Prodeco was changed by the third (the \"**Third Amendment**\") and sixth (the \"**Sixth Amendment**\") amendments to the Mining Contract, executed in 2001 and 2005 respectively. By the Third Amendment it was agreed that the Base Royalty rate was to increase by 1 per cent for every 1 MTA increase in production beyond 3 MTA.12 The term \"*supplementary compensation*\" was changed to \"*Gross Income Compensation*\" (\"**GIC**\"), though in substance it remained the same.13\n\nAward, para. 163.\n\nAward, para. 164.\n\n34.\n\nThe Mining Contract was also altered to explain how the royalties and GIC payments should be calculated when the coal volume exported consisted of coal from the Calenturitas Mine blended with coal from other mines (\"**Blended Coal**\").14 This was necessary to account for the expansion of Glencore's mining operations to the La Jagua coal project. Developments connected with the La Jagua project played an important part in the proceedings before the Tribunal and are discussed in greater detail at paras. 43 -48, below.\n\nAward, para. 179.\n\n35.\n\nThese amendments also clarified the \"*reference price*\" for calculating the royalties and GIC payments due: for coal exported exclusively from the Calenturitas Mine, the reference price would be the higher of (i) the weighted average free on board (\"**FOB**\") Colombian port price for Colombian steam coal for the respective week as published in the ICR, adjusted for calorific value, and (ii) the actual sale price; for the export of Blended Coal, the reference price would simply be the FOB Colombian port price for Colombian steam coal, for the respective week as published in the ICR, adjusted for calorific value.15\n\nAward, paras. 180, 195.\n\n36.\n\nThe Calenturitas mine commenced production in 2004.16 At approximately the same time, Ingeominas created a *Comit\u00e9 de Contrataci\u00f3n Minera* (the \"**Contracting Committee**\") comprising the Secretary-General of Ingeominas, the *Director del Servicio Minero*, two sub-directors and the *Asesor de la Direcci\u00f3n General*. The Contracting Committee became responsible for making recommendations to the *Director del Servicio Minero* regarding any proposed amendments to the Mining Contract.17\n\nAward, para. 171.\n\nAward, paras. 172-175.\n\n37.\n\nIn 2006, Prodeco realised that by diverting a section of the Calenturitas river that ran through the Calenturitas Mine it would be able significantly to increase the amount of exploitable resources accessible to it. It submitted these projections to Ingeominas in November 2006 in its Long-term *Programa de Trabajos e Inversiones* (the \"**2006 PTI**\"), which provided for the mining of an additional 60 MT of coal over the lifetime of the mine and an increase of the capacity of the Calenturitas Mine from 2.9 MTA to 10 MTA from 2010 onwards.18\n\nAward, paras. 183-185, 193.\n\n38.\n\nA further amendment to the Mining Contract (the \"**Seventh Amendment**\"), concluded between Ingeominas and Prodeco on 15 February 2007 following lengthy negotiations, extended the lifetime of the Mining Contract by fifteen years and increased the production levels expected. The basic system for quantifying the compensation to Colombia was left unchanged but clarified to provide that the royalties and GIC would be paid within ten days of the shipment of the coal but would be subject to a quarterly adjustment \"*based on the definitive prices*\".19 The meaning of the term \"*definitive prices*\" became important in connection with the negotiation of the **Eighth Amendment** which was at the heart of the proceedings before the Tribunal.\n\nAward, paras. 193-196.\n\n***(2) The Eighth Amendment***\n------------------------------\n\n*(a) Initiation of Negotiations*\n--------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nSix months after the conclusion of the Seventh Amendment, Prodeco approached Ingeominas about a further change to the Mining Contract. Prodeco maintained that the existing compensation scheme compromised the potential expansion and even threatened the viability of the mining project, because inflation had led to a considerable increase in production costs while the reference price of USD 40 per tonne, on which the GIC was based, had not been altered. Prodeco therefore proposed that Colombia agree to a reduction in the compensation per tonne of coal sold in return for an increase in overall production. With the increased production levels achieved thereby, Prodeco argued that the new compensation scheme would, over the lifetime of the mine, generate much higher revenues for the State than it stood to gain under the previous regime.20\n\nAward, paras. 202-204, 209-211.\n\n40.\n\nThe initial Ingeominas reaction was unfavourable and the *Subdirector de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n y Ordenamiento Minero*, Mr Edward Franco, advised that the proposed amendment would not be in Colombia's interests.21 Nevertheless, the contracting parties continued to discuss Prodeco's proposal.22 A key figure in these negotiations was Mr Mario Ballesteros, who was Director General of Ingeominas from 2 March 2007 to 7 September 2010.\n\nAward, para. 207.\n\nAward, paras. 201-211.\n\n*(b) The Pricing Dispute*\n-------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe negotiations took place against the backdrop of two other developments. First, in July 2008 Prodeco raised a question about the way in which the term \"*definitive price*\" in the Seventh Amendment was to be interpreted. Until that date the parties to the Mining Contract and the Seventh Amendment had proceeded on the basis that the definitive price was the higher of the FOB price in the week when the coal was shipped and the actual sale price obtained by Prodeco. According to Prodeco, however, this formula failed to take account of drastic changes in the market.23 Prodeco maintained that the relevant contractual provisions could also be interpreted as meaning that the definitive price was the actual sale price, as evidenced in Prodeco's invoices to its customers and that this was the correct, as well as the fairer, interpretation. In August and September 2008 Prodeco held meetings with the Minister of Mines and Energy. The Tribunal held that the evidence before it showed that \"*the Minister agreed that it would be fair and reasonable for the royalties to be calculated using the actual price received by Prodeco*\".24\n\nAward, paras. 214-215.\n\nAward, para. 217.\n\n42.\n\nProdeco informed Ingeominas that, with effect from 30 September 2008, it would adjust all payments to Colombia by reference to the actual sale price it received and did so when it made its next payment, reducing the amount paid by USD 6 million.25 Ingeominas countered that Prodeco was not entitled to take this step unilaterally and threatened a declaration of caducity of the Mining Contract if payment at the original level was not made.26 Although Colombia asked the Tribunal to conclude that Prodeco had manufactured the dispute over the definitive price to coerce Colombia into agreeing to the proposed amendment to the Mining Contract, the Tribunal rejected the suggestion that Prodeco had fabricated the dispute by pursuing a request despite knowing that it was not entitled to the rights claimed.27\n\nAward, paras. 221-224.\n\nAward, paras. 222-225.\n\nAward, paras. 218-220.\n\n*(c) The La Jagua Mine and the Three Hectares Contract*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nSecondly, an issue arose regarding the La Jagua mine. The La Jagua mine was located some twenty kilometres east of the Calenturitas mine. Prodeco had acquired three companies \u2013 *Carbones de la Jagua S.A.* (\"**CDJ**\"), acquired in 2005, *Consorcio Minero Unido S.A*. in 2006 and *Carbones El Tesoro* in 2007 (jointly, the \"**Prodeco Affiliates**\")28 \u2013 which held mining rights at La Jagua. The Prodeco Affiliates wished to consolidate their mining activities at La Jagua. However, located in a small gap between the La Jagua coal mining titles held by the Prodeco Affiliates was a 3-hectare area of land over which no concession existed at the time.29 Given its location, this small area was extremely valuable to the Prodeco Affiliates. If Prodeco did not acquire the mining rights to the area, Prodeco's joint operations and the rational development of the La Jagua mine would be severely affected.30 Both Parties accept that the development of La Jagua was critical to any increase in production at Calenturitas, because coal from La Jagua was blended with coal from Calenturitas and shipped together with it.31\n\nAward, para. 178.\n\nAward, para. 235.\n\nAward, para. 687; C-Mem. on Ann., p. 19, para. 38(a).\n\nTribunal Tr., Day 2, p. 317:8-14 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n44.\n\nThe value of the 3-hectares had also been noticed by Mr Maldonado, a former employee of the Ministry of Mines and of Ingeominas's predecessors. In 2006 he had applied to Ingeominas for a mining concession in respect of the area, but his application had been formally rejected in 2007.32 Ingeominas's decision in that respect was based on a March 2007 report which had determined that the site technically overlapped with other concessions and would be too small for a stand-alone mining operation.33 In June 2008, however, Ingeominas reversed its finding that the 3-hectare concession would overlap with other concessions in the area and, in the result, decided to award Mr Maldonado and his partner, Mr C\u00e9sar Garc\u00eda, the 3-hectares concession.34 That decision was formalized with the execution of a mining concession contract in favour of Messrs Maldonado and Garc\u00eda on 16 October 2008 (the \"**3ha Contract**\").35\n\nAward, paras. 234-236.\n\nAward, para. 236.\n\nAward, para. 239.\n\nAward, para. 245.\n\n45.\n\nShortly thereafter, in December 2008, Mr Maldonado and his partner approached Prodeco with an offer to sell the 3-hectares concession to it for USD 11 million.36\n\nAward, para. 247.\n\n46.\n\nProdeco and its affiliates strongly opposed the 3ha Contract as contrary to the national interest, irregular and a misuse of insider information. They formally opposed Mr Maldonado's application in March 2008, and appealed to Ingeominas for its reconsideration of the Prodeco Affiliates' objections in July 2008.37 In the months between August and November 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates communicated their complaints in writing to a range of Colombian authorities, including the *Procurador General de la Naci\u00f3n,* the *Ministro de Minas y Energ\u00eda,* the *Ministro de la Presidencia*, the *Contralor\u00eda*, and the *Jefe del Registro Minero Nacional.*38 Prodeco continued to complain even after the conclusion of the 3ha Contract, by filing a citizen suit against the parties to it, including Ingeominas, and by requesting disciplinary action against the Ingeominas officials involved in its execution.39\n\nAward, paras. 238-239.\n\nAward, paras. 241-244.\n\nAward, paras. 240-246.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal found that, by March 2009, the Prodeco Affiliates were frustrated by the inaction of the Colombian authorities.40 In a final complaint communicated to the *Ministro de la Presidencia*, Prodeco warned that, unless a solution was found to the situation created by the grant of the 3-hectare title, it would have no option other than to enter into direct negotiations with Messrs Maldonado and Garc\u00eda.41 When it received no response, Prodeco decided to pursue that option.42 Ultimately, CDJ purchased the concession title from Messrs Maldonado and Garc\u00eda on 4 May 2009, at a cost of USD 1.75 million (the \"**Assignment Contract**\").43\n\nAward, paras. 248-249.\n\nAward, para. 248.\n\nAward, para. 249.\n\nAward, para. 250.\n\n48.\n\nMessrs Maldonado and Garc\u00eda submitted the contract for sale (the \"**Assignment Contract**\") to Ingeominas for approval, which was granted by Mr Ballesteros on 8 May 2009.44 However, the document which they submitted made no mention of the price paid.45 CDJ paid the purchase price in two separate payments as requested by Messrs Maldonado and Garc\u00eda.46 The Tribunal found that CDJ made the tax withholding required by Colombian law,47 recorded the sum paid in its audited financial statement,48 and declared to Ingeominas both the contract and the price paid.49 The Tribunal also found that, even after conclusion of the Assignment Contract, Prodeco continued to complain about the grant of the 3-hectare concession to Messrs Maldonado and Garc\u00eda50 and that, in June 2011, a new Minister of Mines announced that he had ordered formal investigations into irregularities within Ingeominas.51\n\nAward, paras. 251-252.\n\nAward, para. 251.\n\nAward, paras. 253-254.\n\nAward, para. 255.\n\nAward, para. 256.\n\nAward, para. 256.\n\nAward, paras. 257-258.\n\nAward, para. 259.\n\n*(d) The Conclusion of the Eighth Amendment*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nOn 21 May 2009 Prodeco and Ingeominas concluded an *Acuerdo de Compromiso* (the \"**Commitment to Negotiate**\") in respect of the proposed changes to the Mining Contract, after which formal negotiations took place between June and December 2009. Prodeco paid the USD 6 million difference between the definitive price as it claimed it should be understood and the definitive price as Ingeominas maintained the Mining Contract required.52 The negotiations are described in detail in paras. 266-322 of the Award and culminated in the execution of the Eighth Amendment on 22 January 2010. The terms of the Eighth Amendment are analysed at paras. 323-350 of the Award. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that it established a new formula for the calculation of royalties and the GIC which involved a reduction in the amount payable per tonne to Colombia while Colombia would benefit from an increase in production which should lead to an increase in the overall level of compensation.\n\nAward, paras. 262-265.\n\n50.\n\nIn March 2009 Glencore sold Prodeco to the Australian company Xstrata53 subject to a call option which allowed Glencore to repurchase Prodeco. In March 2010 Glencore exercised the option and repurchased Prodeco.54\n\nAward, para. 230.\n\nAward, para. 360.\n\n***(3) The Contralor\u00eda Proceedings***\n-------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nIn October 2010 the *Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica* (the \"***Contralor\u00eda***\"), a Colombian administrative agency, opened an investigation into alleged corrupt practices in Ingeominas.55 This included an investigation into the conclusion of the Eighth Amendment. In March 2011 the team conducting the investigation reported that Prodeco had failed to establish that the mining project would have been unviable without the Eighth Amendment, that there had been no juridical, technical or financial reasons to modify the Mining Contract, that Ingeominas had failed properly to analyse the impact of the Eighth Amendment and that the Amendment had been detrimental to Colombia because it had reduced revenue from the Mining Contract.56 This Report was not disclosed to Prodeco until August 2012.57\n\nAward, paras. 398-409. The status and workings of the *Contralor\u00eda* are explained in paras. 388-397 of the Award.\n\nAward, para. 406.\n\nAward, para. 409.\n\n52.\n\nFollowing receipt of the report, in May 2011 the *Contralor\u00eda* instituted a Fiscal Liability Proceeding (an administrative proceeding) against Prodeco and Mr Jos\u00e9 Fernando Ceballos, who was the Ingeominas *Director del Servicio Minero* and had signed the Eighth Amendment on behalf of Ingeominas.58 Although the procedure before the *Contralor\u00eda* is an administrative, and not a judicial, one, Colombian law requires that the procedure respect principles of due process. Prodeco and Mr Ceballos were invited to submit evidence and were represented by counsel. The proceedings, which involved the *Contralor\u00eda* taking depositions from various current and former Ingeominas officials, was later extended to include Mr Ballesteros and various other officials.59 It culminated in the *Contralor\u00eda* issuing an *Auto de imputaci\u00f3n de responsibilidad fiscal* (the \"***Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n***\") which formally charged Prodeco, Mr Ceballos and Mr Ballesteros.60 The *Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n,* which was adopted in August 2013 stated that the Eighth Amendment had caused damage to the Colombian State and accused Prodeco of wilfully causing that damage.61\n\nAward, para. 410.\n\nAward, paras. 410-458.\n\nTwo other officials were the subject of lesser charges.\n\nAward, paras. 459-466.\n\n53.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* issued its decision regarding these charges on 30 April 2015. The *Contralor\u00eda* found Prodeco, Mr Ballesteros, Mr Ceballos and the Minister of Mines at the time that the Eighth Amendment was signed had incurred fiscal liability and sentenced them to pay, jointly and severally, COP 60 billion (approximately USD 25 million) in compensation for the damage to the State. The decision largely endorsed the allegations in the *Auto de Imputaci\u00f3n*.62\n\nAward, paras. 487-506.\n\n54.\n\nProdeco took various steps to appeal or otherwise quash the decision.63 None of these had been successful by the time of the Award. On 19 January 2016 Prodeco paid, under protest, USD 19.1 million.64\n\nAward, paras. 507-524.\n\nAward, paras. 525-526.\n\n55.\n\nIn March 2012 the Colombian authorities initiated proceedings to annul the Mining Contract before the *Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca*. At the time that the Award in the present proceedings was issued, the *Tribunal Administrativo* had not given a decision.65\n\nAward, paras. 527-535.\n\n56.\n\nNotwithstanding the various proceedings, the Eighth Amendment was applied on a provisional basis and Prodeco made payment of royalties in accordance with its terms.66\n\nAward, para. 545.\n\n**B. G****lencore****'****s** **C****laim before the** **T****ribunal and** **C****olombia****'****s** **R****esponse**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco first raised the existence of a potential dispute under the BIT in a letter of 18 September 2013 addressed to the President of Colombia.67 That was followed by a formal notification of dispute on 28 August 2015,68 which initiated the six-month consultation period provided for in Article 11 of the BIT. Following the expiry of that period, Glencore and Prodeco submitted their Request for Arbitration on 4 March 2016.\n\nTribunal's Procedural Order No. 2, 4 November 2017 (\"**PO2**\"), paras. 16-17 (**AAE-1**).\n\nAward, para. 536; PO2, note 67, above, at para. 18 (**AAE-1**).\n\n58.\n\nThe relief sought by Glencore and Prodeco is set out at para. 547 of the Award. In summary, they sought a declaration that Colombia had breached Articles 4(1), 4(2) and 10(2) of the BIT, repayment of the USD 19.1 million which they had paid under protest (see para. 54, above), cessation of the existing proceedings and an assurance that new proceedings would not be instituted and, should proceedings not be terminated, forward looking damages.\n\n59.\n\nColombia argued that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction and that the claims were inadmissible. Although Colombia challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on several grounds, a central pillar of its case was that the investment made in connection with the Eighth Amendment was unlawful and thus fell outside the BIT. Colombia maintained that Articles 2 and 4(1) of the BIT excluded investments made in violation of the law of the host State and that an investment procured by corruption, fraud or deceit was an instance of an investment which was tainted by illegality.\n\n60.\n\nAccording to Colombia, the Eighth Amendment was procured by corruption, misrepresentation and the concealment of important information from Ingeominas. At the heart of this argument was an allegation that Prodeco, through its affiliate CDJ, had paid an exorbitant sum for the concession to three hectares of land in order to obtain the agreement of Mr Ballesteros, then the Director General of Ingeominas, to the Eighth Amendment to the Mining Contract which introduced changes seriously detrimental to Colombia. Colombia's case was that the price paid \u2013 USD 1.75 million \u2013 bore no relation to the value of the land and was an indirect bribe to Mr Ballesteros. Almost immediately after the conclusion of the Assignment Contract and its approval by Ingeominas (to which, Colombia argued, the details of the Assignment Contract were never revealed), Mr Ballesteros approved the adoption of the Commitment to Negotiate (see para. 49, above) in spite of the recommendation by the Sub-Director that that the terms proposed by Prodeco were unfavourable to Colombia (see paras. 39 -40, above).\n\n61.\n\nColombia maintained that the terms were so clearly detrimental that only corruption, and the concealment of relevant information, could have caused Ingeominas to accept them. According to Colombia, Prodeco falsely affirmed that it was economically unfeasible to produce beyond 8 MTA when Prodeco's internal documents proved contemporaneous plans to increase production up to 10 MTA between 2010 and 2019. Colombia alleged that the payment which Prodeco had made to Mr Maldonado and Mr Garcia for the three hectare concession had been a thinly concealed bribe to secure the consent of Mr Ballesteros to the Eighth Amendment. On the basis of such influence peddling and misrepresentations, Colombia alleged, Prodeco and the State executed the Eighth Amendment on 22 January 2010.69 The Investment had thus been unlawful and fell outside the protection of the BIT.\n\nApplication, para. 18(iii).\n\n62.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco denied the allegations of corruption and gave a very different account of the circumstances surrounding the three hectare concession (see paras. 46 -47, above). They maintained that the concession had been improperly granted to Mr Maldonado and Mr Garc\u00eda but, despite Prodeco's complaints, had not been reversed, leaving Prodeco no choice but to buy the concession through its affiliate CDJ. They pointed to the fact that Prodeco had been open about the purchase of the three hectare concession and the price which it had paid and argued that there was no evidence that any part of the price paid had been passed on to Mr Ballesteros. Their analysis of what had happened was that, like other mining concerns in Colombia, they had been the victim of \"*greenmail*\", whereby a person was able to obtain a concession to a small area of land which had to be bought out at an exorbitant price in order to unlock the potential of the concessions to the surrounding area.\n\n**C.

Colombia submits that it was wrongly prevented from admitting into evidence certain documents allegedly pertaining to the conclusion of the three hectare contract and thus to the legality of Prodeco's investment.70 The impugned decisions are Procedural Order No. 2 of 4 November 2017 (\"**PO2**\"),71 Procedural Order No. 4 of 24 April 2018 (\"**PO4**\"),72 and Procedural Order No. 6 of 31 July 2018 (\"**PO6**\").73 The record is a complicated one and it is necessary to set it out in some detail before considering the Parties' arguments regarding the application for annulment.\n\nAward, para. 74.\n\nPO2, note 67, above (**AAE-1**).\n\nTribunal's Procedural Order No. 4, 24 April 2018 (\"**PO4**\") (**AAE-9**).\n\nTribunal's Procedural Order No. 6, 31 July 2018 (\"**PO6**\") (**AAE-10**).\n\n***(1) Colombia's First Attempt to Introduce Documents Seized from Glencore and Prodeco***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nColombia was represented in the arbitration proceedings by the *Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado* (the \"**ANDJE**\").\n\n65.\n\nOn 7 June 2017, the ANDJE requested a one-month extension of the deadline (of 3 July 2017) set for the submission of its Counter-Memorial.74 That request was premised on the administrative reorganization of the ANDJE and health issues affecting counsel for Colombia.75 On 12 June 2017, the Tribunal granted a two-week filing extension to Colombia.76\n\nAward, paras. 70-71.\n\nAward, para. 71.\n\nAward, para.72.\n\n66.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, the ANDJE signed an agreement with the *Superintendencia de Industria y Comercio* (the \"**SIC**\"), the administrative agency which enforces antitrust law in Colombia, that the agencies would cooperate to exchange between them information relevant to the legal defence of Colombia (the \"**Cooperation Agreement**\").77\n\nAward, para. 73.\n\n67.\n\nAt an unspecified date in June or July of 2017, the SIC delivered to the ANDJE certain documents it had seized from Prodeco in the context of an antitrust investigation relating to Prodeco's seaport.78 These documents included emails downloaded by SIC from the computers of a number of Prodeco's managers (the \"**Disputed SIC Documents**\")79 during a search of Prodeco's offices which the SIC had conducted in August 2014.80\n\nAward, para. 74.\n\nThe Tribunal was not always consistent in its use of terms to describe the various documents whose production was contested. In PO2 it referred to the 41 documents as \"*the Disputed Documents*\". However, in PO4 it refers to those documents as \"*the Excluded Documents*\" and uses the term \"*the Disputed Documents*\" to refer to a much larger collection of documents for which privilege was claimed (see paras. 111 -123, below). The Committee has retained the term \"*Disputed Documents*\" for this latter collection but has used the term \"*Disputed SIC Documents*\" to refer to the 41 documents which were the subject of PO2. As will be seen (paras. 95-151, below), there was an overlap between these categories in that some of the Disputed SIC Documents were later part of the larger category of Disputed Documents considered in PO4 and in PO6.\n\nAward, para. 74.\n\n68.\n\nOn 17 July 2017 Colombia filed its Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility and Counter-Memorial.81 The exhibits attached to the Counter-Memorial included forty-one internal Prodeco documents which were part of the Disputed SIC Documents and were described as having been \"*recently discovered*\".\n\nAward, para. 76.\n\n69.\n\nBy a letter to the Tribunal dated 26 July 2017, Glencore and Prodeco expressed their concern that Colombia's Counter-Memorial submission included \"*41 private and internal email chains exchanged between* [Prodeco's] *management and their in-house and external counsel*\", the contents of which were, according to Glencore and Prodeco, privileged.82 They requested an order that Colombia reveal how the ANDJE had obtained these documents, and the timing of that acquisition.83 Glencore and Prodeco further requested an order \"*declaring inadmissible all documents irregularly obtained or produced by Colombia in breach of its duty of good faith and rules of privilege, and an order striking out any statements in Colombia's Counter-Memorial and/or witness statements and expert report that relied on such documents*\" (the \"**First Application**\").84\n\nLetter from Claimants to the Tribunal, 26 July 2017 (\"**Claimants letter of 26 July 2017**\"), p. 1 (**C-275**).\n\nClaimants' letter of 26 July 2017, note 82, above, at p. 7 (**C-275**).\n\nClaimants' letter of 26 July 2017, note 82, above, at p. 8 (**C-275**); Award, paras. 24, 77.\n\n70.\n\nOn 3 August 2017, Colombia wrote to the Tribunal to explain that the Disputed SIC Documents had been legally obtained by the SIC in the context of a lawful audit of Prodeco's acitivities, to argue that the documents were not privileged and to request that the Tribunal \"*reject Claimants' petition outright*\".85\n\nLetter from Colombia to the Tribunal, 3 August 2017, p. 2 (**C-276**); Award, paras. 25, 78. 86 Award, para. 79.\n\n71.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco responded by letter of 22 August 2017, slightly amending their initial request for relief.86 On 11 September 2017, Colombia filed a rejoinder letter, reiterating its initial request.87\n\nAward, para. 79.\n\nAward, para. 26.\n\n72.\n\nOn 10 September 2017, the ANDJE filed a criminal complaint with the office of the *Fiscal\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n* (the \"**FGN**\"), based on the Disputed SIC Documents (the \"**Criminal Complaint**\").88 The Criminal Complaint was aimed at certain named persons who were involved in the execution of the Eighth Amendment, reporting that they \"*may have*\" committed the crimes of bribery, conclusion of a contract lacking legal requirements, conspiracy to commit a crime, and undue interest of a public servant in the conclusion of contracts.89 It also requested the deposition of two Prodeco employees, including one of Prodeco's in-house counsel.\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 30 (**AAE-1**); Award, para. 80.\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 31 (**AAE-1**); Award, para. 81.\n\n73.\n\nOn 20 September 2017, Glencore and Prodeco submitted a letter to the Tribunal to address the Criminal Complaint, amongst other issues.90 They requested, in addition to the exclusion of the Disputed SIC Documents, an order that Colombia \"*refrain from harassing or intimidating Claimants, their current and former employees, their current and former counsel, and their witnesses, through the conduct of the criminal investigations arising from the ANDJE's Complaint*\" (the \"**Second Application**\").91 On 2 October 2017, Colombia wrote to the Tribunal to request that it reject Glencore and Prodeco's Second Application.92\n\nAward, para. 27.\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 7 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 8 (**AAE-1**).\n\n74.\n\nThese exchanges were the first round in a series of procedural disputes which the Tribunal addressed in three separate stages. Since the three Procedural Orders (the \"**POs**\") in question are central to the Application for Annulment, it is necessary to set out the issues considered in each Order and the decisions taken by the Tribunal in some detail.\n\n***(2) Procedural Order No. 2 (4 November 2017)***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe principal issue which confronted the Tribunal when it adopted PO2 was whether Colombia could introduce into the record the documents seized from Prodeco's offices by the SIC in 2014. By the time the Tribunal issued PO2, certain matters were common ground between the Parties.\n\n76.\n\nFirst, the documents had been seized on 4 August 2014 by one Colombian agency, the SIC, as part of an investigation into allegedly anti-competitive practices prohibited by Colombian law which were distinct from the matters in issue in the proceedings before the Tribunal.93\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at paras. 19-20, 44, 54 (**AAE-1**).\n\n77.\n\nSecondly, although counsel for Glencore and Prodeco has emphasized the coercive nature of this seizure,94 the Tribunal held that \"[i]*t is common ground between the Parties that the Disputed Documents were legally obtained by the SIC in the course of an antitrust investigation against Prodeco*\".95\n\nBefore the Committee, counsel for Glencore and Prodeco referred to \"*internal privileged emails of the Claimants acquired from servers seized during a dawn raid in an entirely unrelated competition investigation*\" (Tr. p. 79:1-3 (Mr Blackaby)). Since the \"*raid*\" started at 10:37 am (Minutes of the Meeting between the SIC and Prodeco of 4 August 2014, signed by representatives of the SIC and Prodeco (**R-205**)), the reference to a \"*dawn raid*\" must be taken as an instance of forensic hyperbole.\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 54 (**AAE-1**).\n\n78.\n\nThirdly, the documents were handed by the SIC to the ANDJE, which was responsible for the conduct of the arbitration proceedings, pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement signed on 13 June 2017.96 The Parties did not agree then \u2013 and do not agree now \u2013 whether the transfer of the documents by the SIC to ANDJE was lawful under Colombian law.\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 28 (**AAE-1**).\n\n79.\n\nWith regard to the law applicable to whether the documents could lawfully be placed on the record by Colombia, the Tribunal noted that the Parties based their arguments on international law and, alternatively, on Colombian law.97 The Tribunal then held that:\n\n*This approach is consistent with the BIT and the ICSID Convention: while the Colombia-Switzerland BIT has no provision regarding the applicable substantive law, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention establishes that, in the absence of an agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute and such rules of international law as may be applicable. And Article 44 of the Convention provides that \"any question of procedure [\u2026] which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties\", shall be decided by the Tribunal.*98\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 50 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 51 (**AAE-1**).\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal held that it would apply international law and \"*confirm its findings by applying municipal law*\".99\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 52 (**AAE-1**).\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal defined the issue before it as \"*whether it is fair to admit into the record of this arbitration documents lawfully obtained by a State's administrative antitrust agency in the course of an antitrust/unfair competition investigation*\".100\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 59 (**AAE-1**).\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that it had to uphold the principle that each Party had an obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith, and to respect the equality of arms. It considered that the rule that the equality of arms must be respected applied to \"*the marshalling of evidence*\" and that:\n\n*\u2026 arbitration tribunals are authorized to exclude from evidence documents for compelling reasons of \"fairness or equality of the Parties\".*101\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 65 (**AAE-1**).\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that it should exclude the disputed documents \"*for reasons of fairness and equality of arms*\".102 It justified that decision as follows:\n\n*If the Tribunal were to allow the Disputed Documents, such decision would upset the balance between the Parties and their equality of arms. Claimants are private companies, while respondent is a sovereign State, which by law enjoys wide-ranging powers to investigate and sanction by itself administrative misbehavior. Through the exercise of these powers Respondent is capable of legally forcing evidence from Claimants. But such evidence can only be used for the purpose for which it was coerced: to further the administrative investigation, which may result in an administrative sanction.*\n\n*If the disputed documents were admissible as evidence, so would evidence coming from other administrative agencies, such as the tax authorities. And if governments were allowed to submit in investment arbitrations all evidence seized by their administrative bodies or agencies in unrelated administrative procedures, this would create an incentive to start administrative investigations once the investor announces the existence of a dispute.*103\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 67 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at paras. 68-69 (**AAE-1**).\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded, with regard to international law:\n\n*In summary**, the duty to arbitrate in good faith and the principle of equality of arms preclude a State from coercing evidence through its own administrative powers and to marshal it thereafter in an investment arbitration.*104\n\nImportantly, however, the Tribunal continued:\n\n*The proper procedure to obtain evidence from the counterparty is through the agreed upon document production exercise. Not having been obtained through such procedure, the Disputed Documents should be excluded from the record of this arbitration.*105\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 70 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 70 (**AAE-1**).\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal added, in a footnote, that:\n\n*\u2026 the Tribunal's decision does not affect the right or duty of a State or its civil servants to denounce criminal behavior to the proper judicial authorities, nor the use of documents seized in the course of administrative procedures to support such complaints.*106\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at footnote 64 (**AAE-1**).\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal then considered Colombian law.107 It held that:\n\n*By handing over the Disputed Documents to ANDJE, even if in compliance with the Agreement* [of 13 June 2017] *the SIC may have incurred in a* desviaci\u00f3n de poder*: legally using its investigative powers for an (additional) purpose different from that for which they were granted.*108\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at paras. 71-74 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 73 (**AAE-1**).\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that \"[m]*unicipal law thus would appear to confirm the conclusion reached by the Tribunal under international law*\".109\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 74 (**AAE-1**).\n\n88.\n\nThe effect of PO2 was that Colombia was not entitled to introduce the Disputed SIC Documents into the record with the Counter-Memorial. Nevertheless, the Tribunal left open two other ways in which the Seized Documents might be admitted into the record.\n\n89.\n\nFirst, it held that Colombia could seek production of the Disputed SIC Documents through an amended document production process (giving the Parties an opportunity to file new requests for document production that would \"*supersede and replace*\" the Parties' original requests, still pending before the Tribunal), during which any dispute about whether or not a document was protected by legal or settlement privilege could be determined.110\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para.113 (**AAE-1**).\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal also specified that, in asserting legal or settlement privilege over a requested document, the requested Party could opt either to identify the document in a \"*Privilege Log*\" or to deliver the document to the requesting Party with the privileged information redacted.111 The Tribunal set out the details of the amended document production phase in paragraphs 117 to 146 of PO2. Drawing on the International Bar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration, 2010 (the \"**IBA Rules**\"), the Tribunal laid down criteria and procedural requirements for document production in some detail, requiring the production of Redfern schedules in which requests for production and opposition based on, for example, legal or settlement privilege could be made.112 The annex to the Procedural Order set out an amended timetable (subsequently agreed between the Parties113) to be followed with regard to the new phase of document production.114\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 129 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 127 (**AAE-1**).\n\nAward, para. 30.\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at pp. 31-32 (**AAE-1**).\n\n91.\n\nSecondly. the Tribunal held that the rules which it had established \"*regarding the admissibility of evidence obtained from Claimants in the course of Colombia's administrative investigation \u2026 do not apply per se with regard to evidence obtained in judicial criminal proceedings*\".115 It distinguished between an investigation by \"*an administrative agency which initiates an investigation and uses its powers to coerce the production of evidence from citizens*\" and \"*an independent judicial authority, which investigates crimes in the public interest and marshals evidence into the criminal record*\".116\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 87 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 87 (**AAE-1**).\n\n92.\n\nIt then identified the following dilemma:\n\n*Although the Arbitral Tribunal is not bound by the findings of fact or conclusions of law of the Colombian criminal courts, the criminal investigation may well result in evidence or findings which are relevant to this investment arbitration. Consequently, it may well happen that, in the course of the criminal investigation, decisions are adopted or evidence is marshalled which any of the Parties may wish to submit to the investment arbitration tribunal. The question is how to do so, while preserving the basic principles of fairness, good faith and equality of arms.*117\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 88 (**AAE-1**).\n\n93.\n\nOn that basis the Tribunal adopted the following regime:\n\n*decisions of criminal courts**: decisions adopted by Colombian criminal courts, which could potentially impact the present procedure, may be freely marshalled by the Parties, subject to the rule established in para. 17 (3) of Procedural Order No. 1;*118\n\n*criminal evidence**: the situation is more complex as regards evidence, and the Tribunal has not been sufficiently briefed on this question \u2013 the particular decision may well depend on a document-by-document analysis. Consequently, as a precautionary measure, the Tribunal finds that any Party that intends to submit evidence gathered from a criminal procedure in Colombia, shall first ask permission from the Arbitral Tribunal (briefly describing the evidence to enable the Tribunal to consider its relevance, but not submitting the evidence itself). The Tribunal will issue a decision, after hearing the counterparty.*119\n\nPara. 17.3 of the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 1 of 4 November 2016 concerned the timing of filing and precluded late filing without the permission of the Tribunal (**AAE-6**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 89 (**AAE-1**).\n\n94.\n\nColombia could therefore apply to submit \"*evidence gathered from a criminal procedure in Colombia*\".120 The Tribunal, however, recognized that both Parties agreed that \"*communications of any type between Claimants and their designated external counsel for the purpose of seeking or providing legal advice*\" were privileged and had to be subjected to a \"*carved out regime*\".121 The Tribunal considered that it was \"*of paramount importance for the integrity of these* [ie the arbitral] *proceedings*\" that if such documents came into the hands of Colombian authorities in the course of the criminal investigation appropriate measures were put in place to ensure that Colombia's counsel in the arbitration and the officials of ANDJE did not see those documents122 and invited Colombia to set out, within fifteen days, the measures which it intended to take.123\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 89 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 90 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 92 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 94 (**AAE-1**).\n\n***(3) The Steps taken by the Parties following Procedural Order No. 2***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nOn 14 November 2017, Colombia wrote to the Tribunal expressing its \"*serious concerns*\" about PO2 and reserving all of its rights.124 It complained that, by excluding the Disputed SIC Documents, the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state the reasons on which its decision was based and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.125 Colombia maintained that the documents which had been excluded by the Tribunal in PO2 had lawfully been obtained126 and that the SIC had acted in accordance with its duty in handing them to the ANDJE.127 Nevertheless, Colombia stated that it would comply \"*under protest*\" with the directions in PO2.128 In particular, the letter set out the measures which Colombia proposed to take to ensure that Colombia's counsel and the ANDJE did not see any documents which were gathered in the course of the criminal investigation and were properly the subject of legal privilege. Those measures included the appointment of an independent counsel to review whether those documents were \"*communications of any type between Claimants and their designated external counsel for the purpose of seeking or providing legal advice*\".129 The independent counsel was Mr Camilo Enciso, a former *Secretario de Transparencia* of the Presidency of Colombia.130\n\nLetter from Colombia to the Tribunal, 14 November 2017 (\"*Colombia's letter of 14 November 2017*\"), p. 1 (**C-283/R-275**).\n\nColombia's letter of 14 November 2017, note 124, above, at p. 2 (**C-283/R-275**).\n\nColombia's letter of 14 November 2017, note 124, above, at p. 2 (**C-283/R-275**).\n\nColombia's letter of 14 November 2017, note 124, above, at p. 3 (**C-283/R-275**).\n\nColombia's letter of 14 November 2017, note 124, above, at p. 4 (**C-283/R-275**).\n\nColombia's letter of 14 November 2017, not e 124, above, at p. 5 (**C-283/R-275**), quoting PO2, not e 67, above, at para. 90 (**AAE-1**).\n\nColombia's letter of 14 November 2017, note 124, above, at p. 5 (**C-283/R-275**).\n\n96.\n\nOn 16 November 2017 Colombia filed a revised Counter-Memorial which omitted any reference to the Disputed SIC Documents and did not append any of them as exhibits.131\n\nAward, para. 32.\n\n97.\n\nIn accordance with the procedure laid down by PO2, on 14 December 2017 the Parties submitted their respective requests for production of documents for decision by the Tribunal.132 Colombia made thirty-nine requests for production.133\n\nAward, para. 33.\n\nAward, para. 94.\n\n98.\n\nOn 4 January 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"**PO3**\"), accepting twenty-three out of Colombia's thirty-nine requests, although it narrowed down several of them.134\n\nTribunal's Procedural Order No. 3, 4 January 2018 (\"**PO3**\") (**AAE-8**); Award, para. 99.\n\n99.\n\nOn 5 February 2018, Glencore and Prodeco produced to Colombia a total of 366 documents, stating that they had \"*undertaken a reasonable review of their files in good faith, and have identified and produced non-privileged documents in their possession, custody and control pursuant to the Tribunal's orders*\" (the \"**Produced Documents**\").135 Glencore and Prodeco, however, claimed \"*legal or settlement privilege*\" in relation to 159 documents.136 Certain of the Produced Documents were delivered to Colombia in redacted form (the \"**Redacted Documents**\").137 In addition, Glencore produced a Privilege Log (the \"**Privilege Log**\"), identifying the date, the issuer, the recipient and a summary description of the documents which it had identified as responsive to Colombia's requests which had been withheld by Glencore on the basis that they were subject to legal or settlement privilege (the \"**Privilege Log Documents**\"). The Privilege Log Documents and the Redacted Documents will be referred to as the \"**Disputed Documents**\".138\n\nLetter from Claimants to Colombia, 5 February 2018 (\"*Claimants' letter of 5 February 2018*\"), p. 1 (**R-283**).\n\nClaimants' letter of 5 February 2018, note 135, above, at p. 1 and Annex 1 (**R-283**).\n\nLetter from Claimants to ICSID, 2 March 2018 (\"*Claimants' letter of 2 March 2018*\"), pp. 2-3 (**R-277**); PO6, note 73, above, at para. 46 (**AAE-10**).\n\n*See*, however, note 79, above.\n\n100.\n\nColombia objected to the assertions of privilege. On 23 February 2018, Colombia wrote to the Tribunal to protest that Glencore and Prodeco had disregarded the procedural directions set out in PO2 by raising the issue of privilege only after the Tribunal's decision in PO3 and not at the exchange of their respective Redfern Schedules on 7 December 2017, by which stage, according to Colombia, Glencore and Prodeco had \"*waived any right to assert privilege*\".139 In any event, Colombia added, there was no entitlement to privilege.140 According to Colombia, none of the Redacted Documents and only 18 out of the 159 Privilege Log Documents were sent or received by Prodeco's external counsel.141 As such, only these 18 documents could be construed as privileged under international legal standards.142 The remainder were, for the most part, sent or received by Prodeco's in-house counsel - Ms Natalia Anaya and Ms Mar\u00eda Margarita (Paca) Zuleta.143 According to Colombia, settlement privilege \"*does not exist*\" and only \"*communications with outside counsel are protected*\" by legal privilege under International Law or Colombian Law.144 Glencore and Prodeco could not, therefore, have had any expectation of confidentiality in respect of the majority of the documents.145 Accordingly, Colombia requested an order instructing Glencore and Prodeco to produce \"*within 48 hours*\" (1) un-redacted copies of the Redacted Documents; and (2) the Privilege Log Documents, \"*redacting only in those documents exchanged with external counsel the relevant portions where legal advice was sought or given*\".146\n\nLetter from Colombia to ICSID, 23 February 2018 (\"*Colombia's letter of 23 February 2018*\"), p. 3 (**R-272**).\n\nColombia's letter of 23 February 2018, note 139, above, at p. 3 (**R-272**).\n\nColombia's letter of 23 February 2018, note 139, above, at p. 9 (**R-272**).\n\nColombia's letter of 23 February 2018, note 139, above, at p. 12 (**R-272**).\n\nColombia's letter of 23 February 2018, note 139, above, at p. 11 (**R-272**).\n\nColombia's letter of 23 February 2018, note 139, above, at p. 11 (**R-272**).\n\nColombia's letter of 23 February 2018, note 139, above, at p. 11 (**R-272**).\n\nColombia's letter of 23 February 2018, note 139, above, at p. 14 (**R-272**).\n\n101.\n\nOn 2 March 2018, Glencore and Prodeco wrote to the Tribunal in response, stating that they had fully complied with PO3 and requesting that the Tribunal dismiss Colombia's application.147 They contended that Colombia had not challenged any specific entries in the Privilege Log. They maintained that it was international law which determined whether or not a document was privileged and that the decision in *Vito Gallo*148 established that under international law privilege extended to communications with in-house legal counsel for the purpose of seeking or receiving legal advice.149 Glencore and Prodeco stated that \"[c]*onsistent with this approach, Claimants have produced 35 documents setting out communications with in-house counsel that were not prepared for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice*\".150 They added:\n\n*Perusal of the individual entries in the privilege log will confirm that Claimants only asserted privilege over documents or communications created for the purpose seeking or receiving* legal advice*, not those merely related to Prodeco's general operations**.* *The specific matter in respect of which the legal advice was sought or received is also identified in the privilege log.*151\n\nThe letter also challenged Colombia's assertion that legal privilege did not attach, under Colombian law, to communications with in-house counsel.152\n\nClaimants' letter of 2 March 2018, note 137, above, at p. 2 (**R-277**); Award, paras. 37, 104.\n\n*Vito G Gallo v.

Thus, the Tribunal cannot entertain Colombia's general Request for Relief either for all the Redacted Documents or for all the Privilege Log Documents.*\n\n*In order to solve this incident in the quickest and most efficient way possible, the Tribunal suggests that the Parties confer and try to reach an agreement on any disputed document. If, having made the appropriate good faith efforts to find a solution, it cannot be reached, the Tribunal will gladly solve any requests on a document-by-document basis.*\n\n*Under no circumstances shall this incident serve as an excuse to delay the hearing scheduled for May 28 \u2013 June 4, 2018.*153\n\nEmail from the Tribunal to the Parties, 6 March 2018 (\"*Tribunal's email of 6 March 2018*\") (**AAE-26**); Award, paras. 38, 105.\n\n103.\n\nBy a letter to the Tribunal dated 9 March 2018, Colombia reiterated its protest that Glencore and Prodeco had \"*openly disregarded*\" the procedural directions and timetable set forth by PO2, adding that the Tribunal had, by its communication of 6 March 2018 \"*implicitly accepted Claimants' belated privilege objections without stating any reason*\".154 In addition, Colombia argued that at least two of Colombia's arguments in its communication of 2 March 2018 did not require the Tribunal to rule on a \"*document-by-document basis*\". In particular, according to Colombia, a decision on a document-by-document basis was not required in order to rule that Glencore and Prodeco had failed to comply with the Tribunal's established timetable for raising objections to production requests, set out in PO2, and that documents sent or received by in-house counsel were not privileged.155\n\nLetter from Colombia to ICSID, 9 March 2018 (\"*Colombia's letter of 9 March 2018*\"), p. 1 (**R-273**).\n\nColombia's letter of 9 March 2018, note 154, above, at p. 1 (**R-273**); Award, para. 106.\n\n104.\n\nWith regard to communications between Prodeco and its in-house counsel, Colombia further contended that any privilege to which Prodeco might have been entitled had been waived when it permitted those counsel to give evidence in proceedings before the Colombian courts.156\n\nColombia's letter of 9 March 2018, note 154, above, at p. 3 (**R-273**).\n\n105.\n\nColombia also informed the Tribunal that the ANDJE had recently learned that the FGN157 had obtained copies of the files in possession of the SIC \"*in the context of a domestic criminal investigation into the illegalities surrounding the Eighth Amendment*\"158 and that, in accordance with Colombia's letter of 14 November 2017,159 neither Colombia's counsel nor the ANDJE had seen these files. However, referring to para. 89 of PO2, Colombia requested \"*the Tribunal's instructions to gather the evidence collected by the General Prosecutor and marshal it into the record*\".160 This issue was distinct from the dispute regarding privilege and was eventually dealt with by the Tribunal in PO6; it is considered in paras. 143 -151, below.\n\nSee para. 72, above.\n\nColombia's letter of 9 March 2018, note 154, above, at pp. 4-5 (**R-273**).\n\nColombia's letter of 14 November 2017, note 124, above (**C-283/R-275**); see para. 95, above.\n\nColombia's letter of 9 March 2018, note 154, above, at p. 5 (**R-273**).\n\n106.\n\nColombia added that it understood that \"*the Tribunal is adamant not to postpone the hearing scheduled for 28 May \u2013 4 June 2018*\" (the \"**Arbitration Hearing**\"), and stated that Colombia itself would also \"*oppose any request that the Hearing be rescheduled*\".161\n\nColombia's letter of 9 March 2018, note 154, above, at p. 4 (**R-273**).\n\n107.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco responded by letter on 12 March 2018.162 They maintained that Colombia had mischaracterized the Tribunal's communication of 6 March 2018, which had not upheld the claim of privilege but merely established the procedure by which that claim was to be resolved.163\n\nLetter from Claimants to ICSID, 12 March 2018 (\"*Claimants' letter of 12 March 2018*\") (**AAE-28**).\n\nClaimants' letter of 12 March 2018, note 162, above, at p. 1 (**AAE-28**).\n\n108.\n\nAlso on 12 March 2018, Colombia sent to Glencore and Prodeco its comments on the items in the Privilege Log.164\n\nLetter from Colombia to Claimants, 12 March 2018 (**AAE-27**).\n\n109.\n\nOn 17 March 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties stating that it had taken no decision with regard to the claim of privilege and reiterating that, if the Parties were unable to reach agreement on the individual documents, the Tribunal was ready to \"*adjudicate the issue on a document-by-document basis*\".165\n\nEmail from the Tribunal to the Parties, 17 March 2018 (\"*Tribunal's email of 17 March 2018*\") (**AAE-11**).\n\n110.\n\nBy letter of 27 March 2018, Colombia informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable to agree with regard to the production of the Redacted and Privilege Log documents, and requesting that the Tribunal order Glencore and Prodeco to produce the Disputed Documents.166 Colombia maintained that Glencore and Prodeco had refused its request to identify which of the documents in the Privilege Log were among the Disputed SIC Documents and that this refusal had impeded the process of document production.167 Colombia attached to the letter an annex comprising the privilege log with two additional columns containing Colombia's document-by-document response to the assertion of privilege and Glencore and Prodeco's replies.168\n\nLetter from Colombia to ICSID, 27 March 2018 (\"*Colombia's letter of 27 March 2018*\") (**RAE-2**).\n\nColombia's letter of 27 March 2018, note 166, above, at p. 1 (**RAE-2**).\n\nColombia's letter of 27 March 2018, note 166, above, at Annex A (**RAE-2**).\n\n***(4) Procedural Order No. 4 (24 April 2018)***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal ruled on the privilege dispute in its Procedural Order No. 4 of 24 April 2018. Having summarised the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal identified three issues which it had to decide:\n\n- *Whether Claimants failed to follow the appropriate proceedings [sic] for filing their Privilege Log;*\n\n- *Whether attorney client privilege extends to in-house counsel; and*\n\n- *Whether Claimants properly asserted settlement privilege over the Disputed Documents.*169\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 35 (**AAE-9**).\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that the law applicable to these questions was international law:\n\n*The Parties have based their pleadings first on international law,*170 *and alternatively on municipal law. This approach is consistent with the BIT and the ICSID Convention: while the Colombia-Switzerland BIT has no provision regarding the applicable substantive law, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention establishes that, in the absence of an agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute and such rules of international law as may be applicable.*171\n\nCiting Claimants' letter of 2 March 2018, note 137, above (**R-277**) and Colombia's letter of 23 February 2018, note 139, above (**R-272**).\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 37 (**AAE-9**).\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to agree with the view expressed by the *Vito Gallo*172 tribunal that \"*domestic legal concepts of solicitor-client privilege are recognized and protected by international law*\".173 It also held that the concept of settlement privilege was protected by international law.174\n\nSee *Vito Gallo*, note 148, above, at para. 41 (**RL-129**).\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 38 (**AAE-9**).\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 39 (**AAE-9**).\n\n114.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal referred to Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, under which \"*any question of procedure \u2026 which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties*\" are to be decided by the tribunal,175 and the IBA Rules.176\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 40 (**AAE-9**).\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 41 (**AAE-9**).\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that Glencore and Prodeco had not complied with PO2 in the timing of their assertion of privilege but that this failure had not deprived Colombia of its procedural rights or prevented a full presentation of the Parties' different positions on the issues requiring resolution.177 It therefore rejected Colombia's argument that the claim of privilege should be dismissed *in limine*.178\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 46 (**AAE-9**).\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 47 (**AAE-9**).\n\n116.\n\nWith regard to the question whether international law treated communications with in-house legal counsel for the purpose of seeking or receiving legal advice as privileged, the Tribunal considered that whether or not lawyer-client communications were privileged depended not on the status of the lawyer but on whether the communication in question met four conditions: (i) that the document was drafted by a lawyer acting in their capacity as a lawyer; (ii) that a solicitor-client relationship based on trust existed between the lawyer and the client; (iii) that the document had been elaborated for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice; and (iv) that the lawyer and the client, when giving and obtaining the legal advice, must have acted with the expectation that the advice would be kept confidential in a contentious situation.179\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 54 (**AAE-9**).\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that no distinction between in-house and external counsel was mentioned either in *Vito Gallo* or in the IBA Rules and cited the decision in *Reineccius v. Bank for International Settlements* that privilege extended to \"*the legal communications \u2026 between an attorney (whether in-house or outside) and those who are afforded his or her professional advice for the purposes of making or in contemplation of that* decision\".180 The Tribunal concluded that international law made no such distinction, so long as the documents in question met the conditions set out in the preceding paragraph. It concluded that \"[t]*o rule otherwise would imply an unwarranted discrimination towards parties that choose to be represented in investment arbitration, or that seek advice on matters that may become relevant in investment arbitration, by in-house counsel*\"*.*181\n\n*Reineccius v. Bank for International Settlements*, Procedural Order No. 6 of 11 June 2002, UNRIAA vol. XXIII, p. 180 (\"*Reineccius*\").\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 55 (**AAE-9**).\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to consider the position under Colombian law, noting the different conclusions drawn by the Parties from the authorities put before it, and concluded that it would have reached the same conclusion that communications meeting the four conditions were protected under Colombian law whether they were with in-house or external counsel.182\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at paras. 57-63 (**AAE-9**).\n\n119.\n\nIn light of its conclusions on international law and Colombian law, the Tribunal held that:\n\n*\u2026 it is reasonable to presume that when consulted with a view to obtaining legal advice and then when providing such advice, Claimants' in-house counsel acted with the expectation that legal privilege would be protected. Respondent has not presented any evidence to prove otherwise.*183\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 67 (**AAE-9**).\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal also rejected Colombia's argument that privilege had been waived. While accepting that a client could \"*waive the professional secrecy privilege of their in-house or outside counsel*\",184 it held that there had been no such waiver in the present case, either by Prodeco's act of requesting privileged documents from Colombia185 or permitting its in-house counsel to testify, since they did not disclose legal advice.186\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 68 (**AAE-9**).\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 72 (**AAE-9**).\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 73 (**AAE-9**).\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal upheld the principle of settlement privilege. It noted that settlement privilege had not been claimed in respect of any document for which legal privilege was not also asserted.187 It held, however, that, given there was a theoretical possibility that settlement privilege might exist in relation to a document for which legal privilege was inapplicable, it was appropriate to rule on the claim of settlement privilege.188 The Tribunal considered that settlement privilege had properly been asserted.189 It is unnecessary, however, for the Committee to consider that aspect of the Tribunal's ruling.\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 77 (**AAE-9**), citing the Claimants' letter of 2 March 2018, note 137, above, at p. 11 (**R-277**).\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 78 (**AAE-9**).\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at paras. 83-91 (**AAE-9**).\n\n122.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal directed lead counsel for Glencore and Prodeco:\n\n*To submit by April 27, 2018 an affidavit identifying that each of the Disputed Documents meets all the foregoing Requirements, and*\n\n*To produce by the same date, in unredacted form, any and all Disputed Documents that do not meet the Requirements.*190\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 95 (**AAE-9**). The deadline was later extended.\n\n123.\n\nAdditionally, the Arbitral Tribunal established a cut-off date for introducing further evidence or filing further submissions in this proceeding, stating that:\n\n*After May 11, 2018 no new submissions and no additional evidence shall be admitted into the file, except as provided in the following paragraph.*\n\n*If in exceptional circumstances and for unexpected reasons any of the Parties considers that it is of paramount importance that an exception to the rule be made, it shall file a motion, asking for authorization, stating the grounds therefor, and without attaching the new submission or evidence. After hearing the other Party the Tribunal will decide. Any submission made or evidence marshalled in breach of this provision will be disregarded.*191\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at paras. 98-99 (**AAE-9**).\n\n***(5) Developments following Procedural Order No. 4***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Claim of Privilege*\n----------------------------\n\n124.\n\nOn 30 April 2018, lead counsel for Glencore and Prodeco (Mr Nigel Blackaby, QC) submitted an affidavit in which he stated:\n\n*Pursuant to Procedural Order no. 4 dated 24 April 2018, and the Tribunal's communication on 27 April 2018, I confirm that I have reviewed all the Disputed Documents over which Claimants* [i.e. Glencore and Prodeco] *have asserted privilege, as identified in the Privilege Log attached to the Claimants' letter of 5 February 2018 (****Privilege Log****).*\n\n*I confirm that each of the Disputed Documents over which the Claimants have asserted privilege fulfils the Requirements set out in paragraph 54 of Procedural Order No. 4, with the exception of \u2026 two documents.*192\n\nAffidavit of Mr Nigel Blackaby QC, 30 April 2018, paras. 3-4. The Affidavit, which formed part of the record before the Tribunal, was not produced in the annulment proceedings but both Parties referred to it at the hearing before the Committee and the Committee therefore considers it appropriate to quote it in the Decision.\n\n125.\n\nThe affidavit then gave brief details of two documents which were annexed to the affidavit. The Committee is not clear whether these documents were later relied on by Colombia, nor if they were among the Disputed SIC Documents.\n\n126.\n\nBy letter dated 7 May 2018, Colombia wrote to Glencore and Prodeco to state that it had identified twenty-four of the Disputed Documents which, in its view, ought to have been produced by Glencore in response to the Tribunal's instructions in PO3. These documents, according to Colombia, (i) were responsive to its production requests as approved, in narrowed terms, by PO3; and (ii) were not covered by the requirements, established by the Tribunal in PO4, for the application of legal or settlement privilege.193 Colombia accordingly requested the production of these documents by Glencore. The twenty-four documents that were the subject of this request were detailed in a list attached as \"Annex A\" to Colombia's letter (the \"**Annex A Documents**\"). It appears that all twenty-four documents were among the forty-one Disputed SIC Documents.194\n\nLetter from Colombia to ICSID, 11 May 2018 (\"*Colombia's letter of 11 May 2018*\"), p. 41 (**AAE-12**).\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above, at p. 9, note 1 (**AAE-12**).\n\n127.\n\nOn 10 May 2018 Glencore and Prodeco wrote to refuse Colombia's request.195 In this communication they stated that:\n\n*\u2026 only 6 of the 24 Excluded Documents now requested were actually included in Claimants' Privilege Log. One of the documents requested has already been disclosed. Claimants did not assert privilege in respect of the remaining documents because production was not required. The documents were not responsive to Colombia's document requests as narrowed by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No 3. Consequently, Claimants* [Glencore] *did not produce them and did not need to decide if it was necessary to assert privilege over them.*196\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above, at p. 7 (**AAE-12**).\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above, at p. 7 (**AAE-12**).\n\n128.\n\nOn 11 May 2018, Colombia wrote to refer the matter to the Tribunal. By its letter, to which the above correspondence between the Parties was attached, Colombia requested that the Tribunal review the Annex A Documents and Colombia's reasons, as detailed therein, as to why these should be produced by Glencore.197 As before, Colombia argued that these documents were both responsive to its document production requests, and were not protected by either legal or settlement privilege, and as such ought to have been produced by Glencore. Colombia asserted that Glencore's refusal to produce the requested documents on the grounds that \"*[t]he documents were not responsive to Colombia's document requests*\" was \"*disingenuous*\" given that:\n\n[w]*hen preparing its request for production of documents, Colombia was already aware of the existence of categories of documents (such as the Disputed Documents) that were material and relevant for its case and, thus, framed its requests in such a manner as to cover such Documents.*198\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above, at p. 5 (**AAE-12**); Award, paras. 54, 125.\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above, at p. 4 (**AAE-12**).\n\n129.\n\nAccordingly, Colombia asked the Tribunal to order Glencore to produce the documents listed in its Annex A, and to admit them into the record.199 Annex A took the form of a Redfern Schedule in which Colombia set out its arguments as to why each document was responsive to one of Colombia's requests and was not entitled to legal or settlement privilege. Glencore and Prodeco's response to these arguments was set out in the final column of the Schedule. In the alternative, Colombia indicated that it would not object to the Tribunal appointing a conflicts counsel (i.e. a privilege inspector) to analyse the documents.200\n\nAward, para. 54.\n\nAward, para. 54.\n\n130.\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Glencore and Prodeco filed their response to Colombia's 11 May request and asked the Tribunal to reject Colombia's request to admit the Annex A Documents on the basis that, in each case, the document requested was either privileged or not responsive to the requests made by Colombia on 14 December 2017 (see para. 97, above) and dealt with by the Tribunal in PO3.201\n\nLetter from Claimants to ICSID, 14 May 2018 (\"*Claimants' letter of 14 May 2018*\") (**AAE-33**); Award, para. 55.\n\n131.\n\nOn 15 May 2018, Colombia wrote to the Tribunal elaborating on its 11 May request concerning the Annex A Documents.202 Glencore and Prodeco responded to this communication by a letter to the Tribunal dated 17 May 2018, reiterating their request that the Tribunal reject Colombia's request to submit the Annex A documents into the record and opposing Colombia's alternative proposal that the matter be referred to a conflicts counsel.203\n\nLetter from Colombia to ICSID, 15 May 2018 (\"*Colombia's letter of 15 May 2018*\") (**AAE-34**); Award, paras. 56, 128.\n\nLetter from Claimants to ICSID, 17 May 2018 (\"*Claimants' letter of 17 May 2018*\") (**AAE-35**); Award, paras. 56, 129.\n\n*(b) The FGN Documents*\n-----------------------\n\n132.\n\nIn paragraph 89 of PO2 (para. 93, above), the Tribunal required that if a Party wished to put into the record \"*evidence gathered from a criminal procedure in Colombia*\", it should seek the permission of the Tribunal.\n\n133.\n\nAs already stated (para. 105, above), in its letter of 9 March 2018, Colombia sought the \"*Tribunal's instructions to gather the evidence collected by the General Prosecutor* [the FGN] *and marshal it into the record*\".204\n\nColombia's letter of 9 March 2018, note 154, above, at p. 4 (**R-273**).\n\n134.\n\nIn their letter of 12 March 2018, Glencore and Prodeco protested against Colombia's attempt to introduce the documents seized by the SIC on the basis that they were now in the possession of the FGN.205 They demanded that the documents be reviewed by Mr Enciso, in accordance with Colombia's letter of 14 November 2017 so as to exclude the documents referred to in PO2 and that Colombia provide the Tribunal and themselves with a detailed log of these documents.\n\nClaimants' letter of 12 March 2018, note 162, above, at pp. 2-4 (**AAE-28**).\n\n135.\n\nThe Tribunal addressed this matter in its letter of 17 March 2018, in which it directed that:\n\n*All documents collected by the General Prosecutor which Respondent might wish to marshal into the record of this proceeding should be delivered to Mr. Enciso, Respondent's designated special counsel. Mr. Enciso should exclude from the documents received any Confidential Attorney Communications (PO 2, para. 94; Respondent's letter of November 14, 2017). The Tribunal recommends that Mr. Enciso keep a written record of his filtering process.*\n\n*Once so filtered, the documents may be handed to Respondent's counsel (Dechert), who will then be free to make a document-by-document application pursuant to para. 89(2) of PO2. Any such application shall identify the document by its date, names of sender and recipient, and subject-matter, and specify whether the document refers or contains legal advice of any kind and whether it is one of the Disputed Documents (as this term is used in PO 2). The application shall not include the document in question.*\n\n*The Tribunal will issue a decision, after hearing Claimant.*206\n\nTribunal's email of 17 March 2018, note 165, above (**AAE-11**).\n\n136.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's instructions, on 5 April 2018, Counsel for Colombia sent a memorandum to Mr Enciso, informing him of the Tribunal's procedural directions to gather and filter the evidence collected by FGN, and providing him \"*with a list of key-words that would enable him to perform searches in the vast amount of information gathered*\".207\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above, at p. 2 (**AAE-12**).\n\n137.\n\nThereafter, by its letter dated 11 May 2018, Colombia requested that the Tribunal admit into the record certain documents, specified in Annex C of the letter, which had been gathered by the FGN and filtered by Mr Enciso in accordance with the Tribunal's directions (the \"**FGN Documents**\").208\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above, at p. 2 (**AAE-12**); Application, para. 72.\n\n138.\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Glencore filed its response to Colombia's 11 May request and asked the Tribunal to deny the application to admit the FGN Documents.209 Glencore stated that these did not amount to evidence garnered by the Colombian criminal courts and that Colombia had failed to demonstrate their relevance to the Parties' dispute.210\n\nClaimants' letter of 14 May 2018, note 201, above (**AAE-33**); Award, para. 55.\n\nClaimants' letter of 14 May 2018, note 201, above (**AAE-33**); Award, para. 55, 126.\n\n139.\n\nAlso on 14 May 2018, the Tribunal and the Parties held the pre-hearing conference call, in which Colombia agreed to provide Glencore with the FGN Documents.211 It was further agreed that Glencore would submit their comments on Colombia's request to submit the FGN documents to the Tribunal by 17 May 2018, and that, given the \"*time sensitive nature of the Parties' requests*\" the Tribunal would issue a decision on the FGN documents by 18 May, with a \"*full decision and reasoning*\" to follow afterwards.212\n\nAward, para. 127.\n\nAward, para. 127.\n\n140.\n\nOn 15 May 2018, Colombia wrote to the Tribunal elaborating on its 11 May request concerning the FGN Documents.213 It argued that, under the Colombian Constitution, the FGN is defined as an independent organ of the \"*judicial branch*\" and that its functions are akin to those of the *jueces de instrucci\u00f3n* (*juges d'instruction*) in the Spanish and French criminal systems. Colombia added that the FGN could also fall within the definition of an \"*Independent Prosecutor*\" set out in PO2.214 Glencore and Prodeco responded to this communication by a letter to the Tribunal dated 17 May 2018, requesting that the Tribunal reject Colombia's request to submit the FGN documents into the record.215\n\nColombia's letter of 15 May 2018, note 202, above (**AAE-34**).\n\nColombia's letter of 15 May 2018, note 202, above at p. 4 (**AAE-34**).\n\nClaimants' letter of 17 May 2018, note 203, above (**AAE-35**); Award, paras. 56, 129.\n\n***(6) The Tribunal's Letter of 18 May 2018 and Procedural Order No. 6***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nOn 18 May 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties regarding the Annex A Documents, the FGN Documents and a document which Glencore and Prodeco had applied to include in the record. In view of the fact that the Arbitration Hearing was due to start in ten days' time, the Tribunal gave its decision on the requests and stated that a reasoned decision would follow at a later date. The Tribunal stated that:\n\n*The Arbitral Tribunal has decided not to admit into the record any of the documents requested by the Parties for the following reasons:*\n\n*1. Claimants' petition to admit the technical report identified in its email of May 11, 2018 is belated since Claimants were the last to file a main submission.*\n\n*2. Respondent's petition to admit the FGN Documents: the FGN Documents did not make it into the record through Document Production and are not part of a formal* acusaci\u00f3n *in a Colombian criminal court proceeding. Thus, the Tribunal sees no reason to admit them into the record.*\n\n*3. Respondent's petition to admit Annex A Documents: there are two types of documents that Respondent wishes the Tribunal to admit into the record:*\n\n*a. documents that Claimants' counsel has confirmed are subject to privilege and*\n\n*b. documents which \u2013 according to Claimants' counsel \u2013 are not responsive to the Tribunal's decisions in PO3.*\n\n*It falls within the responsibility of Claimants' counsel to determine which documents are responsive to Respondent's petitions (as narrowed down by the Tribunal) and which are subject to privilege. The Tribunal has no reason to second guess these decisions.*\n\n*A full decision will follow in the next days.*216\n\nAward, para. 130.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal set out its reasons in Procedural Order No. 6 on 31 July 2018.\n\n143.\n\nWith regard to the FGN Documents, the Tribunal held that:\n\n*Based on the Tribunal's ruling in PO No. 2, three conditions must be satisfied cumulatively in order for evidence from criminal proceedings to be admissible:*\n\n- *The evidence must be \"gathered\" or \"marshaled\" in the course of a criminal proceeding (i)* [citing PO2, para. 89]*;*\n\n- *Evidence must not be privileged (ii)* [citing PO2, para. 92]*;*\n\n- *Evidence must be relevant and material to this arbitration (iii)* [citing PO2, para. 88]*.*217\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at para. 99 (**AAE-10**).\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal recalled that in PO2:\n\n*\u2026 the Tribunal distinguished between documents procured by an administrative agency and documents \"obtained\", \"gathered\" or \"marshaled\" in judicial criminal proceedings, i.e. evidence obtained by prosecutors or judges that would become the basis of a formal indictment.*218\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at para. 101 (**AAE-10**).\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal found that:\n\n*The FGN Documents do not meet this standard. They were not \"gathered\", \"obtained\" or \"marshaled\" by the FGN in the course of investigative or prosecutorial activities: the SIC simply delivered these documents to the FGN at ANDJE's behest.*219\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at para. 102 (**AAE-10**).\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal held that to allow in documents seized by the SIC which the Tribunal had excluded in PO2 merely because they had been handed to the FGN \"*would contradict the Tribunal's analysis and decision in PO 2*\".220\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at para. 103 (**AAE-10**).\n\n147.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal observed that criminal complaints in Colombia go through four separate phases. It held that:\n\n*In any case, the criminal proceeding launched by ANDJE's complaint is still in the preliminary stage, and the FGN Documents are not part of a formal* acusaci\u00f3n *in a Colombian criminal court proceeding. The Complaint has \u2013 as far as the Tribunal is aware \u2013 not passed the First Phase,* Indagaci\u00f3n*, and has not resulted in any indictment, which would eventually trigger the Second Phase:* Investigaci\u00f3n*, let alone an* imputaci\u00f3n *and later* acusaci\u00f3n *of any person. Thus, the FGN documents have not yet given rise to a formal indictment, and may never do so.*221\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at para. 104 (**AAE-10**).\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concluded that the first requirement was not met222 and rejected Colombia's request to introduce the documents into the record.\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at paras. 101, 106 (**AAE-10**).\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal also rejected the request to include the Annex A Documents from the trove of documents seized by the SIC. The Tribunal noted that Colombia had argued that, notwithstanding the submissions of Glencore and Prodeco, these documents were not privileged and were responsive to Colombia's requests.\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal held that:\n\n*It falls within the responsibility of Claimants' counsel to determine which documents are responsive to Respondent's requests (as narrowed down by the Tribunal* [in PO3]*) and which are subject to privilege. Equally, it falls within the responsibility of Respondent's counsel to determine which documents are responsive to Claimants' requests and which are subject to privilege.*\n\n*Claimants' lead legal counsel, aware of his responsibilities, and prompted by the Tribunal, has filed an affidavit declaring that all the documents included in Claimants' Privilege Log meet the Requirements of para. 54 of PO No. 4 regarding Confidential Attorney Communications and Settlement Privilege. Claimants produced to Respondent the two only documents which did not fulfill the Requirements.*\n\n*Claimants' counsel has made its assessment of the responsiveness and privilege of the Excluded Documents. Respondent has not provided sufficient grounds to make the Tribunal doubt the correctness or good faith of that assessment.*223\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at paras. 111-113 (**AAE-10**).\n\n151.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal noted that, if either Party wished to suggest that the Tribunal draw \"*adverse inferences based on the counterparty's decision regarding responsiveness and privilege of ordered documents*\", it should make detailed allegations to that effect in its post-hearing brief.224\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at para. 114 (**AAE-10**).\n\n***(7) Document R-100***\n------------------------\n\n152.\n\nOne of the documents originally seized by the SIC and which was also included in both the Annex A Documents and the FGN Documents did eventually find its way into the record. This was an email chain, part of which had been submitted by Colombia with the original Counter-Memorial that was later withdrawn.225 After discussion at the hearing before the Tribunal, Glencore and Prodeco agreed to waive the privilege which they had asserted in respect of this document provided that the whole email chain was admitted into the record.226\n\nThe partial email chain was Document **R-54**. Award, para. 658.\n\nIt became Document **R-100**. Award, para. 659.\n\n153.\n\nThat came about as follows. On Day 2 of the Arbitration Hearing, the President of the Tribunal raised the question whether there was any evidence which suggested a relationship between Mr Maldonado and Mr Ballesteros, a matter which he suggested was central to the allegation that the payment for the three hectare concession caused Mr Ballesteros to accept the Eighth Amendment.227 Counsel for Colombia replied that the evidence which the Tribunal had not seen established the link between the three hectare concession and the Eighth Amendment, although he added that \"*it doesn't establish a relationship between Maldonado and Ballesteros*\".228 He then added that:\n\n*There is an email that shows, pursuant to our submission, that the Eighth Amendment was possible because the 3-hectares Contract pleased Ballesteros.*229\n\nTribunal Tr., Day 2, p. 363:5-364:16 (President Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto).\n\nTribunal Tr., Day 2, p. 365:8-12 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nTribunal Tr., Day 2, p. 366:20-22 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal requested clarification as to whether the document referenced by counsel for Colombia in this statement was the document originally submitted by Colombia with its Counter-Memorial as exhibit R-54, and a discussion followed about whether there were any \"*other documents*\".230 In response it was confirmed by counsel for Colombia that:\n\n*That will be the only document.*231\n\nTribunal Tr*.*, Day 2, p. 372:12-17.\n\nTribunal Tr*.*, Day 2, p. 373:2-3 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n155.\n\nColombia had specifically raised R-54 in its letter to the Tribunal dated 11 May 2018, addressing its request for the production of the Annex A documents.232 At that time it described the content of the document as follows:\n\n*By way of illustration, the Disputed Document formerly submitted as exhibit R-54 is responsive to Colombia's request No. 9 (\"*Documents reflecting any link between the assignment of the 3ha Contract (R-97) and the Commitment to Negotiate (C-91)*\"). In this chain of emails, Mr. Nagle shared his views with Prodeco's management on how Prodeco had secured Mr. Ballesteros' support in the negotiations that led to the execution of the Commitment to Negotiate and, later, to the Eighth Amendment. But Claimants refuse to produce this document, even though it does not comply cumulatively with the Requirements. In fact, while Mr. Nagle replied to an email by Natalia Anaya, such email was not \"*elaborated for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice*\" (Requirement No. 3). Instead, Ms Anaya's email simply provided Prodeco's management team with an account of a conversation that she had with Ms. Marcela Estrada (then member of Ingeominas' legal department). For the same reason, exhibit* ***R-54*** *is not a document \"*drafted by a lawyer acting in his or her capacity as lawyer*\" (Requirement No. 1). Neither can Claimants claim that a solicitor-client relationship based on trust existed (Requirement No. 2), nor that Ms. Anaya and Mr. Nagle had an expectation that this document would be kept confidential in a contentious situation (Requirement No. 4). In addition, in no way does* ***R-54*** *disclose Claimants' settlement position in regard to the interpretation of \"definitive price\" under the Seventh Amendment. Claimants implicitly admit that* ***R-54*** *is not privileged when they assert that they are claiming privilege over a \"*broader email chain*,\" which may contain legal advice sought or given by Prodeco's in-house counsel. Claimants, however, cannot assert legal privilege by extension over the Document identified by Colombia if such document, in itself, does not cumulatively comply with the Requirements. In any case, Claimants could have produced redacted versions of this chain of emails. But they did not.*233\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above (**AAE-12**).\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above, at pp. 3-4 (**AAE-12**).\n\n156.\n\nIn response to the allegations made at the oral hearing, counsel for Glencore and Prodeco maintained that \"*R-54 is an incomplete e-mail chain*\" and that the \"*complete chain is R-100*\".234 He added that\n\n*We have no objection to the document going in effectively on two conditions. One is that we have the complete chain. We don't have the cut-off chain of 54, which is an incomplete conversation, that that is fully incorporated within the full e-mail chain, which is--which was R-100, on the understanding that our submission of that document into the record does not constitute a broader waiver of privilege with regard to the other privileged documents in respect of which we assert it since it contains the opinion of Ms. Anaya with regard to certain issues. In particular, that was the discussion about the escrow account. You will recall the discussion about the dispute on Amendment 7, with regard to whether or not the fact that we believe the clear language of the text permitted us to make a certain calculation, and there was a dispute because we had been performing it in another way, then a middle was an escrow account. That was a point of hot debate and in the middle of that discussion effectively we--this is when that e-mail exchange took place.[\u2026] and a second condition, because it was not a document that was on the record for purposes of the arbitration yesterday when we gave our opening speech, so the other condition would be obviously that we be allowed to address that document in the same way as we would have been able to address that document in our opening speech.*235\n\nTribunal Tr*.*, Day 2, p. 373:17-18 (Mr Blackaby).\n\nTribunal Tr*.*, Day 2, pp. 374:4-375:11 (Mr Blackaby).\n\n157.\n\nFollowing this exchange, The Tribunal requested that the Parties agree that the email in question, which seemed a highly relevant document, be introduced into the record.236 Both Parties agreed to the request, and it was further agreed to include the complete email chain in which the email was inserted as Document R-100.237\n\nTribunal Tr*.*, Day 2, pp. 376:15-378:6; Award, para. 659.\n\nTribunal Tr*.*, Day 2, p. 378:3-15 (President Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto); Award, para. 659.\n\n158.\n\nColombia asserts that \"*[t]his was the only document obtained in the 2014 SIC investigation that was admitted into the record*\".238 That is not, however, the case as one of these documents had earlier been provided by Glencore and Prodeco during the document production phase.239\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 96.\n\nSee Colombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above, at p. 7 (**AAE-12**), quoted at para. 127, above. It is not possible for the Committee to determine whether any of the other documents produced by Glencore and Prodeco, e.g. the two documents in respect of which Mr Blackaby stated that the requirements of privilege were not met (para. 124, above) were among the Disputed SIC Documents.\n\n**D. T****he** **A****ward**\n----------------------------\n\n159.\n\nIn the *dispositif* of the Award, the Tribunal ruled that it:\n\n*Dismisses Respondent's Illegality Objection, Fork in the Road Objection, and Inadmissibility Objection, upholds Respondent's Umbrella Clause Objection, and declares that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal is competent to adjudicate claims grounded on breach of Arts. 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty.*\n\n*Declares that that the* Contralor\u00eda's *conduct in calculating the damage allegedly suffered by the Republic of Colombia as a result of the execution of the Eighth Amendment constitutes (i) an unreasonable measure which has impaired Claimants' investment in Colombia in breach of Art. 4(1) of the Treaty and (ii) a breach of fair and equitable treatment, in violation of Art. 4(2) of the Treaty.*\n\n*Orders the Republic of Colombia to restitute to C.I. Prodeco S.A. the Fiscal Liability Amount in the sum of USD 19,100,000.*\n\n*Orders the Republic of Colombia to pay interest over the amount established in para. 3 from 19 January 2016 until the date of actual payment, at the rate of LIBOR for six-month deposits plus a margin of 2%, capitalised semi-annually.*\n\n*Declares that the payment of restitution and interest awarded to Prodeco in accordance with this Award must be neutral as regards Colombian taxes, with the consequences set forth in para. 1630 of this Award, and orders the Republic of Colombia to indemnify Prodeco with respect to any Colombian taxes in breach of such principle.*\n\n*Orders the Republic of Colombia to reimburse Claimants (i) the Costs of the Proceedings (net of any final reimbursements by ICSID) and (ii) USD 1,692,900 as Defense Expenses, plus interest on both amounts at a rate of LIBOR for six-month deposits with a margin of 2%, capitalised semi-annually from the date of this award until the date of actual payment.*\n\n*Dismisses all other claims, objections and defences.*240\n\nAward, para. 1687.\n\n160.\n\nThe reasoning of the Tribunal which led it to these conclusions runs to over 300 pages. For present purposes, however, it is necessary to consider only two parts of that reasoning. First, the Tribunal repeated in the Award the reasons which had led it to make the decisions contained in PO2, PO3, PO4 and PO6.241 As the Committee has already discussed those Procedural Orders and their reasoning in some detail (see paras. 63 -151, above), it is unnecessary to analyse these parts of the Award as well.\n\nAward, paras. 68-134.\n\n161.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal considered at length and then rejected Colombia's argument that the investment had been made in breach of Colombian law and was therefore outside the scope of the BIT with the result that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction (the \"**Illegality Objection**\").242 Colombia's case on annulment is bound up with the way in which the Tribunal approached and decided the Illegality Objection so that it is necessary for the Committee to set out the Tribunal's reasoning in detail before examining whether the Award is subject to annulment.\n\nAward, paras. 553-860.\n\n162.\n\nThere were two strands to the Illegality Objection: (a) the allegation that Glencore and Prodeco had procured the Eighth Amendment by corruption, on the basis that the payment to Mr Maldonado had also benefitted Mr Ballesteros; and (b) that the Eighth Amendment was not concluded in accordance with the requirements of Colombian law regarding the operations of Ingeominas and that Prodeco was guilty of bad faith, misrepresentation and concealment in the negotiations.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal began by setting out what it held were the proven facts in connection with these allegations. It found that the three-hectare area was located in the middle of the concessions held by the Prodeco Affiliates243 and that:\n\n*It seems that the three-hectare gap was the result of clerical errors in the mapping of the concessions granted in the 1990s and 2000s. While it remains uncertain whether these errors were accidental or intentional, it should be noted that Mr. Maldonado worked in Carbocol and in the subsequent mining agencies from 1988 through 2002 and was accordingly in a position to obtain insider information on the three-hectare gap.*244\n\nSee the sketch map at para. 596 of the Award.\n\nAward, para. 597.\n\n164.\n\nIn November 2006 Mr Maldonado (who was by then a former employee of the Ministry of Mines and of Carbocol, the predecessor of Ingeominas) and Mr Garc\u00eda applied to Ingeominas for the grant of a concession contract for the three-hectare area.245 In March 2007, Ingeominas concluded that such a contract would overlap with existing concessions and that the area was too small for a stand-alone concession. It therefore rejected the application.246 Mr Maldonado subsequently challenged this decision in May 2007 but nothing happened until April 2008.247\n\nAward, para. 596.\n\nAward, para. 598.\n\nAward, para. 600.\n\n165.\n\nIn early 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates obtained from Ingeominas agreement for integrated operations on the La Jagua site. The existence of the three-hectare gap, however, threatened the viability of integrated operations. The Prodeco Affiliates therefore petitioned Ingeominas either to correct the errors which had created the three-hectare gap or reject the Maldonado request for a separate contract for that area.248 In June 2008, however, Ingeominas changed its assessment of the Maldonado request, found that the three-hectare area did not overlap with other concessions and revoked its rejection of Mr Maldonado's application.249 A request for reconsideration by the Prodeco Affiliates was rejected in August 2008.250\n\nAward, para. 601.\n\nAward, para. 602.\n\nAward, para. 603.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal then found that Prodeco complained to various Colombian authorities about the proposed grant to Messrs Maldonado and Garcia of a concession for the three-hectare area. It held that, between August and October 2008, the Prodeco Affiliates complained to: the *Procurador General de la Naci\u00f3n*, the *Ministro de la Presidencia*, the *Contralor\u00eda*, the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the *Jefe del Registro Minero Nacional*.251 The Tribunal observed that:\n\n*Respondent has not provided evidence of any reaction from any of the Colombian authorities to whom Prodeco complained. There is also no written record of any of these authorities taking any action to rectify the situation.*252\n\nAward, paras. 605-608.\n\nAward, para. 610.\n\n167.\n\nThe three-hectare contract was granted to Mr Maldonado and Mr Garcia on 16 October 2008253 and Prodeco and its Affiliates continued to complain thereafter.254 The Tribunal found, however, that Prodeco was left with the choice of either buying out the three-hectare concession from Mr Maldonado and Mr Garc\u00eda or \"*to mine around the area, which would imply losing up to 11 million tonnes of coal*\".255 Prodeco made a further complaint to the *Ministro de la Presidencia* in March 2009 but, having received no answer,256 it bought the three-hectare concession for USD 1.75 million in May 2009.257\n\nAward, para. 611.\n\nAward, para. 612.\n\nAward, para. 616.\n\nAward, paras. 617-618.\n\nAward, para. 250.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal found that CDJ had made the payment in Colombian currency to accounts with Colombian banks, had made the tax withholding required by Colombian law and had reflected the payment in its audited accounts. In February 2010 CDJ had informed Ingeominas of the price paid.258 The Tribunal also found that Prodeco had continued to raise the question whether the grant of a concession to Mr Maldonado and Mr Garc\u00eda had been irregular after it had bought out their rights.259\n\nAward, paras. 622-624.\n\nAward, paras. 625-626.\n\n169.\n\nFollowing a change of government in Colombia in August 2010, the new Minister of Mines and Energy gave a press conference at which he referred to the way in which \"[c]*ertain well-connected individuals had been able to register mining licenses in small strategic areas, in order to 'greenmail' owners of adjacent mining exploitations*\".260 The Tribunal observed that:\n\n*It is noteworthy that during this press conference Minister Rodado used a PowerPoint presentation in which Prodeco's three-hectare concession was clearly visible, and that in his public statement there is no allegation that Prodeco had bribed any public official or had otherwise engaged in improper conduct. To the contrary, he explicitly stated that most mining companies working in Colombia were responsible enterprises. At that time, criticism was directed at the former Ingeominas employees who had granted the irregular mining contracts.*261\n\nAward, para. 627.\n\nAward, para. 628.\n\n170.\n\nNor was there any suggestion of corruption on the part of Prodeco in the Fiscal Liability proceeding (see para. 52, above) and there was no reference to the three-hectare contract in the files of the *Contralor\u00eda*.262 Similarly, no suggestion of corruption on the part of Prodeco or Glencore was made during the Procedure for Contractual Annulment (see para. 55, above).263 The first such suggestion appeared in September 2017, when the ANDJE filed a criminal complaint to the FGN against unnamed officers of Prodeco and Glencore and against various named Ingeominas officials (see para. 72, above).264\n\nAward, paras. 630-632.\n\nAward, para. 633.\n\nAward, paras. 634-637.\n\n171.\n\nAfter reviewing the procedural history regarding the Disputed SIC Documents and the contents of Document R-100 (see paras. 152 -157, above),265 the Tribunal set out its decision on the allegations of corruption.266 It began by making clear that it regarded the allegation as one of the utmost gravity:\n\n*Corruption is morally odious: the proper governance of public affairs and the correct assignment of public goods is substituted by favour and arbitrariness. Corruption is also economically deleterious: it restrains economic development and subdues nations into under-development and poverty, as bribes enriching well-connected civil servants or politicians are financed via inflated prices paid or reductions in income suffered by the poorest citizens. Scarce public funds are misdirected by enriching privileged individuals, at the expense of the common good.*\n\n*The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that, provided that there are* prima facie *grounds for suspecting malfeasance, an international arbitration tribunal has the duty to investigate the facts, even* sua sponte*, and to take appropriate measures under the applicable principles of law.*267\n\nAward, paras. 639-661.\n\nAward, paras. 662-747.\n\nAward, paras. 663-664.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal held that an investment made in breach of Colombian law would not be within the scope of the BIT, with the result that the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction.268 According to the Tribunal:\n\n*\u2026 if Claimants have bribed Mr Ballesteros, disguising the corrupt payment as the consideration for the acquisition of the 3ha Contract, the necessary consequence will be the loss of international law protection.*269\n\nAward, para. 665.\n\nAward, para. 666.\n\n173.\n\nThe question, therefore, was whether corruption had been proved.270 The Tribunal considered that the burden of proving that Mr Ballesteros had been bribed was on Colombia and the standard of proof was the preponderance of the evidence.271\n\nAward, para. 667.\n\nAward, paras. 668-670.\n\n174.\n\nWith regard to the criminal proceedings in Colombia, the Tribunal held that:\n\n*The Criminal Complaint and this procedure operate in different legal spheres, are subject to diverging standards of proof, and may reach conflicting results. The fact that the Colombian criminal system has not punished (in fact, in accordance with the available record, has not even investigated) the alleged corrupt practices surrounding the Eighth Amendment, does not preclude a hypothetical finding by this Tribunal that corruption has occurred. And* vice-versa*.*272\n\n*That said, the conclusions of the justice system at the municipal level, or absence thereof, which have a much higher capacity of investigation than this Arbitral Tribunal, is one of the various elements that must be considered when evaluating the available evidence.*273\n\nAward, para. 673.\n\nAward, para. 674.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal then considered six \"*red flags*\" which Colombia suggested proved that there had been corruption.\n\n***(1) The Payment to Mr Maldonado and Mr Garc\u00eda***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal noted the size of the payment but held that the transaction had to be viewed in its proper context.274 It pointed to the fact that, although he had referred to the three- hectare contract as an example of \"*greenmail*\", the Minister of Mines had made no suggestion that Prodeco or Glencore had behaved in a corrupt fashion,275 to Prodeco's repeated complaints about the grant to Mr Maldonado and Mr Garc\u00eda and the lack of any response from the Colombian authorities.276 The Tribunal concluded that:\n\n*The Tribunal does not see any illegality or impropriety in the transaction. It is true that Prodeco yielded to greenmail - but it was a greenmail caused by Ingeominas' inappropriate registration of the 3ha contract in favour of Mr. Maldonado, and the Colombian authorities' unwillingness or inability to react, notwithstanding repeated warnings and complaints.*\n\n*Finally, the Tribunal notes that Prodeco's behaviour is exactly the opposite to that normally adopted in cases of bribery. Corruption requires secrecy. In this case, Prodeco announced* urbi et orbi *that it was being subjected to greenmail and requested assistance from the public administration. When the authorities offered no support, Prodeco informed* ex ante *not less than the* Ministro de la Presidencia *that it was being forced to buy the 3ha Contract.*277\n\nAward, paras. 678-679.\n\nAward, para. 680; see also para. 169, above.\n\nAward, paras. 681-683.\n\nAward, paras. 684-685.\n\n***(2) The fact that Mr Maldonado was a Former Employee of Minercol and Carbocol***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nColombia had argued that the fact that Mr Maldonado was a former official of the predecessors of Ingeominas showed that he was \"*closely connected*\"278 with Mr Ballesteros. However, the Tribunal found that:\n\n*Colombia has failed to marshal any evidence suggesting that there was any connection, let alone a close one, between Mr Maldonado, or his associate Mr Garc\u00eda, and Mr Ballesteros. They worked at different agencies, in different locations, with a time gap of five years.*279\n\nAward, para. 688.\n\nAward, para. 691.\n\n***(3) The Timing of the Payments***\n------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe agreement assigning the three-hectare concession was executed on 4 May 2009, the Commitment to Negotiate (see para. 49, above) was concluded between Prodeco and Ingeominas on 21 May 2009 and the Eighth Amendment was executed on 22 January 2010.280 The Tribunal did not find this timetable suspicious. On the contrary, it concluded that \"*the evidence shows that the date of the Assignment Agreement* [i.e. the contract for purchase of the three hectare concession] *was triggered by the fact that Prodeco's mining activities were fast approaching the 3ha strip. There is no evidence linking the Assignment Agreement with the Commitment to Negotiate*\".281\n\nAward, paras. 695-696.\n\nAward, para. 730; see also Award, paras. 728-729.\n\n***(4) The Alleged Concealment of the Transaction***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected Colombia's allegation that Glencore and Prodeco had attempted to conceal the transaction. It had been a lawyer acting for Mr Maldonado and Mr Garc\u00eda, not Prodeco, who had removed the price from the contract documents when sending them to Ingeominas for approval and there had been no obligation to disclose the price in the request for approval. Moreover, CDJ had been frank in its disclosure of the price it had paid, both in its dealings with Ingeominas and in its accounts, and had withheld the required amount of tax.282\n\nAward, paras. 697-700.\n\n***(5) Alleged Restriction of Knowledge of the Payment to Top Management***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nWith regard to Colombia's allegation that Prodeco's decision to confine knowledge of the purchase of the three-hectare concession to a small group of top management, the Tribunal held that this restriction had applied only during the period of contract negotiation and was standard practice. Once the agreement had been concluded, there had been no secrecy.283\n\nAward, paras. 701-703; see also Award, para. 685.\n\n***(6) Disregard of Mandatory Regulations***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nWhile primarily about the second strand in Colombia's argument (see para. 162, above), Colombia also invoked the alleged failure to follow mandatory requirements on the part of Ingeominas before approving the Eighth Amendment as evidence of corruption on the part of Glencore and Prodeco. The Tribunal concluded, however, that \"*Director Ballesteros did not disregard any mandatory regulation in the way that he handled the negotiation and approval of the Eighth Amendment*\".284 The Tribunal considered that the fact that the procedure for annulment of the Eighth Amendment (see para. 55, above) did not refer to any alleged failure to respect mandatory requirements by Ingeominas reinforced this conclusion.285\n\nAward, para. 718. The analysis which led to this conclusion is set out at paras. 704-717 of the Award.\n\nAward, para. 719.\n\n***(7) Destination of the Payments***\n-------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal also considered, as a possible additional \"*red flag*\", Colombia's suggestion that Glencore and Prodeco had failed to provide any details of the destination to which they had transferred the USD 1.75 million. The Tribunal held that Glencore and Prodeco had in fact provided evidence both of the accounts into which the money had been paid and the withholding of tax as required by Colombian law.286 The Tribunal thus concluded that, far from being a \"*red flag*\", this evidence amounted to a \"*green flag*\".287\n\nAward, paras. 720-722.\n\nAward, para. 734.\n\n183.\n\nWeighing the evidence overall, the Tribunal concluded that:\n\n*If Prodeco's intention had been to corrupt Ingeominas, it would not have filed multiple administrative appeals to prevent the grant of the 3ha contract, it would not have repeatedly complained to the highest Colombian authorities, and it would not have made the payments on-shore, subject to the mandatory tax withholding.*\n\n*The Tribunal's conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the Colombian criminal prosecutor and the Colombian criminal courts, which have a much higher capacity for investigation than this Arbitral Tribunal, have not initiated an investigation into the alleged corrupt practices surrounding the Eighth Amendment either* in tempore insuspecto *or even after the start of this arbitration.*288\n\nAward, paras. 737-738.\n\n184.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considered in detail289 the effects of Document R-100. Colombia had relied, in particular, on one part of this email chain. On 7 May 2009, Natalia Anaya (one of Prodeco's team of in-house lawyers) had emailed Gary Nagle (then CEO of Prodeco) and three other senior officials of Prodeco that \"*Marcela Estrada* [an official of Ingeominas] *confirmed today that she agreed with Ballesteros that they will accept our proposal for the trust and with that they will end the caducity process*\". The reference to \"*the trust*\" was a reference to a proposal from Prodeco that the USD 6 million which Prodeco had withheld as part of the pricing dispute (see para. 42, above) be paid into an escrow account in order to avoid caducity proceedings. Later that day, Mr Nagle replied to Ms Anaya \"[o]*f course he now supports us, we have bought the 3has*\". There followed further emails up to and including an email from Ms Anaya dated 15 May 2009 regarding meetings with Ingeominas.290\n\nAward, paras. 739-747.\n\nAward, paras. 654-657.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal quoted at some length from the testimony of Mr Nagle, who had been cross-examined about this email chain.291 The Tribunal held that Mr Nagle's explanation, in his testimony, of the words \"[o]*f course he now supports us, we have bought the 3has*\" was convincing:\n\n*Respondent construes these words to be an acknowledgement that Prodeco had bribed Mr Ballesteros through the purchase of the 3ha Contract. Mr. Nagle's construction is totally different. He explains that Prodeco had been writing to various Ministries and authorities within the Colombian public administration, complaining that Ingeominas' decision to grant the 3ha Contract to Messrs. Maldonado and Garc\u00eda was highly irregular and requesting that steps be taken to undo such decision. Eventually, Prodeco gave in, and decided to acquire the 3ha Contract. In that context, Mr. Nagle thought that Mr. Ballesteros would be relieved that Prodeco had \"solved\" the situation by yielding to the greenmail.*\n\n*The Tribunal finds Mr. Nagle's explanation of his words convincing. Such construction is also confirmed by the following messages in the R-100 email chain: Mr. Nagle's assumption that Mr. Ballesteros would be satisfied proved totally wrong. Ms. Anaya, an employee of Prodeco, held a meeting at Ingeominas a week later and was told that Mr. Ballesteros was not happy at all with the execution of the 3ha Contract, because the matter had reached President Uribe, and the President was not satisfied at all as to how the problem had been solved.*\n\n*Summing up**, Doc. R-100, and particularly Mr. Nagle's email of 7 May 2009, do not undermine the conclusion reached by the Arbitral Tribunal that Respondent has failed to marshal any evidence proving that Prodeco corrupted Ingeominas' Director Ballesteros in order to procure the Eighth Amendment.*292\n\nAward, para. 742.\n\nAward, paras. 745-747.\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal also dismissed the separate argument, forming the second strand of the Illegality Objection, that Prodeco had negotiated in bad faith with regard to the Eighth Amendment.293 After analysing at length the evidence advanced by both Parties, the Tribunal concluded that the evidence did not sustain the argument that Glencore and Prodeco had negotiated in bad faith. The Tribunal rejected the allegations that the companies had already developed plans for the expansion of production and had concealed material information from Colombia.\n\nAward, paras. 748-858.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal finished its discussion by holding that:\n\n*In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has failed to prove its accusations that Prodeco acquired the 3ha Contract as a means to bribe Mr Ballesteros into executing the Eighth Amendment or that it misrepresented the economic situation of the project and deliberately and in bad faith withheld material information from Ingeominas in order to secure the Eighth Amendment.*\n\n*Consequently, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent's Illegality Objection.*294\n\nAward, paras. 859-860.\n\n**IV. THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n---------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n*Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*(c) that there was corruption on the part of a Member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n189.\n\nColombia asserts that:\n\n*The Award contains fatal flaws that warrant its entire annulment.*\n\n*Most alarmingly, the Tribunal knowingly disregarded clear evidence of corruption and illegality orchestrated by Claimants. This is particularly surprising and disquieting in light of the prevailing consensus in the international community of the need to combat and condemn the scourge of corruption in all its forms. This Award, the likes of which have been annulled by municipal courts for lack of serious consideration of corruption allegations, cannot be allowed to stand in the ICSID system.*295\n\nApplication, paras. 2-3.\n\n190.\n\nSpecifically, Colombia maintains that the Tribunal ignored two instances of corruption and illegality on the part of Glencore and Prodeco. First, Colombia alleges that the Tribunal closed its eyes to evidence that Glencore and Prodeco (with the Prodeco Affiliates) had paid Messrs Maldonado and Garc\u00eda a grossly excessive price (USD 1.75 million) for the 3-hectare concession as an indirect bribe to Mr Ballesteros, who was then the Director of Ingeominas, in order to secure his agreement to the negotiation of the Eighth Amendment to the Mining Contract. Secondly, Colombia maintains that, quite apart from the corruption of Mr Ballesteros, Glencore and Prodeco concealed the true capacity of the Calenturitas mine and their intentions regarding output in order to obtain a system compensation for Colombia which was significantly more favourable for them and which was to the disadvantage of Colombia.\n\n191.\n\nColombia seeks annulment of the Award for manifest excess of power (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention), serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention), and failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention). These three grounds for annulment are each invoked in respect of two distinct aspects of the Tribunal's behaviour.\n\n***(1) The Documents Issue***\n-----------------------------\n\n192.\n\nFirst, Colombia maintains that the Tribunal erred in excluding from the record documents which, it maintains, would have proved that Glencore and Prodeco had corrupted Mr Ballesteros and that they had concealed and misrepresented the true position in order to obtain the agreement of Ingeominas to the Eighth Amendment. The documents in question fall into three categories.\n\n(1) the forty-one documents which had been seized by the SIC from Prodeco in 2014 (the \"**Disputed SIC Documents**\") which Colombia had sought to introduce as annexes to its Counter-Memorial but which it was barred from doing by PO2.296 Twenty-four of these documents were subsequently listed as the Annex A Documents in Colombia's letter to the Tribunal of 7 May 2018.297 It appears that at least one of the forty-one documents was disclosed voluntarily (para. 127, above) and one (which became Document R-100, see paras. 152 -158, above) was introduced into the record at the hearing;\n\n(2) the documents for which Glencore and Prodeco maintained a claim of legal privilege on the basis of communications with Prodeco's in-house legal counsel,298 in respect of which the Tribunal allowed the claim of privilege in PO4 and PO6. Some of these documents were part of the Disputed SIC Documents;\n\n(3) the FGN documents which were taken from the files of the FGN and filtered by Mr Enciso,299 which the Tribunal excluded by PO6. Some of the FGN documents were also Annex A documents.\n\nSee paras. 64 -94, above.\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above (**AAE-12**), p. 41. See paras. 124 -131, 141 -151, above.\n\nSee paras. 95 -123, above.\n\nSee paras. 132 -151, above.\n\n***(2) The Illegality Issue***\n------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nSecondly, Colombia maintains that, even if the Tribunal did not err in excluding the documents referred to above, it nevertheless manifestly exceeded its powers, committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and failed to state its reasons when it ruled against Colombia's objection that the investment was unlawful under Colombian law and thus outside the scope of the BIT.\n\n**V. THE STANDARD ON ANNULMENT**\n--------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Committee will begin by considering the standard to be applied by an *ad hoc* committee in an application for annulment. It will then (Part VI) consider the Documents Issue (see para. 192, above) before turning (Part VII) to the Illegality Issue (see para. 193, above).\n\n**A. The Positions of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Parties are in broad agreement about the principal features of the standard to be applied by an *ad hoc* committee in annulment proceedings. Thus, they agree that:\n\n(1) an award may be annulled only if one of the five conditions in Article 52 has been met;\n\n(2) an annulment proceeding is not an appeal;\n\n(3) the purpose of annulment proceedings is to protect the integrity of the arbitration, not to determine whether the tribunal was right or wrong in its findings of fact or decisions on law;\n\n(4) that for an award to be subject to annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, it is necessary to establish that the Tribunal exceeded its powers and that the excess of power was \"*manifest*\";\n\n(5) that for an award to be subject to annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal must have departed from a rule of procedure of a \"*fundamenta*l\" character and that the departure must have been serious; and\n\n(6) that Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is concerned not with whether a tribunal's reasons are convincing but whether they satisfactorily explain the decision at which the tribunal arrived and address each question put to the tribunal.\n\n196.\n\nThe Parties take very different views, however, both about the nuances of these propositions on which there is apparent agreement and about other aspects of the standard to be applied.\n\n***(1) Colombia***300\n---------------------\n\nApplication, paras. 22-37; Mem. on Ann., paras. 108-169; Reply on Ann., paras. 43-81.\n\n197.\n\nColombia maintains that Article 52 of the ICSID Convention should not be restrictively interpreted. The purpose of annulment proceedings extends beyond what is needed to protect the interests of the parties to a particular arbitration and safeguards the public interest in the integrity and quality of the arbitral process, preventing an unprecedented award from serving as a green light to further irregular awards by other tribunals.301 According to Colombia, there is no presumption of the validity of the award and no special burden or standard of proof.302\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 110; Reply on Ann., para. 47.\n\nReply on Ann., paras. 49-50.\n\n198.\n\nColombia accepts that annulment is not an appeal but maintains that it is not a superficial exercise.\n\n*Where the award reflects a complex legal and factual background, a review of that background is required. Moreover, \u2026 certain grounds for annulment necessitate a particularly searching review.*303\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 112, citing *Duke Energy International v. Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28), Decision on Annulment of 1 March 2011, para. 85 (\"*Duke*\") (**AAL-14**). See also Reply on Ann., para. 51.\n\n199.\n\nColombia rejects the assertion that procedural orders are not pertinent to annulment proceedings. It submits that annulment committees will \"*obviously*\" be required to refer directly to procedural orders in cases where these are the \"*instruments of that breach*\" alleged.304 Moreover, where the defect giving rise to grounds for annulment in a procedural order has been \"*incorporated into the award*\", the procedural order itself can rightly form the basis for the annulment of the award.305\n\nTr. p. 161:18-24 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nTr. p. 162:6-11 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n200.\n\nWith regard to Article 52(1)(b) Colombia argues that a tribunal commits an excess of power if it purports to exercise a jurisdiction which it does not have, fails to apply the applicable law, commits a fundamental error in its application of the applicable law, or makes egregious errors of fact or weighs the evidence irrationally.306 In particular, it contends that a tribunal which acts *ex aequo et bono* without the consent of the parties exceeds its powers.307 Colombia also maintains that a gross misapplication or misinterpretation of the applicable law amounts to a failure to apply the law308 and justifies annulment as a manifest excess of power:\n\n*\u2026 if a tribunal distills a hitherto unknown rule from a given legal order, it would be within the remit of an* ad hoc *committee to inquire into whether or not the tribunal is actually applying the law it claims to be applying. This is a logical imperative. Otherwise, a tribunal would be free to define, from whole cloth, putative legal principles and attribute them to whatever legal order happened to be applicable.*309\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 119; Reply on Ann., para. 72; Tr. p. 19:16-20 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 124-126.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 127-128, citing the decisions on annulment in *Hussein Nouman Soufraki v.

Indonesia,* \"*the injury is inherent in the due process violation*\".316 Colombia submits that this approach is appropriate to the ICSID annulment mechanism's object and purpose of \"*ensuring the fundamental integrity of the ICSID system*\".317 Moreover, Colombia asserts that it would be a highly speculative exercise to \"*attempt to divine the outcome*\" of a case but for a fundamental procedural breach.318\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 152.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 154-157.\n\nTr. p. 26:8-10 (Professor Silva Romero), referring to *Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v.

That chain would be broken if no reasons were provided, if the reasons were frivolous or manifestly irrelevant or if the tribunal gave incoherent or contradictory reasons.320 If a tribunal were to apply an inapplicable legal framework, for example, Colombia submits that it would have offered reasoning that was so manifestly irrelevant as to constitute a failure to state reasons.321\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 163.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 165-168.\n\nTr. p. 46:5-13 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n***(2) Glencore and Prodeco***\n------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco take as the starting point in analysing Article 52 of the ICSID Convention that annulment is an \"*extraordinary remedy*\".\n\n*Consistent with this design, annulment is reserved for \"unusual and important cases\", in which \"egregious violations of certain basic principles\" threaten the very legitimacy of the decision-making process. Any grievance falling short of this exceptionally high standard cannot be a ground for annulment.*322\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 48, citing *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka, A.S. and ISTROKAPITAL SE v.

Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28), Decision on Annulment of 30 December 2015, para. 39 (**RAL-17**).\n\n206.\n\nThey argue that Colombia's approach of a \"*searching review*\" would transform annulment into an appeal,323 and cite the *Daimler* case:\n\n*If [an ad hoc committee] were to undertake a careful and detailed analysis of the respective submissions of the parties before the Tribunal \u2026 and annul the award on the ground that its understanding of facts or interpretation of law or appreciation of evidence is different from that of the tribunal, it will cross the line that separates annulment from appeal.*324\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 50.\n\n*Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Republic of Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1) Decision on Annulment of 7 January 2015, para. 186 (\"*Daimler*\") (**RAL-16**).\n\n207.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco maintain that Article 52 of the ICSID Convention should be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively but in line with the object and purpose and the text of the provision.325 They contend that an applicant for annulment bears a heavy burden but deny that this has anything to do with a burden of proof.326\n\nRej. on Ann., para. 15.\n\nRej. on Ann., para. 16.\n\n208.\n\nThey argue that:\n\n*\u2026 in determining whether a tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers: (i) an* ad hoc *committee cannot second-guess a tribunal's assessment of the evidence; (ii) an award cannot be annulled on the ground that a tribunal made a mistake of fact, regardless of how serious that error is alleged to be; and (iii) an error of law is not an excess of powers.*327\n\nRej. on Ann., para. 60; C-Mem. on Ann., Section V.A.\n\n209.\n\nAccordingly, Glencore and Prodeco submit that annulment proceedings cannot lawfully revisit a tribunal's rulings on the admissibility or probative value of evidence, as Colombia's Application urges the Committee to do.328 An annulment of an Award for procedural orders on evidentiary issues, as such, \"*would be unheard of*\".329 Indeed, Glencore and Prodeco assert that, having \"*searched the decided cases*\", they were unable to find a single instance of an award being annulled for a decision in a procedural order.330\n\nTr. p. 78:16-21 (Mr Blackaby), p. 117:20-23 (Mr Friedman).\n\nTr. p. 117:23-24 (Mr Friedman).\n\nTr. p. 117:24-118:1 (Mr Friedman).\n\n210.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco maintain that the number of rules of procedure which have the fundamental character required by Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention is limited, that it does not include the rules on burden of proof,331 or the rule of \"*liberal admissibility of evidence*\" advanced by Colombia.332 They also contend that even a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure warrants annulment only if it would have determined the outcome of the case.333\n\nRej. on Ann., para. 23.\n\nRej.

T****he** **A****nalysis of the** **C****ommittee**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) The Nature of Annulment and the Powers of an Ad Hoc Committee***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe text of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention and the decisions of past *ad hoc* committees establish that there are four general principles regarding the nature of annulment proceedings and the power of an *ad hoc* committee which are pertinent to the present case.\n\n213.\n\nFirst, as the *ad hoc* Committee in MTD Equity and MTD Chile v. Republic of Chile put it:\n\n*Under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, an annulment proceeding is not an appeal, still less a retrial; it is a form of review on specified and limited grounds which take as their premise the record before the Tribunal.*337\n\n*MTD*, note 308, above, at para. 31 (**AAL-28**). See also *Soufraki*, note 308, above, at para. 20 (**AAL-2**).\n\n214.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Soufraki* went on to analyse this role of an *ad hoc* committee as the safeguard of the integrity of the proceedings in greater detail.\n\n*In the view of the ad hoc Committee, the object and purpose of an ICSID annulment proceeding may be described as the control of the fundamental integrity of the ICSID arbitral process in all its facets. An ad hoc committee is empowered to verify (i)* the integrity of the tribunal *\u2013 its proper constitution (Article 52(1)(a)) and the absence of corruption on the part of any member thereof (Article 52(1)(c)); (ii)* the integrity of the procedure *\u2013 which means firstly that the tribunal must respect the boundaries fixed by the ICSID Convention and the Parties' consent, and not manifestly exceed the powers granted to it as far as its jurisdiction, the applicable law and the questions raised are concerned (Article 52(1)(b)), and secondly, that it should not commit a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (iii)* the integrity of the award *\u2013 meaning that the reasoning presented in the award should be coherent and not contradictory, so as to be understandable by the Parties and must reasonably support the solution adopted by the tribunal (Article 52(1)(e)). Integrity of the dispute settlement mechanism, integrity of the process of dispute settlement and integrity of solution of the dispute are the basic interrelated goals projected in the ICSID annulment mechanism.*338\n\n*Soufraki,* note 308, above, at para. 23 (**AAL-2**) (emphasis in original).\n\n215.\n\nSecondly, as the *Soufraki* Committee also explained \u2013\n\n*Article 52 of the ICSID Convention must be read in accordance with the principles of treaty interpretation forming part of general international law, which principles insist on neither restrictive nor extensive interpretation, but rather on interpretation in accordance with the object and purpose of the treaty.*339\n\nThe reference to principles of treaty interpretation is to the principles laid down in Articles 31 to 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969. The Vienna Convention is not, as such, applicable to the ICSID Convention, which predates it. Nevertheless, the provisions of the Vienna Convention on treaty interpretation are generally regarded as declaratory of customary international law and thus applicable to the interpretation of any treaty.\n\n*Soufraki*, note 308, above, at para. 21 (**AAL-2**).\n\n216.\n\nThirdly, it is clear from the text of Article 52 that an award may be annulled only on one or more of the five grounds set out in Article 52. An *ad hoc* committee is not entitled to range beyond those five grounds. Its function is not to consider whether or not it agrees with the reasoning or the conclusions of the tribunal but only to determine whether or not one or more of the five grounds has been made out.\n\n217.\n\nLastly, it is important to bear in mind that Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention states that an *ad hoc* committee \"*shall have the authority to annul the award or any part thereof on any of the grounds set forth in paragraph (1)*\". The fact that the Convention speaks of a committee having the *authority* to annul indicates that, even where an *ad hoc* committee determines that one of the grounds for annulment is made out, the Committee has a discretion whether or not to annul the award.340 That discretion is by no means unlimited and must take account of all relevant circumstances, including the gravity of the circumstances which constitute the ground for annulment and whether or not they had \u2013 or could have had \u2013 a material effect upon the outcome of the case,341 as well as the importance of the finality of the award and the overall question of fairness to both Parties.\n\nSee *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on Annulment of 3 December 1992, para. 1.20 (**AAL-35**); *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v.

They are not in issue between the Parties in the present proceedings.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *EDF International S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23), Decision on Annulment of 5 February 2016, paras. 61-73 (\"*EDF*\") (**AAL-4)**; *TECO*, note 318, above, at para. 73 (**AAL-47**); *CEAC Holdings Ltd. v. Montenegro* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/08), Decision on Annulment of 1 May 2018, para. 84 (\"*CEAC*\") (**AAL-3**).\n\n219.\n\nAn application under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention can be brought only with regard to an award, not a prior decision or procedural order of a tribunal.343 Nevertheless, it is open to an applicant on annulment to contend that the award is tainted by a prior procedural decision or procedural order which entails a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure or a manifest excess of power, or that there has been a failure to state reasons for a ruling. Moreover, in the present case, the decisions taken by the Tribunal in the three Procedural Orders which are at the heart of Colombia's Application are carefully recorded in the text of the Award itself.344 The Committee therefore concludes that the Application is a perfectly proper application to annul the Award, although Colombia \u2013 as it is entitled to do \u2013 refers at length to the three Procedural Orders in its attempt to show that the Award is tainted by annullable error and the Committee will follow the same course in examining whether the Tribunal committed an annullable error.\n\nSchreuer, note 340, above, at Article 52, para. 61 (**AAL-1**).\n\nAward, paras. 68-134.\n\n***(2) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nArticle 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention provides that an *ad hoc* committee may annul an award on the ground that \"*there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure*\". It is clear from this language that not every procedural default can provide grounds for annulment. For an *ad hoc* committee to annul an award under this provision, it must identify the rule of procedure from which the Tribunal allegedly departed and be satisfied (a) that this rule was of fundamental importance;345 and (b) that the departure was serious.\n\n*EDF*, note 342, above, at para. 199 (**AAL-4)**, discussing, *inter alia*, a difference between the Spanish text of the Convention and the English and French texts and concluding that, in accordance with the principle stated in Article 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969, the meaning which best reconciles the three authentic texts of the ICSID Convention is that only a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure affords grounds for annulment. See also *MINE*, note 340, above, at paras. 5.05 to 5.06 (**AAL-7**).\n\n221.\n\nWith regard to the first requirement, the Committee does not consider it necessary or appropriate to set out a list of those procedural rules which fall into the category of \"*fundamental*\" rules of procedure, but it has no doubt that the rules of natural justice, including the right of a party to present its case, the right of a party to be heard and the right to equal treatment, fall into that category.\n\n222.\n\nOn the second requirement, the Committee agrees with the observation of the *MINE* Committee that:\n\n*In order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \"fundamental rule of procedure\" must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.*346\n\n*MINE*, note 340, above, at para. 5.05 (**AAL-7**).\n\n223.\n\nIt also shares the view of the Committee in *Pey Casado* that:\n\n*The applicant is not required to show that the result would have been different, that it would have won the case, if the rule had been respected. The Committee notes in fact that in Wena, the committee stated that the applicant must demonstrate 'the impact that the issue may have had on the award'. The Committee agrees that this is precisely how the seriousness of the departure must be analyzed.*347\n\nThe Committee is, therefore, not persuaded by the suggestion, in Wena that \"*the violation \u2026 must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had* [the relevant procedural] *rule been observed*\".348 It shares the view of the TECO Committee that:\n\n*Requiring an applicant to show that it would have won the case or that the result of the case would have been different if the rule of procedure had been respected is a highly speculative exercise. An annulment committee cannot determine with any degree of certainty whether any of these results would have occurred without placing itself in the shoes of a tribunal, something which is not within its powers to do. What a committee can determine however is whether the tribunal's compliance with a rule of procedure could potentially have affected the award.*349\n\n*Pey Casado*, note 308, above, at para. 78 (**AAL-34**), citing *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Annulment of 5 February 2002, at para. 61 (\"*Wena*\") (**AAL-41**). See also *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0.r.l. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35), Decision on Annulment of 17 September 2020, paras. 142-143 (\"*Orascom*\") (**AAL-134**).\n\n*Wena,* note 347, above, at para. 58 (**AAL-41**). See also *OI European Group,* note 333, above, para. 248 (**RAL-21**).\n\n*TECO,* note 318, above, at para. 85 (**AAL-47**).\n\n224.\n\nThe Committee is therefore unable to accept the suggestion, advanced by Glencore and Prodeco, that Colombia must show that the eventual outcome of the case *would* have been different had it not been for the alleged departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.350 It is sufficient for Colombia to establish that it *could* have been different.351\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., paras. 53, 55.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *CEAC*, note 342, above, at para. 93 (**AAL-3**).\n\n225.\n\nNor, however, can the Committee accept Colombia's argument that \"*the injury is inherent in the due process violation*\".352 That argument is based upon the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Churchill Mining v. Indonesia*.353 It is, however, important to see the statements of the *Churchill* committee in their context. The committee in that case stated, in the passage relied on by Colombia, that:\n\n*\u2026 where there has been a grave violation of a fundamental rule of procedure, including denial of a reasonably full opportunity to be heard, the injury is inherent in the due process violation without the need to demonstrate that the outcome of the case would have been different otherwise.*354\n\nBut in an earlier passage, the *Churchill* committee had said:\n\n*The test turns on the fundamental nature of the rule of procedure and the seriousness of its violation. A grave violation of a fundamental rule is likely to more or less automatically result in an injury inasmuch as such party is deprived of the due process protections which the rule is intended to provide.*355\n\nTr. p. 26:9-10 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n*Churchill*, note 316, above, at para. 204 (**AAL-48**).\n\n*Churchill*, note 316, above, at para. 204 (**AAL-48**).\n\n*Churchill*, note 316, above, at para. 180 (**AAL-48**).\n\n226.\n\nIf a tribunal heard argument and evidence from only one party before giving its decision, it would be no answer to say that this violation of the rule of equality of arms could have made no difference to the outcome on the ground that the other party's case was wholly lacking in merit. If, however, a party has been heard but particular items of evidence have been excluded, the possible effects of the exclusion are relevant both to whether there has been a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and, if so, whether that departure is to be regarded as serious.\n\n227.\n\nColombia has also argued that the Committee \"*must take as a given*\" that the exclusion of the illegality documents affected the outcome of the proceedings,356 since the Committee has not seen the documents which were excluded by the Tribunal. The Tribunal will return to this matter later (see paras. 364 -370, below), when it examines the application of Article 52(1)(d) to the facts of the present case.\n\nTr. p. 26:21-22 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n***(3) Manifest Excess of Power***\n----------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nArticle 52(1)(b) provides that an *ad hoc* committee may annul an award on the ground that \"*the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers*\". The paragraph lays down two requirements, both of which must be met if an Award is to be annulled on this ground. First, the tribunal must have exceeded its powers and, secondly, that excess of power must be \"*manifest*\". The most obvious instance of an excess of power by a tribunal is the decision of an issue which falls outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal under the ICSID Convention or the relevant BIT (or other instrument conferring jurisdiction) but the term has also been held to include the failure by a tribunal to exercise a jurisdiction which it possesses.357\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Vivendi I*, note 340, above, at para. 86 (**CL-99**).\n\n229.\n\nThe requirement that the excess of powers be \"*manifest*\" refers to how readily apparent the excess is, rather than to its gravity. In the words of one leading commentary on the ICSID Convention:\n\n*In accordance with its dictionary meaning, \"manifest\" may mean \"plain\", \"clear\", \"obvious\", \"evident\" and easily understood or recognized by the mind. Therefore, the manifest nature of an excess of powers is not necessarily an indication of its gravity. Rather, it relates to the ease with which it is perceived. \u2026 An excess of powers is manifest if it can be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis.*358\n\nThis view has been endorsed in several decisions of *ad hoc* committees. Thus, in *Wena Hotels Ltd*. v. *Egypt*, the committee stated that:\n\n*The excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest*.359\n\nSimilarly, the committee in *CDC Group v. Seychelles* stated:\n\n*As interpreted by various ad hoc committees, the term \"manifest\" means clear or \"self-evident\". Thus, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal's conduct, if susceptible of argument \"one way or the other\" is not manifest. As one commentator has put it, \"If the issue is debatable or requires examination of the materials on which the tribunal's decision is based, the tribunal's determination is conclusive\".*360\n\nSchreuer, note 340, above, at Article 52, para. 135 (**AAL-1**).\n\n*Wena*, note 347, above, at para. 25 (**AAL-41**).\n\n*CDC*, note 322, above, at para. 41 (**RAL-7**).\n\n230.\n\nNevertheless, the Committee agrees with the observation of the committee in *EDF v. Argentina* that:\n\n*While the Committee agrees that an excess of powers will be manifest only if it can readily be discerned, it considers that this does not mean that the excess must, as it were, leap out of the page on a first reading of the Award. The reasoning in a case may be so complex that a degree of inquiry and analysis is required before it is clear precisely what the tribunal has decided. In such a case, the need for such inquiry and analysis will not prevent an excess of powers from being \"manifest\".*361\n\n*EDF*, note 342, above, at para. 193 (**AAL-4)**.\n\n231.\n\nDecisions of *ad hoc* committees in other cases have made clear that it is also an excess of power for a tribunal to fail to apply the law applicable to the case or to the particular issue in the case.362 That situation must, however, be distinguished from the case where a tribunal has misapplied the applicable law, since annulment proceedings are not an appeal.\n\n*Soufraki*, note 308, above, at para. 45 (**AAL-2**); *EDF*, note 342, above, at para. 191 (**AAL-4)**.\n\n232.\n\nColombia suggests that there are cases in which the misapplication of the law is such that it must be treated as a failure to apply the law.363 Glencore and Prodeco disagree.364 The Committee considers that there are circumstances in which misinterpretation or misapplication of the law can be so gross that it amounts to a failure to apply that law. That must, however, be clearly distinguished from cases of ordinary error and must amount, in the words of the *AES* committee, to \"*a failure to apply the proper law* in toto\".365 The Committee considers that the standard is, therefore, a very high one in the sense that only the most serious cases of misinterpretation or misapplication will fall within the concept of a manifest excess of powers.366 It is certainly not enough that the committee considers that the interpretation or application of the law was wrong.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 123.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 83.\n\n*AES Summit Generation Ltd. v. Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22), Decision on Annulment of 29 June 2012, paras. 33-35 (**AAL-23**).\n\nSee *Caratube*, note 308, above at para. 81 (**RL-184**); and *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20), Decision on Annulment of 26 February 2016, para. 130 (**AAL-19**), both of which refer to a \"*high*\" standard.\n\n233.\n\nThe Parties also differ over whether what Colombia describes as \"*egregious errors of fact or \u2026 an irrational assessment of the evidence*\" on the part of the tribunal can amount to a manifest excess of power.367 The Committee considers that the assessment of the evidence is a matter for the tribunal and not one which can normally be revisited by an *ad hoc* committee. While an *ad hoc* committee is not entirely excluded from any role in reviewing a tribunal's assessment of the evidence and the findings which it bases upon that assessment (see paras. 406 -408, below), its role is a very limited one.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 131-132; compare C-Mem. on Ann., paras. 80-81.\n\n***(4) Failure to State Reasons***\n----------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe provision of Article 52(1)(e) that an award may be annulled if it \"*fails to state the reasons on which it is based*\" is closely tied to the provision of Article 48(3), which requires that \"*the award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based*\".\n\n235.\n\nThe requirement to state reasons is an important one but it is equally important that an *ad hoc* committee is not drawn into using Article 52(1)(e) as a means for conducting an appeal. The point was very clearly made by the *Vivendi I* Committee in the following passage:\n\n*A greater source of concern is perhaps the ground of \"failure to state reasons,\" which is not qualified by any such phrase as \"manifestly\" or \"serious.\" However, it is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. It bears reiterating that an* ad hoc *committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.*\n\n*In the Committee's view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an* ad hoc *committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal's reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.*368\n\n*Vivendi I*, note 340, above, at paras. 64-65 (**CL-99**).\n\n236.\n\nThe Committee therefore agrees with the observation of the EDF committee that \"*Article 52(1)(e) empowers a Committee to annul an award if there has been a* failure *to state the reasons on which the award is based; it does not entitle a Committee to annul an award because it finds the reasoning unconvincing*\".369\n\n*EDF*, note 342, above, at para. 195 (**AAL-4**) (emphasis in original); see also *TECO*, note 318, above, at para. 87 (**AAL-47**). See also *Orascom*, note 347, above, at paras. 164-165, 170 (**AAL-134**).\n\n237.\n\nTwo further observations regarding Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention are appropriate. First, a tribunal is required to answer each \"*question*\" put to it and to give reasons which enable a reader to discern how it reached that answer. It is not, however, required to respond to every aspect of each argument advanced by a party with regard to a particular question. As the *Enron* committee put it:\n\n*This requires the tribunal to state its pertinent findings of fact, its pertinent findings as to the applicable legal principles, and its conclusions in respect of the application of the law to the facts. If the tribunal has done this, the award will not be annulled on the basis that the tribunal could have given more detailed reasons and analysis for its findings of fact or law, or that the tribunal did not expressly state its evaluation in respect to each individual item of evidence or each individual legal authority or legal provision relied upon by the parties, or did not expressly state a view on every single legal and factual issue raised by the parties in the course of the proceedings. The tribunal is required to state reasons for its decision, but not necessarily reasons for its reasons.*370\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. and Ponderosa Assets, LP v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Annulment of 30 July 2010, para. 222 (**AAL-26**).\n\n238.\n\nSecondly, the Committee notes Colombia's argument that an award may be annulled if the reasons given are \"*frivolous*\" or \"*manifestly irrelevant*\".371 The Committee accepts that if the reasons are manifestly irrelevant to the issue to be decided, then they will not be reasons for the decision. It considers, however, that an *ad hoc* committee must proceed with very great caution in this regard since allegations that reasons are irrelevant, and even more that they are \"*frivolous*\" can easily become an invitation to annul an award on the basis that the committee disagrees with the reasons given. To accept that invitation would be to convert annulment proceedings into an appeal.372 While the Committee accepts that there might be a case in which an award could be annulled because the reasons given were frivolous or manifestly irrelevant, the threshold is a very high one indeed. In particular, a reason is not \"*frivolous*\" because many \u2013 including an *ad hoc* committee \u2013 consider it wrong; to justify annulment, it must be such that no reasonable tribunal could possibly take it seriously. Moreover, an award cannot be annulled because one of the reasons given is frivolous or manifestly irrelevant, so long as the remaining reasons are a coherent explanation of the decision reached.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 166.\n\n*Orascom*, note 347, above, at para. 165 (**AAL-134**).\n\n**VI. THE DOCUMENTS ISSUE**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **P****ositions of the** **P****arties**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) Colombia***\n------------------\n\n239.\n\nColombia first challenges the Tribunal's decision in PO2 not to admit into the record the Disputed SIC Documents and its subsequent decisions regarding Glencore and Prodeco's assertion of privilege (PO4 and PO6) and the FGN documents (PO6).\n\n240.\n\nColombia maintains that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers through a failure to apply the law; that it seriously infringed Colombia's fundamental procedural right to be heard, on all of its evidence; and that it failed to provide coherent or logical reasoning to justify its decision.373 Colombia argues that these errors were committed in the procedural decisions which the Tribunal took in the relevant procedural orders and that they were incorporated into, and have \"*tainted*\" the Award, which should therefore be annulled in its374 entirety.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 207.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 208.\n\n241.\n\nFor Colombia, these failings are rendered the more serious because the evidence which the Tribunal excluded was, in Colombia's view, relevant to allegations of corruption which a tribunal has a duty to investigate with particular rigour.\n\n*(a) Procedural Order No. 2*\n----------------------------\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Power*\n------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nColombia asserts that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by disregarding the proper legal framework for assessing the admissibility of evidence, and, in the alternative, that it committed such gross and egregious misapplications of the law as to amount to a failure to apply the applicable law.375 More specifically, Colombia argues that the Tribunal erred: (i) in its choice of law to govern the Parties' dispute over the admissibility of the Disputed SIC Documents; (ii) in its misapplication of Colombian law; and (iii) in its failure to apply, or egregious misapplication of international law.376\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 217.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 218.\n\n243.\n\nAccording to Colombia, the ICSID Convention and Rules establish that procedural issues \u2013 such as the admissibility of evidence \u2013 are to be governed by international law in the absence of an express *renvoi* to municipal law agreed upon by the parties or mandated by the rules of international law.377 As such, Colombia argues, the Tribunal's reference to Colombian municipal law in PO2 was highly irregular. In addition, the Tribunal's reasoning, in purported justification of its reference to municipal law, constituted an \"*obvious misapplication*\" of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which, according to Colombia, has \"*nothing to do with*\" the law applicable to procedural issues.378 To add to this, Colombia argues that in its misguided application of Colombian law, the Tribunal grossly misinterpreted the notion of \"*desviaci\u00f3n de poder*\", which had been briefed by neither Party.379 Had the Tribunal conducted a \"*proper analysis*\", Colombia submits, it would have concluded that the ANDJE was authorised to request the Disputed Documents from the SIC, and that the SIC was legally required to turn these over to the ANDJE upon the latter's request.380\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 223.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 220-226, 285.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 252.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 255.\n\n244.\n\nColombia acknowledges that the Tribunal did at least profess to apply international law, and that it made reference to certain international law concepts such as \"*equality of arms*\" and \"*good faith*\"381 but maintains that this was mere window-dressing.382 Colombia argues that an analysis of PO2 in fact reveals a complete failure to apply \"*anything resembling international law*\".383 According to Colombia, the Tribunal's reasoning was both circular and lacking in the methodological imperatives of an application of international law.384 Instead of engaging with the legal norms which traditionally govern admissibility under international law, the Tribunal made the \"*unprecedented*\" decision to apply its own subjective notion of \"*fairness*\".385 As such, Colombia considers that PO2 constitutes an *ex aequo et bono* ruling which the Tribunal was not empowered to make.386 Even if the decision to apply the standard of \"*fairness*\" is not considered a failure to apply international law, Colombia maintains, the Tribunal's departure from the accepted tenets of international law was so egregious as to \"*constitute, in practice, the non-application of the proper law*\".387\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 235-237.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 235-237.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 231.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 235-237.\n\nApplication, para. 46; Mem. on Ann., para. 232; Tr. pp. 17:3-5 and 16: 20-22 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nApplication, para. 52; Mem. on Ann., para. 235; Tr. p. 17:3-5 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 239.\n\n*(ii) Serious Departure from Fundamental Rules of Procedure*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nColombia submits that the Tribunal's decision in PO2 constituted a serious departure from Colombia's fundamental procedural rights to be heard and to adduce lawfully obtained evidence in its defence. Whereas Colombia accepts that Rule 34(1) of the ICSID Rules gives tribunals the discretion to exclude evidence, it submits that the exercise of that discretion must nevertheless be \"*informed somehow*\".388 In this respect the Applicant cites the principle that \"*no evidence should be excluded* a limine\".389 As a consequence of this rule, Colombia argues that, except in a very narrow set of exceptional circumstances (evidence obtained illegally or which is subject to legal privilege), any evidence produced by the parties should \"*automatically*\" be admitted.390\n\nTr. p. 165:22-24 (Mr Farhadi).\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 174-175, citing from H.

Had they been admitted, Colombia asserts, the Tribunal would \"*have had no other choice*\" but to find that Glencore and Prodeco's investment was unlawful and thus outside the protection of the BIT.396 Colombia maintains that the emails \"*uncontrovertibly demonstrate* [Glencore and Prodeco's] *corrupting of Mr Ballesteros*\" and, further, provided proof of their \"*calculated efforts to misrepresent the economic and technical rationale for a further amendment to the Mining Contract*\" so as to \"*wrongly induce*\" Ingeominas to accept the Eighth Amendment.397 As such, Colombia argues, it cannot be denied that the Tribunal's departures from fundamental rules of procedure were \"*serious*\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.398 In any event, Colombia adds, the Committee is not required to determine that the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure would have been outcome determinative in order for it to be \"*serious*\", given that the injury is inherent in the due process violation.399 Moreover, as a practical matter, Colombia argues that \"*it is entirely unclear*\" how it \"*could even go about establishing*\" that the Disputed SIC Documents would have been outcome-determinative, given their exclusion.400\n\nApplication, para. 40.\n\nApplication., para. 40.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 276-280.\n\nColombia's Opening Statement before the Committee, not e 391, above, slide 21 (**AAE-38**), referring to *Churchill,* note 316, above, at para. 204 (**AAL-48**).\n\nReply on Ann., para. 57.\n\n*(iii) Failure to State Reasons*\n--------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nFinally, Colombia asserts that the Tribunal failed to state reasons to justify its decision in PO2.401 According to the Applicant, the Tribunal's scant reasoning was \"*not only frivolous and contradictory, but also incoherent*\". By way of example, the reference to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention in the Tribunal's analysis of applicable law is said to be frivolous in that it is \"*manifestly irrelevant*\" and \"*cannot logically explain the decision*\" of the Tribunal.402 Moreover, as above, Colombia argues that the Tribunal failed to \"*even acknowledge*\" Colombia's invocation of the rule of liberal admissibility of evidence and ignored the legal authorities cited by Colombia in support of its application. As such, according to Colombia, its decision to exclude the Disputed Documents is \"*insufficient from a logical point of view to justify the tribunal's conclusion*\".403 In support of this assertion, Colombia recalls the finding in *CEAC* that \"*in order to give a fully reasoned award, a tribunal is required to answer every 'question' put to it*\", and not just provide reasoning for the final outcome.404\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 238.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 285.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 287.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 287.\n\n*(b) Procedural Order No. 4*\n----------------------------\n\n250.\n\nColombia accepts that in PO2 the Tribunal left open two ways in which the Disputed SIC Documents might nevertheless become part of the record in the case: first, through the normal document production process and, secondly, if they came to form part of the record in criminal proceedings in the Colombian courts and were not legally privileged. Colombia asserts, however, that having seemed to leave the door ajar in this way, the Tribunal slammed it shut with its decisions in PO4 and PO6.405\n\nTr. pp. 23:21-25:9 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n251.\n\nColombia claims that the Tribunal's decision in PO2 to give each Party the opportunity to file new document production requests gave it \"*some hope*\" that the Tribunal would cure the effect of its decision to exclude the Disputed SIC Documents in PO2.406 According to Colombia, it was for this reason that it duly complied with the procedure established by PO2 for a new phase of document production requests,407 so as to obtain from Glencore and Prodeco the Disputed SIC Documents \"*already in Colombia's possession*\".408\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 293.\n\nTr. p. 24:5-7 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nTr. p. 24:7-9 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n252.\n\nIn response to Colombia's document production requests, Colombia claims that Glencore and Prodeco put up a further \"*roadblock*\" to the discovery of the Disputed SIC Documents by asserting privilege over documents which \"*manifestly did not enjoy any such privilege*\", including all correspondence involving in-house counsel.409 According to Colombia, legal privilege does not apply to communications with in-house counsel and, even if it did, \"*it did not apply to the documents over which* [Glencore and Prodeco] *had asserted it*\".410\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 295-296; Tr. p. 24:9-14 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nTr. p. 62:18-19 (Professor Silva Romero); Mem. on Ann., para. 298.\n\n253.\n\nNevertheless, Colombia claims that it \"*continued to navigate the Tribunal's procedural labyrinth*\" by bringing these issues to the Tribunal for their resolution in PO4.411 Colombia asserts further that, in its appeals to the Tribunal, it \"*expressly*\" requested to have the privileged nature of Disputed Disclosure Documents ruled on by the Tribunal itself, or by a conflict counsel (privilege inspector), on a document-by-document basis.412\n\nTr. p. 24:15-16 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nTr. pp. 24:16-19, 67:24-68:2 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n254.\n\nColombia asserts, however, that having seemed to leave the door open to the admission of the Disputed SIC Documents through the \"*proper procedure*\", the Tribunal slammed this door shut with its decision in PO4 (and, later, PO6).413 Not only did the Tribunal rule against Colombia on the issue of the applicable law, Colombia submits that it went on to add \"*insult to injury*\" by refusing its request for an independent assessment of the privileged nature of the Privilege Log Documents.414 Its decision in this regard, in Colombia's view, was flawed by a manifest excess of power, serious departures from a fundamental rule of procedure and a failure to give reasons.\n\nTr. p. 24:22-23 (Professor Silva Romero); Mem. on Ann., para. 323.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 300.\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Power*\n------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nAccording to Colombia, the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law to the question of whether or not in-house legal communications were subject to legal privilege.415\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 303-314; Reply on Ann., para. 229; Tr. pp. 20:24-21:8 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n256.\n\nColombia asserts that Colombian law ought to have governed the Tribunal's decision. According to Colombia, the existence of privilege requires, \"*at a minimum, ascertaining the expectations of the parties to the communication at the time it was made*\".416 In the circumstances of the present case, Colombia submits, the expectations of Prodeco's executives' in-house communications in Colombia would have been set by Colombian law.417 On this basis, international law, which according to Colombia is the law applicable to questions of procedure, mandates a *renvoi* to the municipal law of the State in which the relevant legal advice was given. Despite this, Colombia asserts that the Tribunal made its assessment based on its assessment of international law, making reference to Colombian law only as an afterthought.418\n\nReply on Ann., para. 233.\n\nReply on Ann., para. 233.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 312; Reply on Ann., para. 233.\n\n257.\n\nSecondly, Colombia definitively asserts that Colombian law does *not* extend privilege to communication with in-house counsel.419 As such, according to the Applicant, the Tribunal's analysis of Colombia's domestic law shows that it \"*manifestly and egregiously misunderstood the basic authorities*\" cited by Colombia.420 Moreover, the Tribunal failed to refer to a single source that explicitly supported its contention that Colombian law recognizes as legally privileged communications with in-house lawyers.421\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 312-313; Reply on Ann., para. 233; Tr. pp. 20:24-21:3 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 314; Reply on Ann., para. 233.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 312.\n\n258.\n\nThirdly, even in its \"*purported application*\" of international law Colombia asserts that the Tribunal egregiously misapplied the law.422 Colombia considers that the Tribunal seriously erred in its determination that in-house counsel privilege is protected by \"*a general principle of law within the meaning of Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice*\".423\n\nReply on Ann., para. 234; Tr. p. 21:8-10.\n\nReply on Ann., para. 234, referring to PO4, note 72, above, at para. 38 (**AAE-9**).\n\n259.\n\nColombia argues that the Tribunal did not actually engage in an analysis of the existence of a relevant general principle of law.424 Had it done so, Colombia submits, it would have determined that the practice of States in their treatment of in-house counsel communications varies widely, making it impossible to discern a principle of general application.425 Rather, the Tribunal simply applied the *Vito Gallo* criteria.426 Colombia claims on this basis that the Tribunal essentially \"*found no other legal justification than to quote themselves*\" given that the Tribunal members in the present case overlapped by two-thirds with that in *Vito Gallo,* \"*including the same president*\"*.*427 Colombia concludes as such that the Tribunal not only chose the wrong law to govern the question before it, but that it did not even apply the law it had wrongly identified as applicable.428 The \"*hallmarks of an analysis of international law*\" being so absent from the Tribunal's decision, Colombia submits, \"*that it cannot be said that the Tribunal objectively applied international law in the circumstances*\".429\n\nTr. pp. 64:15-24, 65:17-25-66:1 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 310; Reply on Ann., para. 234; Tr. p. 66:1-10 (Professor Silva Romero), referring to *Akzo Nobel Chemicals Ltd and Akcros Chemicals Ltd v.

It maintains that the Tribunal misunderstood the plain meaning of the authority on Colombian law to which it referred.437 Additionally, Colombia asserts, as an instance of \"*frivolous*\" reasoning, that \"*the Tribunal effectively cited a lack of judicial and administrative precedent as an affirmative indication of the existence of a rule of law*\".438\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 320; Reply on Ann., para. 252.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 320.\n\n264.\n\nColombia submits that the Tribunal did not explain its reasoning as to why it refused to examine the privilege issue on a document-by-document basis.439 Colombia refutes the suggestion that PO4 was a mere routine procedural decision on document production which, in the result, did not require detailed reasoning.440 According to Colombia, in the unusual circumstance where both Parties had access to the documents at issue, it was an abdication of the Tribunal's duty to answer all questions posed to it when it delegated the task of the document-by-document assessment of privilege to one of the Parties to the dispute.441 By deferring to Glencore and Prodeco's assessment on privilege, therefore, Colombia claims that the Tribunal \"*essentially ignored 159 questions posed to it, namely, whether or not each of the documents in question was subject to privilege*\".442\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 321.\n\nReply on Ann., para. 253.\n\nReply on Ann., para. 254.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 321; Reply on Ann., para. 256.\n\n265.\n\nFinally, Colombia argues that the Tribunal's reasoning in PO4 was \"*contradictory*\" to its decision in PO2.443 Whereas in PO2 the Tribunal excluded the Disputed SIC Documents on the premise that it would \"*establish the 'proper procedure' for allowing a fair chance for them to be admitted onto the record*\", it failed to establish any such objective and proper procedure in PO4.444\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 322.\n\nReply on Ann., para. 257.\n\n*(c) Procedural Order No. 6*\n----------------------------\n\n266.\n\nColombia argues that, in its PO2 the Tribunal promised that Colombia could marshal into the record evidence gathered by law enforcement authorities in the context of criminal proceedings, but that it \"*broke that promise*\" in PO6.445 Colombia submits that, in that decision, \"*the Tribunal, once more, issued a contradictory ruling by inventing new legal rules*\" to exclude the Disputed Documents.446\n\nApplication, para. 70.\n\nApplication, para. 46.\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Power*\n------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nColombia asserts that the Tribunal did not apply \"any *law at all*\" in Procedural Order No. 6.447 Colombia maintains that the Tribunal did not even \"*attempt to explain what law (if any) it was applying*\" to reach its decision.448 In the place of the \"*habitual*\" section on applicable law, Colombia asserts that the Tribunal instead included a section entitled \"*Applicable Provisions*\" wherein it simply cited the relevant paragraphs of PO2.449 According to Colombia, the Tribunal then went on to interpret its own *obiter dictum* in order to attempt to \"*distil a legal* '*standard' from the penumbrae of the word 'gathered*'\".450 In so doing, Colombia asserts that the Tribunal failed \"*even to consider, let alone apply*\" the law.451\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 342.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 342.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 342.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 342.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 342.\n\n*(ii) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nColombia asserts that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in PO6 by excluding the FGN Documents and the Annex A Documents, these being \"*relevant, non-privileged, and lawfully obtained*\".452 It submits that the Tribunal's decision in this regard denied Colombia its fundamental right to be heard and its concomitant right to produce evidence in its defence.453\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 343 (emphasis added).\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 343.\n\n269.\n\nColombia asserts that the Tribunal's decision on the criteria for admissibility in PO6 differed from the criteria it had itself set out in PO2. Colombia complains that the Tribunal's decision to exclude the FGN Documents on the grounds that these were \"*not part of a formal acusaci\u00f3n in a Colombian criminal court proceeding*\" imported a requirement that had never been stipulated by the Tribunal.454 Colombia characterises that requirement as \"*simply another invention designed to exclude the* [Disputed] *Documents*\".455 According to Colombia, no rule exists under either international law or Colombian law \"*which would support such test to exclude evidence and, tellingly, the Tribunal simply provided no reasons or support for its conclusion*\".456\n\nApplication, para. 73.\n\nApplication, para. 73.\n\nApplication, para. 73.\n\n270.\n\nAs to the Annex A documents \"*allegedly subject to privilege*\", Colombia repeats the complaints it had made about PO4. In particular, Colombia notes that the Tribunal expressly rejected Colombia's request that these documents be admitted on the ground that it was not its role to \"*second guess*\" the determination of counsel for Glencore and Prodeco that documents were privileged. In this regard Colombia argues that\n\n*\u2026 if the Tribunal did not want to believe Colombia \u2013 who had the documents, or Mr Enciso, an independent conflict counsel retained by Colombia \u2013, it should have requested that a Tribunal-appointed conflict counsel review these documents as requested by Colombia. Again, the Tribunal instead decided that Claimants' word was enough, thereby leaving no door open to Colombia to produce documents that Colombia knew were not privileged*.457\n\nApplication, para. 74.\n\n271.\n\nColombia asserts that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in PO6 by excluding the FGN Documents and the Annex A Documents. According to Colombia the Tribunal \"*refus*[ed] *to abide by its own prior ruling, and instead impos*[ed] *unforeseeable byzantine requirements on Colombia*\" with respect to document production, thereby \"*act*[ing] *so arbitrarily as to offend 'rules of natural justice*\".458\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 343.\n\n*(iii) Failure to State Reasons*\n--------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nFinally, Colombia submits that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its decision not to admit the FGN Documents.459 Colombia claims that the Tribunal did not provide \"*a single authority*\" for its decision to impose the requirement that \"*the evidence must be 'gathered' or 'marshaled' in the course of a criminal proceeding*\" in order to be submitted before the Tribunal.460 According to Colombia this is because no such rule exists under either international law or Colombian law.461\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 344.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 344; Reply on Ann., para. 258.\n\nApplication, para. 73.\n\n273.\n\nColombia asserts further that the Tribunal's reasoning simply \"*cannot be followed* '*from Point A to Point B*'\".462 It characterises PO6 as not just lacking a \"*logical chain of reasoning*,\" but as \"*devoid of any chain of reasoning at all*\".463 The Tribunal, according to Colombia, \"*simply provided no reasons or support for its conclusion*\".464\n\nReply on Ann., para. 258.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 344.\n\nApplication, para. 73; Mem. on Ann., para. 344.\n\n***(2) Glencore and Prodeco***\n------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco reject all of the challenges based upon the Tribunal's decisions on the admission and exclusion of evidence. For them, a tribunal's decisions on such matters are ones which fall wholly outside the scope of the annulment process. While accepting that corruption is an issue of the utmost gravity, they argue that Colombia's allegation of corruption was without any foundation and warn that the principles by which an arbitration should be conducted cannot be discarded merely because a respondent State chooses to make an allegation of corruption.\n\n*(a) Procedural Order No. 2*\n----------------------------\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Power*\n------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco refute the assertion that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by its failure to apply the law in PO2, responding to each of the excesses alleged by Colombia in turn.\n\n276.\n\nOn the issue of the Tribunal's choice of law, Glencore asserts that, within the bounds of due process, the Tribunal has \"*absolute discretion*\" over issues of evidence, and thus \"*is not bound to follow one rule or another in making evidentiary determinations*\".465 Nevertheless, Glencore argues that Colombia's assertion that the Tribunal did not apply international law to this issue is \"*demonstrably false*\".466 The decision in Procedural Order No. 2 \"*made clear*\" that the Tribunal chose international law to govern the Parties' dispute, and looked to Colombian law only to confirm its conclusions.467\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 89.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 89.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 89; Tr. p. 135:6-8 (Mr Blackaby).\n\n277.\n\nSimilarly, in relation to Colombia's assertion that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in PO2, Glencore and Prodeco submit that \"[a]*ll Colombia does here is claim that the Tribunal made mistakes of Colombian law*\". They assert that even if the Tribunal made mistakes in relation to Colombian law (which they deny), such errors of law are not an excess of power and are no basis for annulment.468 In any event, Glencore and Prodeco add, given that the Tribunal's reference to Colombian law was carried out only to confirm the Tribunal's application of international law, \"*it had no bearing on the outcome of the proceeding*\" and therefore cannot constitute an excess of power.469\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 96.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 96.\n\n278.\n\nAs regards Colombia's assertion that the Tribunal \"*failed to apply anything resembling international law*\", Glencore and Prodeco counter that Colombia's case is in essence one that the Tribunal committed \"*an error of law*\".470 According to Glencore and Prodeco, however, the erroneous application of the law is not a manifest excess of powers.471 Indeed, the drafters of the ICSID Convention rejected a proposal to include \"*incorrect application of the law*\" as a ground for annulment.472 According to Glencore, an excess of power for failure to apply the applicable law is applicable only if there has been a failure to apply the law *in toto.*473 Glencore submits that this criterion is clearly not met by PO2, which applied the \"*international legal principles of fairness, good faith and equality of arms*\".474\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 91.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., paras. 83, 91.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 83, referring to A.

In other words, the Disputed SIC Documents \"*had not been lawfully obtained for the purpose of use in this arbitration*\".476 As such, even under the liberal admissibility rule as formulated by Colombia, the Disputed SIC Documents fell to be excluded as illegally obtained evidence.477\n\nTr. p. 132:4-7 (Mr Friedman).\n\nTr. p. 130:15-17 (Mr Friedman).\n\nTr. p. 130:17-18 (Mr Friedman).\n\n*(ii) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco deny the assertion that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental procedural rule by its decision in PO2. They maintain that Colombia has failed to show that any of the criteria for the application of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention have been met.478\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 55; Tr. p. 119:10-16 (Mr Friedman).\n\n281.\n\nFirst, Glencore and Prodeco contend that Colombia has failed to identify an applicable -let alone fundamental - procedural rule which was violated by the decision in PO2.479 According to them, the liberal admissibility rule cited by Colombia either \"*does not exist*\", or at least \"*does not exist in the absolute form that Colombia urges*\".480 Glencore and Prodeco assert that the sources which Colombia cites in support of its \"*liberal admissibility*\" rule have been misconstrued. Properly understood, these stand for the uncontroversial proposition that international tribunals are not bound by the rules of evidence that shape proceedings in national courts, and are free to adopt flexible procedures to deal with evidence.481 However, the fact that tribunals are not bound to follow strict rules of evidence from municipal legal systems does not support the proposition that they are \"prohibited *from excluding evidence under appropriate circumstances*\".482 Moreover, Glencore and Prodeco criticise the legal authorities relied upon by Colombia as \"*almost exclusively*\" relying on rules applicable to inter-State cases where \"*the parties have equal powers to obtain evidence*\". Such cases, they maintain, are readily distinguishable from investor-State litigation in which only one party \u2013 the State \u2013 has at its disposal coercive powers for obtaining evidence.483\n\nTr. p. 120:12-15 (Mr Friedman).\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 57; Tr. p. 129:9-13 (Mr Friedman).\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 62; Tr. p. 120:16-21 (Mr Friedman).\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 62; Tr. p. 125:10-13 (Mr Friedman).\n\nTr. pp. 121:19-122:6 (Mr Friedman).\n\n282.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco also contend that the existence of a limit on the Tribunal's discretion to determine admissibility would contradict the terms of Rule 34(1) of the ICSID Rules. Under this provision, ICSID tribunals are granted \"*full discretion*\" in considering the admissibility of evidence.484 As such, they must be taken to be empowered to decide that certain evidence is inadmissible.485 According to Glencore and Prodeco, tribunals \"*need*\" to have the ability to exclude documents, \"*to protect the integrity of the proceeding and* safeguard *principles of due process*\".486 If, on the other hand, ICSID tribunals were bound to admit \"*virtually all evidence sought to be introduced, lest [they] run afoul of denying a party the right to be heard*\", Rule 34(1) would have no purpose.487 From this they conclude that Rule 34(1) \"*displaces any claimed international law rule of 'liberal admissibility' that* requires *Tribunals to admit all evidence*\".488\n\nTr. p. 120:2-6 (Mr Friedman); C-Mem. on Ann., para. 61, citing *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV, ConocoPhillips Hamaca BV, ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV and ConocoPhillips Company v.

They make the argument that Colombia's case in this regard is \"*not an allegation that reasons are missing; it is a claim that the Tribunal made an error of law*\", which cannot form the basis of a violation of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.506\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., paras. 116-120.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 115.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 121.\n\n287.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco deny that the Tribunal was obliged to address every argument made by Colombia.507 They distinguish between the arguments raised by the Parties, on the one hand, and the issue that the Tribunal is asked to decide.508 In this respect Glencore invokes the decision of the *ad* hoc committee in CEAC as establishing the principle that, although a tribunal is indeed required to answer every question put to it, it is \"*not, however, required to deal explicitly with every detail of every argument advanced by the Parties or to refer to every authority which they invoke*\".509 In this case the Tribunal was asked to determine the admissibility of the Disputed SIC Documents.

They assert that the submission of a sworn affidavit, as required by the Tribunal, is normal and sufficient under the applicable procedural rules.519 They maintain that \"[y]*ou may agree with that practice, or you may disagree \u2026 but it is not an annullable error*\".520\n\nRej. on Ann., para. 57; Tr. p. 104:13-18 (Mr Blackaby).\n\nTr. p. 138:22-24 (Mr Friedman).\n\n292.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco submit further that the fact that the Tribunal refused to order the production of the Disputed SIC Documents was not a violation of Colombia's right to be heard. They argue that Colombia had no right to be heard on the content of privileged documents, and that Colombia was able to access all of the evidence to which it was entitled \u2013 namely the \"*non-privileged documents*\" \u2013 in accordance with the supplementary document production phase that the Tribunal ordered.521\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 71.\n\n293.\n\nAccording to Glencore and Prodeco, moreover, the fact that different national legal systems take different approaches to in-house counsel privilege demonstrates that any rule on the subject cannot be \"*fundamental*\".522 A tribunal's resolution of discovery disputes and privilege determinations, according to the Respondents on Annulment, are far from the kind of minimal standards and fundamental rules of procedure that Article 52(1)(d) is intended to safeguard.523 If it were otherwise, then every ruling on a privilege log could be subject to annulment committee review.524 That is not, and cannot be, the proper function of review in the ICSID system.525\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 72.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 72.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 72.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 72.\n\n*(iii) Failure to State Reasons*\n--------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nAs to Colombia's assertion that the Tribunal failed to give reasons, Glencore and Prodeco assert that Colombia has failed to explain why detailed reasons are even required for \"*routine procedural orders on which privilege rules may apply*\".526\n\nTr. p. 140:17-19 (Mr Friedman).\n\n295.\n\nMoreover, they maintain that \"[n]*o independent observer*\" could look at PO4 and conclude that the Tribunal failed to state reasons.527 Responding to the argument that the Tribunal misunderstood Colombia's legal authority cited in order to conclude that in-house legal counsel communications are privileged, Glencore and Prodeco submit that Colombia's disagreement is with the Tribunal's *finding*, rather than a failure to state reasons.528\n\nTr. p. 140:12-16 (Mr Friedman).\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 126.\n\n296.\n\nFinally, Glencore and Prodeco deny that there was any contradiction between the Tribunal's decision in PO2 and PO4. They contend that the decision to permit a new document production process did not \"*impose a waiver of privilege*\" over the documentation sought through that process.529\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 129.\n\n*(c) Procedural Order No. 6*\n----------------------------\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Power*\n------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco deny that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by its decision in PO6. In that decision, they submit, the Tribunal referred to the principles it had set out in PO2, in which the Tribunal had ruled on the applicable law and addressed various related issues.530 In both procedural orders the Tribunal addressed Colombia's improper attempts to introduce the Disputed SIC Documents into the record.531 The assertion that the Tribunal failed to apply the law, in excess of its powers, is as devoid of merit with regard to PO6 as it is with PO2.532\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 100.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 100.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 100.\n\n298.\n\nResponding to the assertion that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law governing privilege, Glencore and Prodeco reiterate their position that the Tribunal is given absolute discretion \u2013 within the bounds of due process \u2013 over issues of evidence.533 In the result, they contend, the Tribunal's application of one privilege rule or another is not subject to annulment review.534\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 97.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 97.\n\n299.\n\nAs to the assertion that the Tribunal misapplied Colombian law, Glencore and Prodeco respond that an error of law, even if shown to exist, is not a basis for annulment.535\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 98.\n\n*(ii) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nNor, according to Glencore and Prodeco, did the Tribunal seriously depart from a fundamental rule of procedure in PO6 by excluding the FGN Documents. By that decision, Glencore and Prodeco reason, the Tribunal simply applied the standards that it had already set out in PO2.536 They maintain that, in making its argument, Colombia \"*does not even attempt to identify a rule of procedure from which the Tribunal departed, much less that the rule is fundamental and the departure serious*\", and that, as the party seeking annulment, Colombia bears the burden of demonstrating that the Award must be annulled under Article 52(1)(d),537 which it has failed to do.538\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 75.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 75, citing *Bernhard von Pezold*, note 495, above, at para. 238 (**RAL-20**).\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 75.\n\n301.\n\nFinally, Glencore and Prodeco assert that the Tribunal did not need to cite legal authority in reaching routine procedural decisions on admissibility of evidence, but that in any event the Tribunal \"*did apply legal principles*\" by referring to the principles set out in its PO2.539 Colombia's \"*real*\" complaint is that \"*the Tribunal erred in the application of that law*\", which is not a proper ground for annulment.540\n\nTr. p. 141:9-13 (Mr Friedman).\n\nTr. p. 141:19-22 (Mr Friedman).\n\n*(iii) Failure to State Reasons*\n--------------------------------\n\n302.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco argue that PO6 stated \"*clear reasons*\" for the decision to exclude the FGN Documents*,* which \"*is all that Article 52(1)(e) requires*\".541 Responding to Colombia's submission that the Tribunal had failed to cite any legal authority in justification of its decision in PO6, Glencore and Prodeco refute the very notion that a tribunal is required cite legal authority when issuing evidentiary determinations, citing Arbitration Rule 34(1) in support of their position.542\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 130.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 130.\n\n**B. T****he** **A****nalysis of the** **C****ommittee**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) General Observations***\n------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nColombia's complaint regarding the exclusion of the illegality documents concerns three separate, but closely related, steps taken by the Tribunal:\n\n*PO2*, adopted on 4 November 2017, by which the Tribunal ruled that Colombia was not to introduce the disputed documents seized by the SIC into the record. Although the Tribunal ruled that Colombia was not entitled to submit these documents with its Counter-Memorial, it provided for a new round of document production which permitted Colombia to request the production of the excluded documents;\n\n*PO4*, adopted on 24 April 2018, by which the Tribunal, holding that legal privilege extended to communications with both in-house lawyers and outside counsel and finding no evidence that Glencore or Prodeco had waived any legal or settlement privilege, rejected Colombia' request to introduce the disputed documents by way of document production, provided that counsel for Glencore and Prodeco submitted an affidavit confirming that each of the documents in respect of which privilege was claimed met all of the requirements identified by the Tribunal. The subsequent affidavit stated that all but two of the documents in respect of which privilege had been claimed met the requirements set out by the Tribunal; and\n\n*PO6*, adopted on 31 July 2018, by which the Tribunal confirmed, and gave reasons for, its decision (originally given in a letter of 18 May 2018) rejecting Colombia's request to introduce the remaining disputed documents as evidence of criminal conduct.\n\n304.\n\nAnnulment is, of course, available only with regard to the Award itself; there is no scope under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention for an application to annul a Procedural Order or a Decision. Nevertheless, as the Committee has already explained (see para. 219, above), procedural decisions are, in effect, incorporated into the Award. If the Tribunal did indeed manifestly exceed its powers or commit a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in one of its procedural decisions, or if it failed adequately to state the reasons for its decisions, then that would be a ground for annulment.\n\n305.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal recited at some length in the Award the earlier procedural decisions which it had taken (see para. 219, above). Before the Committee, Colombia was critical of the Tribunal's behaviour in this regard. Colombia argues that the space which the Tribunal devoted in the Award to what the Tribunal described as \"*certain procedural incidents*\" \"*can only be explained as an ex post facto attempt to cure what the Tribunal had done, drafted not for the parties but for you, members of the Committee*\".543 The Committee does not agree with this criticism. It was both logical and helpful for the Tribunal to incorporate into the Award an account of its decisions on the admission or exclusion of documents, particularly in view of the fact that Colombia had made clear in correspondence its view that those decisions amounted to errors which would render an award annullable under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.544 There is nothing in the relevant portions of the Award to suggest that the Tribunal \"*massaged*\" the reasons given in the Procedural Orders for its decisions regarding the Disputed Documents. On the contrary, the Award recites or summarises those decisions; any difference between these parts of the Award and the Procedural Orders is due to the fact that the Tribunal in its Award was able to add reference to the events which followed the adoption of those Orders.\n\nTr. p. 25:12-18 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nSee, for example, Colombia's letter of 14 November 2017, note 124, above (**C-283/R-275**) expressing its views on PO2, note 67, above (**AAE-1**).\n\n306.\n\nColombia maintains that, by denying it the opportunity to rely upon the Disputed Documents in the arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal committed a serious violation of a fundamental rule of procedure, manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons for its decision. These are separate grounds for annulment and Colombia maintains that, even if the Committee finds that there was no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, it should still annul the Award if another ground of annulment is made out.545 Nevertheless, the three grounds are closely related and the allegation that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure lies at the heart of the case.\n\nTr. pp. 162:23-163:5 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n307.\n\nIn addition, while it is necessary to begin by examining each Order separately, it is important not to lose sight of two overarching considerations. First, it is the combined effect of the three Orders in excluding documents on which Colombia wished to rely which is alleged to constitute the annullable error. Secondly, the context is an allegation by Colombia of corruption and illegality on the part of Glencore and Prodeco and their officials. That is an allegation of the utmost gravity which, had the Tribunal accepted it, would have led to a finding that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction.\n\n308.\n\nThe Committee notes the Tribunal's comments about corruption being \"*morally odious*\" and emphasising the importance of a rigorous investigation of corruption allegations (see para. 171, above). The Committee agrees. A tribunal faced with allegations of corruption has a duty to investigate those allegations with rigour.\n\n***(2) Procedural Order No. 2: The Initial Decision to Exclude the Documents obtained by the SIC***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nAs has already been summarized (see paras. 239 -249, above), Colombia maintains that PO2 contains several serious irregularities which went on to taint the Award. There is considerable overlap between these different alleged irregularities; in substance, Colombia makes three main points:\n\n(a) The Tribunal failed properly to identify the applicable law, since it should have applied international law and not Colombian law;546\n\n(b) Its conclusions about Colombian law were based upon a misunderstanding of a principle which neither party had argued;547\n\n(c) The Tribunal did not apply the applicable law, since it ignored the rules of international law, especially the rule of \"*liberal admissibility of evidence*\", and substituted its own *ex aequo et bono* concept of fairness. In doing so it manifestly exceeded its powers and was guilty of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure since it denied Colombia the opportunity to present its case.548\n\nReply on Ann. para. 205.\n\nTr. pp. 58:6-8, 59:19-25 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\nTr. p. 17:1-5 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n310.\n\nThe Committee does not accept that the Tribunal erred in its identification of the applicable law. It agrees with Colombia that the issue of admissibility of evidence is governed by international law but so did the Tribunal, which held that international law was the applicable law549 and went on to rule that the disputed documents were inadmissible as a matter of international law.550 The purely secondary role played by Colombian law is illustrated by the fact that the Tribunal devoted twenty-four paragraphs of PO2 to a consideration of international law but only four to Colombian law and that its conclusion was merely that Colombian law \"*would appear to confirm the conclusion reached by the Tribunal under international law*\".551 The fact that the Tribunal confirmed its conclusions by reference to Colombian law in no way alters the fact that it treated international law as the basis for its decision to exclude the disputed documents.\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 52 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at paras. 57-70 (**AAE-1**).\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 74 (**AAE-1**).\n\n311.\n\nThat makes it unnecessary to consider whether the Tribunal erred in its findings regarding Colombian law. The Committee sees no basis on which to conclude that the Tribunal made such an error but, even if it did, that error was confined to a law which the Tribunal considered only so as to confirm a finding which it had reached by reference to international law. In those circumstances, such an error would not come anywhere near constituting either a manifest excess of power or a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Nor would it affect the reasoning of the Tribunal in such a way as to amount to a failure to state reasons.\n\n312.\n\nWith regard to Colombia's argument that the Tribunal egregiously misapplied international law, the Committee recalls that the threshold is a high one and that an error by itself is not enough.552 Colombia's criticism of the Tribunal for referring to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention \u2013 on the ground that this provision deals with the substantive law applicable to the resolution of the underlying dispute and not the law to be applied to questions of procedure \u2013 does not begin to cross that threshold. While Colombia may be correct about the scope of Article 42(1), the matter is open to argument either way. Moreover, even if the Tribunal was incorrect in its interpretation and application of the provision, it made no difference to the outcome, since the choice of applicable law by the Tribunal was no different from that suggested by both Parties.\n\nSee para. 232, above.\n\n313.\n\nTurning to Colombia's argument that the Tribunal substituted its own subjective judgment for the rules of international law, the Committee sees two strands to this argument. First, Colombia maintains that the Tribunal disregarded what it describes as the rule of liberal admissibility of evidence. Secondly, Colombia contends that, notwithstanding its references to the equality of arms, the Tribunal did not apply a rule of law but only a subjective concept of fairness, thus deciding the question of admissibility on an *ex aequo et bono* basis, something it had no jurisdiction to do.\n\n314.\n\nColombia maintains that the technical rules on admissibility of evidence found in different systems of national law have no place in international law. It relies, *inter alia*, on the award of the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission in *Parker v. United Mexican States*, which includes the following statement:\n\n*For the future guidance of the respective Agents, the Commission announces that, however appropriate may be the technical rules of evidence obtaining in the jurisdiction of either the United States or Mexico as applied to the conduct of trials in their municipal courts, they have no place in regulating the admissibility of and in the weighing of evidence before this international tribunal. There are many reasons why such technical rules have no application here, among them being that this Commission is without power to summon witnesses or issue processes for the taking of depositions with which municipal tribunals are usually clothed. The Commission expressly decides that municipal restrictive rules of adjective law or of evidence cannot be here introduced and given effect by clothing them in such phrases as \"universal principles of law\", or \"the general theory of law\", and the like. On the contrary, the greatest liberality will obtain in the admission of evidence before this Commission with the view of discovering the whole truth with respect to each claim submitted.*553\n\n*William A. Parker (U.S.A.) v. United Mexican States*, General Claims Commission, Decision of 31 March 1926, Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. IV, p. 39(**AAL-66**).\n\n315.\n\nIt is certainly the case that international tribunals have considered themselves not to be bound by the restrictive rules on admissibility of evidence frequently found in municipal legal systems and have not considered themselves as under a duty to exclude evidence which would not be admissible in the legal systems of the States appearing before them. Nevertheless, the fact that international tribunals have rejected the application of restrictive rules taken from national law does not mean that there is a rule of international law that requires an international tribunal to admit all of the evidence which a party wishes to submit. The passage from *Parker*, quoted above is a rejection of the technical rules of national law (particularly in the common law countries) and a recognition that an international tribunal *may* admit a much wider range of evidence, not an espousal of a general rule that an international tribunal *must* admit whatever a party puts before it.\n\n316.\n\nEven Colombia accepts that there are limits to the supposed rule of liberal admissibility, since it maintains that this rule does not require the admission of evidence which has been illegally obtained or which is covered by legal privilege (a concept which, according to Colombia, applies only to correspondence with external counsel and not with in-house lawyers).\n\n317.\n\nThe Committee considers that even with these qualifications, Colombia's argument goes too far. First, it ignores the broad discretion which the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules accord a tribunal. Thus, Article 44 of the Convention provides that:\n\n*Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.*\n\nRule 34, paragraph 1, of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that:\n\n*The Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value.*\n\n318.\n\nAn ICSID tribunal is thus entrusted with a broad discretion regarding the admissibility of evidence which a party wishes to put before it. The Committee agrees with Colombia that this discretion is not unlimited and that it is to be exercised reasonably but does not accept that it is limited to excluding illegally obtained evidence or evidence protected by legal privilege.\n\n319.\n\nAt the most basic level, the power of the Tribunal to control the procedure and timetable of the proceedings extends to a power to exclude late-filed evidence, evidence which has not been translated as required and evidence which in other respects does not comply with procedural directives given by the tribunal.\n\n320.\n\nMore importantly, an ICSID tribunal is required to ensure that fundamental rules of procedure are complied with. That duty includes ensuring the equality of arms. Indeed, it is well established that the fundamental rules of procedure, a serious departure from which is a ground for annulment, include \"*the principle of equal treatment of the parties*\".554 It follows that, in exercising its discretion under Arbitration Rule 34(1), a tribunal must have regard to whether the admission or exclusion of evidence would affect the equality of the parties.\n\n*Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1), Decision on Annulment of 29 May 2019, para. 164 (**RAL-26**).\n\n321.\n\nIn this respect a highly material factor in investor-State arbitration is that one party, the State, has powers of compulsion not possessed by the other party, the investor. That is one of the factors which distinguishes investor-State arbitration from both purely commercial arbitration and State-to-State arbitration.\n\n322.\n\nThis was a central issue before the Tribunal in the present case. Colombia wished to submit with its Counter-Memorial documents which had come into its possession as a result of the exercise by Colombia of State powers to compel Prodeco to surrender to the SIC documents taken from its servers by SIC officials. Glencore and Prodeco, on the other hand, had no such power to compel any Colombian agency to surrender to them documents held by the State.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal recognized the inequality to which that situation gave rise and held that it was entitled to exclude the disputed documents in order to prevent such inequality.555 It is important, however, to recall that the Tribunal did not rule out all possibility of the documents being admitted into the record. On the contrary, it provided for a further round of document production in which Colombia could seek production of the disputed documents and the question whether or not any of those documents were covered by legal or settlement privilege (which Colombia accepts would be a reason for their exclusion) could be argued and decided. In addition, it provided for the possibility of their introduction into the arbitration proceedings if they came to form part of the record in criminal proceedings before a Colombian court.556\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at paras. 68-69 (**AAE-1**), quoted at para. 83, above.\n\nSee paras. 88 -94, above.\n\n324.\n\nThe Committee sees no error, let alone an annullable error, in the way the Tribunal dealt with matters in PO2. Contrary to what Colombia suggests, there is no rigid rule of international law requiring a tribunal to admit any documents not covered by privilege or obtained by unlawful means. Instead, an ICSID tribunal has a discretion with regard to the admission of evidence and a duty, in the exercise of that discretion, to take into account the need to maintain equality between the parties, one of the most fundamental rules of due process. As the committee in *CEAC v. Montenegro* explained \"[i]*t is, of course, a rule of the utmost importance that each party must be given an equal opportunity to put evidence before a tribunal*\".557 Colombia quoted this passage in support of its argument that the Tribunal had erred by excluding the evidence which Colombia had obtained through the SIC's use of coercive powers.558 The Committee, however, sees the passage from *CEAC* as supporting the Tribunal's decision that, where only one party could obtain information by coercive means, to admit evidence thus obtained simply because that party was in possession of that evidence would be contrary to the principle of equality of arms.\n\n*CEAC*, note 342, above, at para. 110 (**AAL-3**).\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 147.\n\n325.\n\nThe Committee considers that it was well within the bounds of the Tribunal's discretion for it to determine that documents obtained by Colombia by the use of compulsory powers (albeit wielded lawfully), for a different purpose and which did not form part of the record in criminal proceedings in Colombia, should not be admitted outside the normal document production process.\n\n326.\n\nThe references to fairness by the Tribunal in PO2 are not an indication of the abandonment of rules in favour of an *ex aequo et bono* approach. The Committee accepts that an ICSID tribunal is not entitled to decide a case (or procedural issues ancillary to a decision on the outcome of the case) on an *ex aequo et bono* basis unless the parties so agree.559 What the Tribunal was doing, however, was not setting aside the rules of procedure but applying them. Fairness is central to the rule of equality of arms, so it is unsurprising to find the Tribunal referring to it, and an appreciation by the Tribunal of what is fair to each Party is an essential element of the exercise of the discretion vested in it by Arbitration Rule 34.\n\nIn the words of the ICSID Secretariat Updated Background paper on Annulment of 5 May 2016 (**AAL-24**), para. 93:  \nAd hoc *Committees agree that a Tribunal's complete failure to apply the proper law or acting* ex aequo et bono *without agreement of the parties to do so as required by the ICSID Convention could constitute a manifest excess of powers.*  \nSee also *MTD,* note 308, above, at para. 44 (**AAL-28**).\n\n327.\n\nThree other matters require brief reference in passing. First, Colombia draws attention to the fact that the Tribunal, in paragraphs 16 to 18 and paragraph 19 of PO2, referred to the fact that the seizure of the disputed documents took place between the service on Colombia of the first and second notices of dispute. The Committee considers that this reference is simply part of the Tribunal's account of the factual background; there is no indication that it affected the Tribunal's decision and the Tribunal makes clear that the documents were not seized for the purpose of using them in possible future arbitration proceedings.560\n\nPO2, note 67, above, at para. 62 (**AAE-1**).\n\n328.\n\nSecondly, Colombia maintains that it would be ridiculous if one State agency could not seek assistance from another. That is doubtless true but the Tribunal's decision does not suggest otherwise. What the Tribunal dealt with in PO2 was not the propriety of the ANDJE seeking assistance from the SIC but the narrower question of whether documents coercively obtained by the SIC for one purpose could be used for the different purpose of advancing Colombia's case in the entirely separate arbitration proceedings. There is no suggestion that the ANDJE could not have sought and obtained other assistance from the SIC or any other State agency.\n\n329.\n\nLastly, Colombia suggests that the Tribunal wrongly reversed the burden of proof. The Committee does not agree. Under normal principles, it was for Colombia to prove that Glencore and Prodeco had acted unlawfully. PO2 does not change that position.561 It was, of course, for Glencore and Prodeco to establish that any document was privileged but PO2 does not reverse the burden of proof on that either; the Tribunal deferred that question to the extended production process.\n\nThe Tribunal reiterated that point at paras. 668-670 of the Award.\n\n330.\n\nThe Committee thus concludes that PO2 involved no departure \u2013 let alone a serious departure \u2013 from any fundamental rule of procedure and no excess of power on the part of the Tribunal.\n\n331.\n\nNor is the Committee persuaded by Colombia's argument that the Award should be annulled for failure to state reasons. The Tribunal's reasons for its decisions in PO2 are clearly stated and easy to follow. There is nothing incoherent or contradictory about them. They address in detail the question which the Tribunal was required to answer and are in no sense \"*frivolous*\" or irrelevant. Colombia may not find those reasons convincing but that is not a reason for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***(3) Procedural Order No. 4 and its Aftermath: The Tribunal's Ruling on Privilege and its Application***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nColombia criticises the Tribunal's decisions on Glencore and Prodeco's assertion of privilege on two grounds. First, it contends that the Tribunal was wrong to hold that privilege applied to communications between the companies and their in-house legal counsel and maintains that such privilege extends only to communications with independent external counsel. Secondly, Colombia argues that the Tribunal erred in permitting counsel for the companies to certify whether or not individual documents met the criteria for legal privilege and should have appointed a privilege inspector (referred to by Colombia as a \"*conflict counsel*\") to carry out this task.\n\n*(a) The Decision that Communications with In-House Counsel are to be Treated in the Same Way as Communications with External Counsel*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nWith regard to the first argument, Colombia maintains that the Tribunal did not apply the applicable law. While Colombia accepts that the procedure before the Tribunal is governed by public international law, it argues that, on the issue of privilege, international law requires a *renvoi* to the law of the country within which the legal communication is situated. In Colombia's view, such a *renvoi* is required because the central question in determining whether or not a document is privileged is whether those who created or requested that document had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality. That expectation could only be derived from, and shaped by, the law of the State in which the document was created. In the present case, Prodeco's lawyers were Colombian nationals working in Colombia and all of the communications in question took place in Colombia. The Tribunal, it is said, therefore committed an annullable error when it decided to apply public international law rather than Colombian law.\n\n334.\n\nThe Committee can see the force of Colombia's argument that the expectations which underlie the concept of legal privilege are shaped by the relevant local law. In the end, however, it is not persuaded that the Tribunal committed an annullable error regarding the applicable law.\n\n335.\n\nFirst, although Colombia presents what happened as a failure to apply the applicable law, the Committee does not accept that that is the case. The Tribunal rightly identified international law as the law governing the procedure before an ICSID tribunal. That was also the position of both Parties.562 Colombia's complaint is that the Tribunal did not accept that international law contains a *renvoi* to national law on questions of legal privilege. Whether or not international law does indeed require such a *renvoi* is a question about the content of international law. Even if the Tribunal was wrong (which the Committee does not accept) to hold that international law did not require a *renvoi* to national law, it would have been guilty of a misinterpretation or misapplication of the applicable law, rather than a failure to apply that law at all.\n\nAs indicated above (paras. 242 -244), Colombia criticises PO2 on the ground that the Tribunal did not apply international law exclusively but also considered Colombian law.\n\n336.\n\nSecondly, again assuming, *arguendo*, that the Tribunal erred in its decision about the supposed *renvoi*, the Committee does not consider that this error would have been so egregious as to be equivalent to a failure to apply the applicable law, and only an error on such a scale could be a basis for annulment (see para. 232, above). Colombia has adduced no authority in support of its contention that international law requires a *renvoi* to national law where legal privilege is being asserted. Indeed, the only authorities directly in point, the decisions in *Vito Gallo*563 and *Reineccius*564 support the contrary proposition.\n\n*Vito Gallo*, note 148, above, at para. 41 (**RL-129**). It should be noted, however, that the decision in that case was in part motivated by the provision of Article 1131(1) of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), which is not applicable here.\n\n*Reineccius*, note 180, above.\n\n337.\n\nThirdly, the Committee does not accept that the Tribunal erred in deciding the question by reference to international law. Colombia's argument rests purely on three propositions: that legal privilege must depend upon the expectations of those concerned at the time that the relevant documents were created, that those expectations are determined by the national law of the country in which the relevant activities took place, and that international law must therefore, as a matter of logic defer to that national law in order to decide whether the documents in question are privileged.\n\n338.\n\nThe first proposition can be accepted up to a point; legal privilege is indeed closely bound up with the expectations of those who seek or give legal advice, although it should also be recognized that legal privilege serves community interests which may be distinct from those of the client and lawyer.\n\n339.\n\nThe second proposition is less straightforward. It assumes that the relevant activities all take place in one country. Especially given the nature of international investment, that may not be the case. A manager from State A responsible for an investment in State B may well take advice by email from a lawyer (whether in-house or external) in State C. It is true that that was not what happened in the present case, where everything that was done took place in Colombia and the lawyers were qualified in, and regulated by the law of, Colombia. However, a search for the approach taken by international law to questions of privilege cannot be wholly case-specific.\n\n340.\n\nThe really problematic proposition, however, is the third one. To assume that international law defers to national law not only overlooks the limitations on the first two propositions, it also ignores the essentially international character of ICSID arbitration and the fact that an ICSID tribunal must ensure equality of arms in litigation between inherently unequal parties \u2013 the State and the investor. The Committee has already considered the significance of the fact that the State has available to it coercive powers which the investor lacks (see paras. 320 -330, above). There is also the consideration that national law may treat issues of confidentiality differently when considering the relationship between the State and its legal advisers, where issues of official secrecy may be material, and communications between a private party and its counsel.565\n\nSee, e.g., *Vito Gallo*, note 148, above (**RL-129**), where the State's claim was based on concepts of Cabinet confidence under national law.\n\n341.\n\nThe Committee is not called upon to provide answers to these questions. It is enough to note that they suggest that it is by no means self-evident that international law should, or does, require a *renvoi* to national law on issues of privilege. In these circumstances, and given that the only authorities produced which address the subject hold that privilege is determined by international law with no requirement of a *renvoi*, the Committee considers that the decision of the Tribunal that international law did not require it to apply Colombian law cannot be regarded as an egregious misinterpretation or misapplication of the applicable law.\n\n342.\n\nIn passing, it should be noted that the Tribunal reinforced its decision by reference to Colombian law.566 Colombia criticises the analysis of Colombian law as based upon a misreading of the one authority referred to by the Tribunal. The Committee considers that this authority (an interview with two Colombian lawyers) is equivocal. It cannot, therefore, conclude that the Tribunal was guilty of an obvious error. More importantly, even if it was so guilty, that error related only to a law to which the Tribunal referred to confirm the decision which it had already arrived at by the application of international law.\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at paras. 57-63 (**AAE-9**).\n\n343.\n\nColombia also advances a separate basis for challenging the Tribunal's decision. Accepting, *arguendo*, that the question whether privilege attached to communications with in-house counsel falls to be determined by reference to international law, Colombia argues that the Tribunal erred in finding that communications with in-house counsel are privileged under international law. Colombia relies on the fact that the question is treated so differently by different national legal systems. In this context, Colombia refers in particular to the rejection by the Court of Justice of the European Union of the concept that communications with in-house counsel are entitled to privilege.567\n\n*Akzo*, note 425, above, at para. 74 (**RL-116**).\n\n344.\n\nThe Committee accepts that practice regarding whether privilege extends to communications with in-house counsel varies considerably between States. The question before the Committee, however, is not whether there is an international law rule which provides for privilege in those circumstances but whether the Tribunal's conclusion that such a rule exists was one which amounted to so gross a misapplication or misinterpretation of international law that it should be regarded as an annullable failure to apply international law at all.\n\n345.\n\nIn that respect, the Committee recalls that the *Vito Gallo* tribunal568 drew no distinction between communications with in-house lawyers and those with external counsel and that the *Reineccius* ruling569 expressly stated that privilege must be applied to both types of communication. The Tribunal's ruling in PO4 cannot, therefore be considered unprecedented.\n\n*Vito Gallo,* note 148, above, para. 47 (**RL-129**). Colombia draws attention to the fact that two of the members of the Tribunal in the present case (the President and Mr Thomas) were also members of the *Vito Gallo* tribunal. The Committee does not attach any significance to that fact. Mr Thomas was appointed by Colombia and the President by agreement of the Parties. Moreover, neither Party has shown any hesitation in citing before the Tribunal cases in which members of the Tribunal were involved or in citing before the Committee cases in which members of the Committee were involved.\n\n*Reineccius*, note 180, above.\n\n346.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal, recognizing that the matter was not wholly settled, gave a coherent and persuasive explanation for its decision when it held that to treat communications with in-house counsel differently would be to \"*imply an unwarranted discrimination towards parties that choose to be represented in investment arbitration, or that seek advice on matters that may become relevant in investment arbitration, by in-house counsel*\".570 This explanation has a particular resonance in the context of investor-State arbitration because States regularly take advice from their own government lawyers (even if they later choose, as here, to be represented in part by external counsel). If government lawyers, as in-house counsel, are excluded from the ambit of legal privilege, then the respondent State may end up being treated markedly less favourably than the investor.\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 55 (**AAE-9**).\n\n347.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal's decision in PO4 that privilege extended to communications with counsel irrespective of whether the counsel in question were in-house or external cannot be regarded as an egregious misinterpretation or misapplication of international law. The application to annul the award on this ground for manifest excess of power is therefore rejected.\n\n348.\n\nNor can the Committee accept Colombia's argument that the Tribunal was guilty of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The fundamental rule of procedure on which Colombia relies is the right to be heard and, in particular, the aspect of that right which permits a party to submit evidence in support of its case. But, as the Committee has already held, the right to submit evidence is not unqualified. Both Parties recognize that it excludes evidence which is privileged. Colombia's argument is thus no more than a restatement of its argument on manifest excess of power. If, as the Committee has held, the Tribunal did not exceed its powers in determining that privilege under international law extends to communications with in-house counsel, then the application of that ruling cannot, in itself, be a departure from the right to be heard.\n\n349.\n\nFinally, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not fail to state the reasons for its decision. Its decision is explained in a coherent way and without contradiction. The Committee will, however, consider below one aspect of this argument by Colombia, namely that the Tribunal declined to address each of the 159 documents separately.571 That argument goes to the application of the decision in PO4 rather than to the issue of principle decided in that PO.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 321.\n\n*(b) The Tribunal's Decision not to Admit the Annex A Documents*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nIn PO4 the Tribunal set out the conditions which it considered that a document had to meet in order to qualify for legal privilege. Those conditions were:\n\n- *The document has to be drafted by a lawyer acting in his or her capacity as lawyer;*\n\n- *A solicitor-client relationship based on trust must exist as between the lawyer (in-house or external legal advisor) and the client;*\n\n- *The document has to be elaborated for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice;*\n\n- *The lawyer and the client, when giving and obtaining legal advice, must have acted with the expectation that the advice would be kept confidential in a contentious situation.*572\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 54 (**AAE-9**), quoting *Vito Gallo*, note 148, above, at para. 47 (**RL-129**).\n\n351.\n\nColombia does not contest these criteria. It contends, however, that the Tribunal committed an annullable error when it directed that the lead counsel for Glencore and Prodeco should submit an affidavit indicating which of the documents in respect of which they claimed privilege met those criteria,573 and when the Tribunal subsequently decided, in respect of the Annex A documents, that:\n\n*It falls within the responsibility of Claimants' counsel to determine which documents are responsive to Respondent's petitions (as narrowed down by the Tribunal) and which are subject to privilege. The Tribunal has no reason to second guess these decisions.*574\n\nPO4, note 72, above, at para. 95 (**AAE-9**).\n\nLetter from the Tribunal, 18 May 2018, reproduced at Award, para. 130.\n\n352.\n\nColombia complains that no reasons were given for this decision. While the letter of 18 May 2018 is brief, that is hardly surprising in view of the urgency of the matter. The correspondence between the Parties on this issue had concluded only on the previous day and the hearing was due to start in ten days' time.575 The letter ended by stating that the Tribunal would give its reasons at a later date. This it did in PO6, paragraphs 108-114. While the reasons given there are succinct, the Committee considers that they are sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention in that they enable the reader to follow the Tribunal and understand the conclusion at which it arrived.\n\nSee paras. 140 to 141, above.\n\n353.\n\nColombia's more substantial complaints are that the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and manifestly exceeded its powers by declining to \"*second guess*\" the decisions of Glencore and Prodeco's counsel regarding whether the Annex A documents were responsive and whether they were privileged.\n\n354.\n\nColombia emphasizes three features of the situation which confronted the Tribunal and which it argues were different from those which normally exist when a dispute regarding privilege and responsiveness arises. First, it points to the fact that the documents were already in the possession of Colombia and that there was, therefore, no more reason for the Tribunal to accept Glencore and Prodeco's view than to accept Colombia's. Secondly, with regard to whether the documents sought were responsive to the requests made, Colombia argues that, having already seen the documents in question, it had formulated its requests specifically with a view to obtaining production of those documents, so that there could be no justification for holding that they were not responsive. Finally, the dispute regarding the incorporation of the documents into the record of the proceedings arose in the context of allegations of corruption and, according to Colombia, it was therefore necessary that the claims that documents were privileged or not responsive be subjected to scrutiny. According to Colombia, the Tribunal had the power to conduct that scrutiny by ordering that the claims be reviewed by a privilege inspector or decided by the Tribunal itself and it should not have declined to \"*second guess*\" the views of Glencore and Prodeco's counsel. Its failure to use that power was, Colombia maintains, both a manifest excess of power and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n355.\n\nThe Committee considers that it is useful to recall the situation which faced the Tribunal in May 2018, when this issue was presented to it. First, the hearings were due to start on 28 May 2018. The Tribunal had made clear that it did not wish to postpone them576 and Colombia had stated that it would oppose any request for a postponement.577 In the correspondence of May 2018 neither Party suggested that the hearing be postponed. Secondly, of the 24 documents listed in Annex A (all of which were among the Disputed SIC Documents which Colombia had sought to introduce into the record with its original Counter-Memorial), one had already been disclosed, legal privilege had been asserted in respect of six, while the remainder were said by Glencore and Prodeco not to be responsive to the requests of Colombia \"*as narrowed by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 3*\".\n\nTribunal's email of 6 March 2018, note 153, above (**AAE-26**); see para. 102, above.\n\nColombia's letter of 9 March 2018, note 154, above (**R-273**); see para. 106, above.\n\n356.\n\nAnnex A, in the form in which it was attached to Colombia's letter to the Tribunal of 11 May 2018, resembled a Redfern schedule. Each row began by identifying a document by reference to the number it had been given when attached to the original text of the Counter-Memorial. The next column identified the request (in Colombia's document production request which had been considered by the Tribunal in its PO3) to which Colombia claimed the document was responsive. The schedule then identified the date of the document, the person by whom it was sent and the recipients.578 In the following columns, Colombia indicated why it did not consider the document in question was covered by either legal or settlement privilege. In a final column, Glencore and Prodeco explained why they considered the document to be privileged (in the case of the six documents in respect of which privilege was asserted) or stated (in the case of the remaining documents) that they were not responsive.\n\nExcept for certain spreadsheets which had been attached to an expert report submitted by Colombia.\n\n357.\n\nThe Committee considers that different issues arise with regard to the documents said by Glencore and Prodeco to be non-responsive and those for which privilege was claimed. The Committee will therefore examine the two categories separately, beginning with the documents for which privilege was asserted. Although Annex A refers to both legal privilege and settlement privilege, Glencore and Prodeco stated (in the final column of the schedule) that settlement privilege was invoked only with regard to what was then Document R-54. That document was later disclosed at the hearing (see para. 152, above), where it entered the record as Document R-100.\n\n358.\n\nIt is not unusual for a tribunal to accept a certificate from the leading counsel of a party that a particular document is subject to legal privilege (although the Committee appreciates that this practice involves assumptions regarding supervision by a national court of local ethical duties which is not always present in international commercial or investor-state arbitration). While tribunals frequently refer such disputes to a privilege inspector, there is no rule of procedure, let alone a fundamental one, which requires that, whenever there is a dispute concerning such issues, a tribunal should appoint a privilege inspector or conduct its own investigation into the responsiveness of a particular document.\n\n359.\n\nNor does the fact that Colombia had already seen the documents by itself persuade the Committee that the Tribunal should have acted in a different manner. The whole point of the decision in PO2 (which the Committee has found involved no annullable error) was that Colombia, having obtained the Disputed SIC Documents through the intervention of a State agency in the context of an entirely different investigation, should not benefit from that fact in the context of the arbitration proceedings but instead seek the production of the documents through the normal means. To hold that the \"*normal means*\" should be set aside and a different procedure adopted merely because Colombia had seen the documents would be completely counter to the principle underlying that decision.\n\n360.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that the documents were sought for the purpose of establishing a case of corruption on the part of the investor puts the dispute regarding privilege in a different light. As both the Tribunal579 and the Committee580 have made clear, \"*corruption is morally odious*\" and a tribunal has a duty to investigate claims of corruption with rigour. It is arguable that this duty requires that the use of the certification procedure, though acceptable in other circumstances, should give way to a more searching inquiry, either involving the use of a privilege inspector or the scrutiny of the documents by the tribunal itself.\n\nAward, paras. 663-664; see also para. 171, above.\n\nSee para. 308, above.\n\n361.\n\nIn the present case, a further cause for concern is that the one document for which privilege was claimed that was later disclosed, namely what became Document R-100, does not appear to meet the requirements for legal privilege as those were set out in PO4.\n\n362.\n\nR-100 is a chain of emails (see paras. 184 to 185, above). Most of the emails were from Ms Natalia Anaya, one of Prodeco's in-house counsel, to Mr Nagle and other members of Prodeco's senior management. They report on meetings which Ms Anaya had with various officials of Ingeominas. There are very brief replies from Mr Nagle. Ms Anaya does not give legal advice, nor does Mr Nagle request it. In the last email in the chain, dated 15 May 2009, Ms Anaya reports a conversation with Carlos Gustavo Arrieta (Prodeco's external counsel) in the following terms:\n\n*I asked Carlos Gustavo to come with me to the meeting on Monday, but he is busy all day. Anyhow, he told me that he will make all efforts to try to change some meetings in order to go to Ingeominas, but he will confirm on Monday. He said that he believes that more than legal pressure, it is required political pressure through Claudia Jimenez or Mateo Restrepo.*581\n\nEmail from Natalia Anaya to Gary Nagle and others, 15 May 2009, p. 3 (**R-100**).\n\n363.\n\nIn their comments in Annex A, Glencore and Prodeco stated that \"*Ms Anaya also conveys to management the advice of Prodeco's external counsel, Carlos Gustavo Arrieta, on the issues relating to royalties and caducity addressed in the email chain*\". The only part of the email chain in which the views of Mr Arrieta are discussed is the passage quoted in the preceding paragraph. The Committee does not consider that that passage conveys legal advice, nor is there any part of the email chain which seeks legal advice. Nor is the claim to settlement privilege in respect of R-100 easy to accept, as the email chain records positions taken by Ingeominas and does not set out confidential details about the negotiating position of Glencore and Prodeco.\n\n364.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is perhaps surprising that the Tribunal did not subject to closer scrutiny the claim to legal privilege for the other five Annex A documents in respect of which that privilege was claimed. Whether the failure to do so amounted to a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, however, is more debatable. In the end, the Committee considers that it is unnecessary to take a decision on that question, because it has concluded that, even if there was such a departure, it was not a serious one because Colombia has not shown that the exclusion of those five documents could have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\n\n365.\n\nThere are two reasons for that conclusion. First, the allegation that Glencore and Prodeco obtained Mr Ballesteros's agreement to the Eighth Amendment by corruption turns, as the President of the Tribunal pointed out at the hearing, on the establishment of a link between the payment to Mr Maldonado and Mr Garcia for the 3-hectare concession and the acts of Mr Ballesteros. When this issue was discussed at the hearing, counsel for Colombia, who had seen all of the documents for which privilege was claimed, only put forward R-100 as proof of that link. The transcript records him as accepting that this was the only document which went to that issue (see para. 154, above). Document R-100 was then admitted, put to Mr Nagle in cross-examination, and considered at length by the Tribunal (see paras. 184 to 185, above). The Tribunal's conclusion was that it did not establish that there had been corruption. Since Document R-100 was the document which Colombia considered was the evidence of the link between the 3-hectare payment and the decision by Mr Ballesteros, there is no basis on which the Committee could conclude that this link could have been established by the other five Annex A documents for which Glencore and Prodeco claimed legal privilege.\n\n366.\n\nColombia complains that the Tribunal failed properly to analyse R-100 and the testimony of Mr Nagle. However, a tribunal's assessment of the evidence can seldom, if ever, justify annulment of an award. The Tribunal considered the documentary evidence in detail and it had the benefit (which the Committee has not had) of seeing and hearing Mr Nagle's testimony under cross-examination. The Committee does not accept that the Tribunal erred in its assessment of that evidence but, even if it had done so, the error would not have been ground for annulment.\n\n367.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal concluded (see para. 183, above) that the fact that there had been no prosecution of Prodeco or any of its officials and that no formal criminal investigation into them had even been opened confirmed its finding that corruption had not been established. That is particularly important, because the body responsible for opening such a formal investigation, the FGN, had been in possession of all the Disputed SIC Documents since September 2017. This point was put to counsel for Colombia at the hearing and his reply was that \"[a]*n investigation takes time*\".582 The Committee has sympathy with this observation. Nevertheless the fact remains that a public prosecutor, possessed of documents which Colombia maintains constitute clear evidence of corruption, had not even opened a formal investigation into the company accused of that corruption eight months after it came into possession of those documents.\n\nTribunal Tr., Day 2, p. 364:17-18 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n368.\n\nThe importance of this consideration is reinforced by the letter which Colombia addressed to the Committee on 9 September 2020. In that letter, Colombia informed the Committee that \"*pursuant to the criminal complaint filed by the ANDJE in September 2017 \u2026 concerning the events surrounding the execution of the Eighth Amendment to the Mining Contract between Ingeominas and Prodeco*\", the FGN had \"*formally indicted two former Ingeominas civil servants, Mr. Mario Ballesteros and Mr. Fernando Ceballos Arrollave, with the charge of undue interest in the execution of a contract*\". That indictment was made in August 2020, i.e. almost three years after the ANDJE had given the FGN the Disputed SIC Documents. There had been no prosecution or even formal investigation of Prodeco or its officials and Colombia accepts that the charges against Mr Ballesteros and Mr Ceballos are broader than allegations relating to the 3-hectare contract.583\n\nTr. p. 176:16-19 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n369.\n\nLike the Tribunal, the Committee recognizes that the standard of proof in a criminal case is different from that in an international arbitration. Nevertheless, the absence of any action against Prodeco or any of its officials (past or present) based upon the Disputed SIC Documents suggests that those documents are not the evidence of corruption on the part of Prodeco which Colombia contends.\n\n370.\n\nMoreover, these two considerations have to be evaluated in the context of the Tribunal's findings regarding the repeated complaints by Prodeco about the grant of the 3-hectare concession to Messrs Maldonado and Garc\u00eda, the fact that the payment was made openly to them after deduction of tax and declared by Prodeco and the statement by the Minister which suggested a different explanation of the 3-hectare transaction. In light of all of these factors, the Committee concludes that it has not been established that, had the Tribunal handled the question of privilege differently, the outcome of the case could have been different.\n\n371.\n\nOne further matter needs brief attention. Before the Committee, Colombia raises the argument that privilege does not apply where a party communicates with its lawyer with regard to a future criminal act in which the lawyer is complicit.584 Colombia suggests that this was an additional reason why the Tribunal should have rejected, or at least scrutinised more carefully, the claim of privilege. However, the argument does not appear to have been raised before the Tribunal and does not feature in the relevant columns of Annex A. It cannot therefore constitute a basis on which the Award could be annulled.\n\nReply on Ann., para. 35, note 46, citing the decision of the United States Supreme Court in *United States v. Zoilin*, 491 U.S. 554, 21 June 1989 (**AAL-101**). See also Tr. pp. 170-172 (Mr Garc\u00eda Represa).\n\n372.\n\nThe Committee thus concludes that the Tribunal's handling of the privilege claim in respect of the Annex A documents did not entail a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Since the Tribunal had the power to regulate the procedure before it and the admissibility of evidence, in the absence of such a serious departure, the Tribunal cannot be said manifestly to have exceeded its powers.\n\n373.\n\nTurning to the question of whether the Tribunal should have taken a different approach to the issue of responsiveness, the Committee notes that it is normally left to each party in an arbitration to determine which documents in its possession are or are not responsive to a request for production. It is rare for such decisions to be subjected to the scrutiny of the tribunal.\n\n374.\n\nIn the present case, Annex A contained very little on the issue of responsiveness. In each instance, Colombia merely asserted that the document was responsive and indicated the request to which it was said to be responsive as those requests had been set out during the document production phase which led up to PO3. Those requests had, however, been narrowed down by the Tribunal in PO3, so the issue was whether they were responsive to the requests as thus refined. Colombia maintained that:\n\n*When preparing its request for production of documents, Colombia was already aware of the existence of categories of documents (such as the Disputed Documents) that were material and relevant for its case and, thus, framed its requests in such a manner as to cover such Documents.*585\n\nAs it has already said, with regard to the documents for which privilege was claimed (see para. 359, above), to attach decisive weight to the fact that the Annex A Documents had already been seen by Colombia would defeat the purpose of PO2.\n\nColombia's letter of 11 May 2018, note 193, above, at p. 4 (**AAE-12**).\n\n375.\n\nMoreover, Colombia made no attempt to show how the documents which it sought fell within the scope of the requests as they had been narrowed by the Tribunal in PO3. For example, in PO3 the Tribunal narrowed Request No. 12 to:\n\n*Documents prepared and/or reviewed by Management between 23/03/2008 and 25/01/2010 for use in discussions with Ingeominas in support of Prodeco's proposals to amend the Mining Contract, including calculations, scenarios, or economic models.*586\n\nYet Colombia's description of documents R-121 and R-122, which it maintained were responsive to Request No. 12, spoke of them as accounts by Ms Anaya of conversations with Mr Espinosa (an adviser to Ingeominas).\n\nTribunal's Procedural Order No. 3, 4 January 2018, Annex B, p. 28 (**AAE-36**).\n\n376.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Committee considers entirely understandable the Tribunal's decision that:\n\n*Claimants' counsel has made its assessment of the responsiveness \u2026 of the Excluded Documents. Respondent has not provided sufficient grounds to make the Tribunal doubt the correctness or good faith of that assessment.*587\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at para. 113 (**AAE-10**).\n\n377.\n\nIn addition, the considerations set out in paras. 365 -370, above, are also applicable here. The Committee thus rejects the arguments that the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure or a manifest excess of power in its approach to the responsiveness question.\n\n***(4) Procedural Order No. 6: The Exclusion of the FGN Documents***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nThe Tribunal's letter of 18 May 2018 and PO6 also rejected Colombia's request to introduce into the record the documents held by the FGN which had been \"*filtered*\" by Mr Enciso. These FGN Documents were all taken from the Disputed SIC Documents and overlapped with the Annex A Documents but did not include everything which appeared in Annex A while including documents which were not part of Annex A. The Tribunal declined Colombia's request on the ground that the FGN Documents had not been marshalled in the course of investigative or prosecutorial activities as required by PO2.\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal distinguished between several different phases of criminal proceedings under Colombian law: the initial *Indagaci\u00f3n* in which the FGN investigates the facts which have come to its attention by a complaint; the *Investigaci\u00f3n*, which begins with a formal *imputaci\u00f3n* or indictment, and the *Juicio* of three successive hearings leading to a final judgment.588 The Tribunal held that:\n\n*\u2026 the criminal proceeding launched by ANDJE's Complaint is still in the preliminary stage, and the FGN Documents are not part of a formal* acusaci\u00f3n *in a Colombian criminal court proceeding. The Complaint has \u2013 as far as the Tribunal is aware \u2013 not passed the First Phase,* Indagaci\u00f3n*, and has not resulted in any indictment, which would eventually trigger the Second Phase:* Investigaci\u00f3n *\u2026*589\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at paras. 53-55 (**AAE-10**).\n\nPO6, note 73, above, at para. 104 (**AAE-10**).\n\n380.\n\nColombia objects that the requirement that the FGN's inquiry must have proceeded to a later stage had not been mentioned in PO2. However, in PO2 the Tribunal made clear that it had not yet been fully briefed on the issue of incorporation into the record of documents marshalled in a criminal investigation. The Committee considers that it was clear that the Tribunal intended to reach a decision only after full briefing.\n\n381.\n\nColombia also emphasizes the status of the FGN as an independent prosecuting authority under Colombian law. The Committee accepts that the FGN has that status and does not see anything in the Award or PO6 which is inconsistent with an acceptance of that status. However, the fact that the FGN is an independent authority does not alter the fact that its inquiries had not progressed beyond the most preliminary stage.\n\n382.\n\nThe Committee can see nothing which begins to approach the level of annullable error in the Tribunal's handling of the FGN Documents. It heard argument from both Parties and gave full reasons for its decision. Its conclusion that, since the FGN proceedings had not progressed beyond the receipt by the FGN of the complaint from the ANDJE which was accompanied by the Disputed SIC Documents, to admit the Documents would effectively circumvent PO2 appears to the Committee entirely reasonable. The Committee has already held that the decision of the Tribunal in PO2 not to admit documents which the ANDJE possessed simply because they had been obtained by the SIC for a different purpose through the use of State powers was neither a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure nor a manifest excess of power. It is therefore axiomatic that declining to admit the same documents merely on the ground that the ANDJE had passed them to the FGN is likewise perfectly defensible.\n\n***(5) The Cumulative Effect of the Tribunal's Document Decisions***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nBefore reaching a definitive conclusion on the documents issue, the Committee considers that it is necessary to stand back and look at the overall picture of the Tribunal's handling of the dispute over whether documents initially seized by the SIC should have been admitted into the record.\n\n384.\n\nSince this is an annulment proceeding, the Committee cannot substitute its own discretion for that of the Tribunal. All the Committee has to \u2013 or can \u2013 decide is whether:\n\n(1) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by excluding the documents;\n\n(2) The Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by doing so; and\n\n(3) The Tribunal failed adequately to state reasons for its decisions.\n\n385.\n\nThe third question \u2013 whether the Tribunal failed adequately to state its reasons \u2013 is easy to answer. The Committee finds that, at each stage in the proceedings, the Tribunal gave reasons for its decision which enabled the reader to understand what was being decided and which were not contradictory, incoherent or frivolous.\n\n386.\n\nThe first and second questions are linked in that, on the facts of this case, unless the Tribunal was guilty of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, its conduct would not have been a manifest excess of power. The Committee considers that the Tribunal's rulings on general issues of law \u2013 namely, whether a respondent is entitled to rely on documents obtained for another purpose by the use of State coercive powers, whether communications with in-house counsel are covered by legal privilege, and whether documents should been admitted on the basis that they had been given to an independent prosecutor \u2013 contravene no fundamental rule of procedure and involve no excess of power.\n\n387.\n\nThe only issue which remains, therefore, is whether the way in which the Tribunal gave effect to those decisions, which resulted in the exclusion from the record of most of the Disputed SIC Documents, entailed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Committee has concluded that it did not do so. While Colombia complains that its right of defence was seriously handicapped by the exclusion which deprived it of the evidence which would have proved the existence of corruption on the part of Glencore and Prodeco, the fact remains that the document on which Colombia placed greatest emphasis was admitted into the record and failed to convince the Tribunal of the truth of Colombia's allegations. In addition, the remaining documents have, after a lapse of three years, led to no proceedings against Glencore, Prodeco or any of their officials.\n\n388.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee dismisses the application for annulment insofar as it is based on the decisions to exclude documents from the record.\n\n**VII. THE ILLEGALITY ISSUE**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **P****ositions of the** **P****arties**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) Colombia***\n------------------\n\n389.\n\nAs an alternative and additional line of argument, Colombia submits that the Award should be annulled on the basis of the illegality of the alleged investment. It raises this line of argument as applicable even if the Tribunal's decisions in PO2, PO4 and PO6 are assumed to have been irreproachable.590 Indeed, Colombia submits that the evidence which *was* ultimately included in the record of the case \u2013 if understood \"*in accordance with the necessary inferences to be drawn*\" \u2013 was sufficient to compel the conclusion that Glencore and Prodeco's investment was tainted by illegalities and that the Tribunal accordingly lacked jurisdiction over the dispute.591 Instead, the Tribunal reached the opposite conclusion in a decision which Colombia argues gives rise to two grounds for annulment: on the one hand, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power by exercising jurisdiction in circumstances where it had none; and, on the other hand, the Tribunal's findings of fact were so egregious and irrational as to constitute a failure to state reasons and a manifest excess of power.592\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 345.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 348.\n\nTr. p. 71:16-21 (Professor Silva Romero); Mem. on Ann., para. 349.\n\n390.\n\nColombia interprets Articles 2 and 4(1) of the BIT as circumscribing its consent to arbitrate so as to exclude any investment not made in accordance with the laws and regulations of Colombia.593 Colombia argues that this interpretation, whether or not based on the explicit language of the BIT, is consistent with the general consensus in international law that tribunals \"*cannot exercise their jurisdiction over illegal, illicit, or improperly acquired investments*\".594 Colombia therefore maintains that a tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over an illegally obtained investment would constitute an obvious excess of its powers.595 In addition, in circumstances where a tribunal's excess of jurisdiction is manifest, an annullable error would be established.596\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 352.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 353.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 354.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 354.\n\n391.\n\nFor these reasons Colombia asserts that the Committee must conduct a \"*searching analysis*\" of whether or not Glencore and Prodeco's investment was tainted by illegality, thereby depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction.597 Moreover, Colombia adds, such an analysis must lead to the conclusion that the alleged investment was illegally obtained.598 On the one hand, Colombia maintains that the evidence on the record was sufficient for the Tribunal to have drawn the \"*appropriate inference*\" that the Eighth Amendment was tainted by corruption.599 On the other hand, Colombia argues that the evidence shows that the Eighth Amendment was secured on the basis of fraudulent misrepresentations made by Prodeco.600\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 355.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 355.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 358.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 379; Reply on Ann., para. 293.\n\n392.\n\nIn this context, Colombia refers to the \"*highly suspicious*\" facts surrounding the sale of the 3ha plot. Colombia asserts that the inflated price of the land, the timing of its sale and the identity of the parties to that contract were an \"*obvious* indicium *of corruption*\".601 In addition, Colombia claims that the ultimate production of exhibit R-100 at the oral hearing placed a \"*veritable smoking gun*\" before the Tribunal.602 Colombia refers to that document to show that Prodeco's CEO had \"*explained \u2013 even bragged*\" that Mr Ballesteros' favourable treatment of Prodeco had been obtained as a result of the 3ha transaction.603 Colombia does not accept the alternative explanation that Mr Nagle offered for the content of his email, submitting that his testimony to this effect was \"*preposterous*\" and maintains that the contents of the email \"*cannot be explained without raising further questions and doubts*\" as to the legality of the Eighth Amendment.604\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 357-600.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 358-359.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 359.\n\nTr. pp. 72:22-73:2 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n393.\n\nIn the face of this evidence, and in keeping with the established investment law approach to cases where at least a *prima facie* case for corruption is established, Colombia maintains that the Tribunal ought to have dispensed with the burden of proof on Colombia to establish its corruption allegations. It not only declined to do so in the circumstances of this case, Colombia complains, but also refused to draw any adverse inference against Glencore and Prodeco as a result of their failure to produce the Disputed SIC Documents despite Colombia's \"*herculean efforts*\" to marshal them into the record.605 Colombia claims that the Tribunal thereby erected an \"*insurmountable presumption against*\" the presence of corruption, ultimately resulting in its erroneous exercise of jurisdiction over Glencore and Prodeco's illegal investment.606\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 363.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 360, 364.\n\n394.\n\nColombia also points to Prodeco's internal reports as evidence that Glencore and Prodeco deliberately, and in bad faith, withheld geological, technical, and pricing information from Ingeominas and manipulated the data that it relied on to justify the \"*purported economic necessity*\" of the Eighth Amendment.607 These documents, according to Colombia, prove that Prodeco's true assessment was that the Eighth Amendment was not in fact necessary for an increase in production at the Calenturitas Mine to have been feasible.608 That assessment, Colombia argues, stands in \"*stark contrast*\" to what Prodeco told Ingeominas during their negotiations toward the conclusion of the Eighth Amendment.609 Colombia adds that Glencore and Prodeco have yet to address these inconsistencies, and have not explained \"*how and why*\" Colombia would have agreed to the Eighth Amendment without having been convinced of the economic need for it.610\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 379; Reply on Ann., para. 293.\n\nTr. p. 74:3-6 (Professor Silva Romero); Mem. on Ann., para. 379, note 494, referring to NPV Calculation Summary - 2008 Life of Mine Plans June Schedules (G&P0001160) of October 2009, NPV Summary Tab (**R-305.1**); Xstrata plc, Circular and Notice of Extraordinary Meeting of 2 February 2009, p. 32 (**R-303**) (\"*An expansion of production of export thermal coal to 12 Mtpa is planned to be completed by 2013.* [...] *This may increase production to approximately 14 Mtpa.*\"); and Colombia's Opening Statement before the Tribunal, slides 48, 52, 53 (**AAE-14**).\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 379; Reply on Ann., para. 293.\n\nColombia's Opening Statement before the Committee, note 391, above, slide 95 (**AAE-38**); Tr. p. 74:11-12, 23-25 (Professor Silva Romero).\n\n395.\n\nColombia argues that the Tribunal egregiously, irrationally, and incoherently disregarded key *indicia* of the illegality before it. It maintains this position in regard to both its allegation of the \"*obvious corruption*\" underlying the investment, as well as its allegation of Prodeco's bad faith conduct and misrepresentations made to secure the Eighth Amendment.611\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 367-368.\n\n396.\n\nFirst, concerning Glencore and Prodeco's alleged corrupting of Mr Ballesteros, Colombia argues that the Tribunal either totally \"*elided*\" or simply \"*brushed over*\" several red flags of corruption.612 Colombia argues, for example, that the Tribunal refused properly to analyse the allegations made by \"*multiple*\" Ingeominas civil servants that Mr Ballesteros had exercised \"*undue pressure*\" to secure their agreement to the Eighth Amendment.613 Colombia submits further that the Tribunal \"*turned a blind eye to corruption*\" by accepting Mr Nagle's \"*highly implausible explanations*\" of the content of exhibit R-100, despite the fact that \"*many of these explanations consisted themselves in admissions of influence peddling*\". Indeed, Colombia submits, Mr Nagle conceded that Prodeco had \"*yield[ed] to the greenmail*\".614\n\nMem. on Ann, paras. 369-382.\n\nMem. on Ann., paras. 369-370.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 373.\n\n397.\n\nSecondly, Colombia maintains that the Tribunal failed rationally to analyse many key facts relating to Glencore and Prodeco's bad faith and *dolo* in obtaining the Eighth Amendment by fraudulent misrepresentations.615 According to Colombia, the Tribunal \"*ignored*\" clear evidence of illegality, such as Mr Nagle's admission that Prodeco had made \"*gross omissions during negotiations*\".616 Additionally, Colombia submits that the Tribunal relied on facts that were \"*patently false, and knowingly so*\" in order to reach the conclusion that Prodeco had not acted in bad faith during negotiations.617\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 376.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 377.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 381.\n\n398.\n\nThis approach to the evidence led the Tribunal to a manifest excess of power by asserting jurisdiction despite what Colombia maintains was the illegality of the investment. In addition, Colombia contends that the Tribunal's explanation of its decision was so flawed as to involve a failure to state reasons.\n\n***(2) Glencore and Prodeco***\n------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nGlencore and Prodeco do not agree that the Tribunal mistreated the evidence of corruption and misrepresentation raised by Colombia.618 They characterise Colombia's Application in this respect as an attempt to relitigate its allegations of fact, and assert that that type of enquiry is not permissible under the ICSID Convention annulment regime.619 Annulment proceedings, Glencore and Prodeco submit, \"*are not intended as vehicles to revisit*\" a tribunal's findings of fact.620\n\nRej. on Ann., para. 89.\n\nC-Mem. on Ann., para. 101; Tr. pp. 78:16-79:13 (Mr Blackaby).\n\nTr. p. 78:14-18 (Mr Blackaby).\n\n400.\n\nNevertheless, Glencore and Prodeco add that the Tribunal's finding of fact were absolutely correct and Colombia's allegation of corruption was \"*fanciful*\" and \"*opportunistic*\".621 This, they argue, is confirmed by the fact that Colombia itself has taken no domestic prosecutorial action against Prodeco in respect of allegations of corruption raised for the first time only once the arbitration had commenced \u2013 some seven years after the alleged corruption took place.622\n\nTr. pp. 78:14-15, 79:4-7, 80:14-15 (Mr Blackaby).\n\nTr. p. 80:16-24 (Mr Blackaby).\n\n401.\n\nResponding to the assertion that the Tribunal failed to state reasons, Glencore and Prodeco argue that Colombia's allegations of corruption or misrepresentation were \"*thoughtfully and comprehensively*\" addressed by the Tribunal.623 They recall the applicable standard, requiring that the Tribunal's assessment would have to be \"*so irrational that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to the same conclusion*\", and argue that no objective observer could conclude that that standard was met by the Tribunal's treatment of the evidence in this case.624\n\nRej. on Ann., para. 89; C-Mem. on Ann., para. 131.\n\nRej. on Ann., para. 89.\n\n**B. T****he** **A****nalysis of the** **C****ommittee**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nThe Committee considers it necessary to begin with three preliminary observations. First, Colombia states that it advances its case on the Illegality Issue as one which is wholly independent of the Documents Issue. As Colombia puts it, even if the Committee does not annul the Award on account of the exclusion of the illegality documents, \"[b]*ased on the facts on the record, understood in accordance with the necessary inferences to be drawn, the Tribunal should have reached the conclusion that Claimants' purported investment was tainted by corruption and other illegalities and declined jurisdiction*\".625\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 348.\n\n403.\n\nAt times, however, Colombia loses sight of the distinction between the two issues and seeks to boost its case on the Illegality Issue by relying on what it perceives as the Tribunal's wrongful decision to exclude documents.626 Colombia cannot, however, repackage its case on the documents in this way. Since Colombia has advanced its case on the Illegality Issue on the basis that the Award should be annulled because the Tribunal reached the wrong conclusion on a jurisdictional issue on the record before it, the Committee must assess this part of Colombia's case on the basis of that record alone. This part of Colombia's case for annulment cannot be strengthened by allusions to documents which did not form part of that record.\n\nSee, e.g., Reply on Ann., paras. 294-295.\n\n404.\n\nSecondly, Colombia's case for annulment on the Illegality Issue is advanced in two ways:\n\n(a) that there was a manifest excess of power when the Tribunal assumed jurisdiction, since the Tribunal had no jurisdiction unless the investment had been made in accordance with Colombian law; and\n\n(b) that \"*the Tribunal failed to state reasons and manifestly exceeded its powers by reaching egregious and irrational findings of fact*\".627\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 349.\n\n405.\n\nIn practice, however, these two arguments are inseparable. There is no dispute that, if the Eighth Amendment had been obtained unlawfully, the investment would have fallen outside the scope of Article 2 of the BIT and the Tribunal would therefore have lacked jurisdiction. That was expressly accepted by the Tribunal628 and is not contested by Glencore and Prodeco. Nor is there any dispute about what, as a matter of law, would render the investment illegal. The dispute is rather one of fact \u2013 was the Tribunal entitled, on the evidence before it, to reach the conclusion that the investment had not been illegally obtained? Colombia's first argument, that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by asserting jurisdiction, is thus dependent on its second argument, that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by reaching \"*egregious and irrational findings of fact*\".\n\nAward, paras. 665, 825.\n\n406.\n\nThirdly, it is important in this context to be particularly clear about the nature and extent of the Committee's powers. Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention permits an *ad hoc* committee to annul an award only for a *manifest* excess of power. The Committee shares the view of the *ad hoc* committee in *Duke Energy*:\n\n*An* ad hoc *committee will not therefore annul an award if the tribunal's disposition on a question of law is tenable, even if the committee considers that it is incorrect as a matter of law. The existence of a manifest excess of powers can only be assessed by an ad hoc committee in consideration of the factual and legal elements upon which the arbitral tribunal founded its decision and/or award based on the parties' submissions. Without reopening debates on questions of fact, a committee can take into account the facts of the case as they were in the record before the tribunal to check whether it could come to its solution, however debatable. Is the opinion of the tribunal so untenable that it cannot be supported by reasonable arguments? A debatable solution is not amenable to annulment, since the excess of powers would not then be \"manifest\".*629\n\n*Duke*, note 303, above, at para. 99 (**AAL-14**).\n\n407.\n\nIn support of its argument that the Committee must conduct a searching examination of the evidence, Colombia cites the reference in paragraph 158 of the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Caratube* to errors of fact which are egregious and weighing of evidence which is irrational. However, that paragraph needs to be quoted in full:\n\n*Factual findings and weighing of evidence made by a tribunal are outside the powers of review of an annulment committee, except if the applicant can prove that the errors of fact are so egregious, or the weighing of evidence so irrational, as to constitute an independent cause for annulment. The respect for tribunals' factual findings is normally justified because it is the tribunal who controlled the marshalling of evidence, and had the opportunity of directly examining witnesses and experts.*630\n\nMoreover, it is important to note that the *Caratube* committee, in declining to annul the award in that case, referred to the fact that \"*the Tribunal carefully analyzed and weighed the available evidence, and explained in some detail the reasons for its findings*\".631\n\n*Caratube*, note 308, above, at para. 158 (**RL-184**).\n\n*Caratube*, note 308, above, at para. 159 (**RL-184**).\n\n408.\n\nThe Committee agrees with this analysis. It is not enough that the Tribunal's findings of fact and weighing of the evidence are open to debate. For the Award to be annullable on the ground of manifest excess of power, the finding that the investment had not been unlawfully obtained must have been so egregious that it was one which no reasonable tribunal could have reached.\n\n409.\n\nThe Committee considers that Colombia has failed to cross this threshold. The Tribunal carefully analysed the evidence in the record relating to the allegation of corruption632 and that relating to the allegation of bad faith.633 The Committee can find no flaw in that analysis, let alone an annullable error. Colombia disagrees with the Tribunal's conclusions regarding Document R-100 and the evidence of Mr Nagle but the Committee considers that the Tribunal was perfectly entitled to reach the conclusions which it did and which it painstakingly set out and explained in the Award. The Tribunal carefully examined all of the \"*red flags*\" in respect of both corruption and bad faith and weighed all of the evidence in the record before concluding that the totality of the evidence did not justify a finding of either corruption or bad faith.\n\nAward, paras. 596-747.\n\nAward, paras. 751-858.\n\n410.\n\nLike the *Caratube* tribunal, the Tribunal explained in detail the reasons for its findings. That detail is frequently not reflected in Colombia's critique. For example, Colombia maintains:\n\n*\u2026 the Tribunal flouted a further patent* indicium *of corruption: the exorbitant sum of USD 1.75 million paid by Claimants for the infamous 3ha Contract. Despite the exclusion of the Illegality Documents, this extravagant and inexplicable expenditure should have been analysed in depth and ascribed great weight, rather than cast aside. Instead, the Tribunal reached the bizarre conclusion that, because the money was paid into Colombian accounts, and not into a shell company located in a tax haven, the activities must have been above board.*634\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 374.\n\n411.\n\nBut the Tribunal did analyse this issue in depth and it was not \"*cast aside*\". On the contrary, the Tribunal devoted a substantial part of its award to analysing the payment, its size and circumstances.635 Nor did it find that the sum paid did not indicate corruption merely because \"*the money was paid into Colombian accounts, and not into a shell company located in a tax haven*\".636 What the Tribunal emphasized was the fact that Glencore and Prodeco had been open about the payment. In addition to the fact that they had not sought to conceal it by using an offshore account, the Tribunal also pointed to the fact that they had withheld tax, declared the payment in their accounts, declared it to Ingeominas and had continued to complain (without receiving any answer from the various agencies of the Colombian Government to whom those complaints were addressed) about what they saw as \"*greenmail*\".\n\nSee, especially, Award, paras. 611-626.\n\nMem. on Ann., para. 374.\n\n412.\n\nColombia argues that, faced with allegations of corruption, the Tribunal was wrong to insist that the burden of proof was on Colombia. In support, Colombia cites the discussion by Dr Betz of the award in *Spentex v. Uzbekistan*, in which she commented:\n\n*The Tribunal noted that issues of bribery are notoriously difficult to prove in arbitration and that 'there is an inherent danger to dispose of the problem by resorting to strict evidentiary rules that may make proving or disproving corruption practically impossible'. It found that the traditional rule of each party having to prove the facts on which it relied coupled with a heightened standard of proof of 'clear and convincing evidence' made it almost impossible for a party to prove bribery.*637\n\nK. Betz, *Proving Bribery, Fraud and Money Laundering in International Arbitration*, Cambridge University Press, 2017, p. 131 (**RL-149**).\n\n413.\n\nBut the Tribunal in the present case did not rest its conclusions on the burden of proof but on an analysis of the whole of the record before it. Moreover, it is worth noting that Dr Betz continued (immediately after the passage quoted above):\n\n*But it also noted that shifting the burden of proof once a party had produced some corruption indications and then demanding '\"clear and convincing evidence\" for the absence of corruption from the other party' amounts to a '*probatio diabolica *or* de facto *impossibility to disprove the existence of corruption' for the latter.*\n\n414.\n\nNor is the Committee persuaded that the Tribunal committed an error, still less a manifest excess of power, in not attaching weight to an alleged conflict of interests on the part of a lawyer who, Colombia alleges, advised both Ingeominas and Prodeco, or by not drawing an adverse inference of corruption from the approach taken by Glencore and Prodeco to the issue of document production.\n\n415.\n\nThe Committee thus rejects the application to annul the Award for manifest excess of power. The application based on an alleged failure to state reasons also fails since the Tribunal gave a clear and coherent statement of its reasons which is neither contradictory nor frivolous. Those reasons clearly did not convince Colombia but that is not the test which the Committee has to apply.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n416.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n417.\n\nThis provision, which applies *mutatis mutandis* to annulment proceedings by virtue of Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, gives the Committee discretion to allocate all costs of the annulment, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.638\n\nSee also ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j), applied to annulment proceedings by ICSID Arbitration Rule 53.\n\n418.\n\nThe Committee considers that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, a party which has been wholly unsuccessful in an application for annulment \u2013 as the Applicants in this case have been \u2013 should normally bear the entire costs of the proceedings (including the fees and expenses of its members and the costs of the Centre) and the reasonable costs of the successful party. The Committee can see no exceptional circumstances in the present case which would warrant a different decision.\n\n419.\n\nCosts fall into two categories: (i) the costs of the proceedings themselves, namely the costs incurred by the Centre, and the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee and the Special Assistant to the President; and (ii) the costs of representation incurred by the Parties, together with the expenses which the Parties have incurred.\n\n420.\n\nThe total costs of the proceedings (in US dollars) are as follows:-\n\nICSID Administrative Fees: USD 84,000.00  \nFees and expenses of Members of the Committee:  \nChristopher Greenwood: USD 61,741.05  \nDoug Jones: USD 49,351.92  \nBertha Cooper Rousseau: USD 42,153.15  \nTotal: USD 153,246.12  \nFees and Expenses of the Assistant (Ms Elphick): USD 14,562.50  \nOther Direct expenses: USD 20,775.89  \nTotal: USD 272,584.51\n\n421.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by Colombia, as the Party seeking annulment, in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations. Colombia has advanced a total of USD 527,667.91. Colombia shall bear the entirety of these costs, any sum remaining from the advances will be repaid by ICSID to Colombia.\n\n422.\n\nWith regard to the costs incurred by the Parties for legal representation and associated expenses, the Parties submitted details on 24 November 2020, as follows:\n\nColombia:  \nCosts of representation USD 751,137.97639  \nExpenses USD 1,326.09  \nGlencore and Prodeco:  \nCosts of representation: USD 1,248,680.86  \nExpenses: USD 23,676.32.\n\nThis includes the sum of Colombian pesos 31,739,830 for the costs of the ANDJE personnel involved. This sum is converted into US dollars as USD 8,714.06.\n\n423.\n\nThe Committee considers that Colombia, having been unsuccessful in its application to annul the Award should reimburse Glencore and Prodeco for the costs of representation and expenses which they have incurred. The Committee notes, however, that Glencore and Prodeco's costs of representation are significantly greater than those of Colombia. Both Parties were represented by major international law firms. The Committee can see no reason why Glencore and Prodeco should have incurred costs which were more than half as much again as those incurred by Colombia. In these circumstances, it considers that it is equitable to award Glencore and Prodeco a sum of USD 1,000,000.00 in respect of costs and expenses.\n\n**IX. DISPOSITIF**\n------------------\n\n424.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Committee decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Application for Annulment of the Award of 23 December 2019 is dismissed in its entirety. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3), the stay of enforcement of the Award automatically terminates with effect from the date of the present Decision;\n\n(2) Colombia shall bear the entire costs of the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee and of the Assistant, in the amount of USD 272,584.51;\n\n(3) Colombia shall, within sixty days of the date of dispatch of this Decision, pay to Glencore and Prodeco the sum of USD 1,000,000.00 in respect of the latter's costs of representation and expenses."}]}
