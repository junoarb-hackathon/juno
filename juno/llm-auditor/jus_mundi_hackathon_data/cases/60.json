PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural calendar set out in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1 dated 30 November 2017 (\"**Procedural Order No. 1**\"):\n\n(a) On 18 April 2018, the Respondent filed a request to address the objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question (the \"**Request for Bifurcation**\"); and\n\n(b) On 18 May 2018, the Claimant filed its observations on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation (\"**Claimant\u2019s Observations**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 4 June 2018, the Parties were advised that the Tribunal was inclined to join the jurisdictional objections to the merits, and that the majority of the Tribunal had been discussing whether the most efficient conduct of the proceeding could lead it to bifurcate the quantum phase and accordingly sought the Parties\u2019 views by 15 June 2018.\n\n3.\n\nOn 15 June 2018, both Parties provided their views as requested.\n\n4.\n\nOn 20 June 2018, the Respondent sent an email containing its further views on the Claimant\u2019s letter of 15 June 2018.\n\n5.\n\nOn 20 June 2018, the Parties were advised that the Tribunal did not wish to receive unsolicited communications in the future but, to ensure equality of arms, the Claimant was invited to respond briefly to the Respondent\u2019s further communication by 22 June 2018.\n\n6.\n\nOn 22 June 2018, the Claimant provided its response to the Respondent\u2019s unsolicited email.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent in its Request for Bifurcation argues that the Tribunal has the discretionary authority to decide jurisdictional issues as a preliminary question pursuant to Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41(1), (3) and (4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules as well as pursuant to Article 829 of the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement (\"**FTA**\"). The Claimant did not dispute this.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent argues that pursuant to the terms of Article 829(2) of the FTA there is a presumption in favour of bifurcation. The Respondent further states that it is a basic tenet of public international law that \"*a State is not obliged to give an account of itself on issues of merits before an international tribunal which lacks jurisdiction or whose jurisdiction has not yet been established*\"1 and accordingly bifurcation not only ensures procedural economy and efficiency, but it also is an effective tool to uphold these fundamental rules of the settlement of international disputes.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 9 (citing T. D. Gill (ed), Rosenne\u2019s *The World Court, What it is and how it works* (2003) (RL-26), p.81 (internal quotations omitted)).\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the applicable test to be applied is that in *Philip Morris v. Australia*.2 This test requires the Tribunal to determine whether the jurisdictional objections at issue: (i) were *prima facie* serious and substantial; (ii) could be examined without prejudging or entering into merits; and (iii) if successful, disposed of all or an essential part of the claims. The only difference between the Parties\u2019 positions with respect to the applicable test is that whilst the Respondent asserts that the first limb of the test merely requires showing that the objections are not frivolous nor vexatious,3 the Claimant asserts that the hurdle is higher, in that the objection must be \"*sufficiently serious and substantial as to justify bifurcation*\".4\n\n*Id*., paras. 13 *et seq.* (citing *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. The Commonwealth of Australia*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 8, Bifurcation of the Procedure, dated 14 April 2014 (\"***Philip Morris v. Australia***\") (RL-15), para. 109).\n\n*Id*., para. 14 (citing *Resolute Forest Products Inc. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Procedural Order No. 4, Decision on Bifurcation dated 18 November 2016 (RL-22), para. 4.4).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, para. 139 (citing *Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Limited v. Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 201639, Procedural Order No. 2, Decision on Bifurcation, dated 31 January 2018 (RL-25), para. 42 (emphasis omitted)).\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent makes the following jurisdictional objections. Firstly, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has not complied with the mandatory conditions precedent set out in Article 821 of the FTA. The Respondent lists four such failures by the Claimant and concludes that the Parties have accordingly not perfected their consent to submit the dispute to arbitration with the consequence that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.\n\n11.\n\nThe first failure asserted by the Respondent is that the Claimant has failed to deliver a written notice of intent (\"**NoI**\") stating the legal and factual basis for the claim, including the measures at issue. The Respondent notes that the measures forming the basis of the Request for Arbitration and detailed in its Memorial differ from those referred in the NoI. The Respondent further notes that some measures detailed in the Claimant\u2019s first Memorial were only adopted by the Respondent after the submission of the claim to arbitration.\n\n12.\n\nThe second failure asserted by the Respondent is the Claimant\u2019s failure to comply with the mandatory six-month cooling-off period contained in Articles 821(2)(b) and (c) of the FTA. The Request for Arbitration was received by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 8 December 2016 but only the first measure giving rise to the dispute had come into effect over six months before this date.\n\n13.\n\nThe third failure asserted by the Respondent is that the Claimant failed to comply with the FTA\u2019s waiver requirements pursuant to Article 821(2)(e)(ii) of the FTA. In its view, the Claimant\u2019s waiver did not refer to any of the measures detailed in the NoI, Request for Arbitration or Memorial, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s obligations under the FTA. Accordingly, the Respondent argues that the waiver did not unequivocally reflect the Claimant\u2019s intention of withdrawing its right to initiate or continue domestic proceedings with respect to the measures at issue in the arbitration. In any event, the Respondent argues that the waiver cannot be effective with respect to measures which came into force after the submission of the dispute to arbitration.\n\n14.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant did not comply with the mandatory time limitations contained in Article 821(2)(e)(i) as more than 39 months have passed from the date on which the Claimant acquired knowledge both of the measures allegedly in violation of the FTA and of the loss or damage resulting therefrom.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s failure to comply with the above four conditions precedent is *prima facie* serious and substantial as such failure nullifies the Parties\u2019 consent to arbitration under the FTA. The Respondent further asserts that this objection is not entwined with the merits of the dispute and can be determined without prejudging the merits. Finally, the Respondent argues that the objection is capable of disposing of the entire case because it means that the Parties have not perfected their consent to arbitration.\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s second objection is that the claims are outside the jurisdiction *ratione temporis* of the Tribunal because, it submits, the dispute arose prior to the entry into force of the FTA. The Respondent first asserts that the ban on mining activities in *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems was put in place by laws and regulations which predate the FTA\u2019s entry into force in August 2011 and further that the Ministry of Environment specifically directed the Claimant not to conduct mining activities in the relevant area nearly 16 months before the substantive protections of the FTA would begin to cover the Claimant\u2019s investments.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this objection is serious and substantial as the chronological record speaks for itself, and can be examined without prejudging the merits. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal would only need to assess whether the dispute existed before the FTA entered into force and is capable of disposing of the whole case. If successful, the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* under the FTA to hear the claim as it concerns facts and acts taking place prior to the entry into force of the FTA.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s third objection is that the Claimant does not meet the definition of Investor under Article 838 of the FTA as a result of the claim being assigned to a U.S. entity, Trexs Investments LLC (\"**Trexs**\") prior to submission of the claim to arbitration pursuant to an investment agreement such that Trexs is the real party in interest in this arbitration. Trexs, being a U.S. entity and not a Canadian entity, is not protected under the FTA.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this objection is serious and substantial as credible evidence exits demonstrating the assignment. It also considers that the objection can be examined without prejudging the merits because it relates to a limited and discrete set of facts, and that it is capable of disposing of the entire case because the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under the FTA to hear claims of a U.S. national under the FTA.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s fourth objection is that it was entitled to and did properly deny the benefits of the FTA to the Claimant pursuant to Article 814(2) of the FTA. The Respondent asserts that it took this action on 15 December 2016 on the basis that the Claimant is owned and controlled by investors of a non-party to the FTA (pursuant to the investment agreement with Trexs) and that it does not have substantial business activities in Canada.\n\n21.\n\nAgain, the Respondent asserts that this objection is serious and substantial as there is credible evidence indicating that the Claimant is owned and controlled by U.S. nationals and has no substantial business activities in Canada, can be examined without prejudging the merits because it concerns a distinct and discrete factual scenario which is completely independent from the merits of the dispute, and is capable of disposing of the entire case.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s fifth objection is that the measures at issue are outside the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Tribunal as concerning measures \"*necessary* [t]*o protect human, animal, or plant life or health*\" and \"[f]*or the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources*\", which are specifically excluded from the scope of the FTA\u2019s investment protections, including recourse to international arbitration pursuant to the provisions of Article 2201(3) of the FTA.5 The Respondent asserts that the effect of this provision is to exclude the application of the provisions of Chapter Eight of the FTA where these would \"*prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing*\" the environmental measures at issue.6 The Respondent asserts that the measures adopted are excluded from the scope of the FTA\u2019s Chapter Eight being (i) necessary; (ii) not constituting arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination; and (iii) not being a disguised restriction on international trade or investment.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 100 (internal quotations omitted).\n\n*Id*., para. 102 (internal quotations omitted).\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the objection is serious and substantial as the measures adopted are intended to protect a legitimate public welfare objective such as the protection of the environment, that it can be examined without prejudging the merits as the analysis for the Tribunal to undertake would relate to the Respondent\u2019s general efforts to protect the *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems and thus would not overlap with the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the measures\u2019 specific effect on the Angostura Project and would be capable of disposing of the entire case.\n\n24.\n\nWith respect to the possibility of bifurcating the quantum phase, the Respondent argues that such bifurcation could result in a reduction of costs and duration of proceedings as the expert evidence filed in support of the quantum is voluminous. Moreover, even if the Tribunal concluded that the Respondent\u2019s actions give rise to liability, it is probable that the scope, complexity and duration of the quantum phase will be significantly reduced as a result of findings made by the Tribunal in the merits phase. The Respondent further submits that there is no overlap between the merits and damages phases such that there would be no procedural efficiency to be gained from hearing the merits and quantum phases together.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant first notes that whilst it agrees with the application of the test in *Philip Morris v. Australia*, bifurcation should only be ordered if it offers the possibility of significant efficiency gains and thus the Tribunal should determine the most procedurally efficient and fair way to conduct the proceeding.\n\n26.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s first objection, the Claimant notes as an overriding point that even if the Respondent\u2019s objections were to be accepted by the Tribunal, they would not dispose of the totality of the Claimant\u2019s claims such that a substantial portion of the case would still proceed to the merits in any event. The Claimant then responds to each of the alleged \"failures\" detailed by the Respondent.\n\n27.\n\nWith respect to the inadequacies in the NoI, citing the *Crystallex* decision,7 the Claimant submits that the later measures (\"**Related Measures**\") are part and parcel of the same dispute which had previously arisen and over which the Tribunal had jurisdiction and that the investor could not be required to re-notify the State in relation to a subsequent measure enacted after submission of the NoI which related to the same subject matter. The Claimant further notes that pursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is empowered to hear \"*incidental*\" and \"*additional*\" claims \"*arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute*\". The Claimant thus submits that as all the measures taken by the Respondent after service of the NoI arise directly out of the same subject matter of the dispute and the measures described in the NoI, there is no failure by it with respect to the content of the NoI.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, para. 18 (citing *Cyrstallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/112, Award dated 4 April 2016 (CL-85), para. 454).\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant adopts the same arguments with respect to the second alleged failure, again noting that the Respondent was aware that a dispute had arisen in respect of the specific subject matter in excess of the six months cooling-off period and had no obligation to renotify the Respondent of any subsequent related measures nor wait any additional cooling-off period.\n\n29.\n\nWith respect to the third alleged failure, the Claimant notes that it provided a waiver almost verbatim with the form required by Article 821(3) (as contained in Annex 821) of the FTA. Accordingly, the Claimant submits that there can be no legitimate complaint from the Respondent. The Claimant indicates that the waiver is valid also with respect to measures that post-date the waiver. Firstly, the Claimant notes that consent was perfected when the Request for Arbitration was submitted with the waiver attached at which time the Parties\u2019 consent to resolve the dispute by ICSID arbitration was perfected. Secondly, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal extends to any additional or incidental claims which concern the same subject matter. For the sake of completeness, the Claimant finally notes that it has complied at all times with the waiver. Accordingly, the Claimant asserts that the objection is frivolous and would not materially reduce the scope of the subsequent phase of the proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant then turns to the fourth alleged failure. The Claimant agrees with the Respondent that the cut-off date to evaluate the timeliness of Eco Oro\u2019s claims pursuant to Article 821(2)(e)(i) of the FTA is 8 September 2013. The Claimant asserts that looking at its claims as currently pleaded, on a *prima facie* basis the Respondent\u2019s breaches arose from measures commencing in 2014 such that, *prima facie,* the claims have been brought in a timely manner. The Claimant further asserts that the events which took place prior to that date did not deprive it of its rights and thus could not form the basis of a claim against the Respondent. Finally, the Claimant asserts that in any event the objection is too intertwined with the merits to justify bifurcation and would fail the second limb of the *Philip Morris v. Australia* test as it would require a substantial and detailed analysis of the facts of all the State measures, a legal assessment of the nature of each measure and an evaluation of the damages or loss caused by each measure.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimant finally argues that this objection fails on the third limb of the *Philip Morris v. Australia* test in that, even if successful, the Tribunal would still retain jurisdiction over the dispute as described in the NoI and would thus not substantially reduce the scope of the dispute, let alone obviate the need for a merits phase.\n\n32.\n\nWith respect to the second objection, the Claimant repeats the arguments made in respect of the fourth alleged failure of the first objection, as detailed in paragraph 30 above.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant then turns to the third objection in relation to which it argues that it is a company constituted under the laws of Canada and notes that is has not assigned its claim to Trexs but merely granted it an economic interest in the proceeds of the claim. Accordingly, the Claimant argues that this objection is frivolous.\n\n34.\n\nWith respect to the fourth objection, the Claimant notes that the Respondent\u2019s attempt to deny the Claimant benefits under the FTA was exercised after the claim had been submitted. The Claimant asserts that pursuant to *Plama*8 a denial of benefits clause can only operate prospectively such that any attempt by the Respondent to deny the Claimant the benefits under the FTA would have no retroactive effect. Accordingly, the Claimant argues that bifurcation would be inappropriate as this objection would have no effect on the admissibility of the Claimant\u2019s claim. The Claimant further argues that, as it is not owned or controlled by a national of a non-party and as it has substantial business activities in Canada, the Respondent could not validly invoke the denial of benefits clause in any event.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision of Jurisdiction dated 8 February 2005 (RL-3), cited in Claimant\u2019s Observations, para. 103.\n\n35.\n\nFinally, with respect to the Respondent\u2019s fifth objection, the Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 2201(3) of the FTA is flawed in that, by expressly referring to its applicability with respect to the provisions of Chapter Eight, the purpose is to limit the remedies an investor can seek by preventing the right of restitution; it does not operate to prevent an investor being permitted to seek compensation for a breach of the FTA in accordance with the provisions of Chapter Eight. The Claimant notes that it is not seeking restitution and accordingly this provision is irrelevant and that, in any event, an analysis of whether the specific measure is covered by Article 2201(3) of the FTA is inextricably linked with an assessment of the merits and would not achieve a reduction of time or costs.\n\n36.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s objections are not serious or likely to succeed, that even if successful they would not dispose of the entire case or a material part of it, or are so intertwined with the merits that bifurcation would not be efficient.\n\n37.\n\nWith respect to the Tribunal\u2019s subsequent question as to bifurcating the quantum phase, the Claimant argues that issues of quantum are closely intertwined with issues of liability and jurisdiction such that there would be duplication of evidence leading to additional cost and a longer proceeding. With respect to liability, the Claimant notes that to determine whether there has been an indirect expropriation pursuant to Article 811 of the FTA, it would be necessary for the Tribunal to determine the economic impact of the measures in question. With respect to jurisdiction, the Tribunal will be required to assess the Claimant\u2019s knowledge that it has suffered loss or damage as well as the date on which it acquired or should have acquired that knowledge.\n\n38.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant argues that it would be inappropriate to bifurcate the quantum phase.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent, by an unsolicited email of 20 June 2018, responded to the Claimant\u2019s arguments in paragraph 37 above firstly by arguing that the assessment of the economic impact of the measures in question does not rely on expert damages evidence as the Claimant\u2019s expert has assumed a 100% loss. Secondly, the Respondent argues that the investor\u2019s knowledge that it has suffered loss or damage does not require quantification of actual damage but is limited to generic knowledge of the existence of damage.\n\n40.\n\nIn response, the Claimant argues that the Respondent is incorrect in its assertion that it does not rely on expert evidence to assess the economic impact of the measures but that, in any event, this does not have any relevance to the procedural efficiencies of bifurcation. Pursuant to the text of the FTA, the Tribunal will need to assess the difference in value of the investment pre and post the effect of the measures to determine whether there has been a diminution of value such that there has been an indirect expropriation. This, asserts the Claimant, will entail the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of the Parties\u2019 respective positions on quantum.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the Respondent is incorrect to assert that no damages assessment is necessary to determine its jurisdictional argument with respect to knowledge of loss or damage. It notes that for the Respondent to succeed in its jurisdictional objection, it will need to establish that the Claimant was or should have been aware both of a breach of the FTA and that as a result it had incurred loss or damage by the cut-off date. The Claimant argues that this will entail the Tribunal assessing and comparing the effect of any measures that fall outside the limitation period and the effect of the measures that form the basis of the Claimant\u2019s claim which, the Claimant asserts, will require an evaluation of causation and damages.\n\n42.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant submits that even if the Tribunal considers that any of the Respondent\u2019s objections were sufficiently serious and substantial to warrant bifurcation and would dispose of or would significantly reduce the need for the merits phase and are not intertwined with the merits, the Tribunal must still weigh up the delay and costs that would be incurred if bifurcation were to be ordered against the time and economy to be gained by bifurcation if the jurisdictional objections are successful.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n**A. LEGAL FRAMEWORK**\n----------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s power to rule on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation is enshrined in the ICSID Convention and in the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n44.\n\nArticle 41(2) of the ICSID Convention establishes that:\n\nAny objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\n\n45.\n\nFurthermore, Rule 41(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides in its relevant part\n\nthat:\n\nThe Tribunal [...] may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 829 of the FTA provides as follows:\n\nArticle 829: Preliminary Objections\n\n1. The Tribunal shall have the power to rule on preliminary objections to jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n2. Any preliminary objection that the dispute should not be admitted or registered, is not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be made in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules as early as possible.\n\n**B. DISCUSSION**\n-----------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree that there is a general presumption in favour of bifurcation, or that such a presumption is to be read into Article 829(2) of the FTA. The Tribunal interprets this provision merely as imposing a requirement that if a jurisdictional objection is made, then it should be made as early as possible.\n\n48.\n\nThe Parties agree that the matter as to whether the proceedings shall be bifurcated or not is a matter that falls to be decided by the Tribunal, having regard to the principles set out below, and the particular circumstances of each case.9\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para. 12; Claimant\u2019s Observations, para. 4\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises that, as a general matter, three factors are to be examined by the Tribunal in deciding whether to bifurcate (the so-called 'three-part test' applied in *Philip Morris v. Australia*10):\n\n(a) whether the objections raised are *prima facie* serious and substantial;\n\n(b) whether the objection can be examined without prejudging or entering the merits of the case; and\n\n(c) if decided in the Respondent\u2019s favour, whether the objection would dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised.\n\n*Philip Morris v. Australia*, para. 109.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises the significance of the concerns raised by the Respondent with respect to determining its jurisdiction before turning to issues of liability and/or quantum. The Tribunal considers that, in applying the three-part test, it should seek to determine what will best serve the Parties and the sound administration of justice, in particular with respect to procedural efficiency. It recognises, too, that any additional costs that may be incurred by the Respondent in the event that there is no bifurcation may be taken into account when the Tribunal makes its final decision on costs. The Tribunal further emphasises that at all times it has been guided by procedural economy and fairness on a *prima facie* basis and has striven to ensure that it has not prejudged the merits of any of the jurisdictional arguments - or any other arguments - made by either Party.\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore turns to consider each of the Respondent\u2019s objections. In undertaking this analysis, the Tribunal confirms that, at this stage of the proceedings, it has formed no view whatsoever on the merits, whether in relation to liability or quantum, or on any objection to jurisdiction. The Tribunal further determines that, with respect to the first limb of the three-part test, for an objection to be held to be \"*serious and substantial*\" a higher threshold must be applied than merely requiring that the objection is not frivolous or vexatious.\n\n**1. FTA pre-arbitration notice formalities**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that to determine the validity of the first objection it will be required to delve into the substance of the alleged breaches. In its view, the issues are not sufficiently distinct from the merits that this consideration could be undertaken without duplication of the Parties\u2019 and the Tribunal\u2019s efforts. The Tribunal further notes - without forming a view on the matter - the Claimant\u2019s submissions that even if the Respondent were to be successful in making this objection, there is, at minimum, perfected consent for claims arising out of measures detailed on the NoI, even if not for claims arising out of subsequent measures. It considers that to determine this issue without having regard to the merits would raise difficulties. Finally, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that jurisdictional issues are to be decided *prima facie* on the basis of the Claimant\u2019s pleadings, which indicate that the Related Measures arise out of the subject matter of the dispute covered by the NoI or alternatively are additional or ancillary claims which are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal pursuant to the operation of Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal comes to the same view as that expressed in paragraph 52 with respect to the Claimant\u2019s alleged failure to wait for the cooling-off period to expire.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the issue of whether the waiver was valid appears to be an issue of legal assessment, which is not intertwined with the merits and will not require an investigation into facts or issues that will be duplicated in a merits hearing. The Tribunal notes, however, that even if determined in favour of the Respondent, it will not resolve the totality of the Claimant\u2019s claims. The Tribunal further notes that without an examination of the merits of the claim, the Tribunal is unable to determine the extent to which bifurcation of this objection would be capable of disposing of a substantial part of the claim.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that to determine whether the claim is in breach of the FTA\u2019s mandatory time limits contained in Article 821(2)(e)(i), it would be necessary to undertake an enquiry into the meaning and effect of the measures instituted by the Respondent in 2010 - 2012 and into the Claimant\u2019s actual knowledge as well as considering this issue on an objective basis. The Tribunal considers that these issues are so closely intertwined with the merits that it is unlikely that there would be a procedural efficiency to be gained in bifurcating this issue.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal does not therefore believe there would be any procedural efficiency in bifurcating the first objection.\n\n**2. Claims outside the jurisdiction** ***ratione temporis***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a determination of this objection will require the same exercise to be undertaken as that with respect to the Respondent\u2019s objection that the Claimant is in breach of Article 821(2)(e)(i) of the FTA. As determined in paragraph 55 above, the Tribunal considers that the issues are so closely intertwined with the merits that it is unlikely that there would be any procedural efficiency to be gained in bifurcating this objection.\n\n**3. Definition of Investor**\n-----------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that this is a discrete issue which could be determined without consideration of the merits. However, having careful considered the material that is currently before it, the Tribunal is not minded to order bifurcation of this objection on the basis it does not appear, on a *prima facie* basis and without prejudice to its view once the matter has been fully argued, that it amounts to a serious or substantial objection such as to justify bifurcation.\n\n**4. Denial of benefits**\n-------------------------\n\n59.\n\nWhilst the Tribunal accepts that this is a discrete issue which could be determined without consideration of the merits, the Tribunal is not minded to order bifurcation of this objection on the basis it does not appear, on a *prima facie* basis and without prejudice to its view once the matter has been fully argued, that it is a serious or substantial objection such as to justify bifurcation.\n\n**5. The measures at issue are outside the jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae*** **pursuant to Article 2201(3) of the FTA**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nOn the basis of the limited material that is available to the Tribunal at this stage, it is not possible to determine with any confidence whether this is a discrete issue which could be determined without consideration of the merits. However, the Tribunal appreciates that it may be necessary to examine each measure to determine its purpose and impact which would not lead to procedural fairness or efficiency and in any event the Tribunal is not of the view that, on a *prima facie* basis and without prejudice to its view once the matter has been fully argued, that this objection is serious or substantial justifying bifurcation.\n\n**6. Quantum**\n--------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the arguments of the Parties as to the utility of bifurcating the quantum phase of the proceedings. On the basis of the material that is currently available to it, the Tribunal considers that issues related to quantum are closely intertwined with the merits, such that it is unlikely that any procedural efficiencies would be obtained by such a bifurcation.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n62.\n\nAccordingly, having weighed up the Parties\u2019 competing arguments, the Tribunal does not believe that the Respondent\u2019s concerns are justified and it therefore does not order bifurcation either of jurisdiction or of quantum.\n\n63.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, on the basis of the material that is available to it at this time, the Tribunal wishes to make clear that it has formed no view on whether or not it has jurisdiction to hear some or all of the claims that have been put before it, or on any aspect of the merits. It has simply concluded that, at this stage of the proceedings and on the basis of the limited material that is available to it, it would be assisted by having the jurisdictional, merits and quantum issues fully argued together. Further, this decision is entirely without prejudice to the allocation of costs in these proceedings, which will be decided at a later stage.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n64.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n(a) Rejects the Respondent\u2019s request to bifurcate the proceedings.\n\n(b) Directs the Parties to follow Scenario 3 of the procedural calendar set out in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1, as amended in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s communication of 12 March 2018 regarding the Respondent\u2019s additional period of nine calendar days to file its next substantive memorial.\n\n(c) Reserves its decision on the costs of this application for a later stage."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2021-09-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Partial Dissent of Professor Philippe Sands QC", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Partial Dissent of Professor Philippe Sands QC\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case turns on a struggle between competing societal objectives which pull in opposite directions: on the one hand, the protection of the treaty rights of an international investor; on the other hand, the ability of a community to take legitimate measures to conserve its environment. In the present matter, the issues which are presented to the Tribunal concern the lawfulness of the approach taken by the government of Colombia, on behalf of the Respondent, to reconcile the protection of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo with the rights granted to Eco Oro, the Claimant, under the 2008 Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia, which entered into force on 15 August 2011 (the FTA).\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute is centred on measures adopted by Colombia to protect the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, a high mountain ecosystem. The p\u00e1ramo is known to provide a significant role in maintaining biodiversity, with a unique capacity to retain, restore and distribute water across extended areas. This function is of great importance for the broader ecosystems, and for human populations. There is no dispute as to the significance of the p\u00e1ramos of Colombia, or that they represent a majority of such ecosystems around the world, and that they are subject to established and far-reaching protections under the laws of Colombia and international law.\n\n3.\n\nThe FTA between Canada and Colombia has evidently been drafted with care, to ensure that measures properly taken to protect the respective environments of the two countries are not undermined by rights granted to foreign investors. This shared concern for the environment is reflected in the FTA's specific provisions on (i) applicable law,1 (ii) police powers,2 and (iii) exceptions.3\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**), Article 832 (the Tribunal \"shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with [the FTA] and applicable rules of international law\").\n\n*Id.*, Annex 811(2)(b) (\"Except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith, non-discriminatory measures by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, for example \u2026 the protection of the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation\").\n\nSee *id*., Article 2201(3) (\"For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary: \u2026 (c) For the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that it has jurisdiction over the claims brought by Eco Oro, and (by a majority) that the indirect expropriation claim submitted under Article 811 of the FTA should be dismissed, having regard to the provisions of Annex 811(2)(b) on police powers. I support these conclusions. A majority of the Tribunal has further concluded that the claim brought by Eco Oro in respect of Article 805 of the FTA should succeed. I respectfully disagree with this conclusion. The approach taken by the majority fails to respect the text agreed by the drafters of the FTA, and is likely to undermine the protection of the environment.\n\n**Article 805**\n---------------\n\n5.\n\nArticle 805(1) of the FTA provides:\n\n\"Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. The concepts of 'fair and equitable treatment' and 'full protection and security' do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\"\n\nThis language makes clear \u2013 as the Majority recognises \u2013 that the standard of protection which has been granted to the investor is the Minimum Standard of Treatment ('MST'), the one that exists in customary international law. The standard to be applied by the Tribunal is not the Fair and Equitable Treatment ('FET') standard, one that is to be found and applied in other investment protection agreements. The parties to the FTA have reinforced the distinction between the two different standards by the authoritative interpretation of Article 805 and MST adopted in 2017 by the Joint Commission established under the FTA; this confirms that the investor has \"the burden to prove a rule of customary international law invoked under Article 805\".4\n\nJoint Commission of the Free Trade Agreement Between the Republic of Colombia and Canada, Decision No. 6 (24 October 2017) (**Exhibit R-139**).\n\n6.\n\nAs acknowledged by both the ICJ and the ILC, the fact that the FET provision can be found in a number of treaties is not enough to affect the content of customary international law.5 Indeed, the widespread inclusion of FET provisions supports the opposite conclusion, as states which include such provisions in their treaties may be understood as expressing a desire to depart from the standard in customary international law. As with all rules of customary international law, the crucial issue is whether there is sufficient evidence of state practice and *opinio juris* to support the conclusion of the existence of a rule of customary law. As noted below, the majority has made no effort to address that evidentiary requirement, ignoring the explicit requirement of the FTA drafters that the Claimant must prove the content of the rule of customary international law invoked under Article 805.\n\n*Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Guinea v Democratic Republic of the Congo)*, Preliminary Objections, (2007) ICJ Rep 582, at para 90 (discussing rules of diplomatic protection); ILC, 'Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of its 70th Session (30 April \u2013 1 June and 2 July - 10 August 2018) UN Doc A/73/10, 143-146.\n\n7.\n\nIn the past, certain tribunals have - accidentally or deliberately - sought to equate or meld the MST and FET standards. The two standards may share a common aim of imposing restrictions on the manner and extent to which a state is required to treat a foreign investor in its territory, but they do so to in different ways. A breach of the customary MST standard would invariably give rise to a breach of the FET standards, but the reverse is generally not the case. This is because the MST standard sets a much higher bar.\n\n8.\n\nThe position was stated with care and clarity in 1981, by F.A. Mann, who wrote:\n\n\"The terms 'fair and equitable treatment' envisage conduct which goes far beyond the minimum standard and afford protection to a greater extent and according to a much more objective standard than any previously employed form of words. A tribunal would not be concerned with a minimum, maximum or average standard. It will have to decide whether in all circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable. No standard defined by other words is likely to be material. The terms are to be understood and applied independently and autonomously.\"6\n\nDr Mann's conclusion, which is as pertinent today as when it was written, does not mean that the law on MST is set in stone, or is static. It does mean, however, that there is a cardinal distinction between the two standards, and in carrying out its task the duty of a tribunal is bound to take that distinction and apply it to the facts of the case. A failure to do so amounts to a departure from the intentions of the drafters of the FTA. As the Joint Commission has made clear, the burden is on the Claimant to prove the content of the customary rule, and that the standard it sets forth has not been met. A tribunal that melds the two terms, or which misapplies one standard (MST) by applying the conditions of the other (FET), or which fails to satisfy itself that the Claimant has met its requisite burdens of proof, or which fails to give effect to the intentions of the drafters, risks adopting an approach which might be said to manifestly exceed its powers.\n\nF. A. Mann, 'British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments' (1981) 52 *British Yearbook of International Law* 241, 244.\n\n9.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant has not met the burden of showing sufficient state practice, independent of the mere existence of FET provisions in modern investment treaties, to establish that the customary standard has evolved so as to be identical (or similar) to the FET standard. Nor has the Claimant offered any plausible evidence on the requisite *opinio juris*. In so proceeding, the Claimant has not engaged with the deliberate and explicit drafting choice made by the parties to the FTA, one that is premised on the customary standard (MST) continuing to have its own identity, autonomy and component elements.\n\n10.\n\nThe tribunal in *Glamis Gold v United States of America* noted that although the exact formulation of the MST in the old case of *Neer* is no longer directly applicable as such, the customary standard it articulated has not radically changed.7 That conclusion is surely right. As outlined by the Majority in this case, the starting point in determining whether a state's conduct has breached the MST is whether it has acted in a way which is \"arbitrary or grossly unfair or discriminatory, or otherwise inconsistent with the customary international law standard\".8 The state's conduct must be \"egregious and shocking\",9 and lead to an outcome which \"offends judicial propriety\".10 In applying the standard it is important that a tribunal's analysis is made \"in the light of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders\".11 The Claimant has offered no plausible evidence to support a different standard, and the Majority Decision has cited no authority or evidence to support its conclusion. Whilst a finding of bad faith or malicious intention on the part of the state is not required, the threshold for finding a breach of the MST nevertheless remains very high, such that a finding that it has been breached must be based on facts which are truly exceptional. Although the ordinary decision-making processes of states may result in a breach of the FET standard, a breach of the MST is not an everyday occurrence and should be found only in truly egregious 12 circumstances.\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd v United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award (8 June 2009) (**Exhibit CL-59**), para 21.\n\n*Mobil Investments Canada Inc and Murphy Oil Corporation v Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/4, Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum (22 May 2012) (**Exhibit CL-179**), para 153.\n\n*Glamis Gold Ltd v United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award (8 June 2009) (**Exhibit CL-59**), paras 616 and 627.\n\n*Waste Management Inc v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award (30 April 2004) (**Exhibit RL-64**), para 98.\n\n*S.D. Myers v Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award (13 November 2000) (**Exhibit RL-55**), para 263.\n\n*Mobil Investments Canada Inc and Murphy Oil Corporation v Government of Canada (I)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/4, Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum (22 May 2012) (**Exhibit CL-179**), para 153.\n\n11.\n\nThe Majority has sought to construct its finding of a breach of the MST on three intertwined strands of reasoning: first, that the Respondent breached the Claimant's legitimate expectations; second, that the Respondent failed to provide a stable and predictable legal environment; and third, that the Respondent acted arbitrarily in its dealing with the Claimant. The approach is novel. I disagree with the Majority's reasoning in relation to all three strands, as there is no evidence to support the approach to the MST standard, or the finding that there has been a breach of it.\n\n**Legitimate Expectations**\n---------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe notion of legitimate expectations has become a frequent and controversial issue in investment treaty disputes. It has become a recognised element of the FET standard, but its role in the context of an MST inquiry is not yet established.\n\n13.\n\nFirst, as acknowledged by the Majority, in the context of the MST the failure to observe a claimant's legitimate expectations is just one factor a tribunal may take into account in determining whether there has been a breach of the MST.13 The claimant must still show that the failure to observe its legitimate expectations was, in the circumstances, serious enough to amount to egregious and shocking behaviour.\n\n*Glamis Gold Ltd v United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award (8 June 2009) (**Exhibit CL-59**), para 627.\n\n14.\n\nSecond, and more pertinently, if legitimate expectations are to have any place in the context of MST, the concept will have a more limited role than in relation to FET. Unlike in a FET inquiry, there is no authority for the proposition that it will be sufficient for a claimant to point to reliance on legislative provisions or broad statements. Rather, the limited jurisprudence that exists (in the NAFTA context) indicates *inter alia* that a claimant must be able to establish a \"quasi-contractual\" relationship or expectation,14 in the sense that the state must have made \"explicit\" or \"specific\" encouragements or representations on which the investor has placed reliance.15 The Majority's analysis fails to acknowledge or address this requirement, and in so doing has in effect conflated the FET and MST.\n\n*Glamis Gold Ltd v United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award (8 June 2009) (**Exhibit CL-59**), paras 766 and 799; *Cargill Incorporated v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award (18 September 2009) (**Exhibit RL-81**), para 290.\n\n*Glamis Gold Ltd v United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award (8 June 2009) (**Exhibit CL-59**), para 767; *Mobil Investments Canada Inc and Murphy Oil Corporation v Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/4, Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum (22 May 2012) (**Exhibit CL-179**), para 152.\n\n15.\n\nThe Majority concludes that the Claimant had three legitimate expectations: (i) it would be entitled to undertake mining exploitation activities in the entirety of the area covered by Concession 3452; (ii) in the event that the State were to expropriate Eco Oro's acquired rights, compensation would be payable; and (iii) that Colombia would ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment.\n\n16.\n\nWith regard to (i), there is no evidence before the Tribunal to establish that the Respondent gave a \"quasi-contractual\" commitment that the Claimant would have the right to exploit the entirety of the Concession area. Indeed, the right to exploit was premised on the relevant environmental authorisations being obtained, in circumstances in which the Claimant was aware at the time of its investment that the grant of such authorisations was uncertain. To get around this fact, the Majority relies mainly on general statements of encouragement from certain of the Respondent's ministers and officials, as well as the mere fact of the granting of the Concession, but neither gives rise to a \"quasi-contractual\" relationship. As the Tribunal acknowledges in relation to the expropriation claim, the Claimant was aware, or should have been aware, of the existence and effect of the p\u00e1ramo in the Concession area; that the Respondent was committed to the protection of the environment, and that its right or ability to go beyond exploration to exploit the Concession area was subject to the overriding need to protect the environment. Considering that, in its analysis of the Art 811 claim, these same facts led the Tribunal to conclude that the Claimant had not received a specific assurance or representation such as to give rise to a legitimate expectation,16 it is wholly inconsistent for the Majority to reach a different conclusion in its analysis of the Art 805 claim.\n\nTribunal's Decision, para 694.\n\n17.\n\nLikewise, I do not believe that there was any quasi-contractual commitment with regard to expectations (ii) and (iii). The Claimant has not pointed to any specific assurances that it would receive compensation in the event of an expropriation, or that the Respondent would ensure a predictable framework for planning and investing. Any investor could claim to have such 'expectations' on the basis of the Respondent's domestic law and general statements from ministers and officials, but these would not be protected under the MST. I find the reference to expectation (ii) particularly odd given that the Tribunal has concluded that no expropriation has taken place. The concepts of stability and predictability, which underpin expectation (iii), are addressed below.\n\n18.\n\nThere is a further difficulty with the majority's conclusion that the Respondent has violated the Claimant's legitimate expectations under MST (and 805). The Tribunal has recognised that: (1) in order to rely on a claim of legitimate expectation (under FET) an investor must show that its expectation would have been shared by a \"prudent\" or \"reasonable investor\", and to that end it must have engaged in some sort of due diligence;17 (2) there is nothing in the record before it to show that any due diligence was undertaken by Eco Oro in respect of any of the representations upon which it was said to have relied;18 (3) \"the most cursory due diligence even before Concession 3452 was granted would have revealed *(i)* the potential existence of a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem within the boundaries of Concession 3452; *(ii)* the Government's commitment and obligation to protect these ecosystems; and *(iii)* that such protection could be achieved by the imposition of a mining ban\";19 (4) Eco Oro had no \"distinct reasonable investment backed expectations that exploitation would be permitted in the entirety of the concession area\";20 and (5) an appropriate due diligence exercise would have advised Eco Oro \"that Colombia could retrospectively impose a mining ban on all or part of Concession 3452 to protect a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem\".21 Yet notwithstanding these rather clear conclusions, largely in relation to the failed Article 811 claim, the majority nevertheless concludes that Eco Oro had a legitimate expectation in relation to MST, on which it could rely notwithstanding the total absence of any exercise of due diligence. In reaching its conclusion (at paras. 804 and 805 of the Decision), the majority passes in silence on due diligence.22\n\nSee Tribunal's Decision, paras. 681, 762; see *Antaris & G\u00f6de v Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-01, Award of 2 May 2018, para. 360(6): \"in order to rely on legitimate expectations the investor should inquire in advance regarding the prospects of a change in the regulatory framework in light of the then prevailing or reasonably to be expected changes in the economic and social conditions of the host State.\"\n\nTribunal's Decision, paras. 682, 694, 768.\n\nTribunal's Decision, para. 682.\n\nTribunal's Decision, para. 694.\n\nTribunal's Decision, para. 765.\n\nIn relation to the Article 811 claim, the majority concludes that \"Eco Oro could not have anticipated through due diligence the immense confusion in the applicable legal regime created by the contradictory State decisions and changing positions of different State organs\" on the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo (Tribunal's Decision, para. 696). In reaching this conclusion, the majority offers no evidence: it is mere assertion, unsupported by the record of the proceedings. The point is not made in relation to the Article 805 claim.\n\n**Stability and Predictability**\n--------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Majority's reliance on the concepts of stability and predictability are no less problematic. Despite the Majority's tendency to refer to the concepts separately, they are closely interconnected and cannot really be said to be distinct in any meaningful sense; indeed, it is not clear from the Decision what the Majority understands to be the difference between stability and predictability. In any case, the obligation to provide stability or predictability has no foundation in the FTA or in the case law on the MST. In its initial explanation of the MST, the Majority makes no mention of matters of legal or regulatory stability; indeed, at various parts of the Decision, including at paragraph 749, the Majority explicitly states that the Respondent is not under an obligation to provide a stable legal framework. Yet when it comes to the application of the MST standard to the facts of the case, out of nowhere the obligation of stability suddenly emerges, as though magically concocted out of thin air, with no reference to be found either to the Claimant's evidentiary burdens (on state practise or *opinio juris* in relation to the customary law standard) or any legal authority. Legal or regulatory stability is then mentioned repeatedly in the Majority's reasoning, most brightly at paragraphs 754, 762, 781, 803 and 805; this is despite that fact that legal and regulatory stability has never before been treated as part of MST, and no authority or evidence is cited for the conclusion.\n\n20.\n\nThe reliance on predictability, to the extent that it is distinct from stability, is also unsupported by any evidence or authority. The sole source which the Majority invokes in relation to the relevance of predictability is a single line in the preamble to the FTA. It is, however, widely recognised that a preambular aspiration cannot as such give rise to a hard edged or actionable obligation.23\n\n*Cargill Incorporated v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award (18 September 2009) (**Exhibit RL-81**), paras 289-290.\n\n21.\n\nThis reliance on stability and predictability is therefore manifestly incorrect. To be sure, there is ongoing debate as to whether the FET standard encapsulates any sort of an obligation to ensure legal and regulatory stability, with the weight of jurisprudence indicating that such an obligation only exists where the FET provision in question explicitly mentions stability. Without such clear language, most tribunals have recognised that international investment law does not \u2013 and cannot, and should not \u2013 freeze the regulatory environment of a host state, and must not act in effect as a mechanism of insurance system for investors.24 The decision of treaty parties \u2013 as in this FTA \u2013 not to include a stability clause in an international agreement is one that a Tribunal must take seriously, as it represents a deliberate choice of the drafters to preserve a greater degree of regulatory discretion. The same goes for domestic legislation. Invoking the concept of legitimate expectations, as the Majority does by way of magical thinking, cannot change this.25\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd and MTD Chile S.A. v Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Decision on Annulment (21 March 2007), para 67; *Mobil Investments Canada Inc and Murphy Oil Corporation v Government of Canada (I)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/4, Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum (22 May 2012) (**Exhibit CL-179**), para 153; *Hydro Energy 1 S.\u00e0 r.l. and Hydroxana Sweden AB v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/42, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum (9 March 2020), para 584.\n\n*Cargill Incorporated v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award (18 September 2009) (**Exhibit RL-81**), paras 289-290.\n\n22.\n\nThese considerations apply with particular force under the customary MST, which is the standard applicable in this case. Where is the authority for the proposition that a failure to provide stability or predictability can give rise to a violation of the MST standard? The Majority has cited none. I am aware of none. The Majority has effectively engaged in judicial law-making; it has invented a new element for the identification of the customary standard which no state has appeared to have articulated, in the total absence of any evidence of state practise or *opinio juris*. Despite the fact that the drafters of the FTA have made it clear that in relation to Article 805 and MST a claimant must prove the customary rule, with all that implies for evidence of state practise and *opinio juris*, the Majority makes no mention of these elements in relation to the facts of stability or predictability. Without evidence of *opinion juris* or state practise, the claim to a customary standard does not get off the ground.\n\n23.\n\nThe Majority has not explained why what has happened in Colombia is contrary to the rule of law \u2013 indeed, it has done the very opposite, invoking a series of legislative and regulatory acts and ensuing litigation, including before the Constitutional Court, in its narrative. The Claimant's own witnesses and experts testified as to the existence of remedies still available to the Claimant, and the failure to pursue them, and the plausibility of decisions of the Constitutional Court, even if they do not necessarily agree with them. The comportment of Colombia may not be perfect, but in failing to provide stability or predictability it cannot be said to violate the rule of law, or customary law, or to even come close to shocking or offending a sense of judicial propriety. By concluding as it has, the Majority ignores the obvious diligence with which the Constitutional Court of Colombia addressed matters of considerable complexity, offering reasons for all of its conclusions which are drafted with evident care and balance. There is here a manifest inconsistency in the conclusions of the Majority. In the absence of an aggravating factor, such as one of Professor Schreuer's indicia, mere instability can never of itself be serious enough to give rise to a breach of the MST.\n\n24.\n\nConsequently, I do not believe that, in itself, the stability or predictability of the domestic legal framework has any relevance in determining whether the Respondent has breached the MST.\n\n**Arbitrariness**\n-----------------\n\n25.\n\nI agree with the Majority that a state which acts arbitrarily may be in breach of the MST. The starting point in assessing whether a state has acted arbitrarily is the decision of the International Court of Justice in *ELSI*. In that case the Court indicated that a finding of arbitrariness was only appropriate when a state has acted contrary to the rule of law, or its conduct shocks or offends a sense of juridical propriety.26 Similar language has also been used by investment tribunals,27 and it continues to reflect the state of the law today. The Claimant has offered no plausible evidence to support a contrary view, and the Majority Decision has cited no authority to the contrary.\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.P.A. (ELSI)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1989 (**Exhibit CL-153 / RL-50**), p. 15, para 128.\n\n*Waste Management Inc v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3 Award (30 April 2004) (**Exhibit RL-64**), para 98; *Glamis Gold v United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award (8 June 2009) (**Exhibit CL-59**), para 21; *Cargill, Incorporated v.

As stated by the tribunal in *Cargill v Mexico*, and cited by the Majority, \"an actionable finding of arbitrariness must not be based simply on a tribunal's determination that a domestic agency or legislature incorrectly weighed various factors, made legitimate compromises between disputing constituencies, or applied social or economic reasoning in a manner that the tribunal criticises\".28 I fully agree with the Majority that the indicia of arbitrariness given by Professor Christoph Schreuer in *EDF (Services) Limited v Romania* are relevant to the customary MST and helpful in the present case.29\n\n*Cargill, Incorporated v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award (18 September 2009) (**Exhibit RL-81**), para 292.\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award (8 October 2009) (**Exhibit CL-174**), para 303.\n\n27.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, mere instability cannot amount to a breach of the MST. Beyond 'instability', the Majority's conclusion appears to turn on its view that the Respondent acted for a reason other than environmental protection, and/or that the Respondent did not act for a legitimate purpose.30 This view seems to be based on three factors: that the Respondent referred to factors other than environmental protection in some of its decision-making processes; that there were competing approaches to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n Par\u00e1mo in different parts of the Respondent's government; and that the Respondent has not eliminated illegal mining in its territory. In my view, these factors, whether taken individually or cumulatively, are manifestly not sufficiently grave to amount to arbitrariness, or a breach of the MST.\n\nTribunal's Decision, paras 810 and 821.\n\n28.\n\nIn determining whether measures taken by a state is arbitrary to the point of being shocking, tribunals must be sensitive to the difficulties of government decision-making in the face of legitimate objectives that pull in different directions. In the search for balance, and in the face of competing pressures, different arms of the same government may inevitably give expression to different and potentially conflicting priorities. As noted above, this is particularly the case when the protection of the environment or human health is at stake (one need only think of the current challenges faced by so many governments around the world as they confront the emerging reality of global warming/climate change and biodiversity losses and their consequences, or the reality of Covid-19, as governments struggle to find a way through the difficulties of protecting human health whilst also securing economic wellbeing).\n\n29.\n\nAlthough states increasingly sign treaties committing themselves to the protection of the environment, they are still often under pressure to prioritise other social objectives. These competing objectives will often be economic in nature. As concern about the protection of the environment increases, states are increasingly likely to be confronted with decisions that involve complex trade-offs, making internal government debate \u2013 and changes of direction \u2013 more likely. When a government does choose to prioritise a certain interest, such as environmental protection, there are a variety of ways a policy can be designed and implemented depending on the weight a government wishes to give to other interests. Such policy decisions imply delicate balancing acts and may leave particular stakeholders disappointed or even financially worse-off. None of this, in my view, is sufficient of itself to cast doubt on the sincerity of the government's stated objectives. These decisions and their consequences are not extraordinary in any sense, but have become routine and the business of government.\n\n30.\n\nIn this context, arbitrators and judges, as well as other adjudicators, must take care to remain within the arbitral or judicial function: they must not legislate, and they must take care not to trespass into a forbidden domain by imposing their own policy preferences where the legislative branch \u2013 and perhaps also a divided executive arm \u2013 oscillates over time between competing social objectives and policy goals. I fear that the Majority has fallen into error: it has failed to take into account the realities of governmental decision-making in legitimate domains, and the clear limits imposed by the drafters of the FTA in relation to the protection of the environment, not least by imposing the application of MST with all that implies for proving the content of the customary rule.\n\n31.\n\nOn the factual record before the Tribunal, I do not consider that the behaviour of the Respondent can be characterised as having shocked or offended a sense of juridical propriety, or may be said to be contrary to the rule of law. Indeed, the Decision makes crystal clear that Colombia has acted throughout in good faith, seeking to find compromises in balancing the competing objectives of environmental protection and economic development (in this case by means of mining activity). The Decision passes in relative silence on the compelling testimony offered by witnesses, in particular Ms Brigitte Baptiste, on behalf of the Respondent. As she explained, in her capacity as Director General of the Alexander von Humboldt Institute (from 2010 to 2019), she described how the Institute contributed to the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo, confirming the complexity of the task, the manner in which non-ecological factors were taken into account, and the significance and challenge of delimiting the transition zone (strip) between the p\u00e1ramo and other areas (\"The transitional strip from any ecosystem to another one is the area where you have the most ecological exchanges, where you have the most flows because it is a border [\u2026] So, the strip is key for the operation of the ecosystem, and the strip is considered a key protection area for the p\u00e1ramo because this is the ecosystem that is above, and also the flow of ecosystem and, in particular, water.\"31) Ms Baptiste's evidence on the delimitation was honest, balanced, compelling and persuasive, reflective of her integrity; it strongly supported the conclusion that the Respondent's effort to delimit the p\u00e1ramo may not have been perfect, but it was carried out in good faith, was motivated by genuine environmental considerations, and cannot be said to have been arbitrary. Her evidence was undamaged by cross-examination or other evidence.\n\nTranscript, day 3, page 741, lines 7-22, and surrounding exchanges (Wednesday 22 January 2020).\n\n32.\n\nLike many governments around the world, Colombia has found the challenge of taking reasonable measures to protect its environment to be daunting, one that takes time and is often composed of a multitude of decisions that apparently take contrary directions. At a time when the need to protect the environment is, in legal terms, a relatively recent development, it is understandable that different parts of a government may on occasion pull in different directions, or that over time contradictory legislation may be adopted, or that different judicial decisions may be handed down.\n\n33.\n\nIn the age of climate change and significant loss of biological diversity, it is clear that society finds itself in a state of transition. The law \u2013 including international law \u2013 must take account of that state of transition, which gives rise to numerous uncertainties. Adjudicators \u2013 judges and arbitrators \u2013 recognise the need to proceed with caution at a time of transition and uncertainty. Indeed, the precautionary principle has been developed to assist in the taking of decisions in times of uncertainty, and the Tribunal has correctly determined that the application of the precautionary principle \u2013 treated as being applicable as a rule of law in accordance with Article 832 of the FTA \u2013 to this case has contributed to the conclusion that there has been no actionable violation of Article 811 of the FTA. Yet in respect of Article 805, it seems that precaution has no place for the Majority.\n\n34.\n\nTo be clear, the Respondent has not acted perfectly in its management of the p\u00e1ramo, but the MST standard does not require it to have done so. Neither the MST nor the FTA offer a right against confusion. The Majority is correct to point out that there were problems with the manner in which the government handled the process of delimiting the Santurb\u00e1n Par\u00e1mo. It was slow, it was inconsistent, it was uncertain. The key question, however, is: did the process of delimitation cross the line of departing from the rule of law, or proceed on a basis that shocks our sense of juridical propriety? In my view it did not, and the heart of the Decision makes that clear, premised as it is on the view that the Respondent acted in good faith. Yet when it comes to the final and permanent delimitation of the par\u00e1mo, and all the difficulties that gave rise to, including delays, the Majority has taken the evidence before the Tribunal and concluded that the Respondent was somehow not truly motivated by the aim of environmental protection. This conclusion is difficult to comprehend, given the evidence and the finding in the context of the expropriation claim that the Respondent's actions *were* motivated by a desire to protect the environment.32\n\nTribunal's Decision, paras 678 and 699.\n\n**Conclusion on Article 805**\n-----------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Majority's finding of a breach of Article 805 appears to be based on little more than the evidence that the Respondent struggled with the compromises to be made as between different interests, with reasoning and decision-making that was not as efficient, timely or consistent as it could have been. Whilst there are legitimate criticisms to be made as to how the Respondent acted, the same criticisms may be made of any government faced with such decisions, and subject to judicial challenges at every stage. This is why the standard to be applied is paramount, as reflected in the clearly expressed intentions of the drafters of the FTA. In my view, the Majority has manifestly failed to apply the correct standard.\n\n36.\n\nThe Majority's analysis undercuts the plain meaning of the FTA and well-established principles of customary law. The effect of its approach is to significantly lower the bar, and in effect rewrite the FTA and the content and effect of MST. As the language of the ICJ in *ELSI* and other investment tribunals shows, a finding that a state has breached the MST will be rare and extraordinary.\n\n37.\n\nIt is not in dispute the protection of the par\u00e1mo was a legitimate objective. The designation of the general area of the par\u00e1mo in 2007 has not been impugned, and the Tribunal has recognised that the area in which mining has been prohibited has not crossed a line of impropriety or illegality under the FTA. The Claimant went into this project with its eyes open, knowing that it was investing in a par\u00e1mo which was already subject to certain protections, and it knew \u2013 or should have known \u2013 that over time those protections were likely to become even more restrictive. By the time of its renewed and revised project in 2011, when it abandoned an open cast mine for an underground mine, the Claimant was well aware of the difficulties it faced. What the Tribunal impugns is merely the fact that the Respondent has failed to give precise and detailed effect in a timely manner to the permanent and final delimitation of the par\u00e1mo in accordance with a particular scale, timetable and factors. By any reasonable standard, the situation faced by the Respondent, in seeking to give effect to a legitimate objective of environmental protection, was challenging. Its approach in meeting that challenge was not perfect, but it was not contrary to the rule of law, and it was not conduct that shocked or offended a sense of juridical propriety.\n\n**The 2201(3) exception**\n-------------------------\n\n38.\n\nHaving concluded that there has been no breach of either Article 805 or Article 811, I do not address the interpretation and applicability of Article 2201(3).\n\n**Retroactivity**\n-----------------\n\n39.\n\nRetroactivity, which has been addressed by Mr Grigera Na\u00f3n as a matter of concern. As a general proposition, outside of the criminal law context it cannot be said that there is a strict rule against retroactivity. The point was addressed the tribunal in *Cairn Energy v India*,33 a case concerned with whether retroactive tax measures violated the FET standard, independently of the doctrine of legitimate expectations. This appears to be the first decision to consider the point in any detail.34 The tribunal rejected the proposition that a principle of legal certainty entailed an absolute prohibition against retroactive measures.35 Instead, it stated that retroactive measures may not lead to a breach of the FET when taken for the public interest and in conformity with the principle of proportionality.36 A two stage test was suggested:\n\n\"(i) [T]he retroactive application of a new regulation is only justified when the prospective application of that regulation would not achieve the specific public purpose sought, and (ii) the importance of that specific public purpose must manifestly outweigh the prejudice suffered by the individuals affected by the retroactive application of the regulation.\"37\n\nAlthough in the context of an FET claim, the analysis in *Cairn Energy* is premised on the proposition that it is not correct to assume that retroactive measures are strictly prohibited. This is consistent with international case law and the practise of many domestic legal systems, which do not support the idea of a general principle of law (understood in the sense of Article 38 of the ICJ Statute) prohibiting retroactive measures. The better view is that of the tribunal in *Cairn Energy* \u2013 that retroactive measures are permissible if taken for the public interest and in accordance with the principle of proportionality. The fact that a measure may have retroactive effects cannot be sufficient for a tribunal to conclude that the facts of a case bring it within the \"rare circumstances\" so that Annex 811 does not apply. Tribunals must instead consider whether contested retroactive measures were taken in the public interest, and whether they are proportionate. This ties in with the analysis in the Decision, as stated in paras 623-699, to the effect that the measures were taken in the public interest and were proportionate.\n\n*Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn UK Holdings Limited v The Republic of India*, PCA Case No. 2016-7, Award (21 December 2020) (Arbs.

The majority having concluded otherwise, in relation to Article 805, it will be necessary to have an additional phase to identify the loss suffered by Eco Oro if any, and the methodology by which it is to be valued. In this regard, as the questions put by the Tribunal make clear, the finding that Eco Oro had no right to engage in any exploitation without the grant of necessary environmental licenses, coupled with the absence of any exercise in due diligence as to what the likelihood of receiving such licences was in relation to an underground mine, makes this a not entirely straightforward task.\n\n41.\n\nIn this regard, ss to the question of acquired rights,38 it may be that as a matter of Colombian law Eco Oro may be said to have rights that could be characterised, as the majority does, as 'acquired rights'. That characterisation, however, is of limited, if any, consequence, for the case before us, which is concerned with what right Eco Oro actually had under the FTA in relation to the concession. It had a right to explore, and it had a right to apply for an environmental license which would allow it to engage in future exploitation. It had no right, however, as such, to exploit, or to apply to extend the concession for the purpose of future exploitation, without the grant of an environmental license. Nor did Eco Oro have any right to an environmental license. To conclude, as the majority does, that Eco Oro had an 'acquired right' to exploit subject to the grant of a future (and speculative) environmental license does not, in my view, materially assist in the identification and valuation of any loss as the majority may determine to have occurred.\n\nSee e.g. Tribunal's Decision, paras. 449 and 499."}, {"Title": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Horacio A.

As set forth in the *Phoenix* award, the parties to a treaty cannot contract out of the system of international law. As soon as States contract with one another, they do so automatically and necessarily within the system of international law,1 which brings into the picture general principles of law and international law doctrines.2 Therefore, when construed or interpreted, this Treaty provisions cannot be isolated from general international law.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award (15 April 2009), at para. 77.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 31(3)(c) (Exhibit CL-3).\n\n4.\n\nAnnex 811 (2)(b) refers to \"*rare circumstances*\" and includes as illustration of situations in which \"*rare circumstances*\" would be present, \"*when a measure or series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith* [or of a] *non-discriminatory* [character]\".3 If rare circumstances are present under international law, a finding of indirect expropriation may follow.\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (Exhibit C-22; see also Exhibit R-137).\n\n5.\n\n\"*Rare circumstances*\" afford large leeway for interpretation. In the corresponding interpretative exercise, the legal factors to be considered from an international law perspective include legitimate expectations created when the concession was executed on 8 February 2007 (the \"Concession\")4 in respect of legal title/Concession rights of the Claimant, general public international law principles of *pacta sunt servanda*, good faith (including legitimate expectations and the condemnation of abuse of rights) and the proportionality principle. Indeed, although good faith \u2013 a general principle of customary international law \u2013 encompasses all the latter which, in turn, contribute to shaping the notion of good faith and its substance, *pacta sunt servanda* is a general, stand-alone principle of customary international law.\n\nConcession Contract 3452, 8 February 2007 (Exhibit C-16).\n\n6.\n\nThe above is apposite in connection with contractual agreements like the Concession. Contractual rights thereunder are protected investments under the definition of investment in Article 838(g)(i), Section \"C\" of the Treaty, which expressly includes concessions. Contractual rights covered by this provision (unlike other situations which might also fall within its purview) are particularly apt to generate legitimate expectations frustrated by the retroactive or retrospective application of laws, including, without limitation, environmental laws, insofar as not accompanied by full compensation or a credible offer to fully compensate. Indeed, under Treaty Article 811(1)(c), lack of compensation as defined in the Treaty constitutes a Treaty breach rendering the taking illicit under international law.\n\n7.\n\nThe validity of the Concession under Colombian law has not been challenged, so that the necessary conclusion is that the Concession was made with the concessionaire having the legitimate expectation that its rights thereunder would be respected including, without limitation, its right to make a profit or draw economic benefit. The frustration of such rights resulting from retroactive or retrospective legislation or regulations must necessarily be taken into account to determine if Treaty guarantees have been violated, including in the analysis whether \"*rare circumstances*\" are present. As it will be further discussed below, a valid concession under Colombian law vests the concessionaire with acquired rights to explore and exploit the mining resource within the boundaries of the Concession as granted.\n\n8.\n\nFurther, the protection of legitimate expectations is intimately intertwined with customary international law rules, of substantial relevance when there is uncertainty in the applicable legal regime introduced through State conduct after the granting of contractual rights under a transaction to which the State is a party.\n\n9.\n\nAs the European Court of Human Rights5 has decided, not only the protection of legitimate expectations is a component of the general good faith rule of customary international law but, indeed, such rule is a corollary of the protection of legitimate expectations as a general principle of law6 indissolubly linked to the good faith rule under customary international law.\n\n\"*The principle of good faith, codified by Article 18 of the First Vienna Convention, is a rule of customary international law whose existence is recognized by the International Court of Justice and is therefore binding on the Community. The principle is the corollary in public international law of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations, which forms part of the Community legal order and on which an economic operator to whom an institution has given justified hopes may rely*\"*.*7\n\n*Opel Austria GmbH v. Council of the European Union*, Case T-115/94 (Judgment of the Court of First Instance (Fourth Chamber) (22 January 1997) ECR II-00039.\n\nSee, for example, *Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/01, Award (22 September 2014) (Exhibit RL-96) at para. 576 showing that the protection of legitimate expectations is a general principle of law. The International Court of Justice has not endorsed the existence of an international law principle protecting legitimate expectations (*Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia vs Chile)* October 2018 Judgment ICJ Report 2018 page 507, at page 559 (para. 162). However, the facts giving rise to this decision concerned the existence or not of the obligation to negotiate maritime boundaries in an inter-State dispute, and not the enforcement of concession rights protected by a bilateral investment protection treaty. Further, the Court explicitly recognized that the legitimate expectations principle was applied in treaty investment disputes.\n\n*Ibidem*, at II-40.\n\n10.\n\nAlthough this case concerned the application in time of a provision of the EC Agreement, it stands for a general principle of customary international law which is clearly relevant when acquired rights are exposed to the retroactive application of legal rules, therefore adversely affecting legal certainty and predictability and concomitant expectations associated with them. In this connection, the following excerpt of this decision is pertinent:\n\n\"*The principle of legal certainty requires Community legislation to be certain and its application foreseeable by individuals and that every Community measure having legal effects must be clear and precise and must be brought to the notice of the person concerned in such a way that he can ascertain exactly the time at which the measure comes into being and starts to have legal effects. That requirement must be observed all the more strictly in the case of a measure liable to have financial consequences in order that those concerned may know precisely the extent of the obligations which it imposes on them*\"8*.*\n\n*Ibidem*, at II-41.\n\n11.\n\nTo consider, in light of the above, whether \"*rare circumstances*\" in face of which, for example, not respecting a concessionaire's rights under a concession would lead to the violation of Treaty Article 811(1) and its Annex 811(2)(b), it is necessary to bear in mind that *normal circumstances* require not applying retroactively laws or regulations interfering with contractual rights and defeating acquired rights or expectations associated with such rights. It cannot be \"normal\" to take for granted the retroactive application of the law or legal regulations to defeat concession rights, which are prospective in nature, particularly when such application is pursued by the State party to the contract to the detriment of the private counterpart in a situation like the one at stake, in which the State played an active role in attracting investments through, *inter alia*, the enticement of a concession based on the agreement between the State and a private party the legal regime of which is unilaterally controlled by the State. In such scenario, if such interference happens, a \"*rare circumstance*\" is engendered, and compensation may be appropriate.\n\n12.\n\nColombian law leads to similar conclusions. Under Colombian law, including Colombian constitutional law, the retroactive (affecting acquired rights, Colombian Constitution Article 58) or retrospective (affecting ongoing relationships) application of national law requires compensation. Although this provision privileges the public interest over merely private ones, it does provide for compensation in case of deprivation of property rights. In this respect, not only does Article 58 preclude the retroactive application of the law as a basic constitutional guarantee, but it also provides that acquired rights are part of the property rights protected by this provision, which in the present case come into life simultaneously with the coming into life of the contract or concession constituting their source9. In turn, the notion of acquired rights unequivocally carries with it the principle that acquired rights may not be eroded or suppressed by a retroactive application of the law without compensating for the deprivation of such rights protected by the Colombian Constitution.\n\n(All citations to Colombian legal texts or cases in this opinion refer to their original text in Spanish). Article 58 of the Colombian Consitution (Exhibit C-65) recites as follows: \"*Se garantizan la propiedad privada y los dem\u00e1s derechos adquiridos con arreglo a las leyes civiles, los cuales no pueden ser desconocidos ni vulnerados por leyes posteriores. Cuando de la aplicaci\u00f3n de una ley expedida por motivos de utilidad p\u00fablica o inter\u00e9s social, resultare en conflicto los derechos de los particulares con la necesidad por ella reconocida, el inter\u00e9s privado deber\u00e1 ceder al inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico o social. La propiedad es una funci\u00f3n social que implica obligaciones. Como tal, le es inherente una funci\u00f3n ecol\u00f3gica. El Estado proteger\u00e1 y promover\u00e1 las formas asociativas y solidarias de propiedad. Por motivos de utilidad p\u00fablica o inter\u00e9s social definidos por el legislador, podr\u00e1 haber expropiaci\u00f3n mediante sentencia judicial e indemnizaci\u00f3n previa. Este se fijar\u00e1 consultando los intereses de la comunidad y del afectado. En los casos que determine el legislador, dicha expropiaci\u00f3n podr\u00e1 adelantarse por v\u00eda administrativa, sujeta a posterior acci\u00f3n contenciosa-administrativa, incluso respecto del precio*\"*.* The irretroactivity principle is further confirmed by Article 46 of Law 685 of 2001 (Colombian Mining Code, Exhibit C-8): \"*Normatividad del contrato. Al contrato de concesi\u00f3n le ser\u00e1n aplicables durante el t\u00e9rmino de su ejecuci\u00f3n y durante sus pr\u00f3rrogas, las leyes mineras vigentes al tiempo de su perfeccionamiento, sin excepci\u00f3n o salvedad alguna. Si dichas leyes fueren modificadas o adicionadas con posterioridad, al concesionario le ser\u00e1n aplicables estas \u00faltimas en cuanto ampl\u00eden, confirmen o mejoren sus prerrogativas exceptuando aquellas que prevean modificaciones de las contraprestaciones econ\u00f3micas previstas en favor del Estado o de las de Entidades Territoriales*\".\n\n13.\n\nAlso, the Colombian law principle of \"*confianza leg\u00edtima*\" (\"legitimate expectation or reliance\") comes into the picture. The retroactive application of the law to the detriment of acquired rights under Colombian law would be a still more blatant violation both of the legitimate expectations principle under international law and the *confianza leg\u00edtima* and acquired rights principles under Colombian law. It should be noted that under Colombian constitutional law, all of acquired rights, *confianza leg\u00edtima* and legal predictability (*seguridad jur\u00eddica*) fall within the protected ambit of the good faith principle and are thus united by a common thread10. It would then be the \"*rarest of circumstances*\" not to find a violation of Annex 811(2)(b) on the basis of the facts and the law applying in the present case, considered from the perspective of both applicable domestic and international law, including the reference in this provision to the principle of good faith. Such proximity between municipal and international law evokes the kind of convergence of legal principles underlined in the European Court of Human Rights decision referred to at para. 9 above.\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Decision No. 2233 (11 December 2014), at pp. 38-39 (Exhibit R-135).\n\n14.\n\nUnder Colombian law, there is no limitation on the operation of these principles in respect of environmental regulations. Specifically, Council of State Advisory Opinion 2233 of 11 December 2014 provides that: a) the doctrines of acquired rights and *confianza leg\u00edtima* apply (are not carved out or excluded) in connection with environmental regulations11; and b) both cases of retroactive application of the law in regard to acquired rights or of retrospective application of the law in connection with ongoing relationships give rise to compensation12. In fact, Constitutional Court Decision C-35 is an explicit acknowledgment of the retroactive effects of its determinations because it expressly states that it is purposely aimed at curing what is described as the then existing \"deficient legal protection of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems\"13, in other words, at modifying the then existing law.\n\n*Ibidem*, at pp. 36-37, no. 1.1.\n\n*Ibidem*, at 36-40. This is also the situation in international law: *infra*, fn. 36.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016), paras. 166-169 at pp. 140-141 (Exhibit C-42).\n\n15.\n\nIn the present case, notions of acquired rights and *confianza leg\u00edtima* under Colombian administrative law and converging notions of international law referred to above play a central role in the evaluation of the factual and legal context of the situations that give rise to these Treaty claims, including expropriation claims.\n\n16.\n\nFocusing now on the text of Annex 811 (2)(b), this provision requires an analysis of *pacta sunt servanda*, good faith, proportionality, legitimate expectations and abuse of rights. Such principles must be brought to bear when interpreting references to the \"severity\" or the \"purpose\" of measures concerned by the application of Annex 811(2)(b).\n\n17.\n\nAs argued by the Claimant and shown in the witness testimony of Mark Mosely Williams (unrebutted in this part), the Angostura deposit 150 hectares is the Concession's most attractive in terms of silver and gold reserves. This sector of the Concession overlaps 0.09 % of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo (assuming (*quod non*) the P\u00e1ramo delimitation pursuant to Resolutions 2090 of 2014 of the *Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible*14and Resolution VSC 829 of 2 August 2016 of the *Agencia Nacional de Miner\u00eda*15), but deprives the concessionaire of over 50 % of its Concession mining rights and renders mining under the Concession economically inviable16. However, neither the Constitutional Court Decision C-035 of 2016 nor Resolution 2090 of 201417, which preceded Resolution VSC 829, can be taken as the final criterion of delimitation since later Constitutional Court Decision T-361 of 2017 struck down Resolution 2090 and ordered a new delimitation of the P\u00e1ramo, albeit by taking into account the criteria set forth in Resolution 2090.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 2090 of 2014 (19 December 2014) (Exhibit C-34).\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution No. VSC 829 (2 August 2016) (Exhibit C-53).\n\nWitness statement of Mark Moseley-Williams (19 March 2018) at para. 59. More specifically, as a result of Resolution 2090, the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo overlaps with a) 50.7 % of the Concession and 32.4 % of the Angostura deposit; and b) 3.9 % of the restoration area under the Concession and 27.6 % of such area corresponding to the Angostura deposit (*ibidem*, at paras. 25-26).\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 2090 of 2014 (19 December 2014) (Exhibit C-34).\n\n18.\n\nNevertheless, the meaning or real effects of this latter Constitutional Court Decision are less than clear, since: a) it did not delineate the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo; b) in vague terms, it says that as a result of any delineation the levels of protection of the P\u00e1ramo cannot be lower \"as to the protection of the environment\" than the one afforded under Resolution 2090; c) still, it goes on to say, the demarcation of the P\u00e1ramo in such Resolution can be modified in view of errors committed in the demarcation; d) in any case, it also says, that any ensuing modification cannot adversely affect measures to protect or safeguard the P\u00e1ramo \"in global terms\"; and e) it states that in the delimitation the classification of P\u00e1ramo zones under the Alexander Humboldt Institute (IAvH) report must be taken into account18. At any event, the order in this Decision to the Ministry of the Environment to delimit the P\u00e1ramo within one year, in the form of an administrative act, was never carried out.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) at pp. 261-262 (Exhibit C-244).\n\n19.\n\nOn 24 December 2016, the Constitutional Court refused to clarify its Decision C-035 despite various indications from different sectors that its meaning and effects were unclear19. It should also be noted that different laws, resolutions or court decisions (e.g. Law 1930 of 201820 at Article 14; Resolution 769 of 2002 at Article 821, Constitutional Court decision T-361 of 2012 at para. 15.3.422; Council of State Advisory Opinion 2233 of 2014, at 7-8)23 impose on the State, in compliance with its constitutional duties, the unilateral obligation to acquire, on its own initiative, p\u00e1ramo areas, which, if complied with, would likely have avoided Colombian law and international law violations leading to the Claimant's claims in this case; however, despite the vital ecological importance of this natural resource and Colombia's constitutional duties which, since 1997 (Law 373), required Colombia to acquire p\u00e1ramo areas (and accordingly to delimit such areas to determine what was to be acquired) it granted instead, in 2007, a Concession to the Claimant without first establishing whether it overlapped or not with p\u00e1ramo area subject to Colombia p\u00e1ramo acquisition obligations. Colombia did not attempt either to acquire the concession rights it had granted the Claimant limited to the Concession sector comprising the Santurban P\u00e1ramo, which would have been in line with the mandate set forth in Law 373 to protect the p\u00e1ramos.\n\nConstitutional Court, Ruling 138/16 (6 April 2016) (Exhibit C-49).\n\nLaw No. 1930 (27 July 2018) (Exhibit R-51).\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 769 (5 August 2002) (Exhibit C-9).\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (Exhibit C-244).\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Decision No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (Exhibit R-135).\n\n20.\n\nNo due diligence in 2007 \u2013 when the Concession was executed \u2013 could have anticipated the uncertainties and accompanying contradictions created by State conduct postdating the Concession summarized in paras. 16-19 above24. Further, no due diligence on the side of the Claimant could have enabled it to predict the radical impairment of its Concession rights through host State conduct or justify the State's breach of its own, constitutionally mandated obligations to protect the p\u00e1ramos, reminded by the Colombian Council of State25, which were ignored when granting the Concession. In the specific context of the transactions at stake, this situation of inequality gives rise to both legal and moral obligations on the State not to unreasonably or disproportionately exercise its unilateral regulatory or police powers26, since the Respondent is solely responsible for failing to carry out any due diligence or conduct itself and for its lack of foresight when determining the legal entitlement vested in the private party under the Concession having in mind the social or State interests compromised by granting it.\n\nPost-Concession State conduct like conduct described, *inter alia,* at paras. 772-805 of the decision, as well as the facts and circumstances alluded to in its conclusion at para. 820, could not have been anticipated by the concessionaire when entering into the Concession.\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Decision No. 2233 of 11 December 2014, at pp. 16-99 (Exhibit R-135).\n\nJ.D.B Mitchell, *The Contracts of Public Authorities, a Comparative Study* (University of London (London School of Economics), 1954), at 91.\n\n21.\n\nFurther, blanket or general statements as to environmental protection prior to the Concession could not have alerted the Claimant about specific issues regarding its concession rights and their scope or delimitation, but certainly should have alerted the State not to grant concession rights actually or potentially interfering in its laws or obligations regarding P\u00e1ramo protection, including preliminary due diligence to avoid such interference, which should have included the delimitation of the P\u00e1ramo through State action prior to granting the Concession. It was exclusively in the hands of the State to delimit the P\u00e1ramo: the private party could not substitute itself for the State to carry out such delimitation. If the State did not have this foresight, nor could the Claimant have had it.\n\n22.\n\nThe IAvH was created pursuant to the 1993 General Environmental Law27. It took it 17 years to issue its 2007 Report on the p\u00e1ramos28, including Santurb\u00e1n, evaluating their fragility and establishing their general geographic dimension (but not the Santurb\u00e1n delimitation) after the execution of the Concession. The Claimant could not have anticipated this through a due diligence, that was clearly not undertaken by the State itself in protecting a P\u00e1ramo already identified in the Colombian maps since 185129 and \u2013 as it was of public knowledge \u2013 which had been subject to continuing \u2013 apparently destructive \u2013 mining operations since then without effective counter-action by the Colombian State despite this P\u00e1ramo's seemingly obvious delicate ecosystem characteristics.\n\nLaw No. 99 of 1993 (22 December 1993), Articles 16(c) and 19, (Exhibit C-66).\n\nIAvH, Atlas of Colombia P\u00e1ramos (2007) (Exhibit C-14).\n\nArticle La Silla Vac\u00eda \"El tal p\u00e1ramo de Santurb\u00e1n s\u00ed existe\" (8 September 2014) (Exhibit R-110).\n\n23.\n\nThe radical impairment of the concessionaire's acquired rights arising out of state conduct consisting, *inter alia*, of the uncertain Angostura deposit delimitation, rooted in turn in the uncertainty of the Concession delimitation itself, cannot be dissociated from the parallel neutralization of the exercise of such rights to, for example, obtain the mining licenses, necessarily requiring the previous delimitation of the licensed area in which the exploration and exploitation activities would be carried out. In such respect (and for all legal purposes, including for assessing the existence of an indirect expropriation under the Treaty), it is not possible \u2013 unless adopting a formalistic approach \u2013 to dissociate an acquired right under applicable law from its exercise: there is no distinction between denying the existence of an acquired right and neutralizing its exercise through private or State action or conduct, as it has happened in this case. Acquired rights are as much ignored when their existence is rejected as when their exercise is impaired. Therefore, a holistic evaluation of the situation at stake shows that the Claimant's acquired rights have been denied in their entirety and, accordingly, that an illicit taking under the Treaty has ensued.\n\n24.\n\nThe uncertainties in the Concession delimitation were in part prompted by social strife between water users in the city of Bucaramanga and miners in the Vetas Municipality. However, the Claimant did not originate nor could predict the impact of this social strife on the delineation of the P\u00e1ramo as a result of the measures. Rather, the State (in compliance with its basic political and social obligations) should have been aware of the clash of interests between different sectors of its population (as testified by Minister Luz Helena Sarmiento30 and acknowledged by the Colombian Constitutional Court31) which \u2013 as accepted in the decision \u2013 in substantial part account for the State's meandering conduct regarding the P\u00e1ramo before and after the adoption of the measures and the uncertainty regarding its delimitation, existing even today.\n\nHearing transcript, Day 2 (21 January 2020), at pp. 674-685.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (Exhibit C-244), paras. 19-20 and dispositive part, at pp. 254-284.\n\n25.\n\nTherefore, a comparative evaluation of the severity of: (i) the detriment to the P\u00e1ramo sought to be prevented by Resolution 2090, the Constitutional Court Decision C-35 and Resolution VSC 829 (collectively, the \"Measures\") in light of their purpose (as set forth in Annex 811 2 (b)), and (ii) the deprivation of the Claimant's rights caused by the Measures, must necessarily take into account that the P\u00e1ramo delimitation relied upon by the Measures when adopted was, without any fault attributable to the Claimant, not accurate, was still subject to modification or review, and in any case was not final, and that the Measures, which could not have been anticipated by the Claimant when contracting, were harmful to the Claimant by substantially depriving it from its acquired rights under the Concession, particularly in connection with the Angostura deposit. The Respondent was fully responsible for such uncertainty, the very existence of which also constituted a violation of the Respondent's constitutional duties. Such evaluation must also take into account the relatively minimum effects on the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo on mining the Angostura deposit, which \u2013 even if hypothetically considering the correctness of the P\u00e1ramo delimitation pursuant to the Measures \u2013 only affects less than 1% of the entire P\u00e1ramo.\n\n26.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the proportionality and abuse of rights principles \u2013 which are closely linked and operate in tandem \u2013 and the good faith principle, including the notion of legitimate expectations inherent to it, referred to in Annex 811(2)(b), require a weighing and balancing exercise32. Such balancing and weighing exercise, also warranted under Colombian constitutional law, is part and parcel of a determination of the scope and limits of such principles, in light of the State public and regulatory powers33.\n\nNot only this weighing and balancing exercise along lines of proportionality and reasonableness should be applied when construing and applying Annex 811(2) in accordance with international law, but it is also mandated under Colombian law in expropriation cases (when the constitutionality of the applicable norm is challenged, but which, *mutatis mutandis*, is set forth as a general principle (Constitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (Exhibit C-42), at paras. 52-53, 56-57, para. 61 at p. 64)). According to this Decision, the most stringent constitutional controls are brought to bear when applying such principle in situations in which a rule of law is applied retroactively, since in those cases, principles of legal certainty, good faith and *confianza leg\u00edtima* turn the weighing exercise table in favor of the private party (*Ibidem*, paras. 74-75 at p. 71).\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (Exhibit C-42), para. 124 at p. 117.\n\n27.\n\nThe adverse and severe impact of the Measures on the Claimant's Concession rights is undisputed, since it is not questioned that as a result of the Measures the Concession is, for all practical effects, deprived of economic value or, in other terms, that the Claimant's investment was destroyed. In view of the uncertain nature of the delimitation exercise on which the Measures are based, it is not possible to conclude that such Measures' objectives \u2013 protecting the P\u00e1ramo \u2013 were pursued or adopted in good faith or are proportionate to attaining such objective. The omission by Colombia to delimit the P\u00e1ramo before granting the Concession and Colombia however later resorting to its unilateral law making power to impose on the concessionaire a P\u00e1ramo delimitation the deficiencies of which have been already highlighted, thereby retroactively damaging the concessionaire's rights without compensation, is not compatible either with the principle of good faith, referred to in Treaty Annex 811(2)34. Absent a reliable delimitation of the P\u00e1ramo, it is not possible to grasp which is the real harm (if any) posed by the rights under the Concession to the purposes of protecting the P\u00e1ramo ecosystem purportedly sought by the Measures. Therefore, the severity of the harm inflicted on the Claimant is not proportionate to the protective objectives of the Measures since: a) obviously, the Measures were neither reasonable nor appropriate to such effect because the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation ensuing from the Measures could not be assumed to be final or correct in view of the Constitutional Court Decision T-361 of 201735, and b) the Measures were anyway enforceable irrespective of any action or opposition of the Claimant to such enforcement.\n\nThe good faith standard under international law is an objective one. There is no need to prove bad faith intention or motivation in order to show absence of good faith. As stated at para. 161 of *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award (13 November 2000) (Exhibit RL-55): \"*The intent of government is a complex and multifaceted matter* [and] [e]*ach of the many persons involved in framing government policy may approach a problem from a variety of different policy objectives and may sometimes take into account partisan political factors or career concerns. The Tribunal can only characterize CANADA's motivation or intent fairly by examining the record of the evidence as a whole*\".\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (Exhibit C-244).\n\n28.\n\nBecause of their purpose \u2013 protecting the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo \u2013 the Measures qualify as measures \"*designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives*\" alluded to in Annex 811(2)(b), which include the protection of the environment. However, the unilateral pursuit of such objectives by the State without the payment of compensation cannot be privileged without ignoring the reference to *rare circumstances* because an interpretation of this provision ignoring such express qualification of the State's rights to protect the public welfare would be incorrect: the reference to *rare circumstances* clearly signifies that such State rights are not absolute or unbound, and that their exercise, even if hypothetically assuming its validity under the applicable national law, may require \u2013 depending on the circumstances \u2013 compensation in order not to infringe international law36.\n\n\"*Expropriatory environmental measures \u2013 no matter how laudable and beneficial to society as a whole \u2013 are, in this respect, similar to any other expropriatory measures that a state may take in order to implement its policies: where property is expropriated, even for environmental purposes, whether domestic or international, the state's obligation to pay compensation remains*\". *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award (17 February 2000) (Exhibit CL-14), at para. 72.\n\n29.\n\nOn the other hand, the pursuit of such objectives by the State or, specifically, the purpose of the Measures, is not adversely affected, impeded, prevented or interfered with through the assertion or enforcement of the Claimant's rights under Annex 811(2)(b) seeking the payment of compensation under Treaty Article 811(1), since such payment does not preclude any action undertaken or to be undertaken by Colombia to protect the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo in pursuit of the public welfare protection objectives referred to in such Annex. In *rare circumstances* \u2013 like the ones described above \u2013 the severity of imposing the payment of compensation as a result of the Measures (the enforcement of which, or the advancement of the policies underlying them, was and remains unhindered) does not outweigh the severity of the deprivation of the Claimant's acquired rights under the Concession and of the ensuing destruction of the Claimant's investment.\n\n30.\n\nAs set forth in connection with State contracts against the backdrop of the exercise of State police powers:\n\n\"*The result of the general principle here advanced is therefore that the public authority may be exempt from performing its contract according to its strict expression, but that where this exemption results in a loss to the individual contractor compensation should be payable save where that payment would offend the principle. Such cases should arise only where the burden of payment would be such that it could not be borne by the public authority*\"37.\n\nThere is nothing in the record of this arbitration indicating or even suggesting that Colombia would not be able to bear the payment of the compensation due and payable to the investor in the present case.\n\nMitchell, cited *supra*, at 20. The exercise of overriding police power implies excluding the remedies of specific performance or injunctions or their equivalent but \"*Compensation is not thereby necessarily also eliminated, since it is the performance of, or abstention from, a particular act which is obnoxious to the general rule, and not the payment of money*\" (also at 20).\n\n31.\n\nConsequently:\n\n(i) The Measures retroactively impose a delimitation on the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, with direct and adverse impact on the Angostura deposit, and with the effect of substantially depriving the Claimant of the economic value of its acquired rights under the Concession without compensation, and thus constitute a violation of Treaty Article 811(1) and its Annex 811(2)(b).\n\n(ii) By retroactively imposing the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation but at the same time undermining the accuracy and reliability of such delimitation, and thus creating uncertainty as to the very scope of the Measures and their effects, the Respondent has violated the concessionaire's acquired rights under the Concession, deprived the concessionaire's rights of their economic value, and thus are part and parcel of the violation by the Respondent of Treaty Article 811(1) and Annex 811(2)(b).\n\n(iii) The Measures infringe Colombian constitutional law rules precluding the retroactive application of the law without compensation, the constitutional duties of the Colombian State regarding the delimitation of the P\u00e1ramo and the acquisition of P\u00e1ramo covered areas, and Colombian and international law principles precluding the violation both of legitimate expectations and contractual acquired rights under the Concession covered by the investment definition of the Treaty and protected under its provisions and international law.\n\n(iv) Even if the Measures' purposes were considered in isolation, the fulfilment of such purposes is not jeopardized since the enforcement of the Measures is not prevented nor is it rendered impossible or impracticable. For that reason, also in light of the considerations set out in paras. 5-30 above, not paying compensation as required by Treaty Article 811(1) would inflict severe and unwarranted damages to the investor, precisely in a *rare circumstance* situation pursuant to Treaty Annex 811(2)(b) in which compensation is warranted.\n\n(v) The above is confirmed by a weighing and balancing exercise carried out by taking into account the Measure's purposes and the harm suffered by the Claimant occasioned by the Measures. As a result of this exercise, the comparative severity of the harm and deprivation suffered by the Claimant and its investment resulting from the Measures outweighs the severity of the Respondent's obligation to compensate under the Treaty.\n\n32.\n\nUnder such circumstances, the Measures are: a) neither reasonable nor proportionate to the harm to the Claimant resulting from the Measures; i.e, the destruction of its investment; b) objectively incompatible with State conduct pursued in accordance with both international customary law principles of good faith, referred to in Treaty Annex 811(2)(b) (including the principles of proportionality and protection of legitimate expectations) and *pacta sunt servanda*; c) constitute an arbitrary deprivation of the Claimant's contractual rights under the Concession the exercise of which did not and does not preclude or prevent Respondent's actions seeking the protection of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo; and (d) thus constitute an illicit indirect expropriation in violation of Treaty Article 811(1) and its Annex 811(2)(b), which finally culminated on 8 August 2016 (date of notification to the Claimant of ANM Resolution VSC 829)."}],

This facilitates navigation within the document.\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of Section B of Chapter Eight of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia, signed on 21 November 2008 and which entered into force on 15 August 2011 (the \"**FTA**\" or the \"**Treaty**\"),2 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**); and Circular No. 024 of the Directorate of Foreign Commerce of the Ministry of Commerce concerning the entry into force of the Treaty (3 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-21**). See also Canada-Colombia Environment Agreement (also signed on 21 November 2008 and in force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit R-138**).\n\n**A.** **T****he** **P****arties**\n----------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe claimant is Eco Oro Minerals Corp. (formerly known as Greystar Resources Limited (\"**Greystar**\")), a corporation constituted under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, and trading publicly on the Canadian Securities Exchange (formerly, on the Toronto Stock Exchange), with its registered address at Suite 300-1055 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC V6E 2E9, Canada (\"**Eco Oro**\" or the \"**Claimant**\").3\n\nFor ease of reference, the Tribunal refers to the Claimant as Eco Oro even when referring to actions undertaken before it had changed its name from Greystar to Eco Oro.\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is the Republic of Colombia, a sovereign State (\"**Colombia**\" or the \"**Respondent**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\". The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**B.** **B****ackground to the** **D****ispute**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute relates to measures adopted by the Respondent in connection with the *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystem in Santurb\u00e1n, which allegedly have deprived Eco Oro of its mining rights under a concession contract for the exploration and exploitation of a deposit of gold, silver, chromium, zinc, copper, tin, lead, manganese, precious metals and associated minerals entered into on 8 February 2007 between Eco Oro and INGEOMINAS. The contract relates to the Angostura gold and silver deposit located in the Soto Norte region of the department of Santander, within the Vetas-California gold district: Concession Contract 3452 (\"**Concession 3452**\" or the \"**Concession**\").\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Colombia has breached its obligations under *(i)* Article 805 of the FTA by means of the unlawful, creeping and indirect expropriation of its investment; and *(ii)* Article 811 of the FTA by failing to accord Eco Oro's investment the minimum standard of treatment (\"**MST**\"). The Claimant seeks full reparation for what it deems to be the destruction of its investment in Colombia, claiming compensation for damage caused as a result of the Respondent's breaches and violations of the FTA and international law in an amount of USD 696 million, plus pre-award and post-award interest. The Respondent submits that Eco Oro's claims ought to be dismissed in their entirety as the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this dispute and there is no basis of liability accruing to Colombia under the FTA.\n\n7.\n\nSave as specified otherwise, the versions of the exhibits and relevant translations into English thereof referred to by the Tribunal in this decision are the ones provided by the Parties via the online case document repository (Box). In cases where the Parties have provided different translations of the same document or portion thereof, a table containing both translations is used.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal has given careful consideration to the extensive factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their written and oral submissions, and taken full account of the submissions from the Government of Canada. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to reiterate all such arguments, but rather addresses those arguments which it considers most relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal's reasons, without repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties, address what it considers to be the determinative factors required to decide on the requests of the Parties. Where the Tribunal considers, however, that a brief repetition of certain aspects of its conclusions in the context of particular issues is appropriate, it has done so. The Tribunal's analysis shall not be limited to authorities referred to by the Parties.4\n\nSee, e.g., *Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award (22 September 2014) (**Exhibit RL-96**), para. 568, fn. 460.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A.** **I****nitiation of the** **A****rbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 7 March 2016, the Claimant wrote to the Respondent, notifying it pursuant to Article 821(2)(c) of the FTA of the claims Eco Oro intended to submit to international arbitration (\"**Notice of Intent**\").5 In its Notice of Intent, the Claimant, *inter alia,* proposed to hold amicable consultations with Government representatives, with a view to establishing a constructive dialogue permitting to reach a negotiated solution to the dispute.\n\nNotice of intent to submit the claim to arbitration (7 March 2016) (**Exhibit C-48)**.\n\n10.\n\nOn 8 December 2016, ICSID received a request for arbitration from the Claimant against Colombia, accompanied by exhibits C-001 to C-061 (the \"**Request for Arbitration**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn 15 December 2016, the Respondent submitted to the Centre a copy of a Notice of Denial of Benefits sent on that same date to the Claimant by which Colombia stated that it denied the benefits of Chapter 8 of the FTA to Eco Oro and its alleged investments on the basis of Article 814(2) of the FTA.6\n\nLetter from the Republic of Colombia (Mr. Palau van Hissenhoven) to Eco Oro (Mr. Moseley-Williams) (15 December 2016) (**Exhibit R-20**).\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 20 December 2016, the ICSID Secretariat requested additional information from Eco Oro concerning its Request for Arbitration, which was provided on 22 December 2016.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 December 2016, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration, as supplemented on 22 December 2016, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n**B.** **C****onstitution of the** **T****ribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party, and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. Pursuant to the Parties' agreed method of constitution, failing an agreement of the Parties on the presiding arbitrator, she or he would be appointed by the Secretary-General of ICSID, without limitation to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of:\n\na. Ms. Juliet Blanch, a national of the United Kingdom, President, appointed by the Secretary-General pursuant to the Parties' agreement. Ms. Blanch's contact details are as follows:\n\nMs. Juliet Blanch  \nLamb Building  \n 3 rd Floor South  \nTemple  \nLondon  \nEC4Y 7AS  \nUnited Kingdom\n\nb. Professor Horacio A.

Professor Philippe Sands QC, a national of France, the United Kingdom and Mauritius,7 appointed by the Respondent. Professor Sands' contact details are as follows:  \nProfessor Philippe Sands QC  \nMatrix Chambers  \nGray's Inn   \nLondon WC1R 5LN   \nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe Parties were notified on 8 March 2021 of the fact that Professor Sands had been granted the nationality of Mauritius.\n\n16.\n\nOn 11 September 2017 and in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Arbitral Tribunal (the \"**Tribunal**\") was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Ana Constanza Conover Blancas, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C.** **I****nitial** **P****rocedural** **S****teps**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nOn 13 September 2017, ICSID received a letter from the *Comit\u00e9 para la Defensa del Agua y el P\u00e1ramo de Santurb\u00e1n,* the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), the Inter-American Association for the Defense of the Environment (AIDA), MiningWatch Canada, the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) (together, the \"**Petitioners**\") addressed to the Tribunal. In their letter, the Petitioners advised the Tribunal that one or more of them anticipated to submit a request for leave to participate in the arbitration as *amici curiae.* The Petitioners further requested the Tribunal to *(i)* make available to them the documents submitted to or issued by the Tribunal in the proceeding by establishing procedures for the publication of case materials, and *(ii)* establish a timetable for requesting leave for *amici* intervention, in order to avoid disrupting the proceedings. On 14 September 2017, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted a copy of the Petitioner's letter to the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n18.\n\nOn 22 September 2017, in response to an invitation to provide comments from the Tribunal, each Party filed observations on the Petitioners' letter of 13 September 2017.\n\n19.\n\nOn 10 October 2017, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, on behalf of the President of the Tribunal, to inquire whether the Parties would agree to the appointment of Mr. Joao Vilhena Valerio as an assistant to the President of the Tribunal in this case. By communications of 13 and 16 October 2017, the Parties confirmed their agreement on the appointment of Mr. Vilhena Valerio. On 30 October 2017, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted a copy of Mr. Vilhena Valerio's signed declaration of independence and impartiality to the Parties.\n\n**D.** **F****irst** **S****ession and** **W****ritten** **P****hase of the** **P****roceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nOn 21 November 2017, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n21.\n\nOn 30 November 2017, following the first session, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1**, recording the Parties' agreements on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on the disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 established, *inter alia,* that: the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, except to the extent modified by Section B of Chapter Eight (Investment) of the FTA and supplemented by any rules adopted by the Joint Commission of the Free Trade Agreement Between the Republic of Colombia and Canada (the \"**Commission**\") under Articles 822(2), 832, and 2001(3)(a) of the FTA; the procedural languages would be English and Spanish; the Tribunal's award and procedural orders, the notice of intent and the Request for Arbitration would be publicly available subject to the deletion of confidential information; and that the place of the proceeding would be Washington, D.C. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out three scenarios for procedural timetables for the written phase, including time limits for the filing of applications from non-disputing parties.\n\n22.\n\nOn 20 March 2018, the Claimant filed a Memorial on the Merits dated 19 March 2018 (the \"**Claimant's Memorial**\"), with exhibits C-62 to C-279 and legal authorities CL-1 to CL-91. The pleading was also accompanied by two witness statements and two expert reports, as follows: *(i)* Witness Statement of Mr. Mark Moseley-Williams dated 19 March 2018 (\"**First Moseley-Williams Statement**\"); *(ii)* Witness Statement of Mr. Wilmer Gonz\u00e1lez Aldana dated 19 March 2018 (\"**First Gonz\u00e1lez Aldana Statement**\"); *(iii)* Expert report of Behre Dolbear titled \"*Report on Eco Oro Minerals Corporation's Angostura Gold Project - Santander Department, Colombia\"* dated 19 March 2018, prepared by Mr. Bernard J. Guarnera and Dr. Robert E. Cameron (\"**First Behre Dolbear Report**\"), with supporting documents BD-1 to BD-36; and *(iv)* Expert report of Compass Lexecon titled \"*Valuation Assessment of the Angostura Project\"* dated 19 March 2018, prepared by Messrs. Pablo T. Spiller and Santiago Dellepiane A. (\"**First Compass Lexecon Report**\"), with supporting documents CLEX-1 to CLEX-66.\n\n23.\n\nOn 18 April 2018, the Respondent filed a request to address the objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question (the \"**Respondent's Request for Bifurcation**\") accompanied by exhibits R-1 to R-20 and legal authorities RL-1 to RL-30.\n\n24.\n\nOn 18 May 2018, the Claimant filed a response to the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Claimant's Response on Bifurcation**\"), accompanied by exhibits C-280 to C-300 and legal authorities CL-92 to CL-128.\n\n25.\n\nOn 4 June 2018, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it was inclined to join the jurisdictional objections to the merits and that the majority of the Tribunal had been discussing whether the most efficient conduct of the proceeding could lead it to bifurcate the damages phase. The Parties were invited to submit observations on this proposal, which were received on 15 June 2018.\n\n26.\n\nOn 28 June 2018, following additional exchanges between the Parties, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2**, dismissing the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation and joining Respondent's jurisdictional objections and issues related to quantum to the merits phase of the proceeding.\n\n27.\n\nBy emails of 17 and 20 August 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to propose to the Tribunal amendments to Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the timetable for the remaining procedural steps in the arbitration. In addition, the Parties proposed to reserve the last two weeks of January 2020 to hold an oral hearing.\n\n28.\n\nBy emails of 24 August 2018, in response to a consultation from the Tribunal, the Parties confirmed their availability to hold the pre-hearing organizational meeting set out in Section 20 of Procedural Order No. 1 on 20 December 2019, as well as their agreement to hold the hearing in Washington, D.C.\n\n29.\n\nOn 29 August 2018, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 3**, by which it approved the amendments to the procedural calendar proposed by the Parties on 17 and 20 August 2018, including the hearing dates and the date for the pre-hearing organizational meeting.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of 26 September 2018, the Respondent filed a request for a 60-day extension of the deadline set out in Procedural Order No. 3 to submit its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction. On 1 October 2018, in response to an invitation to provide comments from the Tribunal, the Claimant submitted its observations regarding the Respondent's extension request.\n\n31.\n\nOn 10 October 2018, following additional exchanges between the Parties, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 4** concerning adjustments to the procedural calendar. In its order, the Tribunal granted a 60-day extension to the Respondent to file its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction and allowed a 60-day extension to the Claimant for the filing of its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, if so required.\n\n32.\n\nBy communications of 26 and 29 October 2018, and 27 and 29 November 2018, the Parties consulted with the Tribunal concerning potential alternative hearing dates, in case the Claimant were to apply for a 60-day extension under Procedural Order No. 4 and the end-January 2020 hearing needed to be moved. Having consulted with the Parties, the Tribunal concluded that it was necessary to keep the January 2020 hearing dates to avoid several additional months of delay in the proceeding.\n\n33.\n\nBy communications of 18 and 20 December 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to propose amendments to the procedural calendar with respect to the timetable for the remaining procedural steps prior to the hearing.\n\n34.\n\nOn 19 December 2018, the Petitioners filed an application for leave to intervene as non-disputing parties pursuant to Annex 831 of the FTA and Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which included a request to file a written submission, to access case documents and to attend the hearing (the \"**Petitioners' Application**\").\n\n35.\n\nOn 21 December 2018, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 5**, approving the Parties' proposed amendments to the procedural calendar of 18 and 20 December 2018.\n\n36.\n\nOn 24 December 2018, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits (\"**Respondent's Counter-Memorial**\") and Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"**Respondent's Memorial**\"), with exhibits R-21 to R-154 and legal authorities RL-31 to RL-132. The pleading was also accompanied by four witness statements and two expert reports, as follows: *(i)* Witness Statement of Ms. Brigitte Baptiste dated 24 December 2018 (\"**First Baptiste Statement**\"); *(ii)* Witness Statement of Mr. Javier Garc\u00eda Granados dated 24 December 2018 (\"**First Garc\u00eda Granados Statement**\"); *(iii)* Witness Statement of Ms. Luz Helena Sarmiento Villamizar dated 24 December 2018 (\"**Minister Sarmiento Statement**\"); *(iv)* Witness Statement of Ms. Mar\u00eda Isabel Ulloa dated 24 December 2018 (\"**Ulloa Statement**\"); *(v)* Expert report of Charles River Associates (CRA) dated 24 December 2018, prepared by Dr. James C.

Rossi dated 24 December 2018 (\"**First Rossi Report**\"), with supporting documents MR-1 to MR-45.\n\n37.\n\nOn 28 January 2019, each Party filed observations on the Petitioners' Application. The Claimant's observations were accompanied by legal authorities CL-129 to CL-138 and the Respondent's observations were accompanied by legal authorities RL-133 to RL-138.\n\n38.\n\nOn 18 February 2019, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 6** concerning the Tribunal's decision on the Petitioners' Application. In its order, the Tribunal denied the Petitioners' request to file a non-disputing party submission, it denied the Petitioners' request to obtain access to case documents which were not publicly available, and it confirmed that the Petitioners had the right to attend the oral hearing as it was open to the public pursuant to Article 830(2) of the FTA and paragraph 21.8 of Procedural Order No. 1. The Tribunal concluded the following at paragraph 35 of Procedural Order No. 6:\n\n*\"[O]n the basis of the strikingly limited Application, the Tribunal does not find that the Petitioners have met the requirements of Arbitration Rule 37(2) and Annex 831 of the FTA, or even sought to meet those requirements. Those provisions impose on a petitioner a duty to set out reasoned arguments, and none are sufficiently present.\"*\n\n39.\n\nOn 22 March 2019, following exchanges between the Parties, each Party filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents.\n\n40.\n\nOn 5 April 2019, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 7**, ruling on the Parties' respective requests for document production.\n\n41.\n\nOn 1 June 2019, the Claimant filed a Reply on Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 31 May 2019 (\"**Claimant's Reply**\"), with exhibits C-301 to C-446 and legal authorities CL-139 to CL-198.

What legal relevance should the Tribunal attribute to such references given the fact that the claims in this case have been made under international treaties/international law?*\n\n***QUESTION 2*** *- Article 2201 of the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement provides, inter alia, as follows:*\n\n*'3. For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:*\n\n*a. To protect protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and health;*\n\n*b. To ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Agreement; or*\n\n*c. For the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.*\n\n*4. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures relating to nationals of the other Party aimed at preserving public order, subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitutes arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Parties understand that the rights and obligations under this Agreement, in particular the rights of investors under Chapter Eight (Investment), remain applicable to such measures.'*\n\n*What is the effect of the second sentence of the exception in Article 2201(4) (as emphasised in italics), and its absence from the exception in Article 2201(3), on the application of Chapter Eight (Investment) to the rights of investors in relation to measures to which the Article 2201(3) exception is applicable? It would be helpful if the assessment could take into account other treaty practise of Canada and Colombia.*\n\n***QUESTION 3*** *- What, if any, is the application and effect of the 'margin of appreciation enjoyed by national regulatory agencies when dealing with public policy determinations' (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Phillip Morris v. Uruguay, Award, 8 July 2016 (Authority RL-102), \u00b6 388) to the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo?*\n\n***QUESTION 4*** *- Both Colombian legal experts addressed Constitutional Court Decision C-339/02 of 7 May 2002 (Exhibit C-82) in their testimony on Day 4. In Decision C- 339/02, the Constitutional Court addresses a constitutional challenge against articles 3 (partially), 4, 18 (partially), 34, 35 (a) and (c) (partially), and 36 (partially) of the Mining Code 2001. This Decision, inter alia, provides as follows:*\n\n[...]\n\n*Article 34(1) prohibits mining exploitation and exploration works in such areas that are delimited and declared, in accordance with the regulations in force, as areas for the protection of renewable natural resources or the environment, or that expressly exclude mining activities. Up to this point, there are no objections to the provision, since it is in agreement with the principles set out in the Constitution for environmental and natural resource protection, which were discussed at the beginning of these recitals.*\n\n*Article 34(2) indicates that excluded areas comprise the following: a) The system of national natural parks; b) regional natural parks, and c) reserve forest areas. The aim is to protect biodiversity, given the great importance that Colombia has worldwide, as acknowledged by the Court in analyzing the issue. The Court also explains that, besides the areas excluded in this Law, there may be others, whether already declared or to be declared as such in the future by the environmental authority.*\n\n*Of course, excluded areas must be clearly geographically delimited by the environmental authority, in compliance with Article 5 of Law 99 of 1993. Provision is also made for cooperation by the mining authority in areas of mining interest, which is in keeping with the principle of priority protection of the country's biodiversity, along with sustainable exploitation, in accordance with universal and sustainable development principles included in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development dated June 1992, which was ratified by Colombia.*\n\n*The Court considers it worth mentioning that the mining authority must cooperate with the environmental authority, but this duty of cooperation does not limit or condition the exercise of the powers of the environmental authority, which is the one authorized to establish excluded areas. Thus, the operative part will make the enforceability of Article 34(2) of Law No. 685 of 2001 subject to certain conditions.*\n\n[...]\n\n*When applying paragraph 3, one must follow the precautionary principle, a principle which can be understood with the expression 'in dubio pro ambiente'. The same principle must be applied with respect to the fourth paragraph of article 34, in accordance with the principle number 25 of the Rio Declaration that states: 'Peace, development and environmental protection are interdependent and indivisible'.*\n\n*Assuming that Colombia is observing the precautionary principle referred to above \u2014 i.e., in dubio pro ambiente \u2014 so far as the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramos is concerned, does that have any impact on the consideration of its rights and obligations under international law ?*\n\n*Specifically, assuming that the fact that it has yet to delimit the p\u00e1ramo (see, e.g., Exhibit C-455) is legitimate and grounded on Colombia's duty not to allow activities that pose a risk irreversibly to affect the environment and its natural resources, does that prevent Colombia from incurring any possible responsibility under international law in case it is established that the investors' rights have been violated?*\n\n***QUESTION 5*** *- In discussing Constitutional Court Decision C-35 both Colombian legal experts referred to the right of many parties affected by the decision to seek compensation from the lower courts. What domestic legal options were available to a diligent investor to obtain compensation after the Constitutional Court's Decision C-35?*\n\n***QUESTION 6*** *- The parties are further invited to make any further submissions they believe relevant, if and only to the extent they believe it would be helpful to the Tribunal, arising out of the evidentiary hearing which took place between 20 - 24 January 2020.\"*\n\n61.\n\nOn 11 February 2020, the Government of Canada (\"**Canada**\") wrote a letter to the Tribunal providing written notice to the disputing parties and to the Tribunal that Canada intended to exercise its right to file a non-disputing submission on questions of interpretation of the Treaty pursuant to Article 827(2) of the FTA.\n\n62.\n\nOn 12 February 2020, the Tribunal invited Canada to file its written submission by 4 March 2020 and noted that the disputing parties would then have 21 days upon receipt of said submission to file observations on Canada's submission.\n\n63.\n\nOn 13 February 2020, the Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal requesting the Tribunal to place certain conditions and parameters on Canada's submission and the responsive submissions of the Parties.\n\n64.\n\nOn 17 February 2020, the Parties were invited to provide a joint booklet containing all the relevant legislation in Spanish and English and in chronological order so as to assist the Tribunal in preparation for the Tribunal's deliberations scheduled for 5 March 2020.10\n\nAs per the Tribunal's request during the Hearing: Tr. Day 2 (Ms. Blanch) 403:9 *et seq* and Tr. Day 5 (Ms. Blanch), 1584:14 *et seq*.\n\n65.\n\nOn 18 February 2020, the Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal conveying its endorsement to Canada's filing of a non-disputing party submission and deferring to the Tribunal as to when and in which conditions the Tribunal wished to receive such submission and the Parties' comments thereto.\n\n66.\n\nOn 19 February 2020, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties and to Canada, *inter alia,* as follows:\n\n*\"Having carefully reviewed and considered the parties' observations, the Tribunal concludes that it would be assisted by receiving a written submission from Canada that does not exceed 8 pages and is limited to the questions raised in the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 11 of 28 January 2020.*\n\n*In view of considerable time constraints related to the Tribunal's deliberations scheduled for 5 March 2020 in the present proceeding, the Tribunal is obliged to request that the written submission from Canada be received not later than* ***Thursday****,* ***27 February 2020****. The parties will be allowed to submit a brief reply submission by* ***Tuesday****,* ***3 March 2020*** *which shall not exceed 4 pages. The Tribunal apologises for the short time afforded to you in this regard, which is necessary to allow it to meet the demands of the schedule in this arbitration.*\n\n*The Tribunal notes that the deliberations it will hold on 5 March will be preliminary in nature. The Tribunal may raise further questions for the parties arising out of such initial deliberations.\"*\n\n67.\n\nOn 27 February 2020, the Claimant requested a 48-hour extension to the deadline for filing the post-hearing briefs. On the same date, the Respondent opposed the extension request.\n\n68.\n\nOn 27 February 2020, the Tribunal granted the Claimant's extension request and noted that the Parties could file their respective post-hearing briefs by 1 March 2020.\n\n69.\n\nOn 27 February 2020, Canada filed its non-disputing party submission (\"**Canada's Non- Disputing Party Submission**\").\n\n70.\n\nOn or about 28 February 2020, the Parties provided a Joint Booklet of Relevant Legal Instruments to the Tribunal in hard copy.\n\n71.\n\nOn 1 March 2020, the Parties filed their respective post-hearing briefs. The Claimant's submission was accompanied by an Annex containing corrections to the Hearing transcript (\"**Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief\"**). In footnote 212 of the Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, reference was made to a new, unnumbered, legal authority (i.e., Constitutional Court, Judgment T-299, 3 April 2008). The Respondent's submission was accompanied by a Consolidated List of Exhibits (on account of the reference made in the said submission to twelve new legal authorities - RL-176 to RL-187) (\"**Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief\"**).\n\n72.\n\nOn 3 March 2020, the Parties filed their respective comments on Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission.\n\n73.\n\nOn 5 March 2020, the Tribunal held a deliberations session in London, United Kingdom. Further sessions were held via Zoom on 8 February 2021 and 25 March 2021.\n\n74.\n\nNo notification was received from the Respondent pursuant to paragraph 41 of Procedural Order No. 10 with regard to the corrections to the Hearing transcript attached to the Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n75.\n\nOn 6 November 2020, 12 March 2021 and 6 August 2021, the Tribunal updated the Parties with regard to the status of its ruling pursuant to paragraph 5.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n**III.

The Tribunal does not purport to set out all facts it has considered for the purposes of this Decision. The absence of reference to particular facts or assertions, or to the evidence supporting any particular fact or assertion, should not be taken as an indication that the Tribunal did not consider those matters.

As far back as 1992, in its Judgment T-411/92, the Constitutional Court of Colombia,35 stated that:\n\n*\"Ecology contains an essential core, it being understood by this that part that is absolutely necessary so that legally protected interests and what gives rise to it turn out to be real and effectively act as a guardian. The essential content is overtaken or not recognized when the right is submitted to the limitations that make it unfeasible, making it more difficult beyond what is reasonable or divesting it of the necessary protection. The rights to work, private property, and freedom of business enjoy special protection, provided that there exists a strict respect of the ecological function, this is the duty to safeguard the environment due to a fundamental constitutional right.* \"\n\nPolitical Constitution of Colombia (1991) (**Exhibit C-65**).\n\nSee, *e.g.*, Constitutional Court, Judgment C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), pp. 93 and 98.\n\nConstitutional Court of Colombia, Judgment T-411/92 (17 June 1992) (**Exhibit R-134**). In this judgment, the Constitutional Court makes reference to \"*an Ecological Constitution.*\"\n\n85.\n\nAccording to Colombia, it has \"*a particularly significant moral responsibility to conserve and preserve its environment for the benefit of the planet and mankind.\"*36 Articles 8, 58, 79 and 80 of the Political Constitution establish the State's duty and the particulars of protecting the nation's natural wealth; the prevalence of general interest on the matter and the social and ecological function of ownership; the collective right to enjoy a healthy environment; the protection of diversity and integrity of the environment and preservation of the areas of special ecological importance as well as the State's duty to plan the management of natural resources to guarantee sustainable development, their preservation and restoration and prevent and oversee environmental impairment factors. Colombia is also a party to several environment-related international conventions, inter alia, the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (the \"**Ramsar Convention**\")37 and the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (the \"**Biodiversity Convention**\").38 Colombia has a diversified economy, which is guided by the principle of sustainable development.

The deposits occur in that order, from NE to SW, and are located in the western branch of the Eastern Andean Cordillera of northeastern Colombia near the border with Venezuela, some 400 km NNE of the Country's capital, Bogot\u00e1, and ~67 km NE of the city of Bucaramanga, the capital of the Department of Santander.

Spanish colonials exploited two open-pit operations in the district at San Antonio in the La Baja portion and at La Perezosa, immediately SW of La Mascota and NE of Angostura respectively. Production continued on a small scale through the next two and a half centuries. In the early 19th and 20th centuries the British company Colombian Mining Association and French company Francia Gold and Silver undertook operations that included a mill and smelter just outside the town of California. In 1947, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company took an option on a property at La Baja that encompassed the present La Bodega deposit and conducted exploration via tunneling and 746 m of drilling. Core recoveries were reportedly so poor that insufficient information was available to justify a large option payment and Anaconda withdrew. Nippon Mining Company undertook drilling in the La Baja area in 1967, whilst exploration was undertaken by Placer Development and INGEOMINAS in the 1970s and 1980s respectively.54\n\nPorter GeoConsultancy, California-Angostura district \u2013 Angostura, La Bodega, La Mascota (2015) (**Exhibit C-225**); and A.L.

The Deputy Minister of Mines stated that the aim of the reforms achieved by the 2001 Mining Code was to ensure \"*a more modern legislation, which gives legal stability to investors, in accordance with international standards.\"*68 The 2001 Mining Code provided for three phases: exploration, construction and exploitation in one unified concession contract.69 It further provided, *inter alia*, as follows:\n\n*\"ARTICLE 1. PURPOSES. The public interest purpose of this Code is to promote the technical exploration and exploitation of privately-held and state-owned mining resources; to foster such activities in order to meet the needs of domestic and foreign demand for such resources, and to ensure that these resources are exploited in accordance with the principles and regulations governing the rational exploitation of non-renewable natural resources and the environment, focusing on sustainable development and the country's social and economic progress as a comprehensive notion.*\n\n[...]\n\n*ARTICLE 15. NATURE OF THE BENEFICIARY'S RIGHT. The concession contract and other titles issued by the Government referred to in the preceding Article shall not grant the beneficiary any property right on the minerals 'on site,' but the right to exclusively and temporarily determine the existence of minerals in exploitable quantities and qualities within the covered area, and to take such minerals through extraction or abstraction, and the right to subject third party plots of lands to the easements required for the efficient performance of such activities.*\n\n[...]\n\n*ARTICLE 34. AREAS THAT MAY BE EXCLUDED FROM MINING. Mining exploration and exploitation works and projects may not be carried out in areas declared and delimited in accordance with the legal framework currently in force for the protection and development of renewable natural resources or the environment and which, in accordance with the relevant legal provisions, expressly exclude said works and projects. The aforementioned exclusion zones will be those constituted in accordance with the legal provisions in force, such as areas that comprise the system of national natural parks, regional natural parks and forest reserve areas. To that end, these areas should be geographically delimited by the environmental authority on the basis of technical, social and environmental studies with the collaboration of the mining authority, in those areas of mining interest.*\n\n*In order for mining exploration and exploitation works and projects to be excluded or restricted in areas for the protection and development of renewable natural resources or the environment, the act by which these are declared must be expressly based on studies that establish the incompatibility of or need to restrict mining activities. However, by means of a well-founded administrative act of the environmental authority that orders the subtraction of the required area, the mining authority may authorize that in the areas referred to in this article, with the exception of parks, mining activities may be carried out in a restricted manner or only by means of specified extraction methods and systems that do not affect the objectives of the exclusion zone. To that end, the interested party in the Concession Contract must present studies that demonstrate the compatibility of mining activities with such objectives.*\n\n[...]\n\n*ARTICLE 36. EFFECTS OF THE EXCLUSION OR RESTRICTION.*\n\n*In concession contracts, the areas, plots of land and courses where, pursuant to the above articles, mining activities are prohibited shall be deemed excluded or restricted by operation of law or conditioned by the granting of special permits or authorizations.*\n\n*This exclusion or restriction need not be declared by any authority whatsoever, or be expressly stated in acts and agreements, nor may be subject to any waiver by the bidder or concessionaire of such areas or plots of land. If such areas or plots of lands were actually the site of a concessionaire's works, the mining authority shall order they be immediately removed and cleared, without awarding any payment, compensation or damages whatsoever for this reason, notwithstanding the proceedings the competent authorities may commence in each case where applicable.*\n\n[...]\n\n*ARTICLE 45. DEFINITION.*\n\n*The mining concession contract is the agreement entered into between the State and an individual to carry out, at the individual's expense and risk, exploration works for state-owned minerals that may be found within a delimited area, and to exploit them under the terms and conditions established in this Code. This agreement differs from public works contracts and public services concession contracts. The phases comprised by the concession contract within its purposes are technical exploration, economic exploitation, mineral beneficiation at the concessionaire's expense and risk and closure or ceasing of the relevant works and construction.*\n\n*ARTICLE 46. APPLICABLE LAW.*\n\n*The mining laws in force at the time that the concession contract is perfected will be applicable throughout the term of its execution and extensions. If said laws are modified or added to at a later date, these laws will apply to the concessionaire only insofar as they broaden, confirm or improve its rights with the exception of those regulations that contemplate the modification of the anticipated economic revenues to the State or Territorial Entities.*\n\n[...]\n\n*ARTICLE 197. CONSTITUTION AND EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT. The conclusion of a concession contract and its registration in the National Mining Registry are regulated by the provisions of this Code.*\n\n*For the execution of this contract, before the commencement and performance of the exploitation work, all environmental requirements and conditions set forth in this Chapter, and for those not foreseen therein, those set forth in the general environmental regulations, should be met.**\"* [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nSee Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**). See also Speech of President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana on signing into force the Mining Code 2001 (15 August 2001) (**Exhibit C-274**) (\"*We have to bring new private investment to the country and pave the way for exploration and mining activities by businessmen. Evidently, a true causal link between national and foreign capital and the mining industry depends on the existence and upholding of clear, modern and competitive rules, and a clear definition of the roles for the State and of the private sector. Bearing this in mind and taking into account the need to adapt the 1988 mining legislation to the new global economic realities, and of course the tenets of the 1991 political constitution, the National Government has taken it upon itself to prepare, agree upon, and promote the adoption of a new mining code that ensures a stable and attractive regulatory framework for investment that is also fair and beneficial to all Colombians. These new regulations will be crucial to improve the competitiveness of the sector.*\").\n\nArticle El Tiempo \"Miner\u00eda, con 30 a\u00f1os de rezago\" (12 June 2000) (**Exhibit C-76**).\n\nArticle 58 (*Rights Under the Concession*) of the 2001 Mining Code.

Eco Oro was concerned that almost all its activities were above 3200 masl thus coming within the boundaries of the 2007 Atlas, including half of the open pit area, and this decision effectively stopped the project, causing it to be potentially unfeasible or uneconomic.86 Eco Oro published a news release on 26 April 20 1 0,87 which was echoed in several specialised news outlets.88 Eco Oro's market value collapsed that day.89\n\nEmail from S.

Eco Oro further argued that, even if Law 1382 were applicable, the requirements set out in Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code as amended by said law had not been complied with. Eco Oro noted that the IAvH was not an environmental authority and therefore had no jurisdiction to declare a mining exclusion zone. Eco Oro was concerned about the impact of MinAmbiente's decision and, in a report to the Board of Directors, the CEO noted that a \"*comprehensive communication plan [had] to be developed to inform and shape Government and public opinion that mining can be conducted responsibly alongside preservation of p\u00e1ramo and water resources.\"*91 It was also noted that CDMB was *\"getting more vocal on preservation of p\u00e1ramo\"* and that the publicity given to Eco Oro's permit issue was attracting the attention of NGOs who supported protection of the p\u00e1ramo and water resources from the activities of miners.\n\nLetter from Greystar (Mr. Felder) to Ministry of Environment (Mr. Pe\u00f1aranda Correa) (29 April 2010) (**Exhibit R-85**).\n\nGreystar, CEO report to the Board of Directors (3 May 2010) (**Exhibit R-160**).\n\n116.\n\nOn 19 May 2010, Eco Oro reported internally that it had had a *\"very good meeting with Martinez the Mines Minister\"* who had said the *\"Governments* [sic] *definitely wants the project to go ahead.*\"92\n\nEmail from Frederick Felder (Greystar) to Steve Kesler (Greystar) and others (19 May 2010) (**Exhibit C-323**).\n\n117.\n\nOn 27 May 2010, MinAmbiente overturned its previous order and directed that the assessment of Eco Oro's EIA be resumed on its merits.93\n\nMinistry of Environment, Order No. 1859 (27 May 2010) (**Exhibit R-15**).\n\n118.\n\nAs a part of the procedure required to be followed with respect to mining applications, MinAmbiente held public hearings in California and in Bucaramanga. The meeting in California, in November 2010, registered support for Eco Oro's mining project,94 while the one held in Bucaramanga in March 2011 was suspended due to violent confrontations.95 Several demonstrations took place in different parts of the country, some of them in support of the mining project and some others in support of p\u00e1ramo protection and water quality.96\n\nArticle Vanguardia \"Californianos manifiestan apoyo a Greystar\" (21 November 2010) (**Exhibit C-137**); Article Vanguardia \"As\u00ed fue la audiencia p\u00fablica de Angosturas\" (22 November 2010) (**Exhibit C-138**); Greystar News Release \"Greystar Announces Completion of Angostura Project Public Hearing\" (29 November 2010) (**Exhibit C-276**).

It is not the delimitation of an ecosystem for academic reasons or for the exclusive purpose of conservation; it is a very unexpected policy decision in the history of this country which excludes economic activities in about 3 million hectares of high mountain.*\n\n*Such delimitation, as an administrative act, was ordered by law - a law that was first established by the former mining code, which has been repealed. The law was more recently established in the development plan law, so it constitutes a fully effective mandate from Congress giving powers and instructions to the Ministry of Environment, the autonomous regional corporations and the Humboldt Institute.\"*\n\nSpeech by Brigitte Baptiste \"Por qu\u00e9 y para qu\u00e9 delimitar los p\u00e1ramos?\" (27 June 2013) (**Exhibit C-184**) (USB drive provided at the Hearing).\n\n130.\n\nOn 20 June 2011, Eco Oro requested Terms of Reference for the preparation of an EIA for an underground mine, as an alternative to an open pit mine.115 On 27 February 2012, ANLA provided the Terms of Reference and, due to the Project's location, invited Eco Oro to take into consideration in its EIA that the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo at a scale of 1:25,000 was underway pursuant to the provisions of Law No. 1450 and that the provisional boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo had been set forth in the cartography of the 2007 Atlas.116\n\nLetter Greystar (Mr. Heugh) to Ministry of Environment (Ms. Sarmiento) (20 June 2011) (**Exhibit C-153**).\n\nLetter from ANLA (Ms. Sarmiento) to Eco Oro (Mr. Heugh) attaching terms of reference for the Angostura underground mine project (27 February 2012) (**Exhibit C-24**).\n\n131.\n\nAt around this time, Eco Oro carried out a corporate rebranding,117 which signalled a significant change in corporate identity. According to Eco Oro's President and CEO at the time, *\"[t]he Greystar name has negative associations with Government in Colombia and in Bucaramanga. Rebranding is necessary. This can be achieved through renaming the Colombian company or through a corporate transaction. Clearly Government and public do not trust a junior with no CV to develop a large and sensitive project*.\"118 In a letter to MinMinas in 2013,119 Eco Oro summed up those changes as follows:\n\n*\"The changes that have taken place around the Angostura Project are translated, among others, in that it is being led under a new philosophy and a new strategic direction, nurtures itself from learning and knowledge of the experiences and mistakes of the past. Equally behind this project are new investors with a more human and environmental outlook; there is a new Board of Directors with the participation of Colombians interested in marking the development of this country and a new team mostly made up of Santandereans.*\n\n*You, Minister, must be aware of the abysmal differences between the old Greystar open-cast project from a technical and environmental point of view, and today's Eco [Oro] underground project. But perhaps, we have not made a big enough effort you [sic] pick up the feeling, the mood, the soul of those who day by day fight. Our company takes it from there and shapes, with realities, the dreams of thousands of families of the needy province of Soto Norte.*\n\n*Our identity is authentic and genuinely Colombian, and like you Dr. Amilkar, we are proud of it: for no reason - not even for gold - would we be at the forefront of a project that could undermine or jeopardise our land and our people.\"*\n\nCertificate of Change of Name of Eco Oro issued by the Registrar of Companies of British Columbia, Canada (16 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-23**).\n\nLetter from Steve Kesler (Greystar) to the Greystar Board of Directors (14 March 2011) (**Exhibit C-327**). In this letter, Mr. Kesler makes the following assertions with regard to the open-pit and underground options: \"*7. A preliminary evaluation of an underground project indicates a smaller project but with robust economics and at a capex that Greystar can manage. 8. EBX is developing a similar underground project at La Bodega.* [...] *10. Greystar does not want a NO decision to the current project as this is always difficult to reverse. An agreement with Government to delay a decision and allow a joint study of options for leach pads would be a better outcome. This was verbally agreed in Toronto. However, a change of location outside of the present project area (eg to Surata) will mean significant delay in undertaking, new baseline studies, geotechnical studies, project redesign and new EIA as well as engaging in land purchase. There would still be no guarantee of an environmental license. Bucaramanga objections to a cyanide heap leach in a water course feeding the city would remain. However, an option to develop the open pit in the future should 'be maintained. 11. The underground option requires a program of drilling to increase resources and to classify as reserves, more detailed mine design studies, plant location and tailings dam studies. Discussions in Toronto with concentrate traders indicated that a market does exist for pyrite concentrate and this needs to be developed as an alternative. With the development of Cerro Matoso's heap leach project there will be a market for acid in Colombia. This makes the option of off-site processing through roasting worth exploring. Minimization of project footprint in challenging topography has value in public perception as well as reduced site preparation costs.*\" See also Office of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO), \"Compliance Investigation, IFC Investment in Eco Oro (Project # 27961), Colombia\" (30 June 2016) (**Exhibit MR-10**).\n\nLetter from Eco Oro (Mr. Linares Pedraza) to the Minister of Mines (Mr. Acosta Medina) (25 November 2013) (**Exhibit R-94**).

ANM further ordered that, once the decision became final, the areas overlapping with the p\u00e1ramo be handed over pursuant to Article 82 of the 2001 Mining Code. On 29 August 2012, Eco Oro requested that Resolution VSC 2 be revoked in its entirety.125 On 12 September 2012, ANM issued **Resolution VSC 4**,126 whereby it amended its previous Resolution, stating that:\n\n*\"Based on the evidence of the validity of the applicability of Laws No. 1382 of 2010 and No. 1450 of 2011 to concession agreement No. 3452, how the legal exclusion indicated therein is to be put into practice should be considered, with the elements available to the mining authority and* ***based on the criteria of reasonableness, proportionality and responsibility****.*\n\n[...]\n\n*Hence, and in response to the arguments put forward by the mining title holder in its petition for reversal, it is* ***necessary to examine the rationality and proportionality of the decision contained in Resolution No. VSC-002****, dated August 8, 2012, based on the* ***undeniable fact that, at present, Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011 has not been developed, so there is no map at a more detailed scale to provide the mining authority with solid arguments to delimit with absolute certainty the p\u00e1ramo that the resolution is intended to protect.***\n\n*As a result, the decision in Resolution No. VSC-002, dated August 8, 2012, must be intended to protect both the collective right to the environment represented by the preservation of the p\u00e1ramo and the right of the holder of the mining title to preserve an area whose legal status is uncertain, because it cannot be said with complete certainty, due to the absence of technical parameters, that it is located within the p\u00e1ramo.*\n\n*However, the precautionary and prudent action that must be taken by the government agency concerning collective rights cannot go so far as to threaten subjective rights. Hence, the instruments provided for by the legal system have to be used to create conditions to suspend rights so that, when an uncertain condition is satisfied, the right is either granted or forfeited.*\n\n*Accordingly, and in response to the arguments put forward by the holder of the mining title in its petition for reversal filed under No. 2012-261-026565-2,* ***it is clear that the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem based on the map of the Alexander von Humboldt Research Institute is temporary until the competent environmental authority creates the final delimitation at a scale of 1:25,000 after carrying out the technical, economic, social and environmental studies referred to in Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011****. For this reason, the mining authority determination must be in line with said condition. Therefore, the mining authority considers it appropriate to adjust Article 1 of Resolution No. VSC-002 of 2012 and, therefore, will modify it to extend the exploration stage of mining concession agreement No. 3452 of 2007, suspending exploration activities in the area overlapping with the p\u00e1ramo, in accordance with the delimitation based on the map in the P\u00e1ramo Atlas of Colombia by the Alexander von Humboldt Institute, until the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development or the entity acting in its capacity issues the final delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo area in accordance with Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011.

The law directs us to produce the information necessary to delimit the p\u00e1ramo, but fails to provide us with the minimum tools or instruments to do so. During the first twelve months of that process, we really have to aggressively draw on the funding on which we depend in order to commence that process, which includes building a series of criteria and academic conferences that enable us to do our best.*\n\n[...]\n\n*The p\u00e1ramo demarcation process required by law is of national scale - this is very important - and the Institute must provide the requisite knowledge so that all the p\u00e1ramos of the country - thirty-four p\u00e1ramo complexes - may be delimited over the years, in a way that their biodiversity and ecological function is protected. For us, it is impossible, from a scientific point of view, to attain the detailed zoning or micro-zoning referred to by Alfredo Molina at the beginning of the session, since Colombia's poor information systems and handling and processing of environmental information are terribly, terribly underdeveloped. We strive to abide by the law starting from a national vision and from a process of estimation at successive, more detailed, scales, reach then more precise estimations, which will in any case always contain a significant level of uncertainty for decision-making processes, and which pave the way for the required processes of agreement.*\n\n*Up to now, the Institute has made no delimitation proposal, no. I am sure that any member of society may decipher, with the existing data, the boundaries and characteristics of the p\u00e1ramo. But from our point of view, we have an ecological and ecosystemic model with a 1:100,000 scale which is still extremely inaccurate. Based on the information available which will be gathered in the upcoming days, we will surely have to debate which delimitation is required by law, even with a 1:25,000 scale, which is probably not enough for the need or urgency of decision-making in specific points such as the Vetas and California municipalities.*\n\n*Now then, we have a great willingness and the time necessary to produce, let's say, the best state-of-the-art knowledge on the region's biology and ecosystem, and to discuss the rest of the information on social and economic studies. We also want to understand, very well, the dependence of the communities on the p\u00e1ramo's ecosystems and their lifestyles. A few days ago, we were in the countryside - specifically, in Vetas and Berl\u00edn - and we were told to leave. I perfectly understand the tension that we are working with, and it is absolutely not our intention to cause any conflict with the community at all, much less for the sake of a healthy environment built by local communities and minorities that depend on their daily activities to survive, but we also have to comply with the law.* \"\n\nMinutes No. 20 of 2013 (8 May) of the Fifth Constitutional Commission, Congressional Gazette No. 565 (26 July 2013) (**Exhibit C-340**).

In that context, the Attorney General requested the addressees of its letter, *inter alia,* to:\n\n*\"Avoid ideologization of the debate and make decisions based on comprehensive supporting studies; [...] Regularly share any progress made in the zoning and delimitation process for the sake of transparency; [...] Recognize any consolidated situations and vested rights to prevent the filing of legal claims against the Colombian state; [...] The National Mining Agency is required to proceed with caution to refrain from rejecting proposals or terminating agreements if there are conditions - such as the decisions made by the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development - that may threaten citizens and companies that, relying on the principle of confianza leg\u00edtima, have approached the State to propose or develop mining concessions.\"*\n\nLetter from Attorney General (Mr. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez Maldonado) to Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Mines and National Mining Agency (9 September 2013) (**Exhibit C-28**).\n\n142.\n\nOn 11 October 2013, the Santander Mine Workers' Union (SINTRAMISAN) sent a letter to MinAmbiente147 stating, *inter alia,* the following: \"*We only request that you DO NOT LIMIT OUR LIVES, JUST DELIMIT THE SANTURB\u00c1N P\u00c1RAMO.\"*\n\nLetter from Santander Mine Workers' Union (SINTRAMISAN) to Ministry of Environment (Minister Sarmiento) (11 October 2013) (**Exhibit C-278**).\n\n143.\n\nOn 7 November 2013, the Intersectoral Commission for Infrastructure and Strategic Projects (\"**CIIPE**\") was created.

This reduction in employment in the area has resulted in a complicated situation for civil unrest and illegality that will likely be aggravated if the delimitation of the P\u00e1ramo ecosystem covers an area larger than the Park. This is because the communities of the Soto Norte region are not prepared to allow their rights to be further affected; It is our duty to show that the Ministry of Environment's decision on the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo ecosystem should not ignore the acquired rights of mining titleholders of the Soto-Norte Region. This results in a sensitive situation from a juridical and political perspective because in the municipalities that make up the region, there are innumerable deposits of gold and silver, over which there are many mining titles that were acquired from the Constitution and the Law (some of which were granted under the terms of Law 2655 of 1988 and others under Law 685 of 2001), and registered in the National Mining Registry; [...] If the real objective is to preserve the area adequately, to prevent the proliferation of illegal mining and to avoid environmental disasters, displacement and misery, as well as a rise in unemployment and legal uncertainty, the area of the p\u00e1ramo should not be larger than the area of the park.\"*\n\nLetter from Mayors of Soto Norte *et al.* to Ministry of Environment (Minister Sarmiento) and CDMB (Mr. Anaya M\u00e9ndez) (24 February 2014) (**Exhibit C-201**) (USB drive provided at the Hearing).\n\n145.\n\nOn 29 March 2014, Minister of Environment Luz Helena Sarmiento (\"**Minister Sarmiento**\") gave an interview to a newspaper150 during which she said:\n\n\" '*Tomorrow, in Santurb\u00e1n, we will show the final boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo.

If the answer to the previous question is no, is the enforcing authority of such law required to immediately order the closure of all prohibited activities? Would such order result in potential liability for the State in relation to persons with an interest in legal situations which have already materialized in the area delimited as a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem?*\n\n*3. If the answer to the first question is no, is the government allowed to request compliance with such law in a gradual or progressive manner, in furtherance of the principle of legitimate expectations?*\n\n*4. Can the environmental authority, through zoning and the regime governing the uses of the delimited p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, adopt environmental actions to progressively and gradually allow the reconversion of prohibited activities in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, even when such activities had materialized before the entry into force of Law No. 1450 of 2011?*\n\n*5. Is it possible to file an application for an environmental license with the environmental authority in relation to mining titles that had been granted before the entry into force of such prohibition and that did not apply for or obtain the relevant environmental license authorizing the commencement of mining exploitation activities? Is the environmental authority, while Law No. 1450 of 2011 is in force, allowed to authorize mining exploitation activities by granting an environmental license for mining titles that were effective prior to the entry into force of the legal prohibition under Law No. 1382 of 2010?*\n\n*6.

(Emphasis added)* |\n| *This clause thus protects investors from direct or indirect expropriations, but in no way prohibits enactment of subsequent laws by the treaty states, instead establishing a guarantee of nondiscrimination, due process, good faith, and economic compensation.* | *This clause thus protects investors from direct or indirect expropriations, but in no way prohibits enactment of subsequent laws by the treaty states, instead establishing a guarantee of non-discrimination, due process, good faith, and economic compensation.* |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *In this way, the BITs allow, without infringement of the agreements, application of statutes enacted for reasons of public interest, as in this case would be the protection of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems as providers of water and biological diversity, and there are few reasons not to accept such protection in the overall context of protection and defense of the environment. As such, there would be no infringement of investment agreements in application of laws enacted for reasons of general interest (which the BIT allows as a power of the signatory governments), unless the Colombian government were to use discriminatory criteria or refuse to provide the necessary compensation for the specific situations affected by the new law.* [...] | *In this way, the BITs allow, without infringement of the agreements, application of statutes enacted for reasons of public interest, as in this case would be the protection of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems as providers of water and biological diversity, and there are few reasons not to accept such protection in the overall context of protection and defense of the environment.

The same resolution made some exceptions to the general prohibition to carry out mining operations in the area. Among other exceptions, the Resolution stipulated that mining operations could be authorised and executed in the restoration zones of the p\u00e1ramo located in the municipalities of Vetas, California and Surat\u00e1 (where Concession 3452 is located). Additionally, and generally, the Resolution contained a grandfathering provision, similar (but not identical) to that contained in Law 1382, which provided that those projects with a mining concession contract and with an environmental control and management instrument could continue with the operations despite being located in a p\u00e1ramo, not being nonetheless entitled to any extension. According to ANM, there were 54 current mining titles overlapping with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, in a superimposed area of 21,200.72 hectares, corresponding to 16.3% of the p\u00e1ramo complex.164 According to the Mining Registry, the delimitation approved by this Resolution 2090 entailed a 54.7% of overlap with the area granted to Eco Oro under Concession 3452.165\n\nMinistry of Environment Resolution No. 2090 of 2014 (19 December 2014) (**Exhibit C-34 / MR-35**).

A newspaper article dated 26 March 2016 referred to the fact that three companies were relying on the Free Trade Agreements executed by Colombia with the United States and Canada to demand that the mining agreements involving strategic ecosystems be honoured193 writing:\n\n\"*The delimitation of p\u00e1ramos in Colombia is paying off a historical debt to the environment, but it is also creating a legal limbo for companies that already held concessions with environmental licenses in those strategic areas.*\n\n*In addition to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo, eight other ecosystems were delimited this week and the Government expects that, by the end of this year, the other 27 high-mountain systems will have their boundaries delimited to protect them from mining and hydrocarbons extraction, following the decision of the Constitutional Court that, even before its prohibition in 2010, there should not have been any projects in such strategic areas. But the Government had allowed the continuation of such projects until the expiration of the contracts, precisely to prevent legal disputes.*\n\n*According to the National Mining Authority (ANM), there are more than 475 mining titles - 286 in exploitation - that overlap with 28 p\u00e1ramos, covering an area of 127,000 hectares. Such concessions are held by nearly 100 companies and 300 individuals who will have to cease their activities as p\u00e1ramos continue to be delimited.*\n\n*Eco Oro, formerly Greystar, a Canadian company that has been developing the Angostura mining project for twenty years in the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo, has sparked the first flame. A couple of weeks ago, ignoring the authority of the Ministry of Mines and the National Mining Authority, the company sent a letter to President Juan Manuel Santos, communicating its intention to formally initiate amicable settlement proceedings, invoking the provisions of the free trade agreement with Canada that provide legal protection to foreign companies.*\n\n[...]\n\n*'We have invested USD 250 million, have progressed this project for twenty years and the idea is to continue to make progress towards that goal, obviously respecting the environment, the p\u00e1ramo. I have also seen the film 'Wild Magic' and we are all aware that this is an ecosystem we need to take care of, but that does not entail that mining cannot be done. There are compatibilities, and that is what we are looking for,' stated Mark Moseley-Williams, President of Eco Oro.*\n\n*For such reason, the Government is debating whether to halt the mining locomotive that it so enthusiastically announced in 2010 or to seek solutions so that these businesses can carry out their mining projects without affecting the ecosystems. How will it act with respect to the mining titles that overlap with the p\u00e1ramos? Why did it grant concessions within those ecosystems? How feasible is it that an international tribunal could undermine the country's autonomy?*\n\n*The Minister of the Environment, Gabriel Vallejo, has already agreed that there will be strict compliance with the judgment rendered by the Constitutional Court, ordering the eradication of any mining activities currently carried out in the p\u00e1ramos and that new mining titles in them not be granted.*\n\n*'Following the resolutions that I have signed regarding the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramos, with respect to mining and hydrocarbons, environmental licenses shall, in accordance with the relevant limitations, cease to be in force. And we are working with the Ministry of Mines to make a decision regarding titles currently in force in order to have them terminated on the basis of the Constitutional Court decision.'*\n\n*In any case, the Minister said that companies are entitled to file any claims they may consider appropriate if they believe their rights have been violated. However, 'we are abiding by a decision of the Court.'*\n\n*Another question that comes into play is: Why did the Government grant concessions in the ecosystems?*\n\n*First, because doing so had only been impliedly prohibited under a section of the 2010-2014 Development Plan, but with the exception that the companies holding concessions with an environmental license granted prior to 2010 could perform exploitation activities in the p\u00e1ramos until their contracts were terminated. However, that is what the high court objected to.*\n\n*According to the former comptroller for environmental matters, Mauricio Cabrera, he warned on several occasions, in his capacity as advisor to the Ministry of the Environment, that granting titles in such areas would cause legal problems in the future.*\n\n*'Later, in 2013, the Office of the Comptroller General issued a warning because that year, the Government reopened the mining registry. We said it was inappropriate and that under the circumstances it was not appropriate to grant mining titles in the country again. Nevertheless, this is what occurred.'*\n\n*That is to say, the problem that the Executive attempted to avoid six years ago has just reappeared with Eco Oro's warning. However, this is not the only one that the Colombian Government will have to face. Cosigo Resources and Tobie Mining and Energy are already demanding compensation in the amount of USD 16.5 billion. The companies argue that after the declaration of the national natural park of the Yaigoj\u00e9-Apaporis reserve, in 2007, their mining rights were unlawfully revoked, in violation of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States.*\n\nMinutes of a meeting of the Board of Directors of Eco Oro Minerals Corp.

Eco Oro further alluded to an additional source of uncertainty, arising from the fact that some decisions by ANM identified that mining was prohibited in the preservation zone, whereas other decisions noted that such prohibition extended to the restoration zone as well. Finally, Eco Oro stressed that the CDMB (the environmental authority responsible for licensing the Project) had recently informed Eco Oro that, given the lack of clarity regarding the regulatory framework applicable to the Project, it was not in a position to process or grant an environmental license requested by Eco Oro so that the Angostura Project could progress to the construction and mounting and, subsequently, exploitation phases, until the litigation currently on foot was resolved.\n\nLetter from Eco Oro (Ms. Arenas Uribe) to the National Mining Agency (Mr. Garc\u00eda Granados) (7 March 2017) (**Exhibit C-241**).\n\n181.\n\nOn 23 March 2017, Eco Oro replied to ANM with regard to Resolution VSC 10, noting that it was not the competent authority for making this type of determinations: the Colombian State and particularly the mining and environmental authorities were the bodies that should develop the guidelines that the mining title holder was to follow, in accordance with their own interpretation of the Law and case law.214\n\nLetter from Eco Oro (Ms. Arenas Uribe) to the National Mining Agency (Mr. Garc\u00eda Granados) (23 March 2017) (**Exhibit C-242**).\n\n182.\n\nOn 24 April 2017, the Supreme Court of British Columbia rendered a Judgment215 with regard to a petition by the Requisitioning Shareholders to set aside the issuance of shares by Eco Oro's Board of Directors to Trexs, Amber Capital LP (\"**Amber**\"),216 Paulson & Co.

The truth is that p\u00e1ramos are strategic ecosystems because they are the main matting that protects and allows the distribution of water in our country. We are lucky to have around 50% of all the p\u00e1ramos in the world here in Colombia. This is why the Administrative Prosecutor's Office, through the head of environmental matters, adopted several measures to protect these ecosystems.*\n\n*[...] Also, recently, we requested from the National Mining Agency the exclusion of all protected areas, particularly p\u00e1ramos, and that all works and activities conducted by concessionaires be immediately suspended and abandoned without compensation, as mandated by Article 36 of the current Mining Code.*\n\n*And regarding the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo, in light of the Constitutional Court's decision, we are following up on the discussions held with the Ministry of the Environment and, of course, we are working towards the p\u00e1ramo's delimitation before the end of the current administration.'*\n\n*Question: 'What do you mean by 'abandoned'?'*\n\n*Answer: 'I mean that, sometimes, mining areas overlap with protected areas because titles were granted on protected areas where mining cannot be conducted.

Against this backdrop, ECO ORO commenced na arbitration against the Republic of Colombia under the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia in order to seek compensation for the destruction of the value of its investments in Concession 3452 and the Angostura Project.

An interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section, and any award or other ruling under this Section shall be consistent with the interpretation*.\"270\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**). Footnote 10 to Article 832(1) of the Treaty further provides that \"*[i]n accordance with international law, and where relevant and as appropriate, a Tribunal may take into consideration the law of the disputing Party. However, a Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine the legality of a measure, alleged to be in breach of this Agreement, under the domestic law of the disputing Party.*\"\n\n211.\n\nThe applicable law for the interpretation of this Treaty is public international law. The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the relevant rule on the interpretation of treaties is that embodied in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (the \"**VCLT**\").271 The supplementary means of interpretation of treaties is set out in Article 32 of the VCLT. Articles 31 and 32 provide as follows:\n\n*\"Article 31. GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION*\n\n*1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:*\n\n*(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;*\n\n*(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.*\n\n*3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:*\n\n*(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;*\n\n*(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;*\n\n*(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.*\n\n*4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.*\n\n*Article 32. SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF INTERPRETATION*\n\n*Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:*\n\n*(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or*\n\n*(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"*\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S 331 (**Exhibit CL-3**). Canada and Colombia are both parties to the Vienna Convention.\n\n212.\n\nAs mentioned above, Article 832(1) of the FTA provides that \"[a]*n interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section, and any award or other ruling under this Section shall be consistent with the interpretation.\"* It shall be noted that, on 24 October 2017, the Commission issued Decision No. 6 (\"**Commission's Decision**\"),272 providing, *inter alia,* as follows:\n\n*\"The Joint Commission, acting under subparagraph 3(a) of Article 2001 of the Colombia-Canada Free Trade Agreement (hereinafter, the 'Agreement'), reviewed Chapter Eight of the Agreement. In this respect, the Joint Commission decided that Articles 803, 804 and 805 be authoritatively interpreted as follows in order to clarify and reaffirm their meaning:*\n\n*1. Investment and Regulatory Measures*\n\n*For the purpose of Chapter Eight, the Parties reaffirm the right of each Party to regulate within its territory to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the promotion or protection of safety, health, the environment, cultural diversity or gender equality, or social or consumer protection.*\n\n*2. National Treatment and Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment*\n\n*(a) Whether treatment is accorded in 'like circumstances' under Articles 803 and 804 depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguishes between investors or covered investments on the basis of legitimate policy objectives.*\n\n*(b) The 'treatment' referred to in Article 804 does not include procedures for the resolution of investment disputes between investors and States provided for in other international investment treaties and other trade agreements. In addition, substantive obligations in other international investment treaties and other trade agreements do not in themselves constitute 'treatment', and thus cannot give rise to a breach of Article 804, absent measures adopted or maintained by a Party.*\n\n*3. Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law*\n\n*(a) The concept of 'full protection and security' in Article 805 refers to a Party's obligations relating to the physical security of investors and covered investments.*\n\n*(b) If an investor of a Party submits a claim under Section B of Chapter Eight, including a claim alleging that a Party has breached Article 805, the investor has the burden of proving all elements of its claim, consistent with general principles of international law applicable to international arbitration. This includes the burden to prove a rule of customary international law invoked under Article 805, through evidence of the elements of customary international law referred to in footnote 2 of Chapter Eight.*\n\n***CLOSING PROVISION***\n\n*The adoption by the Joint Commission of this or any future interpretation does not indicate an absence of agreement between the Parties about other matters of interpretation of the Agreement.* \"\n\nJoint Commission of the Free Trade Agreement Between the Republic of Colombia and Canada, Decision No. 6 (24 October 2017) (**Exhibit R-139**).\n\n213.\n\nIt shall be noted, nonetheless, that the Claimant challenges the applicability of the Commission's Decision in the present case, as it was rendered almost a year after Eco Oro commenced this arbitration against Colombia. According to the Claimant, that would retroactively modify Article 805 of the Treaty, in violation of Article 28 of the VCLT.273 The Respondent, in turn, submits that the Claimant's argument is without merit, as the Commission's Decision *\"merely confirms the meaning of the FTA as it already existed. It does not seek to modify the text in accordance with the existing international law jurisprudence*.\"274\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 415.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 425.\n\n214.\n\nAs a result of the Tribunal's application of public international law, the results it reaches in the interpretation and application of the FTA may differ from the results that would be reached through the application of municipal law in the courts of Colombia.\n\n**VI. PRELIMINARY MATTERS / JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal's jurisdiction has been invoked by the Claimant pursuant to Chapter Eight of the FTA.275 The Respondent submits that the Claimant bears the burden of establishing that its claims fall within the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction and are admissible and raises a series of objections to the Tribunal's consideration of the merits of the dispute.276 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the present dispute277 on the grounds that:\n\na.

This provision is similar to the counterpart provisions in NAFTA, CAFTA and certain BITs and serves to safeguard against *\"free-rider\"* investors.279\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 7, invoking *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v.

It is common ground that the relevant date to assess this is 8 December 2016: see para. 109 of the Claimant's Response on Bifurcation, in which the Claimant makes reference to *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

Indeed, Eco Oro does not even meet its own *\"chosen\"* definition that \"ownership\" and \"control\" exist if \"*a non-Party owns more than 50% of its shares, or exercises de facto control over the company through the operation and the selection of members of its board of directors or any other managing body* .\"283\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 92.\n\n222.\n\nTurning first to ownership, Eco Oro's public filings confirm that, at the relevant time, Delaware corporations Amber, Paulson and Trexs, together with Bermudan corporation Harrington, owned 49.61% of Eco Oro's shares as of December 2016.284 There is no requirement, either in the FTA or by reason of any authorities, that the ownership or control must be by a single non-Canadian entity or that if more than one entity, they must be shown to be acting in concert. Colombia relies on a plain reading of the Treaty: Eco Oro has not denied that a majority of Eco Oro's beneficial owners were non-Canadian at the relevant time and, as 49.61% of its shareholding was owned by Delaware corporations (Amber, Paulson and Trexs) and Bermudan company (Harrington), \"*the obvious inference is that a majority of Eco Oro's shareholders were non-Canadian* .\"285\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 11; Eco Oro Notice of Annual General and Special Meeting of Shareholders and Management Information Circular (12 September 2017) (**Exhibit R-9**); Eco Oro Press Release \"Eco Oro Completes Plan of Arrangement\" (16 October 2017) (**Exhibit R-34**); and Press Release by Requisitioning Shareholders regarding Meeting to Reconstitute Board (10 February 2017) (**Exhibit R-32**).\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 91.\n\n223.\n\nTurning next to the question of control, the Investment Agreement entered into between Eco Oro and certain parties defined in the Investment Agreement as Participating Shareholders (including Trexs, Amber and Paulson and Ms. Stylianides, Eco Oro's Board's Executive Chair),286 is *\"unorthodox and objectionable as a matter policy and principle.*\"287It gave control over Eco Oro to Trexs, Amber and Paulson, all being non-Canadian entities at this time. The Investment Agreement was rendered necessary because of Eco Oro's *\"financial position at the time, and its decision to abandon bona fide mining operations and instead focus on obtaining funding to bring this arbitration.*\"288 In particular, Trexs was granted the following rights which gave it *\"significant rights of control over Eco Oro, including the right to appoint a board member\"* :289\n\na.

This gave them the right to control both Eco Oro and its claim. Whilst the terms of the CVRs are not public, an Eco Oro shareholder circular stated that:\n\n\"[A] *change of control would not be possible without the consent of Tenor, and the CVRs in effect allow Tenor and the Participating Shareholders to have full control over the Arbitration and other operations of Eco Oro.*\n\n[...]\n\n*The Investment Agreement, including the issuance of the CVRs, differ from customary arrangements to finance the Arbitration in that they provide for:* [...] *control of the Arbitration vesting in Tenor and the Participating Shareholders rather than the Company; events of default that effectively prevent any change of control of the company or of management.*\" 291\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 16; Eco Oro, \"Let's fix Eco Oro\" Shareholder Circular (27 March 2017) (**Exhibit R-39**), p. 4.\n\n225.\n\nChapter 418, Article 1(1) of the British Columbia Securities Act defines a \"control person\" as follows:292\n\n\"[I]*f a person or combination of persons holds more than 20% of the voting rights attached to all outstanding voting securities of an issuer, the person or combination of persons is deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to hold a sufficient number of the voting rights to affect materially the control of the issuer*[\u2026]\"\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 17 (containing an incorrect reference to Exhibit R-50); Securities Act of British Columbia (Undated) (**Exhibit R-48 / C-436**).\n\n226.\n\nGiven the Participating Shareholders held *(i)* shareholdings in excess of the 20% threshold; and *(ii)* rights under their respective investment agreements, Eco Oro was controlled by the Participating Shareholders.\n\n*(ii) Eco Oro Had No Substantial Business Activities in Canada*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nAt all material times, Eco Oro's sole business focus has been the Angostura Project as evidenced, for example, by its Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016,293 which state that its *\"focus\"* is on the Project's development and Eco Oro's Memorial, which provides that Eco Oro has been \"*singularly focused*\" on the Angostura Project.294 Eco Oro also described itself to the MinMinas as \"*genuinely Colombian.*\"295 The activities stated by Eco Oro to have been undertaken in Canada do not amount to \"*substantial business activities*\" whether or not taken individually or cumulatively: they are corporate, financing and administrative activities and not business activities and as such are *\"ancillary, secondary activities that do not form a part of Eco Oro's business.*\"296 To be substantial requires \"*at a minimum\"* activities *\"beyond the normal activities or functions required merely by the fact of its corporate existence* [...].\"297 Indeed, to have had substantial business activities in Canada, Eco Oro would have needed to have acquired mining titles in Canada298 and can only rely on its own activities and not on the activities of third parties in Canada.299\n\nEco Oro, Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (31 March 2016) (**Exhibit R-37**).\n\nEco Oro, Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (31 March 2016) (**Exhibit R-37**), sections 1 and 5, para. 1; Claimant's Memorial, para. 1.\n\nLetter from Eco Oro (Mr. Linares Pedraza) to the Minister of Mines (Mr. Acosta Medina) (25 November 2013) (**Exhibit R-94**).\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 24.\n\nC.

That was the time at which it should *\"analyse whether the objective conditions for the denial are met and, if so, decide on whether to exercise its right to deny the benefits.*\"301 A 'retroactive' denial would not be contrary to the Treaty's objective and purpose. Eco Oro knew that it had no substantial business activities in Canada and that it was owned or controlled by non-Canadians and so would have been aware that Colombia could exercise this right at the time it made its investment. The Treaty protections are thus conditional upon Colombia's right to deny Eco Oro such benefits.302\n\nLetter from the Republic of Colombia (Mr. Palau van Hissenhoven) to Eco Oro (Mr. Moseley-Williams) (15 December 2016) (**Exhibit R-20**).\n\n*Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC v.

Indeed, there is no limitation in the FTA as to the time at which Colombia may exercise its right to deny the benefits of Chapter Eight, the only applicable time limit being that imposed by ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 requiring a respondent to submit its jurisdictional objections no later than the date fixed for the filing of the Counter-Memorial (which time limit Colombia complied with).\n\n230.\n\nFurther, the FTA is based on the Canadian model foreign investment promotion and protection agreement which includes a denial of benefits clause which reproduces the equivalent provision in NAFTA Article 1113(2), subjecting the State's exercise of denial of benefits to *\"prior notification and consultation\"* As this specific prior notification and consultation language is omitted from the FTA, Canada and Colombia must have expressly decided not to subject the exercise of denial of benefits to \"*prior notification and consultation\"* Eco Oro's response that the parties to the FTA thought these words were unnecessary or implied is unsupported by evidence, inherently improbable and based entirely on conjecture. The logical inference is that the parties to the FTA intended to omit the requirement.\n\n231.\n\nIn support of its submissions, in addition to the *Ulysseas* and *Guaracachi* decisions, Colombia also cites the decisions in *Pac Rim*303 and *Empresa El\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador.*304\n\nIn *Pac Rim*, El Salvador raised denial of benefits as an objection to jurisdiction over two years after the claimant had submitted its claim to arbitration. The United States filed a submission as a Non-Disputing Party, observing that any requirement that a DR-CAFTA Party invoke the denial of benefits clause before a claim is submitted to arbitration \"*would place an untenable burden on* [that] *Party* [\u2026] *to monitor the ever-changing business activities of all enterprises in the territories of each of the other six CAFTA-DR Parties that attempt to make, are making or have made investments in the territory of the respondent.*\" Agreeing with this submission and applying Article 31(1) of the VCLT to the interpretation of the denial of benefits clause, the tribunal concluded that \"[t]*here is no express time-limit in CAFTA for the election by a CAFTA Party to deny benefits*\" and \"*the Respondent's consent to ICSID Arbitration in CAFTA* [\u2026] *is necessarily qualified from the outset by* [the denial of benefits clause at] *Article 10.12.2*\". Having found that both the substantive and procedural requirements for the denial of benefits were met, the tribunal dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction. See *Pac Rim*, Decision on Jurisdictional Objections (1 June 2012) (**Exhibit CL-118**), paras. 4.56, 4.83, 4.90; and Respondent's Reply, para. 83.\n\n*Empresa El\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/9, Award (2 June 2009) (**Exhibit RL-148**).\n\n232.\n\nThe object and purpose of a treaty cannot give rise to limitations of the rights of a State through the imposition of new conditions for the exercise of its rights that are not provided for under such treaty.305 Canada and Colombia did not include any requirement as to the time by when such a denial should be invoked, hence no such requirement falls to be imposed.306\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award (22 August 2012) (**Exhibit RL-152**), paras. 164-165.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 84.\n\n233.\n\nFinally, the reason the relevant time to assess compliance with the nationality requirements of ownership and control is at the time an investor files its Request for Arbitration is precisely because it is only at this time that a State can consider and exercise its denial of benefit rights; it would be unworkable for it to be expected to investigate the nationality of an investor's ownership or control each time an investment is made.307\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 85.\n\n***(b) The Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n*(i) Colombia Cannot Deny Eco Oro the Benefits of the Treaty*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nColombia cannot retrospectively deny Eco Oro the benefits of the FTA; in any event, Colombia has failed to show either that Eco Oro is owned or controlled by non-Party investors or that it has no substantial business activities in Canada.\n\n235.\n\nThe purpose of a denial of benefits provision is to give a State the opportunity to counteract nationality planning and protect itself from abuse by investors whose investment the State did not want to protect (i.e., free-riding or treaty shopping via corporate structuring). The present case is precisely the converse: Eco Oro is a Canadian company that has made investments directly into Colombia for over two decades, its Canadian nationality having been acknowledged by Colombia during the totality of this time and its investments in Colombia having been praised by Colombia.308 It is of note that Colombia has not even been able to identify the non-Party State whose nationals it claims own or control Eco Oro.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 690-691.\n\n*(ii) Colombia Cannot Retroactively Deny Eco Oro the Benefits of the Treaty*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nArticle 814(2) must be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning in light of the object and purpose of the FTA. The preamble of the FTA states that the object and purpose of the FTA is, *inter alia*, to \"*ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment*.\" Permitting a retroactive denial of the Treaty's benefits would achieve precisely the opposite - a putative investor would have no certainty as to whether its investment would or would not be protected.\n\n237.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention specifies that the date on which the Tribunal's jurisdiction is to be evaluated is the date on which the Request for Arbitration is filed. Pursuant to the ICSID Convention, \"[w]*hen the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally*.\" Colombia's consent is provided for in the FTA and Eco Oro's consent was given when it filed its Request for Arbitration. At that point, consent to arbitration was perfected and from that date, pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, Colombia could not thereafter deny the benefits of the Treaty to Eco Oro insofar as they apply to the present dispute. This interpretation is supported by *Plama*309 and the vast majority of decisions that have been determined subsequently. The fact that most of these cases have been decided under the Energy Charter Treaty (the \"**ECT**\") is irrelevant -the underlying principle and logic applied by the respective tribunals apply with equal force here. Just as Article 17(1) of the ECT *(i)* requires the relevant State to give notice of the denial to the investor (it sets forth a reservation of rights mechanism which to be effective must be exercised), *(ii)* is phrased in the present tense310 and *(iii)* has, as its object and purpose, the need for certainty and predictability, the same applies to Article 814(2). The use of the word \"*may*\" in Article 814(2) indicates that the State has to take a decision which must be communicated to the investor. Once it is accepted that notice must be given, such notice can only have prospective effect.311\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction (8 February 2005) (**Exhibit RL-3**).\n\n\"[\u2026] [e]*ach Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part* [\u2026].\" Energy Charter Treaty (signed on 17 December 1994; in force on 16 April 1998) (**Exhibit CL-155)**, Art. 17(1).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 50.\n\n238.\n\nThe words excluded from the Canadian model foreign investment promotion and protection agreement (the reference to \"*prior notification and consultation*\") have no linkage with the retrospective denial of benefits. In any event, the mere absence of words is insufficient, without evidence, to draw any conclusion as to the joint intention of the parties to the FTA. An absence of requirement for prior notification for a denial of benefits is at odds with the object and purpose of the FTA; in any event, Colombia did give notice to Eco Oro and must therefore accept that provision of notice was a prerequisite to denying the benefits of Chapter Eight of the FTA.\n\n239.\n\nFinally, whilst the relevant time for assessing the substantive requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention was the date of filing of the Request for Arbitration, that does not mean Colombia did not need to raise its jurisdictional objections based on the denial of benefits provisions until it filed its Counter-Memorial. Referring back to the need for certainty, if Colombia could deny the benefits of the FTA to an otherwise putative qualifying investor without ever telling it so, such an investor would not be operating within a *\"predictable\"* framework and long-term business planning and investment would be frustrated.\n\n*(iii) The Conditions For Invoking the Treaty's Denial of Benefits Are Not Met*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe correct test as to whether a non-Party owns or control a majority of the voting stock is not 50% +1 but even if it were, Colombia has failed to meet it. To have the right to deny the benefits of the FTA to Eco Oro, Colombia must show either that the alleged non-Party or Parties have outright ownership of 100% of Eco Oro's equity or, alternatively, that such investors are able to exercise *de facto* control by their ownership of more than 50% of the voting stock.\n\n241.\n\nWith respect to the test of *\"ownership\",* the ordinary meaning of the word \"*own*\" implies outright ownership. In breach of the VCLT, Colombia imports into the text the concept of majority ownership. Eco Oro is owned by the holders of its common shares which were at the relevant time (and still are) traded on the stock exchange. Eco Oro is not required by law to maintain any record of the nationality of its shareholders. The same applies to its beneficial owners. Eco Oro is obliged312 to maintain a central securities register recording *(i)* the name and last known address of each registered shareholder and *(ii)* the number of shares held. However, this requirement does not apply to the beneficial owners of its shares. Pursuant to section 87 of the Securities Act of British Columbia, shareholders that own or control 10% or more of its issued shares must file a report which is publicly available disclosing the volume of shares owned or controlled.\n\nBusiness Corporations Act of British Columbia (Undated) (**Exhibit C-435**), Section 111(1).\n\n242.\n\nEven if ownership included majority ownership, the three documents referenced by Colombia313 do not evidence Colombia's assertion that, according to its public filings, the share ownership percentage of three of its shareholders amounted to 49.61% as of December 2016. No inference should be drawn as to the nationality of its shareholding from the non-production of information to which Eco Oro has no access. Were Colombia's construction to be correct, if over 50% of Eco Oro's stock were owned by non-Canadian investors, even if each such investor only owned a single share, on the basis that collectively they would own over 50%, Eco Oro would be held to be owned or controlled by investors of a non-Party. This is nonsensical. Investors cannot make decisions for Eco Oro; that is a matter that is determined by its governance structure. In any event, all non-Party investors must be from the same third country, as is clear from the text that specifies the investors must be from *\"**a* *non-Party\"* (the Tribunal's emphasis following Eco Oro's argument). As its shares are listed on a liquid stock exchange, Eco Oro's shareholders frequently change and it would generate significant uncertainty if the right to be assured of treaty protection depended on the dynamics of the stock market on any particular day.\n\nEco Oro, Notice of Annual General and Special Meeting of Shareholders and Management Information Circular (12 September 2017) (**Exhibit R-9**); Eco Oro Press Release \"Eco Oro Completes Plan of Arrangement\" (16 October 2017) (**Exhibit R-34**); and Press Release by Requisitioning Shareholders regarding Meeting to Reconstitute Board (10 February 2017) (**Exhibit R-32**).\n\n243.\n\nWith respect to *\"control\",* at the relevant date, no shareholder owned (whether as the registered owner or beneficially) 20% or more of Eco Oro's outstanding shares. Therefore, no one owned the 50% +1 threshold required to constitute control for the purposes of Article 814(2). Colombia has adduced no evidence in support of its assertion that the Participating Shareholders were acting in concert.\n\n244.\n\nColombia's references to Canadian domestic law are irrelevant: the FTA must be interpreted according the provision its ordinary meaning. However, even if Canadian domestic legislation were relevant, Colombia has referred to the wrong Canadian statute - the Securities Act of British Columbia (which does not address issues of control) instead of the Business Corporations Act of British Columbia, which provides as follows:\n\n\"[A] *corporation is controlled by a person if (a) shares of the corporation are held, other than by way of security only, by the person, or are beneficially owned, other than by way of security only, by (i) the person, or (ii) a corporation controlled by the person, and (b) the votes carried by the shares mentioned in paragraph (a) are sufficient, if exercised, to elect or appoint a majority of the directors of the corporation.*\"314\n\nBusiness Corporations Act of British Columbia (Undated) (**Exhibit C-435**), Section 2(3); Claimant's Reply, para. 711.\n\n245.\n\nThe question of \"control\" is fundamentally a question of corporate law and the correct statute is the Business Corporations Act of British Columbia.315 No non-Party exercised *de facto* control: at the relevant time the Board of Directors comprised eight members and no shareholder had sufficient shares to be able to control the appointment of directors to the Board. Pursuant to its Articles of Association,316 Eco Oro is governed by two bodies: *(i)* the shareholders, who take decisions on either a two-thirds supermajority basis or a simple majority basis depending on the nature of the issue to be decided upon; and *(ii)* the board of directors, who are appointed by the shareholders and who take decisions on those issues delegated to it on a majority basis. Pursuant to these provisions, a shareholder would need to have appointed at least four of the six directors to be able to \"*control*\" Eco Oro and that could only be achieved by a shareholder holding in excess of 50% of the voting stock. On the relevant date (as detailed above) no shareholder held that percentage of voting stock.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 711.\n\nArticles of Incorporation of Eco Oro (5 May 2005) (**Exhibit C-10**).\n\n246.\n\nThe Investment Agreement did not give Trexs control over Eco Oro: whilst it required Eco Oro to take all commercially reasonable steps to appoint a Trexs nominee to the Board or, absent such appointment, to permit a Trexs nominee to attend board meetings as an observer, this type of provision is commonly required by capital providers making equivalent investments. Thus, whilst Trexs had a contractual right to have a candidate *considered* for appointment to the board (and at the relevant time had a nominee appointed to the board) such appointment was not guaranteed. In any event, the ability to appoint one member of a six-person board does not equate to control.\n\n247.\n\nWith respect to the provisions of the Investment Agreement, Trexs' veto rights are standard negative covenants in corporate finance and, rather than an usurpation of control by Trexs, they are an exercise of the powers granted to Eco Oro's board of directors under the Articles of Association. Again, the consultation rights and rights to receive information are not an assertion of control but a standard feature of financing agreements. Indeed, it is noteworthy that, having received the Trexs CVR, Colombia made no further submissions as to its giving of control, no doubt on the basis that the actual text was not supportive of Colombia's initial submissions.\n\n248.\n\nEco Oro has substantial business activities in Canada. Whilst the words *\"substantial business activities*\" are not defined in the FTA, it is typically interpreted by tribunals to require the investor-claimant to be more than a \"*shell company*\" with business activities that are *\"nominal, passive, limited and insubstantial*\"317 and that *\"substantial\"* refers to the substance of the activity rather than its form.318 The purpose of the denial of benefits provision is to ensure shell companies are not established and used to manufacture jurisdiction. Eco Oro has maintained its place of business in Canada since 1987 and, in that time, has bought and contracted for many services, including: mineral sample storage, laboratory testing, assay analysis, metallurgical test and resource estimation. In addition, it conducts corporate and commercial activities in Canada such as its finance and investor relations, it trades its shares on a Canadian stock exchange, complies with Canadian security filing obligations, raised equity funding, maintains active Canadian dollar denominated bank accounts with the Bank of Montreal in Canada and holds its annual general meetings in Canada. The fact its primary (or only) investment is outside Canada is irrelevant: it has continuously had substantial business activities in Canada and has also carried out exploration projects in Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Indonesia, the USA as well as Canada.319\n\n*Pac Rim*, Decision on Jurisdictional Objections (1 June 2012) (**Exhibit CL-118**), para. 4.75.\n\n*Amto*, Final Award (26 March 2008) (**Exhibit CL-107**), para. 69.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 84.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nAs an initial point, the Tribunal notes that Colombia does not assert that Eco Oro is a \"*free rider*\" or that it has made any attempt to treaty shop. It is not disputed that Eco Oro has maintained business functions in Canada since 1987 (the issue being whether or not those functions were substantial) and Colombia has from time to time acknowledged both Eco Oro's Canadian nationality and referred, in positive terms, to the existence and importance of Eco Oro as a Canadian investor and to the importance of the Angostura Project itself.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal first turns to Colombia's contention that Eco Oro is owned or controlled by investors of a non-Party. The FTA does not refer to a majority or partial ownership, it simply specifies ownership and it contains no definition. The ordinary meaning of \"*own*\", when not circumscribed by adjectives such as \"*partial*\" \"*shared*\" or \"*majority*\" connotes full or complete ownership. The Tribunal therefore construes \"*own*\", as used in the FTA, to require 100% ownership. An investor with less than 100% ownership falls to be considered in the second limb, namely whether they have the ability to exert control. Colombia has not asserted that 100% of Eco Oro's shares were, at the relevant date (8 December 2016) owned by a non-Party and the Tribunal therefore finds that Colombia has not shown that Eco Oro was owned by a non-Party.\n\n251.\n\nTurning to the question of *\"control\",* Colombia contends that the Tribunal should infer that 50% plus one shares were owned by investors of a non-Party given 49.61% of its shareholding was owned just by three Delaware corporations and one Bermudan company. Colombia says it is irrelevant whether or not such non-Party shareholders were acting in concert as there is no such requirement in the FTA: Eco Oro was controlled by investors of a non-Party.\n\n252.\n\nIt is not accepted by Eco Oro that 49.61% was owned by investors from a non-Party but, in any event, turning to the express wording of the FTA, the requirement is for *'control'*. This must mean, on an ordinary reading of the word, actual not putative control. It is insufficient that if all the non-Canadian investors were to act in concert, they would be able to exercise control. The Tribunal must make its decision on the basis of the facts - was Eco Oro controlled by investors of a non-Party? Whilst it may be that Amber, Trexs, Paulson and Harrington were acting in concert, even if they did collectively own 49.61%, this could not result in control. Colombia has adduced no evidence that any of the other non-Canadian shareholders were acting in concert, nor that there was any communication of any nature between them. The Tribunal cannot plausibly proceed on the basis that it should infer control in these circumstances. This is particularly so given the nature of Eco Oro's governance structure, which both requires shareholders to take decisions either by a simple majority or a two-thirds majority and provides that a shareholder may only appoint a Director to Eco Oro's Board if such shareholder holds in excess of 50% of the voting stock (Colombia has not adduced evidence to show any shareholder held that percentage on the relevant date).\n\n253.\n\nThere is further no provision in the Investment Agreement which evidences that Trexs was able to, let alone did in fact, control Eco Oro (and the Tribunal notes that, having received the CVRs, Colombia did not pursue its submissions that they gave the Participating Shareholders control over Eco Oro).\n\n254.\n\nHaving determined that Eco Oro was neither owned nor controlled by investors of a non-party on the relevant date, Colombia was not entitled to deny the benefits of Chapter Eight to Eco Oro. It is therefore unnecessary to consider Colombia's other submissions, but the Tribunal notes that those business activities described by Eco Oro (and which activities Colombia did not dispute took place) were sufficient to comprise substantial business activities in Canada. The Tribunal does not see there is any requirement for Eco Oro to have acquired a mining licence in Canada to meet this limb. It is further unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider whether, to be effective, any notice should have been served on Eco Oro notifying it of Colombia's exercise of its right to deny Eco Oro the benefits under the FTA nor by when such notice, if required, should have been exercised.\n\n**B.** **W****hether** **E****co** **O****ro is a** **P****rotected** **I****nvestor under the** **FTA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nArticle 838 of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n\"[...] ***investor of a Party*** *means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or an enterprise or national of a Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment. A natural person who is a dual citizen shall be deemed to be exclusively a citizen of the State of his or her dominant and effective citizenship. A natural person who is a citizen of a Party and a permanent resident of the other Party shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the Party of which he or she is a citizen.*\"320\n\nFootnote 12 to Article 838 of the Treaty further provides that: \"*For greater certainty, it is understood that an investor 'seeks to make an investment' only when the investor has taken concrete steps necessary to make said investment, such as when the investor has duly filed an application for a permit or license required to make an investment and has obtained the financing providing it with the funds to set up the investment.*\" Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**).\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* because the true beneficiary of the claim is a Delaware-incorporated US company - Trexs - to whom Eco Oro assigned the benefit of its claim in July 20 1 6.321\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 31. See Investment Agreement between Eco Oro and Trexs (21 July 2016) (**Exhibit R-12**) and Investment Agreement between Eco Oro and Trexs, Schedule A: Contingent Value Rights Certificate (21 July 2016) (**Exhibit C-452**).\n\n*(i) Nationality under the FTA falls to be determined by reference to the true beneficiary of the claim*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nIt is a well-established principle of international law that only a real party in interest has standing to sue,322 such that the nationality of a claimant falls to be determined by reference to the beneficiary party and not the nominal claimant.323 Indeed, this principle is reinforced by the provisions of Article 819 of the FTA which gives standing to a claimant to submit, \"*on its own behalf,\"* a claim that it \"*has incurred loss or damage\"* arising from an FTA breach. Therefore, it is not sufficient that Eco Oro is a Canadian incorporated company if it does not stand to benefit from the claim.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment of the Award (2 November 2015) (**Exhibit RL-98**); Respondent's Memorial, fn. 41.\n\n*The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award (26 June 2003) (**Exhibit RL-62**).\n\n258.\n\nThis principle is not overridden by the *lex specialis* regime created by certain of the FTA's definitions. There is insufficient specificity in the FTA and Article 838 does not provide that complying with the definitions of *\"investor\"* and *\"investment\"* is a sufficient rather than just a necessary condition to establish a claimant's standing to bring a claim. The FTA is subject to and consistent with principles of international law on standing and there is no clearly evinced intention that the contracting States intended to derogate from this.\n\n259.\n\nWhilst no case has yet considered the issue, commentators observe that where, prior to the commencement of an arbitration, a funding arrangement is entered into which gives rise to a *de jure* or *de facto* assignment of the benefits of a claim to an entity that does not satisfy the nationality requirements, the tribunal will lack jurisdiction *ratione personae* as the nationality requirement should be considered by reference to the funder's nationality.324 The fact there are no prior cases applying this principle to this fact pattern is immaterial as third-party funding of this nature is of recent origin.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, fn. 46.\n\n*(ii) The FTA's Nationality Requirement was to be satisfied at the date of the Request for Arbitration*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe FTA's nationality requirement falls to be determined at the date of the submission of the dispute to arbitration as that is when the agreement to arbitrate is formed both under the FTA and international law. This was 8 December 2016.\n\na. The Nationality Requirement was not satisfied at the date of the Request for Arbitration because Eco Oro had assigned its claim to Trexs\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nAs of 8 December 2016, Eco Oro had already assigned the benefit of its claim to Trexs pursuant to the Investment Agreement which was \"*in substance and effect an assignment of the benefit of the claim by which Trexs became its main beneficiary and the party in control of it*.\"325\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 40.\n\n262.\n\nTrexs became the main beneficiary: not only was it granted 51% of the proceeds of the claim (whereas Eco Oro only stood to benefit by 22.7% of the proceeds), it was also granted certain rights enabling it to control the process of the claim. These include the ability to control all material aspects of the claim, including the right to veto any settlement or termination of the arbitration and the rights to appoint a member to the board of directors, to be provided with relevant information concerning the claim and to be consulted in relation to filings and certain steps in the arbitration.\n\n263.\n\nIn addition, the Investment Agreement itself recognised, by implication, that it was assigning the claim to Trexs by virtue of one of the representations and warranties which provided that\n\nEco Oro had not \"*other than pursuant to* [the Investment Agreement] *assigned all or any portion of* [its claims under the FTA].\"326\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 43; Investment Agreement, Section 13(s)(ii) (**Exhibit R-1**).\n\n264.\n\nTherefore, as at the date the arbitration was commenced, the actual beneficiary of the claim was Trexs, a Delaware corporation. Accordingly, the FTA's nationality requirement is not satisfied.\n\n***(b) The Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n*(i) Eco Oro is an \"investor \" with Canadian nationality as defined in Article 838 of the Treaty*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nEco Oro complies with the requirements of the FTA: as accepted by Colombia,327 it was incorporated in accordance with the applicable laws of Canada and it is a qualifying investor for protection under the FTA in accordance with the definitions of *\"investor of a Party\"* and \"*enterprise.*\"328 That in itself is sufficient as the FTA only requires that an enterprise (Eco Oro) be \"*constituted or organized*\" under the laws of Canada (which Eco Oro is) and permits the submission of a claim to arbitration by any \"*investor*\" of one of the FTA's contracting parties. Colombia has failed to identify any other provision requiring the application of additional criteria. The Treaty requirements are clear and precise and no additional requirements need to be implied; giving effect to the FTA as *lex specialis* is consistent with rules of international law.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 19.\n\nEco Oro notes it is a company constituted under Canadian law, therefore qualifying as an investor pursuant to Article 801(1) of the FTA. As required by Article 821(2)(d) of the FTA it included copies of: *(i)* its Certificate of Good Standing issued by the Registrar of Companies of the Province of British Columbia, Canada (Annex B); and *(ii)* The Certificate of Existence and Legal Representation of Eco Oro's branch [*Sucursal*] in Colombia issued by the Chamber of Commerce of Bucaramanga (Annex C).\n\n266.\n\nColombia's argument to the effect that there is an established rule of international law that the beneficiary of a claim is the proper party to the claim such that the nationality of the claimant falls to be decided by reference to the nationality of such beneficiary is both illogical and misplaced: illogical because in the case of publicly traded entities there will rarely be a single beneficiary of a claim as such entity will have several economic stakeholders and the nationality of such stakeholders may change several times in any one day; and misplaced because the nationality provisions in the FTA are *lex specialis.* Tribunals apply nationality criteria strictly; indeed, one of the commentators cited by Colombia notes that \"*the nationality of the claimant would be unaffected by the fact that the proceeds of the award may go directly to a third party.*\"329 Pursuant to international law, a corporation's nationality is established by its place of incorporation330 and not by the ultimate destination of the proceeds of any claim.\n\nP. Pinsolle, \"Comment on Third-Party Funding and Nationality Issues in Investment Arbitration\", Transnational Dispute Management 639, Vol. 10 (2013) (**Exhibit RL-29**), pp. 644, 646.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 26, invoking *Barcelona Traction Case*, ICJ Reports 3 (1970) (**Exhibit CL-200**) para. 71.\n\n267.\n\nColombia misstates and misapplies the principle and legal authorities upon which it seeks to rely as each relates to the nationality of the beneficial owner of the underlying property the subject of the dispute (i.e., the investment that gave rise to the dispute) and not the beneficiary of the claim itself. It has not been disputed that Eco Oro has full legal title to Concession 3452.\n\n268.\n\nAccordingly, Eco Oro is an investor pursuant to the provisions of the FTA and thus has standing to bring this arbitration.\n\n*(ii) Eco Oro has not assigned its claims to Trexs*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nWhilst irrelevant, Eco Oro has not assigned its claim to Trexs, it has merely granted an economic interest in its proceeds which has no effect on its own nationality. Trexs is just one of several equity and debt holders in Eco Oro and, as with other investors, it has provided capital to help both Eco Oro's business in Colombia as well as to finance the arbitral proceedings. It is not a third-party funder, but even if it were, recent cases concerning third-party funding have concluded that in the absence of express wording in the relevant treaty to the contrary, tribunals should opt for \"*informed indifference*\" towards a funder's involvement with respect to the admissibility of the claim.331 In the present case, the FTA requires nothing more of Eco Oro than that it is an *\"entity constituted under the laws of Canada\"* which it is. The FTA definitions are clear: there is therefore no justification or necessity for the Tribunal to import any additional requirements into it.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 676, quoting J. von Goeler, \"Third Party Funding in International Arbitration and its Impact on Procedure\" (2016) (**Exhibit CL-125**), pp. 239-240. This author argues that the  \n\"*[t]ransfer of economic interest (or 'beneficial interest') to a funder of a different nationality than the funded party before the initiation of the arbitral proceedings does not affect jurisdiction, unless relevant investment treaty contains clear language to this effect.*  \n*That the claimant is a purely or partially nominal owner (and thus not the 'real party in interest') otherwise has no bearing on the requirements of 'investor' and 'investment.'*  \n*This position finds support in a constant line of case law: CSOB v. Slovakia, Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic, RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation and Quasar de Valores v. The Russian Federation. The arbitral tribunals deciding these cases took into account the presence of a third-party funder and, far from declining to 'recognize the role of third-party funders', opted for informed indifference towards the funder's involvement as regards admissibility of the funded investor's claim. This indifference has nothing to do with 'ignoring the elephant in the room', but rather constitutes the logical consequence of autonomous interpretation of investment treaty language. In the absence of clear treaty provisions to the contrary, the economic interest a funder obtains by virtue of the funding agreement as well as the motives behind its investment are not relevant for deciding on the legal question whether or not the funded party's claim is admissible. This is not only the correct legal approach, but also corresponds with business reality. It would hardly make sense if, in a financially deeply interconnected world, '[a]nything short of full and disclosed claim assignment to a third party might shed doubt on the identity of the actual claimant.'*\"\n\n270.\n\nIt would be impractical and would *\"eviscerate the distinct legal personality that comes with the incorporation of a business*\"332 if it were necessary to analyse how each stakeholder stands to benefit from the proceeds of an arbitration in order to determine the nationality of a claimant-enterprise. It would also be contrary to the object and purpose of the FTA which seeks to ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment if its qualification as an investor were to depend on the relative interests and priorities of its stakeholders.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 674.\n\n271.\n\nThere is a legal distinction between an assignment of a claim (after which the claim can only be brought by the assignee) and an investment into a publicly traded entity. The Investment Agreement achieves what it says it is, namely an investment; assignment is not its practical effect and Eco Oro is not a \"fa\u00e7ade.\" The question of \"control\" is not relevant to the question of Eco Oro's status as an investor and Eco Oro has full control over the arbitration; no steps can be taken without its consent. Trexs holds less than 10% of Eco Oro's shares and the majority of Eco Oro's directors have no links with Trexs such that Trexs has no command over Eco Oro's decision-making process, including with respect to the arbitration. In any event, the directors all owe fiduciary duties to all the shareholders. 333 Finally, certain words were omitted from the Investment Agreement provision quoted by Colombia: it should read *\"other than pursuant to the Investment,* [Eco Oro] *has not disposed of, transferred, encumbered* *or assigned all or any portion of such Claim Proceedings (or any interest therein) or any proceeds thereof, whether by way of security or otherwise (including any set off or agreement to set off any amounts relating to the Claim Proceedings)*.\" (The words underlined are the words omitted by Colombia). When read in full, it is clear the purpose and meaning of the provision is to confirm that Eco Oro has not and would not convey the claim proceeds in any way. It does not infer that the Investment Agreement was in reality an assignment. Indeed, Colombia cannot complain that Eco Oro was obliged to seek funding as a direct result of Colombia's own unlawful conduct. 334\n\nSee paras. 220 *et seq.* above.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 685, invoking, *inter alia*, *Quasar de Valores SICAV S.A. and Others v. Russian Federation* (SCC Case No. 24/2007), Award (20 July 2012) (**Exhibit CL-77**), paras. 31-33.\n\n272.\n\nThe CVR which was appended as Schedule A to the Investment Agreement provides that it *\"does not derogate from or in any way limit or restrict* [Eco Oro's] *ownership of the Claim Proceeding Rights and* [Eco Oro's] *ability to prosecute the Claim Proceedings or otherwise result in the Holder owning or controlling the Claim Proceedings.*\"335\n\nInvestment Agreement between Eco Oro and Trexs, Schedule A: Contingent Value Rights Certificate (21 July 2016) (**Exhibit C-452**). (\"*Claim Proceeds*\" are defined therein as \"*all present and future value, order, award, entitlement or remuneration of any kind and in any form including, without limitation, any property, assets, cash, bonds, or any other form of payment or restitution, permit, license, consideration, refund or reimbursement of fees or similar right in each case paid, payable, recovered, owing to, due to, awarded to, ordered or otherwise received or to be received by the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or affiliates of any kind, or any of their respective successors or assigns pursuant to or in respect of any settlement, award, order, entitlement, collection, judgment, sale, disposition, agreement or another monetization of any kind of, in any way relating to the Claim Proceedings.*\").\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nIt is not disputed that Eco Oro is incorporated in accordance with the applicable laws of Canada and is a Canadian enterprise. Accordingly, Eco Oro satisfies the express requirements set out in Article 838 of the FTA. The test in Article 838 is clear and specific: the Tribunal does not accept Colombia's contention that there is insufficient specificity in the FTA. Colombia does not identify any provisions in the FTA requiring investigation into Eco Oro's beneficial ownership and the Tribunal does not accept Colombia's further contention that as there is no provision in the FTA specifying that this is the only applicable test, the Tribunal must instead be guided by a principle of international law which requires consideration of the beneficial owner of the putative claimant. In the absence of such provisions, it is not apparent to the Tribunal why it should engage in an analysis of the beneficial owners of a listed company. The cases cited by Colombia do not relate to the beneficial owner of the claimant but to the beneficial ownership of the property the subject of the claim. Whilst this may not always be a distinction with any substance, in the present case, where there is no allegation (or evidence) that Eco Oro itself is not the 100% owner of the title to Concession 3452, the Tribunal is satisfied that Eco Oro is a protected investor for the purposes of Article 838 such that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae.*\n\n**C.** **W****hether** **E****co** **O****ro has complied with the** **C****onditions** **P****recedent to** **A****rbitration provided for in** **A****rticle** **821** **of the** **FTA**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nArticle 821 of the Treaty (\"**Article 821**\") provides as follows:\n\n*\"Article 821: Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration*\n\n*1. The disputing parties shall hold consultations and negotiations in an attempt to settle a claim amicably before a disputing investor may submit a claim to arbitration. Consultations shall be held within 30 days of the submission of the Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under subparagraph 2(c), unless the disputing parties otherwise agree. Consultations and negotiations may include the use of non-binding, third-party procedures. The place of consultations shall be the capital of the disputing Party, unless the disputing parties otherwise agree.*\n\n*2. A disputing investor may submit a claim to arbitration under Article 819 or Article 820 only if:*\n\n*(a) the disputing investor and, where a claim is made under Article 820, the enterprise, consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Section;*\n\n*(b) at least six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim;*\n\n*(c) the disputing investor has delivered to the disputing Party a written notice of its intent to submit a claim to arbitration (Notice of Intent) at least six months prior to submitting the claim. The Notice of Intent shall specify:*\n\n*(i) the name and address of the disputing investor and, where a claim is made under Article 820, the name and address of the enterprise,*\n\n*(ii) the provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions,*\n\n*(iii) the legal and the factual basis for the claim, including the measures at issue, and*\n\n*(iv) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed;*\n\n*(d) the disputing investor has delivered evidence establishing that it is an investor of the other Party with its Notice of Intent;*\n\n*(e) in the case of a claim submitted under Article 819:*\n\n*(i) not more than 39 months have elapsed from the date on which the disputing investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the disputing investor has incurred loss or damage thereby, and*\n\n*(ii) the disputing investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of the other Party that is a juridical person that the disputing investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, the enterprise, waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of either Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 819, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the applicable law of the disputing Party, provided that the action is brought for the sole purpose of preserving the disputing investor's or the enterprise's rights and interests during the pendency of the arbitration; and*\n\n*(f) in the case of a claim submitted under Article 820:*\n\n*(i) not more than 39 months have elapsed from the date on which the enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage thereby, and*\n\n*(ii) both the disputing investor and the enterprise waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of either Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 820, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the applicable law of the disputing Party, provided that the action is brought for the sole purpose of preserving the disputing investor's or the enterprise's rights and interests during the pendency of the arbitration.*\n\n*3. A consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in the form provided in Annex 821, shall be delivered to the disputing Party and shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration. Where a disputing Party has deprived a disputing investor of control of an enterprise, a waiver from the enterprise under subparagraphs 2(e)(ii) or 2(f)(ii) shall not be required.*\n\n*4. An investor may submit a claim relating to taxation measures covered by this Chapter to arbitration under this Section only if the taxation authorities of the Parties fail to reach the joint determinations specified in Article 2204 (Exceptions - Taxation) within six months of being notified in accordance with those provisions.*\n\n*5. An investor of a Party who is also a national of a non-Party may not initiate or continue a proceeding under this Article if, as a national of the non-Party, it submits or has submitted, directly or indirectly, an investment claim with respect to the same measure or series of measures under any agreement between the other Party and that non-Party.*\"336\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**), Art. 821.\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe Parties have not perfected their consent to submit the dispute to arbitration as Eco Oro has failed to comply with four of the mandatory conditions precedent set forth in Article 821 and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction.\n\n*(i) Consent to Arbitration under the FTA is conditioned on compliance with the Conditions Precedent in Article 821*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nThese requirements are conditions precedent and not mere formalities: pursuant to Article 823(1) of the FTA, Eco Oro's failure to comply with any of these conditions precedent results in nullification of Colombia's consent to arbitrate.\n\n*(ii) Eco Oro has Failed to Comply with Four of the Conditions Precedent Listed in Article 821 of the FTA*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. Article 821(2)(c)(iii)\n-------------------------\n\n277.\n\nThe Notice of Intent did not state all the legal and factual bases for its claim, including each one of the measures at issue. The wording of the FTA is clear: it requires the Notice to contain, *inter alia, \"the legal and the factual basis for the claim, including the measures at issue.*\" This requires the listing of all the measures at issue, without limitation, to ensure Colombia is properly apprised of the existence, scope and subject matter of the controversy. It is insufficient for Eco Oro only to describe the *\"basis\"* of the claim in its Notice of Intent.\n\n278.\n\nThe cases cited by Eco Oro are irrelevant: none of the underlying Investment Treaties had equivalent provisions requiring either the listing of all measures or alternatively conditioned consent to arbitrate on compliance with such measures. Even if it were sufficient to describe the basis of the dispute without specifying the entirety of the measures at issue, Eco Oro's Notice of Intent is still not acceptable because Colombia could not have understood from the Notice of Intent that Eco Oro intended to bring claims with respect to measures that did not concern the Angostura Project or the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. Eco Oro is seeking to introduce \"*by the back door\"* claims not related to the original dispute. To the extent that claims were uncrystallized at the time the claim was submitted to arbitration, Eco Oro should have waited before filing its Request for Arbitration and it should have filed a new notice of intent to apprise Colombia of those new disputes which were not related to the Angostura Project or the process of delimiting the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. Accordingly, Eco Oro failed to comply with the condition precedent in Article 821(2)(c)(iii).\n\n279.\n\nEco Oro's reliance upon Article 46 of the ICSID Convention (\"**Article 46**\") does not assist it - a tribunal's powers under Article 46 to hear incidental or additional claims apply only to a dispute falling within the scope of the consent of the parties and as Eco Oro has failed to comply with the conditions precedent contained in Article 821, there is no consent to submit the dispute to arbitration and thus Article 46 is of no avail.\n\nb. Article 821(2)(b)\n--------------------\n\n280.\n\nEco Oro failed to comply with the six-month cooling-off period. Eco Oro, in its Request for Arbitration, refers to Resolution VSC 829, Resolution 48, Resolution VSC 906, Judgement T-361, Order VSC 195 and Colombia's decision to have the Colombian p\u00e1ramo declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites as all being contrary to Colombia's obligations under the FTA. However, even on Eco Oro's case, each of these measures was adopted less than six months before Eco Oro submitted its claim to arbitration and they were mostly adopted after the submission of the claim to arbitration. In particular, Eco Oro argues that it was deprived of *\"vital rights under Concession 3452\"* by Resolution VSC 829, however that was only adopted in August 2016. Thus, less than six months had passed between the date of the measures giving rise to the claim and the date of submission of the claim to arbitration. Again, this is a mandatory requirement which cannot be dispensed with. Whilst Eco Oro relies upon the *Crystallex* case,337 Colombia notes that the relevant Canada-Venezuela BIT did not contain an equivalent provision making the notice period a condition precedent.338 Therefore, Eco Oro failed to comply with the condition precedent in Article 821(2)(b).\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2), Decision on Bifurcation (23 May 2012) (**Exhibit CL-117**) (\"***Crystallex***\").\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 69.\n\nc. Article 821(3)\n-----------------\n\n281.\n\nEco Oro failed to comply with the waiver requirements which are mandated to be in the form of Annex 821 and included in the submission of a claim to arbitration. This waiver must relate to measures that are alleged by Eco Oro to be in breach of the FTA and is submitted with the Notice of Intent. Eco Oro's waiver did not relate to all the measures alleged by Eco Oro in this arbitration to be in breach as some occurred after the waiver and Notice of Intent were submitted.339\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 85.\n\nd. Article 821(2)(e)(i)\n-----------------------\n\n282.\n\nEco Oro's Request for Arbitration was received by ICSID's Secretary General on 8 December 2016 and the mandatory cut-off date is therefore 8 September 2013 (the \"**cut-off date**\"), however Eco Oro had knowledge of all relevant alleged breaches and the resulting loss or damage before that date. The mining ban had been in force since Law 1382 came into effect on 9 February 2010 and Eco Oro has not had the right to mine in those areas of its Concession overlapping with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo since at least August 2012.\n\n283.\n\nEco Oro's knowledge arises, *inter alia,* from the following which occurred before the cut-off date (the \"**pre cut-off Measures**\"):\n\na. Law 1382 of 2010 which established an immediate mining ban in that area of Concession 3452 which overlapped with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, being 54.42% (confirmed by Resolutions VSC 2 and 4) and Eco Oro knew or ought to have known that Concession 3452 was not protected by the transitional regime introduced. Colombia refers to the following as evidencing that knowledge:\n\ni. An email dated 24 April 2010340 from Mr. Kesler (Eco Oro's then President and CEO) noting that Eco Oro was *\"led to believe that the Angostura project would benefit from 'grandfathering' regarding the new law\"* which it submits shows that the grandfathering exemption had not materialised for Eco Oro;\n\nii. An internal memorandum dated 3 May 2010 which confirms that Eco Oro knew it did not benefit from the transitional regime; 341\n\niii. The rejection of its 2009 EIA pursuant to which Mr. Kessler noted in the same email of 24 April 2010 that \"[t]*his effectively stops the project* [...]. *The project, with this condition, may not be feasible or economic.* \";342\n\niv. A report prepared by Mr. Kessler for Eco Oro's board of directors noting that the impact of this on the share price was \" *dramatic* .\";343\n\nb. Resolution 937 of 2010 confirmed Law 1382 was enforceable by reference to the 2007 Atlas;\n\nc. Resolution 1015 of 2011 rejected Eco Oro's EIA referring to Resolution 937;\n\nd. Law 1450 of 2011 re-enacted the mining ban established in Law 1382 and specified that the 2007 Atlas would serve as a *\"minimum reference\"* to enforce the mining ban;\n\ne. Resolution 35 of 2011 upheld the denial of an environmental licence; and\n\nf. Resolution VSC 4 of 2012, which definitively confirmed Eco Oro could not conduct mining activities in that part of Concession 3452 overlapping with the p\u00e1ramo. As this was unchallenged by Eco Oro it took effect as a definitive determination of Eco Oro's rights under Concession 3452 through the application of Laws 1382 and 1450. Thus, Eco Oro must have known VSC 4 curtailed its ability to conduct mining activities in the p\u00e1ramo areas of Concession 3452.\n\nEmail from S. Kesler (Greystar) to D. Rovig (Greystar) and others (24 April 2010) (**Exhibit R-180**).\n\nGreystar, Internal Memorandum (3 May 2010) (**Exhibit R-159**).\n\nEmail from S. Kesler (Greystar) to D. Rovig (Greystar) and others (24 April 2010) (**Exhibit R-180**).\n\nGreystar, CEO report to the Board of Directors (3 May 2010) (**Exhibit R-160**).\n\n284.\n\nEco Oro sought to challenge these measures evidencing its awareness of them before the cut-off date.\n\n285.\n\nThose measures enacted after the cut-off date on which Eco Oro relies (the **2014-2019 Measures**), do not give rise to a distinct, independent, self-standing cause of action; they merely continued the prohibition on mining in p\u00e1ramo areas and so do not trigger the limitation period:344\n\na. Resolution 2090 did not increase or reduce the area of Concession 3452 overlapping with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo vis-\u00e0-vis Resolution VSC 4, which had been implemented before the cut-off date. Eco Oro is incorrect to say it benefitted from the transitional regime as it neither held an environmental license nor an equivalent environmental control and management document granted before 9 February 2010 as required by Article 5. The environmental managing plan Eco Oro possessed referred to a smaller project in a smaller mining title and not the area of Concession 3452 overlapping with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.\n\nb. Resolution VSC 3 did not lift the suspension on mining activities imposed by VSC 4, it simply rejected Eco Oro's request to extend the suspension of activities in the exploration phase of Concession 3452 because the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo pursuant to Resolution 2090 had been issued by the time the request was rejected.\n\nc. Law 1753 again confirmed the prohibition on mining activities in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and again Eco Oro did not qualify for the transitional regime as it neither had the requisite environmental licence nor environmental control and management plan.\n\nd. Judgment C-35 was irrelevant to Eco Oro as it could not have benefitted from the grandfathering exemption which the judgement struck down.\n\ne. Resolution VSC 829 did not curtail any of Eco Oro's rights because Eco Oro had not been able to mine in the areas of its Concession overlapping with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo since at least August 2012 when the ANM refused to extend Eco Oro's exploration phase with regard to such overlapping area. It extended the exploration phase only for areas that fell outside the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and the ANM had taken a substantially identical position in Resolution VSC 4.\n\nf. The CIIPE minutes are irrelevant, merely confirming the existence of an overlapping portion of the title.\n\ng. Resolution VSC 906 rejected Eco Oro's request to suspend its obligations under Concession 3452 on the basis that Eco Oro's alleged uncertainty about the effects of Judgment C-35 were unfounded. The uncertainty alleged by Eco Oro related to whether or not mining was prohibited in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and thus in the parts of Concession 3452 overlapping the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. However, this uncertainty existed before the cut-off date.\n\nh. Judgement T-361 annulled Resolution 2090. However, the annulment did not alter the ban on mining in the area delimited by the 2007 Atlas (being the \"minimum reference\" area) and Resolution 2090 was ordered to remain in force until the new delimitation was prepared, which new delimitation could not afford a lower level of protection to the p\u00e1ramo than that provided by Resolution 2090. Again, therefore, this judgment did not give rise to a self-standing cause of action.\n\ni. Finally, Colombia's application to UNESCO was a continuation of Colombia's legislature's policy decision to ban mining in the p\u00e1ramos and did not give rise to a self-standing cause of action.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras. 129-130, invoking *Aaron C. Berkowitz, Brett E. Berkowitz and Trevor B. Berkowitz v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/2, Interim Award (30 May 2017) (**Exhibit RL-108**), para. 208.\n\n286.\n\nIn arguing that the Angostura Project survived notwithstanding the pre cut-off Measures, Eco Oro contends that Colombia provided continued support for the Angostura Project after the mining ban adopted in 2010 and that it was only the 2014 - 2019 Measures that destroyed the Angostura Project. These submissions are not supported by the actual facts.\n\n287.\n\nThe Terms of Reference for the underground mining project did not indicate support for the Angostura Project: they were accompanied by a letter from ANLA Director Ms. Sarmiento noting the requirement to take into account the ongoing process of delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and further noting the adoption of the 2007 Atlas pursuant to Resolution 2090.345 It is correct that the letter referred to Decree No. 2820 of 5 August 2010 (\"**Decree 2820**\"),346 but such reference was not an indication that mining was not banned in the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. Decree 2820 did not specifically regulate the granting of environmental licences in p\u00e1ramo areas but instead provided a general framework for the processing and issuance of environmental licenses in Colombia. Further, it required a favourable opinion from the MinAmbiente as a precondition for the granting of an environmental licence and required the subject project to comply with applicable instruments for the conservation and sustainable use of the environment. The applicable instrument at the time of Eco Oro's request for Terms of Reference was Resolution 937 which meant that the 2007 Atlas delimitation applied. Therefore, at this time (February 2012) Eco Oro should have understood that it would not be able to mine in those areas overlapping with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.\n\nLetter from ANLA to Eco Oro attaching terms of reference (27 February 2012) (**Exhibit C-24**).\n\nDecree No. 2820 (5 August 2010) (**Exhibit C-129**).\n\n288.\n\nPIN and PINE designations were neither endorsements nor confirmation of the legal or environmental feasibility of the Project; they merely streamlined certain administrative processes or provided additional oversight and scrutiny to sensitive projects. Indeed, the Project was designated a PINE because of its anticipated adverse environmental impact, were it even to materialise.347\n\nINGEOMINAS, Resolution No. DSM-28 (22 February 2011) (**Exhibit C-19**).\n\n289.\n\nSurface canons were calculated with respect to the entire area of a mining title, not taking into account mining exclusion zones.348 Whilst it was open to Eco Oro to request a reconfiguration of the title to remove those areas where it could not conduct mining activities (for example mining exclusion zones), it did not do so. The ANM was unable itself to calculate the percentage of the area which did not overlap with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo until it received the polygon maps.349 It would not have been possible for an ANM official to determine the coordinates of the overlapping area in the absence of such a map as it would have engaged such official's personal responsibility. Eco Oro could have requested reimbursement of the overpaid sums if it had requested a reconfiguration of the title.\n\nLaw No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Art. 230; ANM Memorandum (17 September 2012) (**Exhibit R-192**), pp. 3-4.\n\nSecond Garc\u00eda Granados Statement, para. 13.\n\n290.\n\nIt is also incorrect to say that Eco Oro's rights were restored from the effects of the pre cut-off Measures because it benefitted from grandfathering provisions: it had none. The *raison d'\u00eatre* of Article 5 of Resolution 2090 was to grandfather projects at the exploitation stage only. Eco Oro did not have the required documentation and so had not progressed to the exploitation stage: the transition regime did not apply to it.\n\n291.\n\nThe mining ban continued in force notwithstanding Constitutional Court Judgement C-366 as Judgement C-366's effect was expressly deferred by the court for two years. By the time its effects came into force, Law 1450 had been enacted which again contained a ban on mining in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. In the *Consejo de Estado* Advisory Opinion 2233 of 11 December 2014 (\"**Advisory Opinion 2233**\") the *Consejo de Estado* explained that this meant the mining ban had been continued without interruption since 9 February 2010.350 Indeed, it is telling that Eco Oro never took any steps towards preparing an EIA and PTO for its underground mine.\n\n*Consejo de Estado* Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**), p. 11.\n\n292.\n\nResolution VSC 3 did not lift the mining ban over the entirety of the Concession area but merely confirmed Eco Oro could resume its activities pursuant to Resolution 2090. As Eco Oro had no grandfathered rights under Article 5, the suspension of mining was only lifted in relation to those areas that did not overlap the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo as delimited by the 2007 Atlas.\n\n293.\n\nFinally, as the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo had already been delimited pursuant to Resolution 2090, Law 1753 was irrelevant and, in any event, as the Project was not at the exploitation stage, the transitional regime in Article 173 did not apply to Eco Oro.\n\n294.\n\nIt is incorrect for Eco Oro to say that its administrative challenges to the pre cut-off Measures are irrelevant because these measures did not result in a permanent deprivation of its rights: Laws 1382 and 1450 introduced a permanent definitive ban on mining in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems that is continuing. It is irrelevant that the ban was enforced through a provisional delimitation contained in the 2007 Atlas: Eco Oro could not reasonably have expected the ban to have been lifted and, whether or not the measures resulted in a formal deprivation of its Concession, the fact is that Eco Oro has been barred from conducting mining activities in the overlapping portion of its Concession area since August 2012, whether the overlap is defined with reference to the 2007 Atlas or Resolution 2090.\n\n*(iii) Colombia did not exacerbate the dispute following the submission of the Claim to Arbitration*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nWhilst Colombia denies that it took any steps which aggravated the dispute following submission of the Notice of Intent, even were the allegation to be correct, no argument has been raised, let alone identified by Eco Oro, which would support its contention that such aggravation would exempt it from compliance with the Article 821 requirements.\n\n296.\n\nEco Oro has identified certain measures that post-date the Notice of Intent which it asserts are \"**Related Measures**\" because they concern the same subject-matter of the dispute notified in the Letter of Intent and over which, it says, the Tribunal has jurisdiction on the basis they are \"*incidental*\" or \"*additional*\" claims relating to the same subject matter as that described in the Notice of Intent. These Related Measures are not related to the measures the subject of the Notice of Intent. The dispute described in the Notice of Intent was limited to Colombia's *\"unreasonable delay\"* in delimiting the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and its *\"persistent lack of clarity\"* regarding Eco Oro's right to continue developing its mining project. It neither concerned Resolution 48 (which related to another mining title) nor measures not concerning the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo such as *(i)* the termination of the exploration period and Eco Oro's renunciation of Concession 3452; *(ii)* the ANM's decision to approve Minesa's PTO; or *(iii)* the alleged delay in approving the transfer of certain of Eco Oro's titles not relating to the Angostura Project to Minesa.351\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 104.\n\n297.\n\nIn particular:\n\na. Resolution VSC 829 granted Eco Oro a two-year extension of the exploration period of that part of Concession 3452 which did not overlap with the Preservation Area of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and thus confirmed its definitive delimitation.\n\nb. Resolution 48 did not contradict Resolution VSC 829 and thus did not create any additional uncertainty.\n\nc. By Resolution 906, the ANM rejected Eco Oro's final request for a suspension of its obligations under Concession 3452 and this decision was upheld by Resolution 343. The ANM's decision was reasonable and valid under Colombian law and therefore did not violate Eco Oro's rights.\n\nd. Judgement T-361 did not have any impact on the 54% overlap of the p\u00e1ramo with Concession 3452.\n\ne. As for the UNESCO application, firstly Colombia has done nothing additional to the announcement by the Attorney General and, in any event, Eco Oro has not substantiated how this declaration would have impacted upon Concession 3452.\n\nf. Finally, Eco Oro did not renunciate Concession 3452 due to actions by Colombia but to avoid being in breach of its own obligations as it had failed to submit a PTO within the three-month grace period granted by the ANM after the expiration of Concession 3452's exploration period.\n\n298.\n\nColombia therefore submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to judge such conduct.352\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras. 103 *et seq*.\n\n*(iv) Article 46 of the ICSID Convention does not empower the Tribunal to adjudicate Eco Oro's \"related measures\" claims*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nAs Eco Oro failed to comply with the Article 821 requirements in relation to these Related Measures, the Tribunal is not empowered under Article 46 ICSID Convention to hear them as they are not within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n***(b) The Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n*(i) Eco Oro complied with all of the Treaty's pre-arbitration formalities*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe Parties' consent to arbitrate extends to all measures relating to the subject matter of the dispute, so long as any claim arising therefrom is made no later than the reply memorial.353 Colombia's consent to submit its investment disputes with foreign investors is provided in Article 822. The provisions in Article 822 are procedural requirements which were complied with by Eco Oro prior to the submission of its claim to arbitration. Therefore, the FTA requirements to submit the dispute to arbitration have been satisfied.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 97, referring to Rule 40(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which provides as follows: \"*An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counter-claim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding*.\"\n\n301.\n\nEco Oro consented to submit the present dispute to arbitration in accordance with Article 821.\n\na. Article 821(2)(c)(iii)\n-------------------------\n\n302.\n\nAll Colombia's breaches the subject of Eco Oro's claim are incidental to, and/or relate to the same subject matter as, the claims notified in its Notice of Intent. In particular, the Notice of Intent put Colombia on notice that *(i)* its claim concerned the impairment of Eco Oro's mining rights in relation to its Project within Concession 3452; *(ii)* it had a claim under Article 805; and *(iii)* reserved its rights under Article 811. Pursuant to the wording of Article 821(1)(c), the Notice of Intent is only required to specify the *\"basis\"* for the claim. This cannot require comprehensively detailing *\"every feature or element\"* of the claim, let alone future conduct relating to the claim which would be impossible to foresee at the time of submitting the Notice of Intent. The purpose of this requirement is to apprise the State of the subject-matter of the dispute, as Colombia itself accepts.354 Therefore, to satisfy the requirement, Eco Oro need only provide Colombia with sufficient information as to the subject-matter of the dispute, including the measures at issue.355 Nothing in the FTA supports Colombia's submission and it plainly cannot have been the intention of the drafters that a claimant should be obliged to launch new arbitration proceedings for each post-Notice of Intent measure, even if such measure is part and parcel of the same dispute. Indeed, by the terms of footnote 8 to the FTA, the FTA itself recognises that disputes, even once notified in the Notice of Intent, are not static such that administrative acts giving rise to a claim may be reviewed, confirmed or modified. It would make no sense were a claimant to be required to issue a new Notice of Intent each time such an administrative act was modified. Clearly, any such later measure reflecting the evolution of the claim would form a part of the dispute and fall within the scope of the Parties' consent to arbitrate. Whilst Colombia argues that the purpose is to exclude *\"premature or unripe\"* claims, it is simply unfeasible to expect an investor to wait until its claims were ripe - how could it know if the dispute would be further exacerbated? Indeed, postponing submission of a Notice of Intent would unnecessarily delay justice and the resolution of a *bona fide* dispute which is itself prejudicial and would cause procedural chaos. It is also unfeasible given the 39-month limitation period.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 107.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 747, alluding to the following cases: *Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur SA v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (21 December 2012) (**Exhibit CL-121**), para. 123; *A11Y Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (9 February 2017) (**Exhibit CL-191**), paras. 148-149; *Tulip Real Estate Investment & Development Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Decision on Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issues (5 March 2013) (**Exhibit RL-92**), paras. 83, 121-122; *Tenaris S.A. and Talta-Trading E Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal LDA v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/26, Award (29 January 2016) (**Exhibit CL-189**), paras. 243-244.\n\n303.\n\nThe Related Measures plainly concern the same subject-matter as the dispute (see below) and the Tribunal is entitled to exercise jurisdiction over the Related Measures.\n\nb. Article 821(2)(b)\n--------------------\n\n304.\n\nEco Oro waited at least six months from Colombia's first measures giving rise to the present dispute before commencing arbitration. The purpose of a cooling-off period is to ensure that the State is aware that a dispute has arisen in respect of a specific subject-matter. Colombia cannot have been unaware of the subject-matter of the dispute given the content of Eco Oro's Notice of Intent. The cases relied upon by Colombia are of no assistance to Colombia. Whilst the tribunal in *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador* declined to extend jurisdiction over an alleged breach of which no notice had been given,356 Eco Oro gave notice of the existence of an investment dispute under Articles 805 and 811, being the provisions relevant to its case as finally pleaded, including the claim for Colombia's failure to accord its investment a minimum standard of treatment under Article 805. Eco Oro waited the requisite period after filing its Notice of Intent before commencing its arbitration proceedings.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction (2 June 2010) (**Exhibit RL-6**), paras. 332-337; Claimant's Reply, para. 773.\n\nc. Article 821(3)\n-----------------\n\n305.\n\nEco Oro's waiver is in compliance with Article 821 being in the precise form of a letter containing the contents as set out in Annex 821 and it applies to the entire scope of the dispute, including any future actions of Colombia as is clear from the wording that it applies to State measures *\"that are alleged to be a breach\"* of the FTA. The measures that post-date the Notice of Intent of which Eco Oro complains are closely related to the notified dispute. In any event, this objection appears to have been abandoned by Colombia in its Reply on Jurisdiction. 357\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 91.\n\nd. Article 821(2)(e)(i)\n-----------------------\n\n306.\n\nEco Oro waited more than nine months after delivering its Notice of Intent before commencing arbitration.\n\n307.\n\nAt the time of commencing arbitration, not more than 39 months had elapsed since Eco Oro first acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of *(i)* those breaches by Colombia that form the subject of its claims in this arbitration and *(ii)* that it had incurred a loss resulting from those breaches.\n\n308.\n\nAs a jurisdictional objection, this issue should be decided on a *prima facie* basis, this being the *\"universal\"* approach when considering jurisdictional objections.358 Eco Oro refers to all the measures that were adopted by Colombia after 8 September 2013 and it does not found its claim on measures that occurred before that date. The first measure Eco Oro identifies as giving rise to a breach for which Eco Oro seeks recovery took place in 2014 which was within the 39-month time period. The events prior to this merely comprise years of delay on the part of Colombia to delimit the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, it was only the measures which took place in 2014 and thereafter which resulted in a permanent deprivation of its rights under Concession 3452 and the crystallisation of its losses.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 786-787, making reference to *Amco Asia Corp. and Others v. The Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2, Decision on Jurisdiction (24 December 1996) (**Exhibit CL-93**) (\"***Amco***\"), para. 38; *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Jurisdiction (25 May 1999) (**Exhibit CL-94**) (\"***Wena***\"), pp. 890-891; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

The pre cut-off Measures did not result in a breach of the FTA and thus did not have the effect of depriving Eco Oro of its Concession 3452 rights; they are merely part of the factual context. Eco Oro refers to the events that took place before the cut-off date merely as contextual factual background to its claim; these events have no impact on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n310.\n\nThe fact Eco Oro still had mining rights over the entire area of Concession 3452 at the cut-off date is demonstrated by the following:\n\na. It had to pay surface canons over the entire area until July 2016, when the amount payable by Eco Oro was reduced by the ANM *pro rata* to the area falling outside the Preservation Zone of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. Indeed, it is noteworthy that *(i)* Colombia has never offered to reimburse Eco Oro for the amounts allegedly overpaid up to July 2016 and *(ii)* it was only in August 2016 that CIIPE concluded that the overlapping area was neutralised by State measures.359\n\nb. Law 1382 did not specifically prohibit mining activities in p\u00e1ramo areas: until the p\u00e1ramo was designated in accordance with the requirements of Article 3 (i.e., geographically delimited by the Environmental Authority based on technical, social and environmental studies) the mining restrictions could not take effect.\n\nc. Order 1241 and Resolutions 1015 and 35 denied Eco Oro's open pit mining project not because of mining restrictions but due to its disapproval of certain aspects of the open-pit project. Indeed, MinAmbiente confirmed at that time that it had not declared an exclusion zone over the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems.360\n\nd. Resolution 937 was illegal, as concluded by the MinMinas because it did not meet the requirements set out in Laws 1382 and 145 0.361\n\ne. Law 1450 required the Minister of Environment to delimit p\u00e1ramo ecosystems on a 1:25,000 scale based on technical, social and environmental studies and thus could only come into effect when the further delimitation exercise had been properly undertaken. The ANM did not impose a ban on Eco Oro pursuant to Laws 1450 and 1382, it imposed a temporary suspension of mining activities in the area of Concession 3452 overlapping the 2007 Atlas pending publication of the delimitation by MinAmbiente, at which point the suspension was lifted. There was no permanent deprivation of Eco Oro's mining rights under Concession 3452.\n\nf. Resolution VSC 4 again imposed a temporary suspension *\"until the Ministry of Environment* [...] *issues the final delimitation to a scale of 1:25,000\",*362 not a permanent exclusion. The suspension was lifted when Resolution 2090 released the delimitation at a scale of 1:25,000 at which point, as Concession 3452 was grandfathered, Eco Oro was permitted to undertake mining activities in the entire area of Concession 3452. Therefore, there was no permanent impairment of its rights.\n\ng. In fact, Colombia continued to endorse and support the underground mining project in Concession 3452. It provided Eco Oro with terms of reference for the EIA, it twice nominated the Project and Concession 3452 as a PIN and it required Eco Oro to pay canons over the entire surface area of Concession 3452.\n\nh. Resolution 2090 was issued after the cut-off date and did not contain a final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. However, as the Project was grandfathered, Resolution 2090 had limited effect, although it did curtail Eco Oro's rights in certain ways, for example by prohibiting the extension of the duration of Concession 3452. Resolution VSC 3, issued very shortly after Resolution 2090, lifted the mining suspension imposed by Resolution VSC 4 leaving Eco Oro free to pursue its mining operations over the entire area of Concession 3452.\n\ni. Law 1753 again contained grandfathering provisions such that Eco Oro remained permitted to continue its mining operations.\n\nIntersectoral Commission for Infrastructure and Strategic Projects (CIIPE) Minutes of Meeting No. 5 [CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT] (16 August 2016) (**Exhibit C-397**).\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 35 (31 October 2011) (**Exhibit C-290**).\n\nLetter from Ministry of Mines (Ms. D\u00edaz Lopez) to INGEOMINAS (Mr. Montes) (27 September 2011) (**Exhibit C-330**).\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution VSC-4 (12 September 2012) (**Exhibit C-25**).\n\n311.\n\nThus, the measures passed before the cut-off date were irrelevant and meaningless to Eco Oro's claim. It was only in 2016 that its rights under Concession 3452 became imperilled when the grandfathering provisions in Law 1753 were struck down as unconstitutional by Judgement C-35, although it was unclear whether the Constitutional Court's decision also applied to the grandfathering provisions in Resolution 2090. In August 2016, the ANM issued Resolution VSC 829 extending Concession 3453's exploration phase only in respect of that part of Concession 3452 which did not overlap with the Preservation Zone of the Resolution 2090 delimitation but this was with reference to Judgement C-35 (and not to the pre cut-off Measures). It was only at this point that Eco Oro lost its rights to conduct mining activities in over 50% of its Concession.\n\n312.\n\nThe fact that Eco Oro made certain administrative challenges does not make Resolution 2090 and subsequent events a single continuous dispute arising from the pre cut-off Measures. Such challenges went only to the scope or effect of the Government act in question. As such measures did not permanently deprive Eco Oro of rights under Concession 3452, such challenges are irrelevant. In any event, as the measures which were effected after the cut-off date are separately actionable, pursuant to the decision in *Berkowitz v. Costa Rica,*363 the Tribunal has jurisdiction over them.\n\n*Aaron C. Berkowitz, Brett E. Berkowitz and Trevor B. Berkowitz v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/2, Interim Award (30 May 2017) (**Exhibit RL-108**).\n\n313.\n\nEco Oro has also complied with the requirements contained in Articles 25(1) and (2) of the ICSID Convention as:\n\na. There is a legal dispute arising from Colombia's breach of its obligations under the FTA;\n\nb. The dispute arises directly out of Eco Oro's investments in Colombia, which investments are qualifying investments for the purposes of the FTA and the ICSID Convention;\n\nc. The dispute has arisen between Colombia, an ICSID Contracting State and Eco Oro, a national of Canada, an ICSID Contracting State; and\n\nd. Colombia has consented to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration pursuant to Article 823 and, by filing its Request for Arbitration, Eco Oro consented to submit its dispute to ICSID arbitration in accordance with Articles 821 and 823.\n\n314.\n\nTherefore, the Parties' consent to submit the present dispute to arbitration was perfected on 8 December 2016.\n\n*(ii) The Related Measures*\n---------------------------\n\n315.\n\nColombia does not argue that Eco Oro's Notice of Intent was deficient nor does it assert that Eco Oro is claiming for any Government measures that pre-date its Notice of Intent and that were not referenced therein. Colombia's objections are based on the fact that Eco Oro's claim in the arbitration include the Related Measures which post-date the Notice of Intent.\n\n316.\n\nThese Related Measures all concern the same subject-matter as the dispute notified in the Notice of Intent, namely the impairment of Eco Oro's mining rights in relation to the Angostura Project as a result of the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo as encapsulated in the following paragraphs from the Notice of Intent:\n\n*\"The dispute arises out of the Republic's measures and omissions, which have directly impacted the rights granted to Eco Oro for the exploration and exploitation of the 'Angostura' gold mining project, located in the Soto Norte region of the Department of Santander, within the Vetas-California gold district, which Eco Oro has been developing since 1994 (the Angostura Project).* [....]\n\n*The measures and omissions that have affected Eco Oro include (but are not limited to) the Republic's unreasonable delay in specifying the boundaries of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and whether they overlap with the Angostura Project, as well as its persistent lack of clarity regarding Eco Oro's right to continue developing its mining project in light of further requirements which remain undefined and, later, as a consequence of Decision C-035 [Sentencia C-035] handed down by the Constitutional Court on 8 February 2016, which extended the prohibition of mining activities in p\u00e1ramo areas.\"*364\n\nNotice of intent to submit the claim to arbitration (7 March 2016) (**Exhibit C-48**).\n\n317.\n\nThe Related Measures are thus a continuation of, exacerbation of, or otherwise related to the same subject-matter of, the dispute that was notified in the Notice of Intent.\n\n318.\n\nWhere a State has exacerbated a dispute after the arbitration has been filed, tribunals have routinely exercised jurisdiction over such later measures. To do otherwise would be unnecessary and inefficient. Where there has been an evolution of the same dispute, rather than two different disputes, given the link between the initial claim and the later measures, the pre-arbitration formalities performed for the initial claim also cover the later measures.365 Colombia is incorrect to state that the *Crystallex* and other cases cited by Eco Oro are not on point because the underlying treaties did not make such requirements \"conditions precedent\" or require the notices of dispute to specify the \"measures\" at issue. Article XII(2) of the underlying treaty in *Crystallex* provides that prior to filing a claim the investor must deliver a notice *\"alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement\"* Further, the language of the treaty evidences that submission of a claim is conditional upon compliance with the relevant procedural requirements and it is clear from the wording of the award that the tribunal considered the pre-arbitration formalities to be mandatory. The same approach was adopted by the tribunals in *Eiser v. Spain,*366*Enron v. Argentina,*367 *Metalclad,*368 *Swisslion v. Macedonia,**369* *Teinver v. Argentina,**370* *Tenaris v. Venezuela**371* and *Ethyl v. Canada.**372* The approach followed by each of the tribunals in these cases was to consider whether the subsequent acts referred to related to a dispute that had already been notified. If so, it would be unreasonable and inefficient to *\"require the dispute to be carved into multiple slices, with each new development requiring an additional request for negotiations and a subsequent request for a separate additional arbitration.*\"373 Colombia has not cited a single case making a contrary finding.\n\n*Crystallex*, Award (4 April 2016) (**Exhibit CL-85**), para. 455.\n\n*Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energ\u00eda Solar Luxembourg S*.*\u00e0 r.l. v.

Resolution VSC 829 justifies the refusal to extend the exploration phase of Concession 3452 in relation to those areas of Concession 3452 which overlapped with the Preservation Area of the 2090 Delimitation by reference to Judgement C-35. Judgement C-35 and the 2090 delimitation are specifically identified in the Notice of Intent and Resolution VSC 829 is therefore unequivocally linked to the subject matter of the dispute.\n\nb. Resolution 48 addresses the effects of Judgement C-35 and the 2090 delimitation and whilst it concerns a different concession contract (Concession EJ-159 and not Concession 3452), it indicates that the ANM was issuing conflicting decisions exacerbating the uncertainty and lack of clarity described in Eco Oro's Notice of Intent regarding Concession 3452 and thus is again related to the subject matter. The Tribunal is not asked to exercise any jurisdiction over Concession EJ-159, it is simply referenced as part of the facts relevant to Eco Oro's claims regarding Concession 3452.\n\nc. Colombia concedes that the ANM's decision in Resolution 906 (and by association the rejection in Resolution 343 of Eco Oro's appeal of the decision) relate to the subject matter, Resolution 906 having been described by Colombia as addressing \"*the alleged uncertainty surrounding the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.*\"375\n\nd. By its content, Judgement T-361 created further uncertainty as to the scope of Eco Oro's mining rights under Concession 3452 and therefore is clearly related to the subject matter of the dispute.\n\ne. The Attorney General's office, having initially deplored the legal uncertainty to which the mining industry had been subjected through the delimitation process and having urged the Government to respect existing and acquired mining rights so as not to incur State liability, then contradicted itself by stating publicly that Colombia intended to apply to UNESCO to have all its p\u00e1ramos formally declared World Heritage Sites, to ensure mining operations were prohibited in these areas. The Attorney General referred specifically to the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, explaining the objective was to prohibit mining in the delimited p\u00e1ramo areas without paying compensation to existing mining title holders. Again, this is clearly related to the subject-matter.\n\nf. The letter ordering Eco Oro to submit a PTO for Concession 3452 within 30 days specifically addressed the ANM's views regarding the effect of the p\u00e1ramo re-delimitation on Eco Oro's ability to proceed with its obligations. Eco Oro's letters of renunciation referenced the ongoing uncertainty relating to the p\u00e1ramo delimitation and its effects on Concession 3452 since Resolution 2090. Hence the rationale for the renunciation is thus again related to the subject-matter.\n\ng. Eco Oro had no alternative but to renunciate Concession 3452 given the acts of the ANM. Having taken contradictory positions in the latter half of 2018 with respect to whether or not Eco Oro should have received an extension for the filing of a PTO, on 14 February 2019 the ANM wrote to Eco Oro ordering it to submit a PTO within 30 days, failing which the Concession would be subject to forfeiture. Eco Oro would therefore be in breach of its obligations under the Concession resulting in the initiation of caducity proceedings which would trigger cross forfeiture of Eco Oro's other titles and frustration of the pending assignment of some of its titles to Minesa. It was not possible to prepare a PTO within the very short period of time allowed and thus renunciation was a mitigation of Eco Oro's losses.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 102.\n\n321.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention empowers the Tribunal to hear *\"incidental\"* and *\"additional\"* claims *\"arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"* ICSID tribunals have consistently applied Article 46 as well as Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to hear claims arising from State measures taken after an investor's notice of dispute or after the commencement of arbitral proceedings.376\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 762-764, invoking *CMS Gas*, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (17 July 2003) (**Exhibit CL- 23**), paras. 116-120; *LG &E Energy Corp., LG &E Capital Corp. and LG &E International Inc. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (30 April 2004) (**Exhibit CL-165**), paras. 80-81; and *Cervin Investissements S.A. and Rhone Investissements S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/2, Award (7 March 2017) (**Exhibit CL-127**), paras. 445-448.\n\n322.\n\nWhilst Colombia says Article 46 is inapplicable because Eco Oro's failure to comply with the Article 821 requirements means there is no consent to arbitration, this argument is circular and unsupported by the text of the FTA. The issue between the Parties is whether the Parties' scope of consent is limited exclusively to the measures listed in the Notice of Intent, or whether it extends to measures exacerbating the dispute notified and which post-date the Notice of Intent. Under Article 823, Colombia consented to having disputes submitted to arbitration so long as the pre-arbitration formalities were complied with. Once the dispute was submitted to ICSID, Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules gave the Tribunal jurisdiction to hear all claims that arise from the subject matter of the dispute.\n\n323.\n\nThe cases cited by Colombia to support its argument are inapposite. The tribunal in *Guaracachi*377 declined jurisdiction over the new claims as, *inter alia,* there was insufficient nexus between the old and new claims and the new claims all pre-dated the notice of dispute even though they were known to the claimant at the time the notice was issued. This is not the position in the present case. Equally, the tribunal in *Supervision y Control S.A. v. Costa Rica*378 refused jurisdiction over new claims that were not mentioned in the Notice of Intent, nor *\"directly related to those included in the Notice of Intent\"* on the basis of non-compliance with the notification requirement. However, claims that were directly linked were held to be admissible.\n\n*Guaracachi*, Award (31 January 2014) (**Exhibit RL-13**).\n\n*Supervisi\u00f3n y Control S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/4, Award (18 January 2017) (**Exhibit RL-107**), para. 346.\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal should therefore exercise jurisdiction over the Related Measures.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n***(a) Article 821(2)(c)(iii)***\n--------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nColombia's first objection is the adequacy of Eco Oro's Notice of Intent given its failure expressly to list the Related Measures in breach of Article 821(2)(c)(iii). This provision requires specification of *\"the legal and factual basis for the claim, including the measures at issue\"* Given the context of Article 821 as a whole and considering the ordinary meaning of the provision, the purpose of this Article is to ensure the State is provided with sufficient detail to enable it to engage in constructive and informed discussions with the investor to enable a realistic possibility of achieving a settlement of the dispute before the arbitration is commenced. It was therefore not necessary for Eco Oro to include extensive detail in its Notice of Intent, provided \"*the measures at issue*\" were clear.\n\n326.\n\nColombia does not argue that Eco Oro wrongfully omitted relevant measures which took place before the Notice of Intent was issued. It is difficult to see how Colombia could reasonably expect Eco Oro to have identified measures that occurred after the date the Notice of Intent was issued (the Tribunal considers below whether it has jurisdiction over the Related Measures). The Notice of Intent identified that the harm suffered by Eco Oro arose as a result of Colombia's delays in delimiting the boundaries of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo in addition to the impact of Judgement C-35 in extending the boundaries of the mining ban. At the time the Notice of Intent was issued, it provided clear and full details of the measures out of which the dispute arose, namely the acts of Colombia specifically in relation to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. Colombia cannot therefore reasonably argue that it was not properly apprised of the existence, scope and subject-matter of the controversy at the time the Notice of Intent was served.\n\n327.\n\nIt must also be borne in mind when considering the content and adequacy of the Notice of Intent that Eco Oro had to keep at the forefront of its mind two specific time periods when deciding when to file its Notice of Intent: the minimum six-month time limit in Article 821(2)(b) and the 39-month limitation period contained in Article 821(2)(e)(i). Eco Oro therefore had to judge the point in time at which its claim had crystallised but once this point had been reached, it couldn't wait for an indeterminate period of time to see if Colombia effected any further measures exacerbating the dispute.\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore turns to consider the Related Measures and specifically whether Eco Oro's inclusion of them in its submissions is bringing in *\"by the back-door\"* claims which were not included in the Notice of Intent. It is unclear whether Colombia says that the fact that these form a part of Eco Oro's case notwithstanding they were not referred to in the Notice of Intent renders the Notice of Intent invalid or whether Colombia's argument is that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Related Measures or both. As a preliminary point, it cannot be the case that a claim becomes frozen in time once a Notice of Intent is filed. Just because an investor takes the step of filing a Notice of Intent does not mean that a State will automatically cease its activity in relation to the disputed property. Claims are not static and Government action may continue in parallel with inter-party consultations and the progress of arbitral proceedings. An investor must be entitled to continue to seek remedies in relation to continuing activity which it asserts is (or may come to be) in breach of the relevant Treaty, even after it has commenced arbitration, insofar as those breaches are related to claims set out in the Notice of Intent. The alternative - to expect an investor to file a new Notice of Intent each time a further measure occurs - is hardly realistic or practical, as it would result in unnecessary waste of time and financial resources.\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that to the extent a measure is unrelated to the dispute but in relation to which Eco Oro sought to make a claim, such a claim should clearly be the subject of a new arbitration and the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction over such measure. However, if there is a clear nexus between the measures detailed in the Notice of Intent and the Related Measures then the Tribunal should be able to exercise its jurisdiction over the Related Measures. The Tribunal therefore considers each of the Related Measures to ascertain whether there is sufficient nexus between such measure and the claim as detailed in the Notice of Intent such that it is an evolution of the same dispute and it would therefore be inefficient to require repetition of the pre-arbitration formalities. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Notice of Intent is a detailed document (comprising 14 pages) with the last measure referred to being Judgement C-35.\n\n330.\n\nThe first Related Measure is Resolution VSC 829. This resolution extended Eco Oro's Concession rights only in the area which did not overlap with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and, unlike the other extensions, made no reference to any temporary nature of the exclusion zone pending the publishing of a 1:25,000 scale delimitation. It refers to Judgement C-35 and accordingly has a nexus to the subject matter of the dispute as referred to in the Notice of Intent. The Tribunal therefore finds that it has jurisdiction over this measure.\n\n331.\n\nWhilst Resolution 48 concerns a different concession contract, it again relates to the effects of Judgement C-35 and the Resolution 2090 delimitation and is relevant to Eco Oro's statement in the Notice of Intent as to the lack of clarity surrounding the consequences of both Judgement C-35 and the Resolution 2090 delimitation. The Tribunal notes Eco Oro's clarification that it is not asking the Tribunal to exercise any jurisdiction over Concession EJ-159 but is simply referencing it as part of the facts relevant to its claims and the Tribunal accepts that there is a sufficient nexus between it and Eco Oro's claim as detailed in the Notice of Intent.\n\n332.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal finds that Resolution 906 relates to the subject matter of the dispute as detailed in the Notice of Intent having been issued to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.\n\n333.\n\nConstitutional Court Judgement T-361 is clearly an evolution of, and related to, the dispute.\n\n334.\n\nGiven that the Attorney General's office referred specifically to the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and explained the objective was to prohibit mining in the delimited p\u00e1ramo areas without paying compensation to existing mining title holders, the Tribunal again finds that the pronouncement is related to the subject- matter of the dispute.\n\n335.\n\nThe communications between Eco Oro and Colombia in relation to the requirement for Eco Oro to submit a PTO for Concession 3452 and Eco Oro's renunciation of its Concession are the final act of this evolved dispute. As such, the Tribunal finds it has jurisdiction over them.\n\n336.\n\nIn conclusion, the Related Measures are all sufficiently connected with the dispute as described in the Notice of Intent such that they each form a part of the continued unravelling of Concession 3452. The Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction over them both pursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and as forming a continuing part of the dispute described in the Notice of Intent.\n\n337.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that Eco Oro provided sufficient detail in its Notice of Intent such that Colombia was able to understand the basis of the case that was to be brought against it. Eco Oro therefore complied with its obligations under Article 821(2)(c)(iii).\n\n***(b) Article 821(2)(b)***\n---------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal next turns to Colombia's second objection, namely that Eco Oro did not respect the six-month cooling-off period. This objection is not persuasive. Eco Oro's Notice of Intent references Judgement C-35 as the final measure leading to the dispute. The date of this Judgement was 8 February 2016 and more than six months elapsed before Eco Oro commenced the arbitration. The fact the Related Measures occurred after this date and indeed continued to arise during the course of the arbitration is irrelevant; it cannot have been the intention of the drafters of the FTA that if there is a subsequent measure which exacerbates the dispute, this obliges the investor to start new arbitral proceedings and conversely it cannot be the case that a State could enable proceedings to be derailed by the simple process of effecting a further Related Measure after a Notice of Intent is issued. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Eco Oro is in compliance with its obligations under Article 821(2)(b). It should be noted that in coming to this determination with respect to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Related Measures, the Tribunal makes no findings as to the legal effect of any of these measures.\n\n***(c) Article 821(3)***\n------------------------\n\n339.\n\nIt is unclear whether Colombia maintains its objection with respect to the alleged inadequacy of Eco Oro's waiver (if it does then it is with a notable lack of enthusiasm). The waiver issued by Eco Oro followed almost word for word the text contained in Annex 821 and the fact that it did not contain reference to the Related Measures is unsurprising given they only came into being after commencement of the arbitration. Given this and given the Tribunal's determination that the Related Measures are an evolution of the same dispute as that described in the waiver, it is clear that the waiver is not defective. The Tribunal therefore finds that Eco Oro has complied with its obligations under Article 821(2)(e).\n\n***(d) Article 821(2)(e)(i)***\n------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nTurning finally to Colombia's limitation period objection under Article 821(2)(e)(i), it is common ground that the date from when the time period starts to run is the date on which Eco Oro obtained actual or constructive knowledge of the adoption of the measures the subject of the claim and became aware that a breach of the FTA could cause loss or damage to its investment. Eco Oro says it had mining rights over the entirety of Concession 3452 as at 8 September 2013 and that it was the measures which occurred after that which deprived it of these rights. It therefore does not rely on measures which took place before the cut-off date; the only relevant measures for the purposes of the Tribunal's analysis being those which took place after the cut-off date. In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot see how Eco Oro could be said to have known (or had constructive knowledge) of events which had yet to take place, notwithstanding Colombia's allegations that these measures could hardly have taken Eco Oro by surprise given the measures that had been effected prior to the cut-off date. The fact that on Colombia's analysis, Eco Oro should have anticipated such measures is not sufficient to comprise actual or constructive knowledge of the *specific* post cut-off date measures for the purposes of Article 821(2)(e)(i). The Tribunal therefore finds that Eco Oro is not in breach of Article 821(2)(e)(i).\n\n341.\n\nIn undertaking this analysis, the Tribunal has not considered whether Eco Oro did indeed have any mining rights as at the cut-off date which were capable of being expropriated; that analysis is to be performed when considering the merits of Eco Oro's claims.\n\n**D.** **W****hether** **E****co** **O****ro****'****s** **C****laims fall within the** **T****ribunal****'****s** **J****urisdiction** ***ratione temporis***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nArticle 801(2) of the Treaty (\"**Article 801(2)**\") provides as follows:\n\n*\"Article 801: Scope and Coverage*\n\n[...]\n\n*2. For greater certainty, the provisions of this Chapter do not bind a Party in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.*\"379\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**), Art. 801(2).\n\n343.\n\nArticle 838 of the Treaty (\"**Article 838**\") provides, *inter alia,* as follows:\n\n*\"****covered investment means****, with respect to a Party, an investment in its territory of an investor of the other Party existing**[380]* *on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, as well as investments made or acquired thereafter*[\u2026]\"381\n\nPursuant to Article 106 (*Definitions of General Application*) of the FTA, \"***existing*** *means in effect on the date of entry into force of this Agreement.*\" Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**).\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**), Art. 838.\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nEco Oro's claims relate to the prohibition on mining in the p\u00e1ramo areas of Concession 3452 which has been in force since 2010. This is before the entry into force of the FTA on 15 August 2011 and the dispute between the Parties therefore arose before 15 August 2011. The measures which took place after that date are all a continuation of the mining ban in p\u00e1ramo areas which was enacted in 2010.\n\n345.\n\nEco Oro seeks to bring two claims against Colombia: *(i)* that Colombia unlawfully expropriated its investments by depriving it of \"*the use and enjoyment of its right to mine the Angostura Project under Concession 3452\"* and *(ii)* that Colombia denied Eco Oro fair and equitable treatment because it failed to \"*abide by its commitments in Concession Contract 3452 and the 2001 Mining Code, including the commitment to a stabilized legal framework.*\"382 However, Eco Oro never had the rights it asserts and, even had it had such rights, they would have been curtailed by a series of laws and regulations prior to the FTA's entry into force in August 2011.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras. 74, 143.\n\n346.\n\nIn considering this, Eco Oro may only rely on those facts and matters which arose after the entry into force of the FTA; pursuant to Article 801(2) the Tribunal must disregard *\"any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\"* Eco Oro's rights to mine must be assessed at the time the FTA entered into force, however at this time Eco Oro's mining rights had been curtailed both by the declaration of the Santurb\u00e1n-Sisavita and the Santurb\u00e1n Natural Regional Parks and by Resolution 937 which imposed the same mining restrictions on Eco Oro as did Resolution 2090. The dispute between the Parties therefore arose in 2010.\n\n347.\n\nUnder international law a dispute arises when a *\"disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interest between two persons\"* occurs.383 The Parties have been in dispute as to Eco Oro's rights to conduct mining activities in the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo since at least April 2010, as evidenced by the following measures embodying Colombia's policy in relation to mining activities in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and which Eco Oro opposed, namely:\n\na. Law 1382;\n\nb. *Concepto T\u00e9cnico* 594 of 15 April 2010 by which MinAmbiente determined that a significant portion of Concession 3452 overlapped with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo;\n\nc. Order 1241 of 20 April 2010 by which MinAmbiente rejected Eco Oro's EIA on the basis that mining was prohibited in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and that a significant area of Concession 3452 overlapped with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo;\n\nd. Order 1859 of 27 May 2010 by which MinAmbiente determined that it would assess the merits of Eco Oro's EIA;\n\ne. Resolution 937;\n\nf. Resolution 1015;\n\ng. Law 1450; and\n\nh. Eco Oro's EIA was rejected by MinAmbiente relying upon Law 1382 and which rejection was upheld by Resolution 35.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 145; Respondent's Reply, para. 23; *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v. U.K.)*, 1924 P.C.I.J. (ser. B) No. 3 (30 August 1924) (**Exhibit RL-45**).\n\n348.\n\nIt can be seen from this that Resolution 2090 was not an isolated measure but instead a continuation of the mining ban established by Laws 1382 and 1450, both of which predated the FTA's entry into force. Whilst Law 1382 was struck down, the mining ban was re-enacted through Law 1450 and Eco Oro did not benefit from the grandfathering regime in Law 1382. Whilst environmental licenses could be issued for non-mining activities in the p\u00e1ramo, mining activities were not permitted.\n\n349.\n\nEco Oro did not have grandfathered rights and so had no rights to be curtailed by Law 1382 and its rights were not curtailed by Law 1450 because the mining ban did not become effective until the issuance of Resolution 2090.\n\n350.\n\nEco Oro's argument that to assess its jurisdiction *ratione temporis* the Tribunal should only look at the claims as framed by Eco Oro applying a *prima facie* test is wrong: an objective test should be applied.384 The authorities Eco Oro relies upon to support its argument are not of assistance as none relate to the question of *ratione temporis* but instead *ratione materiae,*385*ratione personae,*386 or are otherwise inapplicable.387\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 20; *Kingdom of Lesotho v.

However, in its submissions, Eco Oro says it formed legitimate expectations at two points in time: *(i)* when it originally acquired the mining titles which were consolidated into Concession 3452; and *(ii)* when the titles were in fact consolidated.388 These expectations are legally irrelevant and in any event must have ceased prior to the FTA entering into force. As of 15 August 2011, Eco Oro could not legitimately have expected it would be permitted to mine in the entirety of the area of Concession 3452 as by then *(i)* its environmental licence application had been rejected due to the presence of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem in the project area and *(ii)* the mining ban in p\u00e1ramo areas had been enacted by Laws 1382 and 1450. Pursuant to Article 801(2), legitimate expectations which arose and ceased prior to the FTA coming into force must be disregarded.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 470.\n\n***(b) The Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nThis objection was only advanced for the first time in Colombia's Reply on Jurisdiction and therefore should be excluded under Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In any event it 389 is wrong.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 128.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine Colombia's jurisdictional objections on a *prima facie* basis, this being the \"universal\" approach when considering jurisdictional objections.390 Colombia is wrong to say this only applies to the evaluation of objections *ratione materiae.* In the commentary relied upon by Eco Oro, the author merely notes that the *prima facie* test was used \"*less frequently\"* and since publication of this article, the *prima facie* test has been used in a number of cases.391\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 787, making reference to *Amco*, Decision on Jurisdiction (24 December 1996) (**Exhibit CL-93**), para. 38; *Wena*, Decision on Jurisdiction (25 May 1999) (**Exhibit CL-94**), pp. 890-891; *CMS Gas*, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (17 July 2003) (**Exhibit CL-23**), para. 35; *Azurix*, Decision on Jurisdiction (8 December 2003) (**Exhibit CL-99**), para. 73; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9*, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction (6 August 2003) (**Exhibit CL-97**), paras. 144-145.\n\nSee A. Sheppard, \"Chapter 23: The Jurisdictional Threshold of a Prima-Facie Case\" in P.T. Muchlinski, F. Ortino, C. Schreuer (eds.), *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law* (2008) (**Exhibit CL-106**), p. 960. See also *Eli Lilly and Company v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/14/2, Final Award (16 March 2017) (**Exhibit CL-128**), paras. 163 and 165; *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised) (31 May 2005) (**Exhibit RL-4**), para. 12; *Infinito*, Decision on Jurisdiction (4 December 2017) (**Exhibit RL-24**), paras. 185-187, 332-333.\n\n354.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the events raised by Colombia do not form the basis of Eco Oro's claims and are accordingly irrelevant for the purposes of determining jurisdiction. Colombia says that prior to the entry into force of the FTA, Eco Oro's rights had already been curtailed by *(i)* the declaration of the Sisavita Regional Park; *(ii)* the declaration of the Santurb\u00e1n Regional Park; and *(iii)* Resolution 937 which adopted the 2007 Atlas. Eco Oro's rights were not curtailed by any of these three events. The Sisavita Regional Park did not overlap with the Angostura deposit at all and the Santurb\u00e1n Regional Park only overlapped with a *de minimis* part of the Angostura deposit. The declarations of the two regional parks were not relied upon by Colombia as being relevant to Colombia's jurisdictional objections in its submissions prior to its Reply and their creation is irrelevant to Eco Oro's claim.\n\n355.\n\nColombia's argument that any legitimate expectations Eco Oro may have had must have ceased by the time the FTA entered into force is incorrect. The events referred to by Colombia did not deprive Eco Oro of its rights and therefore cannot have had any negative effect on Eco Oro's legitimate expectations. As Eco Oro's rights were only deprived by events which took place after the FTA entered into force, its legitimate expectations arising out of those rights could not have ceased to exist.\n\n356.\n\nThat should be the end of the investigation. If, however, Colombia's argument needs to be addressed in substance, it is clear that the real dispute between the Parties does not arise from events prior to the cut-off date but from after the FTA came into force.\n\n357.\n\nThus, it was only events after the FTA entered into force that caused Eco Oro to suffer a permanent loss and only those events which resulted in Eco Oro having knowledge of a breach of the FTA causing it loss and therefore triggering the FTA time limitation.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n358.\n\nEco Oro says that in making its case it does not rely upon any acts or facts that arose before the entry into force of the FTA, namely on 15 August 2011. It states that it relies only upon those acts which took place thereafter.\n\n359.\n\nEco Oro further says its rights were only deprived by events which took place after the FTA entered into force, such that its legitimate expectations arising out of those rights could not have ceased to exist.\n\n360.\n\nFor the purposes of this jurisdictional objection, as Eco Oro relies only on post-15 August 2011 measures, that is sufficient to found jurisdiction over those measures: the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine whether prior acts are compatible with the FTA, although it is entitled to have regard to those acts in establishing the facts as they occurred after 15 August 2011, including the state of mind of the Parties, and the expectations they may have had at that time. Whether or not Eco Oro had protected rights will be considered below, but on the basis that Eco Oro's claim stands or falls on its reliance only upon facts and events which occurred after 15 August 2011, the requirements of Article 801(2) are satisfied.\n\n**E.** **W****hether** **E****co** **O****ro****'****s** **C****laims fall within the** **T****ribunal****'****s** **J****urisdiction** ***ratione materiae***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nArticle 2201(3) of the Treaty (\"**Article 2201(3)**\") provides as follows:\n\n*\"Article 2201: General Exceptions*\n\n[...]\n\n*(3) For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:*\n\n*(a) To protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and health;*\n\n*(b) To ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Agreement; or*\n\n*(c) For the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.*\n\n[...].392\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit R-137**).\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n*(i) Colombia has not consented to arbitrate claims arising out of measures which are expressly excluded from the scope of the FTA*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nColombia argues that Article 2201(3) of the FTA should be construed as providing that nothing in the FTA is to be read as restricting the Contracting Parties' ability to adopt measures *\"necessary* [t]*o protect human, animal or plant life or health\"* and for \"*the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources\"*. On that basis, Colombia asserts that it has not consented to arbitrate disputes relating to such measures, as Colombia's consent to arbitration set out in Article 823 of the FTA only extends to *\"claim[s] by an investor of a Party that the other Party has breached* [...] *an obligation under Section A* [of the FTA]\". There can be no breach of the FTA if the actions taken by Colombia are *(i)* necessary; *(ii)* do not constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination; and *(iii)* are not disguised restrictions on international trade.393 Article 2201(3) does not solely apply to limit a tribunal's right to award non-monetary damages.394 Further, given environmental measures were excluded from Chapter Eight in its entirety, it is not surprising that the more specific exclusion provided for in Article 837 does not reference them and the fact Annex 811(b) confirms that measures for the \"*protection of the environment*\" do not constitute indirect expropriation is equally unremarkable given their exclusion from the scope of Chapter Eight. The Parties have not consented to resolve through arbitration claims concerning measures that fall outside the scope of Chapter Eight and the Tribunal therefore does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate on these measures.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 157.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 158; Respondent's Reply, para. 124; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 44-49.\n\n363.\n\nSupport for this can be found in an opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"**CJEU**\"), stating that environmental exceptions in investment instruments act as a bar to jurisdiction over claims concerning measures for the protection of the environment.395\n\nCJEU Opinion on CETA 1/17 (30 April 2019) (**Exhibit RL-173**).\n\n364.\n\nColombia further asserts that Article 2201(3) should be read consistently with GATT Article XX which is phrased in very similar terms to Article 2210(3) and on which the Environment Agreement and this carve-out are based. It is apposite to refer to GATT and WTO law in interpreting Article 2201(3),396 which support its construction.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 425, making reference to *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award (5 September 2008) (**Exhibit CL-53**).\n\n365.\n\nFinally, Colombia posits that the second sentence in Article 2201(4) of the FTA does not appear in either of the treaties giving rise to the disputes in *Bear Creek*397 (the Canada-Peru FTA) and *Infinito*398 (the Canada-Costa Rica BIT), cited by Eco Oro in support of its interpretation of Article 2201(3). *Bear Creek* and *Infinito* are thus clearly distinguishable on this basis alone, and cannot inform the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 2201(3), which must be construed on its own terms, against the background of the other terms of the FTA, and in light of its particular object and purpose and all other important principles of international treaty interpretation.399\n\n*Bear Creek Mining Corporation v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/21, Award (30 November 2017) (**Exhibit CL-91**) (\"***Bear Creek***\").\n\n*Infinito Gold Ltd. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5, Decision on Jurisdiction (4 December 2017) (**Exhibit RL-24**) (\"***Infinito***\").\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 49.\n\n*(ii) Eco Oro's claims fall squarely within the Environmental Exception of the FTA and therefore outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n366.\n\nThe measures giving rise to Eco Oro's claims are all measures falling within the FTA's environmental carve-out because they were all necessary for the protection of human, plant and animal life, namely the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and for the conservation of non-living exhaustible natural resources, namely water. These measures have not been applied \"*in a manner that constitutes arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination*\" as they apply to all holders of mining rights located in areas which overlap the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. Indeed, Colombia notes that Eco Oro has not alleged discrimination.400\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 162.\n\n***(b) The Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n*(i) Article 2201(3) of the Treaty has no bearing on Eco Oro's claims and Colombia's interpretation is incorrect*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nArticle 2201(3) provides that *\"nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures*\" taken for any of the listed purposes that meet the qualifying criteria. The text of Article 2201(3) is explicit and specific: the ordinary meaning is that it does not prevent the payment of compensation (which payment does not prevent Colombia from adopting or enforcing measures to protect the environment) but only applies when a State is seeking to pass (adopt) or implement (enforce), *inter alia,* environmental measures.401 Indeed, the payment of compensation, as a result of an internationally wrongful act such as a breach of the FTA, is a default rule under international law.402 It is unnecessary for Article 2201(3) to state that this obligation remains in effect; to the contrary, it would require explicit and unequivocal text to restrict a State's obligation to pay compensation. 403\n\nSee Claimant's Reply, fn. 1500, where Eco Oro asserts that \"[a] *similar provision appears at Article 1114 of NAFTA. It has been interpreted as serving the purpose of a general reminder to be 'sensitive to environmental concerns.'* *Metalclad Corporation v The United Mexican States (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/97/1), Award, 30 August 2000,* ***CL-15****, para 98**: 'This conclusion is not affected by NAFTA Article 1114, which permits a Party to ensure that investment activity is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns'; see also SD Myers, Inc v The Government of Canada (UNCITRAL), Separate Opinion of Dr Bryan Schwart, 12 November 2000,* ***CL-95****, paras 117-118: 'Commentators on NAFTA have referred variously to Articles like 1114 as 'tautologies' or as 'diplomatic, rather than legal' statements. [\u2026] I view Article 1114 as acknowledging and reminding interpreters of Chapter 11 (Investment) that the parties take both the environment and open trade very seriously and that means should be found to reconcile these two objectives and, if possible, to make them mutually supportive.'*\"\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Rejoinder, para. 208; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 117, where Eco Oro makes reference to Articles 27(b) and 36(1) of the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) (**Exhibits CL-17 / CL-202** / **RL-115**).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 208.\n\n368.\n\nAgain, applying the VCLT rules on treaty interpretation, Article 2201(3) specifically applies to Chapter Eight. Article 834(2)(b) (in Chapter Eight) permits a tribunal to award restitution but the act of restitution may require what Article 2201(3) expressly prohibits. It cannot be correct that Article 2201(3) carves out environmental measures from the ambit of Chapter Eight: if it had there would have been no need to refer to them in Chapter Eight at all. For example, pursuant to Annex 811(2)(b), in *\"rare circumstances\"* environmental measures will amount to an indirect expropriation. Had environmental measures been excluded from Chapter Eight this provision would not have been included. Again Article 807(2) carves out environmental measures, but had they been excluded in their entirety from Chapter Eight this would have been unnecessary. In any event the second sentence of this article specifically provides that an environmental measure will still be subject to the investment protections offered in Articles 803 and 804 (guarantees of National Treatment and Most-Favoured Nation Treatment): this is irreconcilable with Colombia's asserted construction.\n\n369.\n\nA further argument against Colombia's construction is the absence in Article 837 of a reference to environmental measures. Article 837 refers to those matters excluded from the dispute settlement provisions of Chapter Eight as listed in Article 837, but environmental measures are not included in the list and nor are measures falling within the ambit of Article 2201(3). Colombia's argument that the alleged general carve-out of environmental measures contained in Article 2201(3) explains both the inclusion and exclusion of references to environmental measures is contradictory. It is also noteworthy that Article 2202, which takes, in part, the same form as Article 2201(3) and which contains an exception for national security, is explicitly referenced in the exceptions contained in Article 837.\n\n370.\n\nThis construction is supported both by the decisions in *Bear Creek*404 and *Infinito.*405The tribunal in *Bear Creek* considered an identical provision to Article 2201(3) holding that it could not be interpreted in such a way as to absolve Peru of a liability to compensate the investor for breach of a provision in the Canada-Peru FTA, stating that *\"since the exception in Article 2201 does not offer any waiver from the obligation in Article 812 to compensate for the expropriation, Respondent has also failed to explain why it was necessary for the protection of human life not to offer compensation to Claimant for the derogation of Supreme Decree 083.*\"406\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 821; *Bear Creek*, Award (30 November 2017) (**Exhibit CL-91**).\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 212; *Infinito*, Decision on Jurisdiction (4 December 2017) (**Exhibit RL-24**).\n\n*Bear Creek*, Award (30 November 2017) (**Exhibit CL-91**), paras. 477-478.\n\n371.\n\nThe CJEU authority referred to by Colombia is inapposite, *(i)* being contained in an opinion relating to the compatibility of CETA with EU law and not arising out of adversarial proceedings; and *(ii)* having been the product of teleological interpretation as opposed to the textual analysis required by the VCLT. Colombia's reference to decisions rendered pursuant to GATT Article XX is equally inappropriate. GATT Article XX only applies to Chapters Two to Seven and therefore cannot shed any light on the interpretation of Article 2201(3).407\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 216.\n\n372.\n\nArticle 2201(3) permits an investor to seek compensation but not restitution for a breach of the FTA. As Eco Oro is not seeking restitution, only monetary compensation, Colombia is not prevented from *\"adopting or enforcing\"* the measures at issue and Article 2201(3) has no relevance to Eco Oro's claim.\n\n**(2) Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nIn a non-disputing party submission dated 27 February 2020, Canada provided its views on Article 2201(3). It noted that the general exceptions in sub paragraphs 1 - 3 are standard in Canada's trade agreements and the language used is generally similar across its agreements. This enables States to *\"differentiate between investments on the basis of a broad range of policy objectives without breaching the national treatment obligation\"* meaning that *\"legitimate regulatory actions will rarely need to be justified on the basis of the general exception on Article 2201(3) because they will not constitute breaches of the investment obligations in the first place\"* The general exceptions thus act as a *\"final 'safety net' to protect the State's exercise of regulatory powers in pursuit of the specific legitimate objectives identified in the exceptions.*\"408\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, paras. 19-20.\n\n374.\n\nCanada notes that these exceptions only apply once there has been a determination that there is a breach of a primary obligation in Chapter Eight. The exceptions in Article 2201 cannot broaden the scope of a State's primary obligations. For the exception to apply, the measure in question must *(i)* not be applied in a manner that constitutes arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investments or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment; *(ii)* relate to one of the policy objectives set out in paragraphs (a) - (c) (which includes the protection of the environment); and *(iii)* be \"necessary\" to achieve these objectives. If the general exception applies, there can be no violation of the FTA and thus no State liability and, consequently, payment of compensation would not be required.\n\n375.\n\nCanada further notes (in response to a question raised to the Parties by the Tribunal) that each sub-paragraph of Article 2201 has its own scope of application and should be read and construed without reference to any of the other sub-paragraphs.\n\n376.\n\nCanada finally explains that the Contracting Parties to the FTA \"*did not view their investment obligations as being at odds with the protection of environmental and social goals and their environment and human rights obligations!\"* As provided for in Article 1701 of the FTA, the Contracting Parties \"*affirmed that trade and environment policies are mutually supportive*\" and that \"*a good faith interpretation of investment obligations in their context and in light of the purpose and objective of the [FTA], will not be inconsistent with a State's ability to adopt environmental protection measures. In this respect, in the context of an allegation that a regulatory measure is in breach of Article 811, a proper analysis of the measure in light of the guidance provided in Annex 811.2 (and if necessary under Article 2210(3)) will not limit the State's ability to regulate in the public interest for the protection of the environment*.\"409\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, paras. 24-25.\n\n377.\n\nIn response, Eco Oro notes Canada's acceptance that Article 2201(3) bears no relation to the question of Colombia's consent to arbitrate. This is a matter addressed in Articles 818 - 837. Canada confirms Article 2201(3) only applies after determination of a breach of a primary obligation in Chapter Eight; this presupposes that a tribunal constituted under Chapter Eight will have had jurisdiction to hear claims based on, *inter alia*, environmental measures. Given the exceptions listed in Article 837 and its Annex do not include environmental measures, it is clear that Colombia has consented to arbitrate claims arising out of environmental measures; there is no wholesale exclusion of environmental measures from the scope of Chapter Eight.\n\n378.\n\nColombia concurs generally with Canada's submission and notes the Tribunal should place *\"significant weight\"* on it. Colombia further notes with approval Canada's submission that the Article 2201(3) exception operates as a *\"safety net\"* and that where it applies there is no violation of the FTA and no liability to pay compensation, which submission, it says, is irreconcilable with Eco Oro's submission that Article 2210(3) only operates to prevent a tribunal awarding non-monetary relief. This is a *\"highly persuasive\"* basis to depart from the *Bear Creek* and *Infinito* judgements cited by Eco Oro (to the extent they are in any event relevant). Article 2210(3) is clearly a *\"critical component\"* in the FTA scheme providing for the balance between investment protection and environmental and human rights obligations.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal is here considering the relevance of Article 2201(3) in terms of Colombia's jurisdictional objection and not in terms of the merits of Eco Oro's claim.\n\n380.\n\nThe Tribunal construes Article 2201(3) in accordance with its ordinary meaning pursuant to the VCLT to consider its applicability to the question of jurisdiction. The title of this Article is \"General Exceptions\" and Article 2201(3) commences with the words *\"For the purposes of Chapter Eight* [...].\" Given these words, it is difficult to construe Article 2201(3) other than as in principle being of application when Chapter Eight is engaged, rather than applying to exclude the totality of the application of Chapter Eight. Had it been intended, as contended for by Colombia, that environmental measures *per se* were entirely outside the scope of Chapter Eight, the measures listed in Article 2201(3) would not be referred to as 'exceptions' to Chapter Eight; the words would be redundant. The fact that there is a detailed description of the specific purpose and necessity of the environmental measures provided for in Article 2201(3) (which list is a contained list and not just examples of measures that are to be regarded as exceptions) is inconsistent with Colombia's construction. Were it intended that all forms of environmental measures are excluded from Chapter Eight, this level of detail would also be redundant. The Tribunal's analysis is supported by Canada's submissions that these exceptions only apply once there has been a determination that there is a breach of a primary obligation in Chapter Eight.410\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 16.\n\n381.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal does not accept Colombia's submissions that this provision can operate as a bar to the existence or exercise of jurisdiction, and it therefore finds it has jurisdiction *ratione materiae*.\n\n**VII. SUBSTANTIVE CLAIMS**\n---------------------------\n\n382.\n\nHaving concluded that it has jurisdiction to determine Eco Oro's claims, the Tribunal now turns to consider the merits of its substantive claims.\n\n383.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Colombia has breached Article 811 of the Treaty (\"**Article 811**\") relating to expropriation, as well as multiple aspects of Article 805 of the Treaty (\"**Article 805**\") relating to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.

To determine fair market value a Tribunal shall use appropriate valuation criteria, which may include going concern value, asset value including the declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria.*\n\n*(3) Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable.

Whilst in opening submissions, Mr. Blackaby appeared to concede that Eco Oro only had an acquired right to apply for an environmental licence and not an acquired right to exploit subject to obtaining an environmental licence (Tr. Day 1 (Mr. Blackaby), 31:6-7), in paragraph 3 of its Post-Hearing Brief, Eco Oro maintains its submission that it had valuable rights to exploit, which exploitation rights were expropriated by Colombia.\n\nBy signing Concession Contract 3452, Eco Oro gained access to Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code \u2013 Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**).\n\nConcession Contract No. 3452 (8 February 2007) (**Exhibits C-16 / MR-34**); Article 77 of the 2001 Mining Code \u2013 Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**).\n\n389.\n\nThese rights initially arose out of Permit 3452. From 1997, Eco Oro carried out its mining activities in the area covered by Permit 3452 pursuant to an approved PMA.419 Permit 3452 and Eco Oro's subsequent titles were granted under the 1988 Mining Code,420 which required a concessionaire to obtain an exploration licence and complete its exploration activities before obtaining an exploitation licence. Pursuant to Article 6 of the 1988 Mining Code, permits granted prior to the 1998 Mining Code (such as Permit 3452) and exploration and exploitation licences issued pursuant to the 1988 Mining Code constituted acquired rights. Article 10 of the 1988 Mining Code provided that mining activities could be carried out anywhere in Colombia, save for the restricted mining zones, which included *\"ecological, farming or livestock reserve areas in accordance with Article 9* [...].\" Article 9 provided that:\n\n*\"The Ministry may indicate areas in which prospecting, exploration or exploitation mining works should not be carried out according to existing studies, since these are incompatible with such works pursuant to the Renewable Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Code* [...]*.*\n\n*The indication referred to in the previous paragraph does not affect previously issued titles, while they remain valid.\"*\n\nEnvironmental Management Plan for Gold Exploration in the Municipality of California, Santander, prepared by Geocol, Ltda. For Greystar (March 1997) (**Exhibit C-4**); CDMB, Resolution No. 568 (4 June 1997) (**Exhibits C-5 / R-64**); and Decree 1753 of 1994 (8 March 1994) (**Exhibit C-307**).\n\nDecree No. 2655 of 1988 (Mining Code 1988) (23 December 1988) (**Exhibit C-64**) (as cited in Claimant's Memorial, para. 320).\n\n390.\n\nThe mining titles that Eco Oro obtained had no existing environmental restrictions and two of the licences obtained (granted pursuant to the 1988 Mining Code) were converted into exploitation licences shortly after being acquired by Eco Oro.421 Permit 3452 was not within a prohibited area and therefore Eco Oro had acquired rights to explore and exploit pursuant to Permit 3452 and its other exploration and exploitation licences over 92% of the Angostura deposit.\n\nExploration Licences 13356 and 47-68. See Greystar Resources Ltd., Consolidated Financial Statements for years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (9 March 2005) (**Exhibit C-96)**, pp. 11-12.\n\n391.\n\nArticle 6 of the 1988 Mining Code established what constituted acquired rights for the purposes of mining laws and regulations (namely duly executed and formalised concession contracts) and noted the difference between such acquired rights and mere expectations.422 Thus, when the titles were consolidated under Article 101 of the 2001 Mining Code into Concession 3452, this gave Eco Oro acquired rights pursuant to Article 6 of the 1988 Mining Code. Eco Oro's single unified title granted it the right (and obligation) to explore and exploit the entirety of the Concession area for up to 30 years and to obtain an extension of the Concession. 423 Whilst seven of the ten titles were under exploitation at the time of integration, it is accepted that when Concession 3452 was granted, it reverted to being in the exploration phase.424 However, on being granted the unified title, the ANM approved Eco Oro's Unified Exploration and Exploitation Program, confirming it had fully complied with the obligations set out in the various integrated titles. Eco Oro's Concession 3452 had a duration of 20 years because the ANM deducted the ten years of exploration that had been conducted under the oldest integrated title, namely Permit 3452.\n\nDecree No. 2655 of 1988 (Mining Code 1988) (23 December 1988) (**Exhibit C-64**), Art. 6.\n\nArticles 45, 58 and 70, of the 2001 Mining Code. Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**).\n\nTr. Day 4 (Professor Ricaurte), 879-883.\n\n392.\n\nConcession 3452 was a new contract and subject to a new legal regime but it was not a new title: the concessionaire was entitled to assume that mining would continue to be allowed as it had been allowed under the old regime.425 Although Concession 3452 was only registered on 9 August 2007, it came into effect on 8 February 2007 when it was executed.426\n\nANM Memorandum (2 October 2014) (**Exhibit PMR-32**); Tr. Day 4 (Professor Ricaurte), 904:4-905:11.\n\nRicaurte Opinion, para. 27.\n\n393.\n\nEco Oro's rights pursuant to Concession 3452, included the following:\n\na. To explore (clause 4(a)), which right entailed two reciprocal obligations on Eco Oro *(i)* to pay surface canons over the entire area and *(ii)* the obligation to explore. Eco Oro further had the right and obligation to apply for an environmental licence by submitting a PTO for approval of the mining authority and an EIA for the approval of the environment authority, prior to the expiry of the exploration phase. Upon being granted an environmental licence, Eco Oro was then permitted to commence exploitation activities;\n\nb. The exclusive right to exploit in the concession area (clause 4(b));\n\nc. The right to request an extension of the concession.\n\n394.\n\nEco Oro's right to undertake exploitation activities in the whole of Concession 3452 is an acquired right. Pursuant to Articles 58 and 197 of the 2001 Mining Code, Eco Oro had acquired rights under Concession 3452 to explore, to exploit (provided the relevant environmental regulations were complied with) and to obtain an extension of the Concession. This is confirmed by *(i)* an opinion of MinMinas in 2012;427 *(ii)* the *Consejo de Estado* in a 2017 judgement;428 and *(iii)* by Clause One of Concession 3452 which stated that the object of the agreement was *\"to undertake a project of economic exploitation [...] in the entire area set out in Clause Two of this agreement* [...].\"429\n\nMinistry of Mines and Energy Opinion 2012026198 in response to question raised by the Attorney General's Office regarding Mining Concession Contracts (14 May 2012) (**Exhibit PMR-26**).\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Judgment No. 38338 (6 July 2017) (**Exhibit PMR-37**).\n\nConcession Contract 3452 (8 February 2007) (**Exhibit C-16**), Clause 1.\n\n395.\n\nThe fact that Eco Oro had to fulfil certain requirements (pre-conditions) before being able to exercise its exploitation rights (such as obtaining approval of its PMA and getting an environmental licence) does not change the fact these rights are acquired rights and not condition precedents. This is demonstrated, *inter alia,* by the 2005 MinAmbiente Decree governing the granting of licences (\"*the granting of an environmental licence is the pre-condition for the exercise of rights arising from* [...] *concessions*\")430 and as stated in a letter from MinAmbiente to the *Consejo de Estado* dated 7 October 2014.431 Thus, Concession 3452 gave Eco Oro acquired rights, the exercise of which was subject to obtaining the relevant approvals, permits and licences. This became part of Eco Oro's patrimony and thus subject to legal protection. Eco Oro's application for an environmental licence was entitled to be considered as if there was no blanket ban on mining.\n\nDecree No. 1220 of 2005 (21 April 2005) (**Exhibit C-97**), Art. 5.\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Environment (Mr. Vallejo) to the *Consejo de Estado* (Mr. Hernandez) (7 October 2014) (**Exhibit C-348**).\n\n396.\n\nFor Eco Oro's right to exploit to be subject to a condition precedent (a suspensive condition) as argued by Colombia, it would have had to have been expressly agreed to by both Parties. The provision in Concession 3452 that Eco Oro had to apply for an environmental licence was not a condition precedent but a legal requirement to be complied with to exercise a right under the Concession. There are many such requirements, for example the various permits and authorisations required for exploration activities as provided for in Article 198 of the 2001 Mining Code. This is clear from reading Articles 59, 197 and 199 of the 2001 Mining Code which refer to the exercise of a right.\n\n397.\n\nIn compliance with these rights and obligations, Eco Oro has invested over USD 250 million, over the course of 20 years, building: roads; over 1,000 drilling platforms from which it has drilled over 362 kilometres of cores; several kilometres of exploration tunnels to expand the existing network of tunnels that had existed when it acquired the underlying titles; and a water treatment plant to treat the water draining from these tunnels. It has also declared over 3.2 million ounces of resources.432\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 82; Second Compass Lexecon Report, Appendix D; Compass Lexecon Historical Cost Summary (Undated) (**Exhibit CLEX-96**).\n\n398.\n\nPursuant to Article 45 of the 2001 Mining Code, Eco Oro carried these activities out and incurred expense at its own technical and economic risk; not at its own legal risk. The concession contract is an adhesion contact, established by the administrator. It is also a reciprocal State contract (as defined by Article 1498 of the Civil Code) and, as confirmed by Colombian jurisprudence, it is not aleatory.433 Its purpose is to provide clear and firm legal stability to those private parties that participate in exploration and exploitation activities, conferring rights and obligations, such that the applicable legal rules are those in force at the time the contract is perfected. Whilst it is accepted that certain subsequent public interest laws, for example environmental laws, may adversely affect such a contract pursuant to the principle that the public interest prevails over private interests, given the rights are acquired, compensation is payable if the rights are adversely affected.434 Article 90 of the Constitution provides that for the State to be liable to pay compensation, there are three requirements: *(i)* the existence of harm; *(ii)* the harm must be attributable to the State through either an action or omission by any public authority; and *(iii)* such harm must be unlawful. The compensable loss includes economic and non-economic losses, including loss of a chance; the valuation is governed by the principles of full reparation and equity.\n\nAdministrative Tribunal for Cundinamarca Judgment (29 November 2018) (**Exhibit PMR-41**).\n\nTr. Day 4 (Professor Ricaurte), 865-869.\n\n399.\n\nWere Colombia's construction correct, it would entail Eco Oro renouncing its right both to compensation and to the re-establishment of the economic equilibrium of the concession. This would be impermissible under Colombian jurisprudence and doctrine as it would distort the commutative nature of the concession contract. Because these are reciprocal contracts, the only risks that can be validly transferred to the concessionaire are the economic risks of the project, never legal or regulatory risks.435\n\nTr.

Its only right was the right to explore for minerals and to apply, within strict time limits, for the necessary permissions and licenses to construct mining infrastructure and exploit minerals, subject always to compliance with applicable licensing restrictions and other relevant laws.\n\n401.\n\nEco Oro identifies its covered investment as being those rights arising out of Concession 3452 and the regulatory framework and asserts that these rights were expropriated. Whilst Permit 3452 was an exploration and exploitation permit, it only covered 250 hectares out of Concession 3452's 5,000 hectares and all exploitation activities had been discontinued prior to Eco Oro's acquisition of it. Eco Oro had no acquired rights at the time of executing Concession 3452 to mine in the entirety of Concession 3452 or at all. All rights, including any exploitation rights it may have had under the 1988 Mining Code and Decree 2477 of 1986, were voluntarily relinquished upon its entry into Concession 3452, when its rights instead became subject to the 2001 Mining Code.436 Only mining titles governed by the 2001 Mining Code, or those in respect of which a conversion request to the 2001 Mining Code had been made, could be integrated. Therefore, upon integration of the ten titles pursuant to Article 349 of the 2001 Mining Code, all ten titles became subject to the same unified, modern, legal framework.437\n\nINGEOMINAS, Resolution DSM No. 75 (2 February 2007) (**Exhibit C-109 / R-68**); Vivero Arciniegas Report, paras. 16-18; M. Ricaurte, Commentary to the 2001 Mining Code (2017) (**Exhibit R-195**), Art. 101; Tr. Day 1 (Mr. Mantilla-Serrano), 286-288.\n\nVivero Arciniegas Report, para. 10.\n\n402.\n\nIn any event, the pre-2001 Mining Code titles did not confer any mining rights, the titles being licenses and permits and not concession contracts. Professor Ricaurte accepts that licenses and permits could be unilaterally modified by the Mining Authority without the concessionaire's consent.438 Being *titulus precarious,* they could be altered or withdrawn at any time without compensation being payable and their term was strictly limited with no right of renewal. The fact that INGEOMINAS was aware that some exploitation had been carried out under Permit 3452 is irrelevant, the entire Angostura Project was legally reset upon integration of all the titles.439\n\nRicaurte Opinion, para. 25(b); Claimant's Reply, para. 63(b).\n\nINGEOMINAS, Resolution DSM No. 75 (2 February 2007) (**Exhibit C-109 / R-68**).\n\n403.\n\nWhilst Eco Oro is correct that concession contracts under the 2001 Mining Code are, *inter alia*, bilateral and adhesion contracts, they are onerous contracts440 and as such can be aleatory or commutative. Colombian doctrine has held that concession contracts may be aleatory because the parties are subject to a contingency of profit or loss.441 This contingency can be seen from Article 45 of the 2001 Mining Code, which provides that the concessionaire carries out the concession contract at its own expense and risk. Therefore, Concession 3452 is not commutative.\n\nArticle 1497 of the Civil Code \u2013 C\u00f3digo Civil Colombiano (extract) (Undated) (**Exhibit PMR-45**).\n\nA. Matson Carballo, \"El contrato de concesi\u00f3n minera. Con comentarios y normatividad\", Librer\u00eda Jur\u00eddica S\u00e1nchez R. Ltda., Medell\u00edn (2013) (**Exhibit PFDV-10**).\n\n404.\n\nProfessor Ricaurte is also incorrect to say that the principle of economic equilibrium applies to mining concession contracts; such concession contracts are governed by the 2001 Mining Code and not, pursuant to Article 53 of the 2001 Mining Code, by the General Public Procurement Code.\n\n405.\n\nConcession contracts are multi-tiered agreements *(contratos escalonados)* such that the rights and obligations accruing to the concession holder change over the course of each phase of the concession.442 Not every contractual right is an acquired right; to qualify as such the right must *(i)* have been perfected such that all requirements or pre-conditions to the vesting of the right have been fully satisfied; and *(ii)* not be revocable. Whilst the object and ultimate purpose of a concession contract is economic exploitation, its achievement is subject to compliance with the stipulated laws and regulations and Clause 1 of Concession 3452 does not provide that the right to exploit is an acquired right. The main purpose of the exploration phase was to allow Eco Oro to conduct such activities as would enable it to submit its PTO for approval from the relevant mining authority and apply for an environmental licence, but there was no guarantee those applications would be successful. It is clear from the text of Clause One that the PTO, once submitted and approved, forms a part of the concession contract and defines the content of the object of the concession contract. Any application for an environmental licence for activities which failed to offset their effects on the environment must be rejected and the precautionary principle militates against issuing an environmental licence for activities whose effects on the environment are uncertain. In any event, an environmental licence can be revoked at any time without compensation if the relevant environmental authority finds that the project causes an adverse impact on the environment. A PTO may also be denied if it is not demonstrated that the project will be technically or economically feasible.\n\nArticle 45 of the 2001 Mining Code details the phases. Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Art. 45.\n\n406.\n\nTo acquire the right to exploit minerals under Concession 3452, pursuant to Articles 85 and 86 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clauses 5 and 6 of Concession 3452, Eco Oro had to, *inter alia,* submit a viable PTO and obtain an environmental licence,443 neither of which it did for the underground mining project (and its attempt to obtain an environmental licence for the open-pit mining project failed): in the absence of these, there is no right to carry out construction or exploitation activities. These requirements are suspensive conditions to which the existence of the right to fulfilment is subject; there is no right to exploit without satisfying them and as they are attached to the rights to construct and exploit, these rights cannot be acquired rights but are merely bare expectations which were not immune to subsequent changes in the laws and regulations. This is clear from the Civil Code which provides that: \"*A condition is suspensive if, while it is not fulfilled, the acquisition of a right is suspended; it is resolutive if a right is extinguished when it is fulfilled.\"*444 This is also confirmed by a Judgement of the Constitutional Court.445 Contrary to a bare expectation (*simples expectativas)*, an acquired right can be transferred to a third party and is immune to subsequent laws or regulations. A right that is subject to a suspensive condition is deemed not even to exist until the condition is met.446\n\nArticle 85 of the 2011 Mining Code. Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**).\n\nArticles 1530 and 1536 of the Civil Code. \"C\u00f3digo Civil\", Arts. 1530, 1536 (Undated) (**Exhibit PFDV-1**).\n\nSentencia 15668 del 26 de marzo de 2008 de la Secci\u00f3n Tercera de la Sala de lo Contencioso Administrativo del Consejo de Estado.

In the exploration phase, the entirety of the area is available to the concessionaire to carry out certain activities and that is the acquired right - it is correct that to exercise certain aspects of that right, permits or authorisations may be required, to enable trees to be cut down or to use water for example, but the whole of the concession area is available and accessible. At the exploitation phase, the concessionaire has no accessibility to any part of the concession area unless and until they get the environmental licence. This environmental licence is completely different to an environmental authorisation and without it there is no access at all to any area of the concession.\n\n409.\n\nUpon being asked by MinAmbiente to clarify the nature of the exploitation right,447 the *Consejo de Estado* confirmed these rights were not acquired rights.448 The practical effect may be the same where there is an acquired right which requires compliance with a precondition to be exercisable and a suspensive condition,449 but if there is a requirement which must be complied with before the right can be exercised it cannot be an acquired right.450\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Environment (Mr. Vallejo) to the *Consejo de Estado* (Mr. Hernandez) (7 October 2014) (**Exhibit C-348**).\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**).\n\nTr.

Again, Article 14 of the 2001 Mining Code does not say that, by entering into the concession, Eco Oro gained an acquired right to exploit, it merely provides that *(i)* concession contracts are the only type of mining contract permitted under the 2001 Mining Code; and *(ii)* mining titles issued prior to the effective date of the 2001 Mining Code are to remain in force.451\n\nThis is confirmed by Professor Ricaurte's commentary to Article 14 - M. Ricaurte, Commentary to the 2001 Mining Code (2017) (**Exhibit R-194**), Article 14.\n\n411.\n\nWhilst Eco Oro had an acquired right to explore and an acquired right to apply for an environmental licence, given that Constitutional Court Judgement 339 of 2002 confirmed the possibility of establishing mining exclusion zones in the p\u00e1ramo pursuant to Articles 34 and 36 of the 2001 Mining Code, Eco Oro would have known its application would be refused and therefore it is not even as if Eco Oro has lost any opportunity.452\n\nTr.

Republic of Uzbekistan*, UNCITRAL, Award (17 December 2015) (**Exhibits CL-84 / RL-99**) (\"***Oxus***\").\n\n413.\n\nEco Oro's acquired rights were therefore: *(i)* to the availability of that part of Concession 3452 that is not restricted by an environmental exclusion zone to conduct exploration activities, subject to the obtention, where applicable, of the necessary environmental permits (as these permits are different in nature to an environmental licence it does not change the nature of this acquired right); and *(ii)* to apply for an environmental licence.\n\n414.\n\nThe breach of an acquired right does give right to compensation, whereas the breach of a mere expectation does not.454 However, as Eco Oro had no acquired right to exploitation, it has no right to compensation.\n\nTr. Day 4 (Mr. Vivero Arciniegas), 1004:12-18.\n\n415.\n\nFinally, Eco Oro does not have any right to renew its concession for an additional 30 years because such a right would only have vested had Eco Oro reached the exploitation phase; Eco Oro remained in the exploration phase, having not, *inter alia,* obtained an environmental licence.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nEco Oro's right to exploit will only benefit from constitutional protection pursuant to Article 58 of the Political Constitution if it is an acquired right. Eco Oro says it is whereas Colombia says it is not. Article 58 provides as follows:\n\n\"*All private property is guaranteed, together with other rights acquired in accordance with the civil laws, which may not be ignored or undermined by subsequent laws. When the application of a law passed for the purpose of public utility or social interest results in a conflict between the rights of individuals and the need recognized in said law, the private interest shall be subordinate to the public or social interest. Property has a social function that implies obligations. As such, an ecological dimension is inherent in it. The State will protect and promote associative and joint forms of property. Expropriation may be carried out for reasons of public utility or social interest defined by the legislature, subject to a judicial decision and prior compensation. The compensation will be determined by taking into account the interests of the community and of the individual concerned. In cases determined by the legislature, the expropriation may be carried out by means of administrative action, subject to subsequent litigation before the administrative law courts, including with regard to the value of compensation.*455\n\nPolitical Constitution of Colombia (1991) (**Exhibit C-65**).\n\n417.\n\nIn Judgment C-529 the Constitutional Court drew the distinction between those rights protected by Article 58 and mere expectations, noting:\n\n\"*[Page 9]*\n\n*The provision [Article 58 of the Political Constitution] refers to* *consolidated legal situations, not those amounting to mere expectations**. Given that in mere expectations the right has not been acquired, they are subject to future regulation introduced by law.*\n\n*It is clear that an amendment or repeal of a given legal provision produces effects to the future,* *except for the principle of most favorable rule, such that situations which were consolidated under the amended or repealed provision may not be impaired**. Therefore, pursuant to the constitutional provision, individual and concrete rights which have already been acquired by a person are not affected by the new rules, which can only apply to legal situations arising after the rules' entry into force.*\" 456 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment C-529 (24 November 1994) (**Exhibit PMR-7**).\n\n418.\n\nThe Constitutional Court further stated in Judgment No. C-168 that:\n\np. 11\n\n*\"**Private property and other acquired rights under civil law are guaranteed and cannot be disregarded or infringed by subsequent laws**. When the application of a law issued to protect a public interest or a social interest results in a conflict between the rights of individuals and the interest recognized by the law,* *the private interest must yield to the public or social interest**.....*\n\n[...]\n\n*acquired rights are the legal powers regularly exercised and the expectation of having legal powers that are not exercised at the time of the change in legislation\". (Explanations of Comparative Chilean Civil Law, Volume I, pp. 64 and following)*\n\n[...]\n\n*Bare expectations do not constitute rights, nor potential rights. They refer to factual situations rather than legal situations: they are interests that are not legally protected and that resemble 'castles in the sky'...*\n\n[...]\n\n*As can be seen,* *case law as well as doctrine distinguish acquired rights from bare expectations,* *and ...* *the legislators, when issuing the new law, cannot harm or ignore them. The same does not occur with so-called 'expectations,' because as their name indicates, they are merely the probability or hope there is of one day obtaining a right; consequently, they can be changed at the lawmaker's discretion**.*\n\n*Our Supreme Law expressly protects acquired rights, in article 58, and prohibits lawmakers from issuing laws that will hurt or ignore them, leaving so-called expectations, whose regulation is the competence of lawmakers, outside of this coverage, in accordance with the parameters of equity and justice that the very Constitution has laid out for the performance of their duty.*\n\n[...]\n\n*In conclusion:* *acquired rights are incorporated definitively to the equity of the owner, and are covered from any official act that might ignore them,* because *the Constitution itself guarantees and protects it; the same does not occur with expectations, which in general lack legal relevance, and consequently can be changed or extinguished by lawmakers.*[...]\"457 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-168 (20 April 1995) (**Exhibit PFDV-5**) (USB drive provided at the Hearing).\n\n419.\n\nAgain in its Judgment C-314, the Constitutional Court stated:\n\n*\"7.* *Acquired rights*\n\n*In line with the decisions of this Constitutional Court,* *acquired rights are rights which have definitively become part of a person's estate**. Thus, a right has been acquired when the person asserting the right satisfies the requirements established in the law, i.e. when the legal premises are fully met. In line with this notion,* *non-consolidated legal situations, i.e. those where the factual requirements for the acquisition of the right have not been satisfied, do not constitute acquired rights but mere expectations**.*\n\n[RESPONDENT'S TRANSLATION]\n\n*[p. 19]*\n\n*In this regard the Court said:*\n\n*The Court has indicated that acquired rights are violated when a law affects established legal situations that give rise to a right of a substantive nature that has definitively become part of a person's estate. However, if the circumstances indicated have not been met, what exists is a mere expectation that can be modified or extinguished by the legislator**. (Ruling C-584/97, M.P. Eduardo Cifuentes Mu\u00f1oz)*\n\n*With regard to their scope of protection, the Court has said that,* *by express provision of article 58 of the Constitution, acquired rights are intangible, which implies that they cannot be disregarded by subsequent laws, although subsequent laws may modify or even extinguish the rights over which individuals have mere expectations**.*\n\n*As the Court has emphasized, case law and doctrine have clearly differentiated between acquired rights and bare expectations, and they agree that the former are intangible and therefore the legislator, in issuing the new law, cannot harm or disregard them. This is not the case with the so-called 'expectations', because as their name indicates, they are only the probability or hope to one day obtain a right; consequently, they can be modified at the discretion of the legislator. (Ruling C-453 of 2002 Alvaro Tafur G\u00e1lvis) [Page 20]*\n\n*From the abovementioned jurisprudence it may be concluded that neither a law nor the administrative or judicial authorities may modify legal situations which have become consolidated under an earlier law, but they can do so where only mere expectations are concerned.*\"458 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-314 (1 April 2004) (**Exhibit PMR-16**) (USB drive provided at the Hearing).\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal first considers the position as at the date on which Eco Oro's ten titles were integrated into Concession 3452. Whilst Article 6 of the 1988 Mining Code provided that duly executed concession contracts and licences and permits are treated as giving rise to acquired rights, this is not relevant to the Tribunal's analysis. Having voluntarily sought integration of its titles, Eco Oro relinquished all of the rights it held at that point pursuant to the provisions of Article 101 of the 2001 Mining Code. This is the consequence of *acogimiento* under Article 101, as described by Professor Ricaurte in her commentary to the 2001 Mining Code, and as advised by Mr. De Vivero.459\n\nM. Ricaurte, Commentary to the 2001 Mining Code (2017) (**Exhibit R-195**), Art. 101.\n\n421.\n\nThe Tribunal next looks for guidance in Concession 3452. Clause One of Concession 3452 provides that the object of the Concession is \"*to undertake a project of economic exploitation* [...] *in the entire area set out in Clause Two of this agreement.\"*460 The Tribunal notes there is no guarantee that economic exploitation will be achieved. Clause Five of Concession 3452 and Article 85 of the 2001 Mining Code specify that Eco Oro could not proceed to exploitation without having received approval of its PTO and having obtained an environmental licence. There is no provision which addresses the legal status of Eco Oro's right to exploit Concession 3452, nor does the Concession agreement make any distinction between the right to explore and the right to exploit or their respective legal natures. Further, no provision provides whether the requirements to obtain an approved PTO and an environmental licence are suspensive conditions such that the right to exploit is only a bare expectation which does not vest until these conditions are satisfied. It is therefore unclear merely upon a review of the Concession whether Eco Oro's right to exploit is an acquired right but which can only be exercised upon the obtention of the necessary approvals.\n\nConcession Contract 3452 (8 February 2007) (**Exhibit C-16**), Clause 1.\n\n422.\n\nBoth experts accept that Concession 3452 was subject to one legal regime, the 2001 Mining Code. In seeking to construe the relevant provisions of the 2001 Mining Code, it is of assistance to note the following. Firstly, the Congressional Gazette No. 113 (14 April 2000), summary of the Congressional discussions that preceded its issuance, states as follows:\n\n\"*The Concession Contract*\n\n*Definition*\n\n*Given that, as a general rule, the* *only title granted by the State for the technical exploration and exploitation of mining resources* *shall hereafter be the concession contract, it is pertinent to define it and highlight its typical elements. This is not a mere theoretical intellectual exercise, but rather it constitutes a highly useful tool for its correct interpretation and for the appropriate resolution of conflicts and discrepancies arising out of their execution.*\n\n*1. The definition of concession put forth in Article 49 of the Bill covers both a formal and a teleological approach. As regards the former, it confirms that a* *concession is a true contractual transaction,* *meaning that it is a meeting of the minds between the State and a private party. Perhaps on its face this might look like an unimportant or redundant assertion, but its purpose is nothing other than to legally* *rule out certain lines of thinking which to this day persist, according to which concessions of this kind are not true contracts but mere permits or authorizations unilaterally issued or granted by the State for exploiting the State's own resources**.*\n\n*The definition is also adopted with the criterion of identifying the* *object of the contract,* *which is to* *carry out the studies, mechanisms and works that have an exclusive purpose: to exploit the soil or the mining subsoil at the contractor's own expense and risk**. Moreover, this latter aspect excludes, as an element of the contract, the performance of the contract in full or in part through state investments.*\" 461 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nCongressional Gazette No. 113 (14 April 2000) (**Exhibit PMR-10**).\n\n423.\n\nSecondly, MinMinas' explanatory statement in April 2000 to the Colombian Congress for the enactment of the 2001 Mining Code, *inter alia,* states that: \"[...] *the Bill's aim is for the new Mining Code to become a useful and efficient tool for the* [mining] *industry's development and, as such, its greatest contribution is to offer, by means of categorical and express mandates, a clear and firm legal stability to the private parties that participate in the exploration* *and exploitation* *of mining resources.*\"462 [Tribunal's emphasis]. In June 2000, the Congressional Gazette also records that Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code \"*enshrined a principle that is essential for the legal stability required by the concessionaire, in addition to vesting the concessionaire with the right to be subjected only to favourable changes in legislation.*\"463 Finally, in May 2001, the Colombian Congressional records as contained in the Report to the House of Representatives note that the 2001 Mining Code \"*enshrines the principle of the stable contractual legal framework [Normatividad], which guarantees that throughout the contract's performance, and throughout any extension thereof, the applicable legal rules shall be those which were in force at the time the contact was perfected.\"*464\n\nStatement of Reasons for Law 685 (Congressional Gazette No. 113) (14 April 2000) (**Exhibit PMR-10 / PMR- 12**).\n\nCongressional Gazette No. 200 (12 June 2000) (**Exhibit PMR-13**), p. 7.\n\nSpeech (Congressional Gazette No. 238) (22 May 2001) (**Exhibit PMR-14**), p. 7.\n\n424.\n\nTurning to the 2001 Mining Code, several Articles refer to a concession agreement as providing the exclusive right to exploit as well as explore (Articles 15, 45 and 58 by way of example) however those articles refer to the right to exploit as being an exclusive right; there is no express provision in the 2001 Mining Code identifying which, if any, of the rights granted by a concession agreement are acquired rights. Article 58 details what rights are granted under the Concession:\n\n*\"ARTICLE 58. RIGHTS UNDER THE CONCESSION.*\n\n*The concession contract shall grant the concessionaire the exclusive power to perform, within the area granted, any such studies and works as may be necessary to establish the existence of the minerals that are the subject-matter of the contract,* *and to exploit them* *in accordance with the principles, rules and criteria inherent in the mining engineering and geology accepted techniques. The concessionaire shall also be entitled to install and perform, within and outside such area, the equipment, services and works required to efficiently exercise the easements referred to herein.*\"465 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nLaw No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Art. 58.\n\n425.\n\nEco Oro further cites Article 46 which provides:\n\n*\"ARTICLE 46. APPLICABLE LAW*\n\n*The mining laws in force at the time that the concession contract is perfected will be applicable throughout the term of its execution and extensions. If said laws are modified or added to at a later date, these laws will apply to the concessionaire only insofar as they broaden, confirm or improve its rights with the exception of those regulations that contemplate the modification of the anticipated economic revenues to the State or Territorial Entities.\"* 466\n\nLaw No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Art. 46.\n\n426.\n\nAgain, this Article does not expressly provide that the right to exploit is an acquired right. However, it is of note that the 2001 Mining Code does not provide that the right to explore is an acquired right. The terminology used to describe the right to explore is that it is an \"exclusive power\" and yet the Parties agree that the right to explore is an acquired right. The terminology with respect to the right to exploit is the same as that with respect to the right to explore, namely that it is an \"exclusive power.\" Accordingly, the Tribunal does not find that there is any relevance to the fact that the 2001 Mining Code does not provide that the right to exploit is an acquired right. It appears that at no time in the discussions leading to the issuance of the 2001 Mining Code was any distinction drawn between the rights to explore and to exploit, both being spoken of as rights obtained under a concession agreement.\n\n427.\n\nThe relevant authorities would also appear to have been acting under the belief that the right to exploit was an acquired right which was therefore protected by Article 58 of the Constitution. For example, in September 2011, MinMinas (Ms. D\u00edaz Lopez) wrote to INGEOMINAS (Mr. Montes) stating:\n\n*\"Finally, the position of the control organs in relation to the protection of natural resources is clear to this Office. Thus, the precautionary principle constitutes one of the fundamental tenets of Colombian environmental policy. How ever,* *such principle cannot disregard acquired rights, in accordance with Article 58 of the Political Constitution.**\"* 467 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nLetter from Ministry of Mines (Ms. D\u00edaz Lopez) to INGEOMINAS (Mr. Montes) (27 September 2011) (**Exhibit C-330**).\n\n428.\n\nIn providing this opinion, MinMinas noted that it was not commenting upon a specific case but giving a general opinion. In addition to raising serious doubts as to the legality of Resolution 937 of 2011, it considered the concept of acquired rights. However, in doing so, it did not address whether the rights it identified as acquired rights were merely exploration rights or exploration and exploitation rights. Had MinMinas been of the belief that exploitation rights were not acquired rights, it seems unlikely that it would have addressed the application of the precautionary principle on acquired rights. It has not been suggested that exploration rights should be excluded to protect the p\u00e1ramo.\n\n429.\n\nIn May 2012, MinMinas issued Opinion 2012026198 in response to a question raised by the Attorney General's Office regarding Mining Concession Contracts stating: *\"However, this is not the case with the concession contracts that have been duly granted, which at the time of execution give rise to acquired rights which become part of the concessionaire's patrimony subject to protection by the law.*\"468 Whilst no explanation is given as to the nature of the rights that are referred to as being acquired, again the Tribunal does not understand there to have been any distinction drawn between exploration and exploitation rights.\n\nMinistry of Mines and Energy, Opinion 2012026198 in response to a question raised by the Attorney General's Office regarding Mining Concession Contracts (14 May 2012) (**Exhibit PMR-26**).\n\n430.\n\nIn a memorandum issued in December 2013, the ANM stated:\n\n\"[Page 20]\n\n*It is then undeniable that the notion of acquired rights and, naturally, consolidated situations are directly related to the application of the Law in time, as in no event may a subsequent Law produce retroactive effects intended, as suggested in this case, to deny a legal situation created and consolidated under an earlier Law.*\n\n[...]\n\n[Page 23]\n\n*It is therefore clear that Mining Concession Contract No. 141, having been executed in strict observance of the law in force at the time, which, it is worth noting again, did not contain any prohibition on entering into a contract in the area that is the object of the present Contract, granted EXPLOTACIONES CARBONIFERAS YERBABUENA LTDA* *a true right to exploit a coal deposit in the municipality of Zipaquir\u00e1, which constitutes an acquired right;* *that is to say, it consolidated a subjective legal right that must be respected despite the legislative changes that were to eventuate.*\n\n[...]\n\n[Page 24]\n\n*It is particularly important to draw the attention of the Honorable Court to the fact that in the present matter,* *when Contract No. 141 was executed, it generated for the contracting parties a duly consolidated legal right and not a mere expectation, for which reason a subsequent provision cannot act as an impediment such that the right is ignored. This is the understanding of the Constitutional Court in Decision C-478 of 1998* [...]*.*\n\n[...]\n\n[Page 26]\n\n[...]\n\n*In accordance with the above considerations, it is relevant to highlight what the Ministry of Mines and Energy has said, precisely regarding the prevalence of acquired rights when the declaration of forest protection reserve areas occurs after the granting of a mining title. Accordingly, the Ministry expressed in a report filed under number 2012026647 of 16 May 2012, as follows:* [page 27]\n\n*\"... Thus,* *where an area is declared to be a forest protection reserve, in which it is not possible to carry out mining activities in accordance with article 34 of Law 685 of 2001, mining titles granted prior to the declaration of the area must in any case be respected, as those titles give rise to acquired rights on the part of the mining titleholders that cannot be ignored under subsequent* *laws.*[...].\"469\n\nNational Mining Agency Memorandum No. 2013-0725 (18 December 2013) (**Exhibit PMR-30**) (USB drive provided at the Hearing).\n\n431.\n\nAgain, in their letter to MinAmbiente, of 24 February 2014, the Mayors of Soto Norte and other Municipalities refer to the acquired rights of mining titleholders in circumstances in which the Tribunal understands the reference to be to exploitation as well as to exploration.470\n\nLetter from Mayors of Soto Norte *et al.* to Ministry of Environment (Minister Sarmiento) and CDMB (Mr. Anaya M\u00e9ndez) (24 February 2014) (**Exhibit C-201**).\n\n432.\n\nColombia supports its contention that the right to exploit is not an acquired right by reference to Advisory Opinion 2233. However, the *Consejo de Estado* does not state that a right to exploit is not an acquired right. The opinion considers the question of payment of compensation where a mining exclusion zone is declared over a concession area. The *Consejo de Estado* first considers the tensions between, on the one hand, the general interest in protecting the environment and, on the other hand, the private interest of those in possession of mining concessions which it held can be seen as \"*a declaration of principle that* [the mining] *activity is one of general interest and is encouraged by the government itself, which is further supported by various sections of the Mining Code aimed at providing legal certainty and assurance to those conducting this activity in a legal manner that is compatible with the environment*.\"471\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135 redline**), para. 2.2.1.1.\n\n433.\n\nThe *Consejo de Estado* then details the rights granted by the mining concession, stating:\n\n*\"The rights granted by the mining concession are indicated in two additional statutes from the Mining Code: (i) Article 15 indicates that the concession contract does not grant ownership over the minerals on site, but rather grants the right to 'establish, exclusively and temporarily within the concession area, the existence of minerals in an exploitable quantity and quality, and to appropriate them by extracting or capturing them'; and (ii) Article 45, whereby* *the concession contract grants to the concession holder exclusive authority* *to conduct within the concession area the studies, works and projects necessary to establish the existence of the minerals to which the contract refers* *and to exploit those minerals, [...] at the risk and expense of the concession-holder,* *and the closing or removal of the corresponding works and sites.'*\n\n*In this way* *the mining concession grants to its holder the right to explore and exploit the assigned areas* *and also to shut down and close the respective activities, all in strict adherence [...] to environmental regulations.*\n\n*It is thus clear that those who have obtained from the government a mining concession, which is understood to have been granted for lands for which such activity is permitted (the code itself, in Article 36, excludes outright those areas for which mining is not permitted), are entitled to the expectation that their lawful activity will be respected and will be allowed to carry on during the term of the contract, which is 30 years (Article 70). Without a doubt, there can be medium- and long-term endeavors and investments should be recognized.*\"472 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**), para. 2.2.1.2.\n\n434.\n\nThe *Consejo de Estado* concludes that the private right of the investor must yield to the general interest in preserving the environment such that holders of concessions in areas where a mining exclusion zone is subsequently declared do not have a right to mine in that mining exclusion zone. However, whilst the *Consejo de Estado* does not expressly state that the right to exploit is, or is not, an acquired right (noting only that the concession agreement gives an exclusive authority to exploit), it continues by stating that \"*the government must review on a case-by-case basis the need to reach agreements for economic compensation, in order to avoid legal claims*\", further noting that there would be no breach of any bilateral treaty agreement unless the State *\"refuse[d] to provide the necessary compensation for the specific situations affected by the new law*.\"473\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**), para. 2.2.1.4(c).\n\n435.\n\nIn understanding the meaning of this opinion, the Tribunal notes that Article 58 of the Constitution provides that the State may carry out expropriation \"*for reasons of public utility or social interest* [...] *subject to a judicial decision* *and prior compensation**.*\"474 It would not have been necessary for the *Consejo de Estado* to refer to a need for compensation upon taking away a right to exploit if such right were merely a bare expectation that did not vest until the requisite suspensive conditions had been complied with. There would only be the need to undertake a case-by-case review to determine whether compensation were payable if the right to exploit were an acquired right, the loss of which would, *prima facie,* give rise to a right to compensation; the purpose of the review being to determine the value of the exploitation right lost in the light of the surrounding circumstances, no doubt including the progression and current status of the exploration activities undertaken at that time the zone was declared.\n\nPolitical Constitution of Colombia (1991) (**Exhibit C-65**) [Tribunal's emphasis].\n\n436.\n\nEco Oro also cites in support of its submissions the *Consejo de Estado* judgements dated 3 February 2010 (which it says holds that the concession contract grants economic rights which are opposable to third parties and assignable in accordance with the law475), 14 May 2012476 and 6 July 2017.477 The 2017 decision478 states at paragraph 23 that:\n\n*\"23. [the concession agreement] is evident that the mining title granted to the private respondent was previous to the declaration and delimitation of the special reserve area that overlapped with the concession,* *which is why it had an acquired right that could not be ignored**. In fact, article 46 of [the 2001 Mining Code], which entails the National Government's prerogative to declare these type of areas of special interest, clearly establishes that these cannot ignore titles that predate their establishment [...].*\n\n[...]\n\n*24. it must be noted that the claimant has insisted on the fact that the necessary activities for the delimitation of the reserve area began before the execution and registry of the title in favor of Mr Rendle. However it must not be overlooked that the final delimitation, for reasons of publicity to those interested in the mining titles of the area, only becomes binding with the issuance of the act that declares and delimits the special public interest area.*\n\n*25. Moreover, this Chamber does not ignore that the claimant begun the proceedings to declare the nullity of the concession contract in light of the undeniable breach of the public interest. But even though it is clear that lawmakers wanted to restrict third parties' mining and exploration and exploitation expectations in reserve areas in order to protect the public interest,* *it is also evident that lawmakers wanted to prevent the public interest from impinging upon the acquired rights of private parties holding titles that predate the establishment of the area,* *which is precisely what has happened in the present case.\"* [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Judgment No. 33187 (3 February 2010) (**Exhibit PMR-21**).\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Judgment No. 57199 (24 January 2019) (**Exhibit PMR-27**).\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Judgment No. 38338 (6 July 2017) (**Exhibit PMR-37**).\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Judgment No. 38338 (6 July 2017) (**Exhibit PMR-37**).\n\n437.\n\nTurning to the *Consejo de Estado* Judgment No. 52038,479 it was held that:\n\n\"*4.5.

Regarding legislation, that protection is reflected in the general rule that the contract is subject to those legal provisions that were in force at the time of its conclusion, which stands as an* *unobjectionable contractual and constitutional guarantee of acquired rights since, considering the decisions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, acquired rights are 'rights that have been incorporated into the estate of a person**.'*\n\n*4.7. Therefore, as to the practical aspect,* *the protection afforded by the law is reflected in instruments such as the mining protection action provided for in Articles 307 et seq.* [480] *of the Mining Code,* *which affords onsite protection for exploration* *or exploitation* *works carried out by the mining title holder against any statements that disrupt, alter or affect the performance of the mining activities.* *This instrument is intended to guarantee the full enjoyment and exercise of the rights that the title holder has acquired by executing the concession contract**.\"* [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Judgment No. 52038 (29 January 2018) (**Exhibit PMR-38**) (USB drive provided at the Hearing).\n\nThere is no translation into English of these provisions.

The fact the exploitation right may be difficult to value, or indeed may be valueless in circumstances where it has almost no chance of getting an environmental licence, cannot and does not of itself mean it is not an acquired right.\n\n440.\n\nTherefore, as at the date of entry into force of the FTA, the Tribunal finds that Eco Oro had acquired rights to explore in the totality of the area of Concession 3452 (Article 58 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clause 4 of the Concession 3452). The majority of the Tribunal finds that Eco Oro had acquired rights to exploit in the totality of the area of Concession 3452 (Article 58 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clauses 1 and 4 of Concession 3452), the exercise of such rights being subject to PTO approval and obtaining an environmental license; and extend the concession at the end of its term (Article 77 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clause 4 of Concession 3452).\n\n**C.** **W****hether there was a mining ban over any part of** **C****oncession** **3452** **in existence** **as at the date the** **FTA** **entered into force**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nHaving determined the nature of Eco Oro's covered investments at the time the FTA entered into force, the Tribunal now turns to consider whether there was a mining ban in force when the FTA came into existence.\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nArticles 34 and 36 of the 2001 Mining Code do not permit Colombia to ban mining in p\u00e1ramo areas with immediate effect on Concession 3452, without an express declaration that the concession falls within that area and upon notification of such restriction. Constitutional Court Judgement 339 of 2002 does not have the effect contended for by Colombia; it merely provides that the list of areas in Article 34 where exclusion zones can be established is not exhaustive and it just eliminates the phrase in Article 36 *\"pursuant to the prior articles.\"*\n\n443.\n\nArticle 34 provides that exclusion zones can only take effect once the three stated requirements in the article have been complied with, namely: *(i)* the mining exclusion is expressly provided for by law or regulation; *(ii)* the exclusion zone has been geographically delimited on the basis of technical, environmental, social and economic studies demonstrating the incompatibility of the area with mining activities; and *(iii)* the exclusion zone has been delimited with the collaboration of the mining authority. An exclusion cannot be lawful if not undertaken in accordance with these requirements.\n\n444.\n\nArticle 36 addresses the effect of an exclusion that has come into force either pursuant to Article 34 or from the application of another provision of the 2001 Mining Code. It is clear from the wording of Article 34 (and construing it in the context of Articles 31 - 35) that it can only have an effect on a subsequently executed concession contract - an exclusion can only be expressly mentioned in a concession if such concession is already in existence at the time the concession is executed but the exclusion need not be *\"expressly mentioned\"* as the concessionaire would be aware of it. The purpose of specifying that such restriction need not be mentioned is that it may well be burdensome and impractical to expressly carve out of each mining title areas corresponding, for example, to roads, power lines and rural dwellings; indeed the mining authority may not even be aware of any excluded or restricted areas at the time the title is granted. 482 Therefore, the provision must be referring to pre-existing restrictions and exclusions. Article 36's application to subsequent concessions is also clear from the fact that the *\"renunciation of the applicant\"* to the exclusion zone is not required - there is no purpose in an applicant renunciating the exclusion zone because it is excluded as of right. Further, the provision *\"if in fact said zones* [...] *were to be occupied\"* clearly refers to the situation where an exclusion exists, the concession is executed and yet the concessionaire continues to carry out mining activities in such area. In this situation, the activities would be illegal and the concessionaire would be forced to withdraw without compensation.\n\nRicaurte Opinion, para. 79.\n\n445.\n\nEstablishing an exclusion zone after execution of a concession would breach the provisions of Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code, which enshrines the principle of non-retroactivity of laws to acquired rights, a provision which stabilises mining laws. The effect of Article 46 was confirmed by the Constitutional Court as follows: \"[...] *In fact, article 46 of law 685 of 2001, Mining Code, which entails the National Government prerogative to declare these type of areas of special interest, clearly establishes that these* [areas] *cannot ignore titles that predate their establishment* [...].\"483 This principle of non-retroactivity of laws and the respect for acquired rights set out in Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code is also enshrined in Article 58 of the Political Constitution.484\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Judgment No. 38338 (6 July 2017) (**Exhibit PMR-37**).\n\nPolitical Constitution of Colombia (1991) (**Exhibit C-65**).\n\n446.\n\nThe same principle was confirmed by Advisory Opinion 22 3 3.485 Thus, a mining exclusion zone delimited subsequent to the execution of a concession will apply to the concession *(i)* if enacted for reasons of public interest; and *(ii)* upon the payment of compensation.486 Pursuant to Article 90 of the Constitution, this compensation must include compensation for the actual damages suffered (*damnun emergens*), certain future losses (*lucrum cessans*) and the loss of a chance (uncertain future losses).487\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**).\n\nRicaurte Opinion, para. 85.\n\nTr. Day 4 (Professor Ricaurte), 894-896 and (Mr. Vivero Arciniegas), 971-976.\n\n447.\n\nLaws 1382 and 1450 also did not establish an effective mining ban in the p\u00e1ramos. Paragraph 1 of Law 1382 contained a grandfathering regime as follows:\n\n*\"If on the effective date of this law, any construction and assembly or exploitation activities are being undertaken subject to a mining title and an environmental licence or their equivalent in areas which were not previously excluded, such activities shall be allowed until their expiration, but no extensions shall be granted with regard to such titles.*\"488\n\nLaw No. 1382 (9 February 2010) (**Exhibit C-18**).\n\n448.\n\nLaw 1382 was struck down by the Constitutional Court in May 2011 as unconstitutional having been enacted in the absence of community consultations. Whilst Advisory Opinion 2233 stated that the first time p\u00e1ramo exclusion zones were established was by Law 13 82,489 this did not mean that an immediately effective mining ban had been established in the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo as a result of Law 1382. Article 3 required the mining exclusion zone to be delineated on the basis of technical, social and environmental studies and on the basis of cartographic information to be provided by the IAvH.490 Thus, the mining ban could not become effective until the p\u00e1ramos had been delineated in accordance with these requirements. The fact no mining ban had immediately become effective is demonstrated by the actions of Colombia in adopting Decree 2820,491 Article 10 of which anticipated mining in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Further, Article 1 of INGEOMINAS Resolution 267 of 15 December 2010 extended the exploration phase of the entirety of the area of Concession 3452 for two years.\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**), p. 8.\n\nLaw No. 1382 (9 February 2010) (**Exhibit C-18**). The Tribunal notes that the actual text states \"*provided*\", not \"to be provided.\"\n\nDecree No. 2820 (5 August 2010) (**Exhibit C-129**).\n\n449.\n\nThe 2007 Atlas did not entail a mining ban in the p\u00e1ramos. It had no normative content, was just an academic exercise and the purpose was *\"to compile all information available at the time about the p\u00e1ramos and identify the actions taken to protect them.\"* Indeed, the methodology used was inadequate for the purposes of validly determining a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem.492\n\nFirst Baptiste Statement, paras. 23 and 43. The Tribunal notes Ms. Baptiste's statement provided that \"[o]*ne of the main challenges in determining the reference area was to develop a methodology to identify the transition zone between forest and the p\u00e1ramo*.\"\n\n450.\n\nWhilst the effects of the striking down of Law 1382 were deferred for two years, Law 1450 was enacted in June 2011, which required delimitation based on technical, social, environmental and economic criteria. Again, no mining ban could become effective until delimitation in compliance with these requirements had been undertaken. Therefore, Laws 1382 and 1450 did not ban mining in the areas of the Concession overlapping the 2007 Atlas, Eco Oro continued mining activities in those areas after this time and Colombia designated the Project a PIN, demonstrating that mining in the concession area had not been excluded.\n\n451.\n\nResolution 937 also did not create a permanent mining ban; it merely adopted the 2007 Atlas as a reference for the identification and delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems (Article 1). This was explained in a letter from MinMinas to INGEOMINAS on 27 September 2011: *\"Currently, the requirements for declaring p\u00e1ramo ecosystems in the country, as set out by current norms, are not met. Although the transitory provision of [Law 1450] orders that the cartography of* [the 2007 Atlas] *be used as a reference, at no point does it determine that the zones excluded from mining are established by such cartography.\"*493 In any event, this Resolution failed to meet the requirements of Laws 1382 and 1450 in that it wasn't based on technical, social, environmental and economic studies.494 It is also of note that this Resolution was only issued one week before Eco Oro's application for an environmental licence for its open-pit mine was denied by the environmental authorities and yet such denial was not on the basis of Resolution 937 or the 2007 Atlas, but rather on detailed technical 495 reasons.\n\nLetter from Ministry of Mines (Ms. D\u00edaz Lopez) to INGEOMINAS (Mr. Montes) (27 September 2011) (**Exhibit C-330**), p. 2.\n\nLetter from Ministry of Mines (Ms. D\u00edaz Lopez) to INGEOMINAS (Mr. Montes) (27 September 2011) (**Exhibit C-330**), p. 11.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 143; Ministry of Environment, Resolution No. 1015 (31 May 2011) (**Exhibit R-16 / R-71**).\n\n452.\n\nThe fact there was no mining ban is further confirmed by:\n\na. ANLA's Resolution 35 of 31 October 2011, which stated that \"[...] *the Ministry has not declared an exclusion zone for mining in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem* [...]\" and that the IAvH cartographic information had not been used to identify and quantify the area of the different bioclimatic levels within the area of interest.496\n\nb. Whilst Resolution VSC 2 only granted Eco Oro an extension over non-overlapping areas of Concession 3452, this was overturned by Resolution VSC 4 which stated that Article 202 of Law 1450 *\"had not been developed\"* so that the p\u00e1ramo could not be delimited *\"with absolute certainty\"* and that, therefore, the legal status of the overlapping area of Concession 3452 was *\"uncertain\"* as \"*it cannot be said with complete certainty, due to the absence of technical parameters, that it is located within the p\u00e1ramo.\"* As a result, the exploration phase for the entirety of Concession 3452 was extended for a further two years, albeit it was noted that no exploratory activities could be carried out in the p\u00e1ramo area pursuant to Article 202 of Law 1450 *\"until the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development or the entity acting in its capacity issues the final delimitation to a scale of 1:25,000*.\"497\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 35 (31 October 2011) (**Exhibit C-290**), p. 5.\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution VSC-4 (12 September 2012) (**Exhibit C-25**).\n\n***(b) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n453.\n\nArticle 34 of the 2001 Mining Code empowers MinAmbiente to exclude areas from mining activities, including p\u00e1ramo areas as confirmed by Constitutional Court Judgement 339 of 2002. P\u00e1ramos were defined in Resolution 769 of 2002 to include low high Andean forests.498 This exclusion zone could be achieved either through the creation of a national park or through the delimitation of a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and the fact such zone was declared over all or part of an area where a concession had been granted is irrelevant. This should have been well understood by Eco Oro when it executed Concession 3452 and was a risk that Eco Oro voluntarily assumed.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 769 (5 August 2002) (**Exhibit C-9**).\n\n454.\n\nArticle 36 confirms that where a restriction on mining arises, it is immediately applicable, without the need for any express declaration, such that mining is prohibited *de jure* in those areas designated as a mining exclusion zone and is applicable to any existing concession, not just future concessions. Had it been intended that it was only to apply to future concessions this would have been explicitly provided for in Article 36. This was the case with Article 9 of the 1988 Mining Code which expressly provided that any exclusion zone declared would not affect mining titles which had already been granted. This construction is also clear from the fact that Article 36 provides that it is unnecessary for a concessionaire to waive any of its rights in order for the exclusion zone to take effect by operation of law. Eco Oro's construction makes no sense - it would be absurd to grant a mining concession over an area where a mining exclusion zone had been established. Colombia's construction is also supported by the 2002 Judgement C-339 of the Constitutional Court.499 Colombia does not say that at the time Concession 3452 was executed, the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo had been designated and excluded. For it to succeed, Colombia does not need to show that there was an outright ban, Colombia was entitled to wait to see the nature of the mining proposed by Eco Oro before deciding whether or to introduce a mining ban.500\n\nTr. Day 1 (Mr. Mantilla-Serrano), 274-276.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Mr. Mantilla-Serrano), 268.\n\n455.\n\nArticle 46 of the 2001 Mining Code is not a stabilisation clause, it merely enshrines the basic general principle of non-retroactivity of the law and confirms that concession contracts are governed by the legislative framework in existence at the time the concession contract was entered into. Further, it makes no reference to environmental protection legislation, merely to mining laws and its lack of applicability to environmental protection legislation was confirmed by Advisory Opinion 2233 specifically referring to the protection of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems.501 Indeed, Article 196 of the 2001 Mining Code specifies that all environmental provisions and regulations apply immediately to all mining activities and the *travaux* to the 2001 Mining Code note that Article 46 does not stabilise environmental laws, stating that \"[...] *there can be rules following the concession contract, that must necessarily be applied to the concessionaire, e.g. technical and environmental laws and regulations* [...].\"502 Indeed, these *travaux* have been cited with approval by Professor Ricaurte.\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**).\n\nRepublic of Colombia, Draft Bill No. 269 for Senate debate (14 April 2000) (**Exhibit R-49**), p. 25.\n\n456.\n\nMinAmbiente's exercise of a right expressly reserved under the 2001 Mining Code does not constitute a retroactive change of the law but is instead the application of an existing law which Eco Oro accepted on executing Concession 3452.\n\n457.\n\nLaw 1382 together with the MinAmbiente's Resolution 937 of May 2011 banned mining in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems as delimited in the 2007 Atlas.\n\n458.\n\nAlthough Law 1382 was struck down, the effect was suspended for two years such that the ban continued uninterrupted as per the following:\n\na. MinAmbiente Resolution 937 of May 2011;\n\nb. Law 1450 (which confirmed its immediate application);\n\nc. Law 1753 of 2015; and\n\nd. Law 1930 of 2018.\n\n459.\n\nThe fact the ban had been operative since 9 February 2010 was confirmed by Advisory Opinion 2233 which provided that, *\"with respect to mining activities, the ban on undertaking them in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems has been operative in Colombia since February 9 2010.*\"503\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**).\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n460.\n\nThe 2001 Mining Code came into being against the backdrop of an increasing awareness of the need to protect the environment and of the importance and fragility of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. This can be seen from the General Environmental Law, which was published on 22 December 1993, the Biodiversity Convention having entered into force in Colombia on 29 January 1996, the Ramsar Convention entering into force on 18 October 1998, and Colombia's adoption of its (green) Constitution. Article 1.1 of the General Environmental Law is of particular relevance, referring to the relevance of the Rio Principles, Principle 15 of which contained the precautionary principle (namely that *\"where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation\";* also know as *in dubio pro ambiente*) and which was enshrined into Colombian Law by Article 1.6 of the said General Environmental Law.504 In addition, Article 1.4 provides that \"*the p\u00e1ramo and sub p\u00e1ramo areas, water springs and aquifer recharge zones shall be the subject of special protection.\"*\n\nThe *Consejo de Estado* in its Advisory Opinion, quoting Constitutional Court judgments C-703 of 2010 and C-988 of 2004, notes with regard to the precautionary principle that \"*although it is part of the positive order, with legal rank, in any case 'it has been constitutionalized, since it is derived from the internationalization of ecological relations (Article 266 of the Constitution) and from the duties of protection and prevention contained in articles 78, 79 and 80 of the Charter' in addition to the fact that it derives from the duty imposed on the authorities 'to avoid damages and risks to life, health and the environment'*\". See *Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**).\n\n461.\n\nBefore the 2001 Mining Code came into force, it is common ground that Permit 3452 was not in a prohibited area.\n\n462.\n\nThe key provisions of the 2001 Mining Code with respect to Colombia's right to impose a mining ban and the manner in which it is to be undertaken are Articles 34, 36 and 46.\n\n***(a) Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n463.\n\nArticles 34 and 36 are not easy to construe. Article 34 is titled *\"Areas that may be excluded from mining.\"* At the very least, this puts a potential investor on notice that it was in the mind of the legislator that certain mining activities could be banned in certain areas. The text might be construed to include areas in which mining has been excluded as well as those in which it may be excluded, i.e., a future delimitation. However, the phraseology is contradictory in the body of the article. The text first refers to areas where mining exploration and exploitation may not be carried out in areas \"declared and delimited\" (which could be construed as referring to the fact that areas are already excluded by operation of Article 34) rather than areas \"*to be* *declared and delimited\"* This suggests the scope of the Article relates to areas that have been delimited by virtue of this Article. However, the text then provides that *\"exclusion zones will be those constituted in accordance with the legal provisions in force, such as areas that comprise the system of natural national parks, regional natural parks and forest reserve areas*\"; the wording that the exclusion zones \"will be\" not \"are\" those constituted in accordance with the legal provisions in force, and that the areas \"should be\" rather than \"are\" delimited by the environmental authority, indicates that this is providing for a future delimitation rather to an immediate existing ban. The inclusion of the phrase \"such as\" indicates this was not an exhaustive list and therefore, as stated in Judgement 339, p\u00e1ramo ecosystems may also be declared mining exclusion zones pursuant to Article 34.\n\n464.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also notes that Law 1382 amended Article 34 by adding the following underlined words that the exclusion zones will be \"*those that have been constituted or will be established in accordance with the legal provisions in force* [...].\"505 Law 1382 was struck down by Constitutional Court judgement C-366 of 2011 such that the underlined words are not applicable. This supports the Tribunal's construction that Article 34 can only apply to future areas to be designated as mining exclusion zones.\n\nLaw No. 1382 (9 February 2010) (**Exhibit C-18**) (USB drive provided at the Hearing).\n\n465.\n\nArticle 34 details the process by which mining exclusion areas are to be declared and delimited, namely where *(i)* such declaration and delimitation is undertaken in accordance with the legal framework currently in force for the protection and development of renewable natural resources or the environment; *(ii)* the delimited areas should be geographically delimited by the environmental authority on the basis of \"*technical, social and environmental studies*\" with the collaboration of the mining authority; and *(iii)* the act declaring a mining exclusion area must be expressly based on studies establishing the incompatibility of or need to restrict mining activities. Having regard to the language of Article 34 in its entirety, the Tribunal construes it such that it empowers MinAmbiente to publish, in the future, a mining exclusion zone but requires MinAmbiente to follow the specified process in order to achieve this, i.e., a future delimitation. The Tribunal does not understand this construction to be disputed by Colombia.506\n\nTr. Day 1 (Mr. Mantilla-Serrano), 266:6-267:6.\n\n***(b) Article 36 of the 2001 Mining Code***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n466.\n\nArticle 36 provides that where mining activities are prohibited, such areas are *\"deemed excluded or restricted by operation of law* [...] [and] *this exclusion or restriction need not be declared by any authority whatsoever or be expressly stated in acts or stated in acts and agreements* [...].\" The question is whether, when an area is declared as a mining exclusion zone, does it only apply to future concessions or also to concessions that were already in existence at the time the exclusion zone is declared.\n\n467.\n\nIn construing Article 36, the Tribunal is mindful that, whilst Colombian law contains a general principle of non-retroactivity, it also allows a public purpose law to have retrospective effect provided that it is carried out with strict adherence to the principle of legality, with due process and with appropriate compensation where due. This retrospective effect is outlined in Advisory Opinion 2233 in which the *Consejo de Estado* explains (albeit with respect to the legal effect of Section 202 of Law 1450):\n\n\"*3. Retroactivity and retrospectivity. Immediate general effect of public policy rules and their application in environmental matters*\n\n*The Chamber has identified four general rules for this type of situations that relate to the application of law over time:*\n\n*'1. All laws are applied with respect to the future as of their effective date, on the understanding that they cannot disregard acquired rights or consolidated situations and that they produce immediate effects on mere expectations and ongoing situations.*\n\n*2. Constitutionally, there are two explicit limits to the effects of new laws that must be respected by the legislature: the existence of rights acquired with just title in Article 58 of the Constitution [...].* *As an exception that confirms the rule, Article 58 allows for the sacrifice of rights acquired under just title 'for reasons of public utility or social interest' subject to compensation**.'*\n\n[...]\n\n*A distinction is then made between retroactivity or application of new laws to situations consolidated (terminated) under a previous rule - which by constitutional principle is not permitted (Article 58 of the Constitution) - and retrospectivity or application of the new law to situations in progress at the time of its entry into force.*\n\n[...]\n\n*Based on the foregoing, it is possible to understand that the application of the new law to ongoing situations does not necessarily conflict with Section 58 of the Constitution:* [...]\n\n[...]\n\n*Therefore, in relation to new laws, it is possible to speak of an application that is 'general, immediate and future-orientated, but with retrospectivity', that is, with effects on the legal situations in progress at the time of its entry into force. In this way, unlike situations consolidated or defined under a previous law - over which a general principle of non-retroactivity applies -it can be accepted that the new law governs not only the legal situations arising from its entry into force, but also the present and future legal effects of those which arose under a previous law (retrospectivity).*\n\n*This retrospective effect of the law is particularly important in relation to rules issued on the grounds of morality, public health or utility, in respect of which Act 153 of 1887 expressly provides for their immediate application, even when they restrict rights protected in the previous law.* [...]\n\n[...]\n\n*What has just been stated in relation to the immediate application of the rules of public or social order is even more relevant in environmental matters, whose provisions have this status by law.*\n\n[...]\n\n*It can then be concluded for the analyzed case that Section 202 of Law 1450 of 2011, being an environmental rule of public order and social interest nature, has immediate general effect and can be applied with retrospectivity, unless there is a constitutional reason of greater weight that prevents this or demands its moderation, as will be seen later*.\"507 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**).\n\n468.\n\nThe *Consejo de Estado* further notes that *\"since the sacrifice of individual and established situations does not constitute the general rule of State action and entails a clear afflictive effect on citizens, their legal position is surrounded by a series of minimum guarantees such as (i) strict adherence to the principle of legality (compliance with constitutional requirements); (ii) observance of due process and (iii) payment of compensation to prevent the Administration's decision from becoming a 'confiscatory act, expressly prohibited by Article 34 of the Constitution.'* [...] *Therefore, the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations determines that normative changes are not made 'arbitrarily and suddenly without any consideration for the stability of the legal frameworks that govern the action of persons and to the detriment of the predictability of the consequences to individuals of adjusting their behavior to these rules.*'\"\n\n469.\n\nThe fact that certain provisions of the 2001 Mining Code may also be applied or relied upon to have retrospective effect is confirmed by Article 196 of the 2001 Mining Code. This Article states \"[t]*he legal provisions and regulations of an environmental nature\"* have a general and immediate application and Article 197 which refers to \"*environmental requirements and conditions\"*508 which, whether or not \"set forth\" (as translated by Colombia) or \"contemplated by\" (as translated by Eco Oro), must be complied with or met before the commencement and execution of mining works, in order to be permitted to exercise rights under the concession contract. These provisions require compliance with environmental regulations not necessarily contemplated at the time the 2001 Mining Code was enacted, but which are subsequently enacted. This makes clear that an investor who proceeded on the basis of the 2001 Mining Code, had clear notice that future environmental laws or regulations could be applied to have retroactive effect. This may be relevant to determining the nature and reasonableness of Eco Oro's expectations.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Parties have provided alternative translations of this Article but both refer to *\"requirements and conditions*\" being those that are environmental or of an environmental nature. Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**).\n\n470.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that, provided due process is followed with respect to the declaration of the mining exclusion zone, following the *Consejo de Estado'*s analysis with respect to the retrospective effect of Article 202 of Law 1450, Article 36 may be applied in a manner that has or allows for retrospective effect, subject to compensation pursuant to Article 58 of the Constitution (the Tribunal considers below whether due process was indeed followed when delimiting the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo).\n\n471.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that when the 2001 Mining Code was published, Article 36 had been written on the basis that it referred to situations where mining activities had been prohibited *\"pursuant to the above articles\"* but this wording was deleted pursuant to the Constitutional Court Judgement 339 of 2002. In the Tribunal's view, the removal of these words does not change the meaning of Article 36 in that any prohibition contemplated by Article 36 must have been carried out lawfully and must, therefore, be in compliance with Article 34. Article 36 therefore provides that, when an area is excluded from mining activities in accordance with the Article 34 requirements, it is deemed excluded with immediate effect.\n\n472.\n\nThere is a further contradiction between Article 34 -which expressly requires an \"*act by which* [the exclusion zones] *are declared\"-* and Article 36, which states that the *\"exclusion or restriction need not be declared by any authority whatsoever.*\"509 The Tribunal understands this to mean that for the delimitation to be lawful, there must be some form of declaration, for example the declaration of the creation of a national natural park, regional natural park, forest reserve area or p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, which declaration expressly excludes mining exploration and exploitation works and projects in accordance with Article 34. However, it is not then necessary for there to be a further declaration that the effect of the creation of the national natural park, regional natural park, forest reserve area or p\u00e1ramo ecosystem is that the area within such designated area is a mining exclusion zone. It is an automatic consequence of the Article 34 declaration that the area immediately becomes a mining exclusion zone without more.\n\nLaw No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Arts. 34, 36.\n\n473.\n\nThe Tribunal next turns to consider whether Article 36 excludes the payment of compensation where a mining exclusion zone comes into being. The last sentence of Article 36 provides that \"[...] *if such areas or plots of lands were actually the site of a concessionaire's works, the mining authority shall order they be immediately removed and cleared without awarding any payment, compensation or damages whatsoever for this reason, notwithstanding the proceedings the competent authorities may commence in each case where applicable*.\"510 As is clear from the opening words of this sentence, the provision is directed to a situation where a concessionaire's works are located in the areas delimited as mining exclusion zones. The Article provides that *\"they\"* shall be removed and cleared without compensation, but to what does the word *\"they\"* refer? Logically, this appears to be a reference to the concessionaire's works that must be removed and cleared, such that no compensation is payable for the removal and clearance of the works themselves. However, the provision is silent as to whether or not compensation is payable for the loss of any underlying acquired rights due to any declaration of a mining exclusion zone. Given this silence, the Tribunal is guided by Article 58 of the Constitution, which provides that compensation is payable for loss of an acquired right, the quantum of which is to be determined \"*by taking into account the interests of the community and of the individual concerned*.\"511 The Tribunal therefore finds that Article 36 does not prohibit the right to compensation for the loss of an acquired right to exploit. The Tribunal's construction is supported by the statements of the *Consejo de Estado* in Advisory Opinion 2233, as detailed above, which indicate that certain compensation may be required to be payable, in respect of the loss of an acquired right. The Tribunal's construction ensures Colombian law is respected but balances any immediate potential harm to the environment by ensuring that \"works\" are removed from the area ensuring that the area in the exclusion zone is able to return to its natural state.\n\nLaw No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Art. 36.\n\nPolitical Constitution of Colombia (1991) (**Exhibit C-65**).\n\n***(c) Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n474.\n\nIn undertaking its analysis in Advisory Opinion 2233, the *Consejo de Estado* also considers the meaning and effect of Article 46. It notes that \"*the guarantee of legal stability and respect for legitimate confidence does not imply a rule prohibiting amendment of current statutes upon execution of a contract, but rather, it allows the possibility of economic claims in cases where the conditions of the investment have changed. Put another way, Article 46 of the Mining Code does not necessarily result in the applicability of the prohibition stipulated by lawmakers for the protection of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems.*\"512\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**), para. 2.2.1.1(iv), last paragraph.\n\n475.\n\nIt is apparent from this language that Article 46 does not have the force of a stabilisation clause. Nevertheless, it tends to reinforce the *Consejo de Estado*'s finding that whilst a subsequent law may lawfully have a retrospective effect on Eco Oro, Eco Oro may retain the possibility of an economic claim against Colombia.\n\n476.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that, pursuant to Article 34, Colombia was permitted to designate mining exclusion zones provided that the procedure set out therein was complied with. Article 36 provides that if the area is excluded pursuant to the procedure laid down by Article 34 then it becomes immediately effective and if existing works have to be removed this is at the cost of the concessionaire. However, an existing title holder may be entitled to compensation if it suffers loss of an acquired right.\n\n477.\n\nHaving construed the relevant provisions of the 2001 Mining Code, the Tribunal next considers Laws 1382 and 1450 and Resolution 937. The Tribunal first recalls the requirements set out in Article 34 which must be complied with before an exclusion zone can be declared, namely:\n\na. The act by which the mining exclusion zones areas are declared and delimited must expressly state that it excludes mining exploration and exploitation works.\n\nb. The exclusion zone must be geographically delimited on the basis of technical, social and environmental studies (this was the wording in effect at the time the 2007 Atlas was published, the requirement for economic studies not then having been added);\n\nc. The act by which the exclusion zone is declared must be expressly based on studies that establish the incompatibility of or need to restrict mining activities; and\n\nd. The delimitation must have been prepared with the collaboration of the mining authority.\n\n478.\n\nColombia accepts that the 2001 Mining Code did not expressly create an exclusion zone over any part of Concession 3452513 but says that Article 3 of Law 1382 of February 2010 and MinAmbiente Resolution 937 prohibited all mining in those p\u00e1ramo ecosystems delimited by the 2007 Atlas.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Ms. Blanch), 266:22 \u2013 267:1-6; Tr. Day 1 (Mr. Mantilla-Serrano), 262:15-18; and Tr. Day 1 (Mr. Mantilla-Serrano), 266:6-20.\n\n***(d) Law 1382 of 2010***\n--------------------------\n\n479.\n\nOn a careful review of Law 1382, it does not seem to the Tribunal that it created a mining exclusion zone in the area of the 2007 Atlas.\n\n480.\n\nArticle 3 of Law 1382 amends Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code such that Article 34 expressly refers to p\u00e1ramo ecosystems as an area which \"*may*\" be excluded from mining. This is consistent with Judgement 933. Article 34 continues by stating that *\"[t]he aforementioned zones will be those that have been constituted or will be established in accordance with the legal provisions in force.*\"514 This suggests that exclusion zones could have been put in place by the time of the enactment of Law 1382, however, even on Colombia's case, as of the date Law 1382 was published no exclusion zone had yet been created by the 2007 Atlas; Colombia argues that it was only the publication of Law 1382 which achieved this.\n\nLaw No. 1382 (9 February 2010) (**Exhibit C-18**) (USB drive provided at the Hearing).\n\n481.\n\nLaw 1382 provides that such exclusion zones should be areas *\"geographically delineated by the Environmental Authority based on technical, social and environmental studies. The p\u00e1ramo ecosystems shall be identified in accordance with the cartographic information provided by the* [IAvH].\" Paragraph 3 of Article 3 further provides that \"[t]*he declaration of the exclusion areas referred to in this section requires the Ministry of Mining and Energy's prior non-binding opinion.*\"515\n\nLaw No. 1382 (9 February 2010) (**Exhibit C-18**) (USB drive provided at the Hearing).\n\n482.\n\nTurning first to the requirement that exclusion zones must be delimited on the basis of the technical, social and environmental studies, Colombia adduced no evidence of any such studies having been undertaken before 2010. Indeed, Colombia accepts that the 2007 Atlas was not prepared on the basis of technical, social and environmental studies as such, having been created as a part of MinAmbiente's 2002 p\u00e1ramo programme.516 Colombia argues that the Article 34 studies were unnecessary as Resolution 937 specifies that the 2007 Atlas was to be adopted as a minimum reference. The Tribunal turns to Resolution 937 next, but for the purposes of Law 1382 it seems to the Tribunal that it does not make the 2007 Atlas an exclusion zone as it was not created in accordance with Law 1382's requirements. What Law 1382 does is set out the conditions pursuant to which a mining exclusion zone can be created; the 2007 Atlas did not of itself comply with those conditions. Further there is no evidence that any \"*prior non-binding opinion*\" had been obtained from MinMinas. The Tribunal finds, therefore, that Law 1382 did not of itself create a mining exclusion zone.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Mr. Mantilla-Serrano), 259:21-260:1.\n\n483.\n\nGiven this determination, the Tribunal does not need to consider whether the grandfathering regime applied to Eco Oro, as no mining exclusion zone had been effected over any area of Concession 3452.\n\n***(e) Resolution 937***\n------------------------\n\n484.\n\nThe Tribunal next turns to MinAmbiente's Resolution 937, Article 1 of which adopts the 2007 Atlas *\"for the identification and delimitation of P\u00e1ramo Ecosystems*.\"517 Colombia says the meaning of this is that the 2007 Atlas becomes the delimitation required by Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code (as amended by Law 1382) which gives the 2007 Atlas the force of law as a mining exclusion zone.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 937 (25 May 2011) (**Exhibit R-70**), Art. 1.\n\n485.\n\nThe 2007 Atlas clearly identifies and delimits P\u00e1ramo Ecosystems for certain purposes. The question is: does the delimitation meet the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code? Article 1 of Resolution 937 does not explicitly state the purpose for which the 2007 Atlas is adopted, indeed it does not state that the identification and delimitation is for the purposes of complying with the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code or Law 1382. Colombia accepts that the 2007 Atlas was not prepared on the basis of technical, social and environmental studies, notwithstanding that both Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code and Law 1382 expressly require this for any delimitation to be valid. Further, Resolution 937 makes clear that, to the extent that environmental authorities may have undertaken their own delimitation in their own jurisdictions (as permitted by Article 1(1)), such delimitation must be at least as detailed as 1:25,000. This shows the importance of the delimitation being on a 1:25,000 scale, whereas the 2007 Atlas was on a scale of 1:250,000. The Tribunal therefore does not accept that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo became a mining exclusion zone with the adoption of Resolution 937. Something more was needed.\n\n486.\n\nAs an aside, whilst the Tribunal does not accept that Resolution 937 has the effect contended for by Colombia, it must have been clear to all interested parties that the parameters of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, once delimited in accordance with the law, would not encompass an area less than that of the 2007 Atlas. The Tribunal so concludes because Article 1(1) of Resolution 937 further provides that delimitations carried out by the environmental authorities in their own areas of jurisdiction will be the legally binding delimitation *\"for all purposes*\" provided the cartographic scale used is at least as detailed as 1:25,000 delimitation with no higher elevation than that defined as the lower altitudinal limit for the ecosystem in the 2007 Atlas and with an area no less that that contained in the 2007 Atlas. It follows from this that, with the adoption of Resolution 937, Eco Oro was put on notice as to the future delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo, and the geographic extent of such delimitation being an area no less than that contained in the 2007 Atlas, although, as the Tribunal notes below (paras. 698 and 799), there was a lack of clarity as to what was meant by the words *\"nor is the extent of the total established area decreased*\"518*.*\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 937 (25 May 2011) (**Exhibit R-70**), Art. 1, para. 1.\n\n***(f) Law 1450***\n------------------\n\n487.\n\nThe Tribunal next turns to Article 202 of Law 1450, adopted on 16 June 2011. Paragraph 1 provides that the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem should be delimited to a scale of 1:25,000 based on technical, economic, social and environmental studies, the delineation to be adopted by an administrative act of MinAmbiente or whoever acts in its capacity. Article 201(1) provides, *inter alia*, that no mining activities shall be undertaken on the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and that, \"*for these purposes*\" the 2007 Atlas will be considered as \"*a minimum reference*\" until a more detailed scale cartography has been obtained. As noted in the previous paragraph, above, the reference to the area delimited in the 2007 Atlas is not without consequence, albeit a reference lacking in precision.\n\n488.\n\nThis provision is not easy to construe given the wording of Article 34 and the Tribunal accepts there is a tension between them. The Tribunal finds the proper construction of this Article is that it is calling for the requisite delimitation to be undertaken rather than stating that it has been undertaken by Resolution 937. This is evident from *(i)* the reference to the fact the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems *\"should be\"* delineated to a 1:25,000 scale, which suggests that, at that point, a delimitation at that scale had not been conducted (as indeed was the case); *(ii)* the wording that the delineation prepared *\"will be\"* adopted by MinAmbiente; and *(iii)* the fact that at the time this Resolution was passed (25 May 2011) there was no delimitation at a 1:25,000 scale - the closest was the 2007 Atlas which was not only a delimitation at a scale of 1:250,000 but had also not been prepared on the basis of technical, economic, social and environmental studies.\n\n489.\n\nIt is also of note that, in Law 1450, there was an addition of economic studies to be undertaken in determining the delineation of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Again, no evidence was adduced of any technical, economic, social and environmental studies having been undertaken.\n\n490.\n\nColombia says that the reference to the 2007 Atlas serving as \"*a minimum reference\"* confirms the 2007 Atlas is, for preliminary purposes at least, the mining exclusion zone and its effect is permanent, at least until a 1:25,000 plan is published. Against this, Eco Oro says that Article 202(1) merely effects a temporary (or preliminary) suspension of mining within the 2007 Atlas, pending a lawful delimitation carried out pursuant to the requirements of the 2001 Mining Code (as amended by Law 1382), thus ensuring that no permanent damage can be caused to a potential area of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem but which will have no effect once the 1:25,000 plan is published.\n\n491.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with Colombia's construction. Article 202(1) can only be construed such that a temporary suspension of mining activities in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems comes into effect as delineated by the 2007 Atlas, which suspension will end once the required delineation at a scale of 1:25,000 and undertaken on the basis of technical, social and environmental studies has been published. Paragraph 1 of Article 202 does not create a permanent mining ban: it cannot when Colombia itself accepts that the 2007 Atlas does not meet each of the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code nor those of Article 3 of Law 1382. These requirements are essential to ensure any final delimitation is as reasonably accurate as possible to ensure that a proper balance is achieved between on the one hand protecting the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and on the other protecting the livelihoods of those who work or live in areas which fall within the 2007 Atlas but may not fall within a delimitation undertaken in accordance with Article 34 and Law 1450. Clearly a delimitation at a scale of 1:250,000 will be less accurate than a delimitation at a scale of 1:25,000 and Colombia accepts there are errors in the 2007 Atlas which would be corrected by a more detailed delimitation. By way of example only, Colombia accepts that the 2007 Atlas had a potential margin of error of between 100-150 meters in altitude519 which could be significant in terms of determining the parameters of the mining exclusion ban and the extent of the overlap with Concession 3452. Indeed, on Eco Oro's case, in a mountainous area such as where the Angostura Deposit is located, this altitudinal shift could result in a shift of up to 250 meters in the Resolution 2090 delimitation boundary such that almost all of the Angostura deposit might end up outside the Preservation Zone.520 This construction is supported by the text of Resolution VSC 4, which confirms \"[...] *the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem based on the* [2007 Atlas] *is* *temporary* *until the competent environmental authority creates the final delimitation at a scale of 1:25,000 after carrying out the technical, economic, social and environmental studies referred to in Article 202 of Law No. 1450 of 2011.\"* [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nMinistry of Environment, Presentation \"Delimitation of the P\u00e1ramo of Santurb\u00e1n\" (December 2014) (**Exhibit C-217**), p. 43; IAvH, \"Contributions to the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo\" (2014) (**Exhibit C-194**), p. 53. Colombia accepted there was a 5-13.9% margin of error in determining where the boundary should lie and the margin of error could be as much as 150 meters in altitude in certain areas, because the \"*quality of the information has limitations*.\" Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 257-258.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 274(b).\n\n492.\n\nTherefore, even after the passage of Laws 1382 and 1450 and Resolution 937, Eco Oro is subject only to a temporary (or provisional) mining ban: there is no permanent mining exclusion zone over Concession 3452, just a mandatory suspension of mining activities pending the final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo in accordance with all applicable rules at the time such delimitation is completed. This is the position under Law 1382 and this temporary suspension of mining activities continued as a result of the two-year suspension of the effect of the overturning of Law 1382. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the reason for Law 1382 being overturned was its unconstitutionality for failure to consult, which tends to support the conclusion that, as at that date, no final delimitation had been carried out in accordance with the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code. Before the two year's suspension had expired, Law 1450 was published which, as the Tribunal has determined above, had the same suspensive effect.\n\n493.\n\nThe Tribunal's construction is further supported by the Constitutional Court which, in 2017, stated:\n\n*\"[i]n the case at hand, under Laws No. 1450 of 2010 and 1382 of 2011, the Lawmaker prohibited mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation projects and activities in areas delimited as p\u00e1ramos. Furthermore, it imposed on the Ministry of the Environment and Social Development the obligation to make progress on the delimitation of p\u00e1ramos.* *However, the only p\u00e1ramo delimited when the prohibition was in place was Santurb\u00e1n by way of Resolution No. 2090 of December 19, 2014.* *Therefore, even if the administrative acts whereby the environmental licenses and permits, and concession agreements, were granted remained valid, they had been deprived of their legal basis, as the Lawmaker placed limits on the private persons' freedom to carry out mining and hydrocarbon activities in p\u00e1ramos.*\" 521\n\n*\"Particularly,* *although p\u00e1ramos are ecosystems that, pursuant to the law, call for special protection, they are not protected areas per se, since the 'protected area' category is tied to a declaratory and implementation procedure by the environmental authorities. In other words, although these ecosystems have been identified as areas that require special protection, no category of specific or automatic protection has been regulated for such biomes. To that extent, at present there are p\u00e1ramo areas that have been declared to be protected areas and others that have not.*\"522 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\n\"[W]*e may conclude that,* *although there is a definition of p\u00e1ramo and the obligation to delimit it, determining the scope of protection is effected through such administrative acts as decided upon by the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development on demarcating p\u00e1ramo areas**.*\" 523 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), p. 97.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), p. 101.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), p. 103.\n\n494.\n\nIn support of its construction of Law 1382, Resolution 937 and Law 1450, Colombia refers to Advisory Opinion 2233 and, in particular, the following statement which, on first review, appears contradictory to the statement of the Constitutional Court: *\"Although Act 1382 of 2010 was only in force for a short period of time, the fact is that the deferred effect of its declaration of unconstitutionality allowed the exclusion of p\u00e1ramos from mining activity to continue over time, as it was later included in the general prohibition of Act 1345 of 2011 that we are now dealing with.* *Put differently, with respect to mining activities, the ban on undertaking them in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems has been operative since February 9, 2010*.\"524 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**). (\"*Dicho de otro modo, en lo que se refiere a las actividades mineras, la prohibici\u00f3n de realizarlas en ecosistemas de p\u00e1ramos opera en Colombia desde el 9 de febrero de 2010*.\").\n\n495.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, these two statements can be reconciled. In its judgment, the Constitutional Court is determining, *inter alia*, the actual date on which any specific mining ban came into force. Whilst the *Consejo de Estado* makes a general statement of the importance of protecting the p\u00e1ramos, the focus of its opinion is on considering the effect of a mining ban on \"*persons and companies who were validly carrying out mining and agricultural activities in p\u00e1ramo zones prior to the Act's passage.\"* Given the \"Act\" that the *Consejo de Estado* is referring to is Law 1450 (which was passed in 2011), when the *Consejo de Estado* refers to mining having been prohibited in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems pursuant to the 2001 Mining Code and Law 1382, it is effectively confirming that there is the power to exclude mining from areas where p\u00e1ramo ecosystems have been declared pursuant to the legal requirements contained in the 2001 Mining Code and Law 1382. The same must therefore be so with respect to Law 1450, such that it does not of itself bring in a permanent mining ban but ensures a suspension of mining pending a final delimitation in accordance with the law. Indeed, in defining the problem, the *Consejo de Estado* says, in paragraph 1, that Section 202 of Law 1450 *\"orders the delimitation of the country's p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and prohibits the undertaking of mining and agricultural activities within them.*\" This is consistent with a construction that Law 1450 does indeed *(i)* order that mining is finally prohibited within the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, once finally delimited and *(ii)* ensures that the condition of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems is not adversely affected pending delimitation, by suspending mining within the 2007 Atlas pending such final legal delimitation.\n\n496.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal understands Advisory Opinion 2233 to explain that, once a final delimitation has been undertaken in compliance with the requirements of Article 34 (as amended), a permanent mining ban becomes immediately effective and enforceable in the delimited area.525 Thus, the enactment of Law 1382 provided for the immediate applicability of a ban on any area once, but only once, it was lawfully declared as a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem in compliance with Article 34. If legitimately declared, such a ban would be continued by Law 1450 without a break. However, as the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo had not been finally delimited in accordance with Article 34, Laws 1382 and 1450 did not create any permanent mining ban in Concession 3452. In other words, the term \"p\u00e1ramo ecosystems\" is being used as short-hand for areas which are to be permanently excluded from mining once delimitation has been lawfully undertaken, i.e., in compliance with the requirements contained in the 2001 Mining Code and repeated in Law 1450. Until this happens, mining is suspended, but this is not the same as a permanent ban.\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**), Section A 1 \u2013 The general protection of p\u00e1ramos in environmental legislation.\n\n497.\n\nThe Constitutional Court confirms this construction in Judgement C-35 stating that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was the only p\u00e1ramo that had been delimited but that such delimitation took place only by Resolution 2090 on 19 December 20 1 4.526\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), pp. 97 and 101.\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal takes comfort that its construction is correct from the contemporaneous understanding of both MinMinas and MinAmbiente as well as other Government bodies. For example, MinMinas wrote to INGEOMINAS stating that whilst the 2007 Atlas was to be used as a reference it did not itself establish mining exclusion zones.527 Further, when Eco Oro's application for an environmental licence for its open-cast mine was rejected in Resolution 1015, detailed technical reasons were provided rather than a simple statement that the mining activities planned were banned because they were intended to be carried out in a delineated p\u00e1ramo ecosystem.528 The latter would have been far simpler and the obvious thing to say had there been a mining exclusion zone in place. Again, ANLA confirmed in Resolution 35 dated 31 October 2011 that no mining exclusion zone had been permanently declared in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. The ANM Resolution VSC 4 noted that it was \"*undeniable*\" that at that point Article 202 of Law 1450 had not been developed such that there was not a more detailed map than the 2007 Atlas at 1:250,000 and that therefore the *\"legal status\"* of the area in Concession 3452 was *\"uncertain because it cannot be said with complete certainty, due to the absence of technical parameters, that it is located within the p\u00e1ramo\"* The effect was that exploratory activities continued to be suspended *\"until the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development or the entity acting in its capacity issues the final delimitation to a scale of 1:25,000.\"*\n\nLetter from Ministry of Mines (Ms. D\u00edaz Lopez) to INGEOMINAS (Mr. Montes) (27 September 2011) (**Exhibit C-330**).\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 1015 (31 May 2011) (**Exhibit R-16 / R-71**).\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that as at the date of entry into force of the FTA, whilst mining activities had been suspended, there was no mining exclusion zone in force over any part of Concession 3452 and Eco Oro had acquired rights to explore in the totality of Concession 3452 (Article 58 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clause 4 of the Concession 3452). The majority of the Tribunal finds that Eco Oro had acquired rights to exploit in the totality of Concession 3452 (Article 58 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clauses 1 and 4 of Concession 3452), the exercise of such rights being subject to PTO approval and obtaining an environmental license; and extend the concession at the end of its term (Article 77 of the 2001 Mining Code and Clause 4 of Concession 3452).\n\n500.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to consider whether Colombia's measures had the effect of indirectly expropriating Eco Oro's rights.\n\n**D.** **W****hether** **C****olombia** **U****nlawfully** **E****xpropriated** **E****co** **O****ro****'****s** **I****nvestment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nArticle 811 provides for indirect expropriation. It is uncontroversial that contractual rights may be indirectly expropriated,529 seizure of title is not required and the measures do not need explicitly to express the purpose of deprivation of rights or assets, provided they have \"*a devastating effect on the economic viability*\" of the project and cause the claimant to *\"incur unsustainable losses*\"530 depriving the investor substantially of the use, value and enjoyment of its investment. Thus \"[...] *a measure or series of measures can still eventually amount to a taking, though the individual steps in the process do not formally purport to amount to a taking or to a transfer of title*.\"531 *\"The last step in a creeping expropriation that tilts the balance is similar to the straw that breaks the camel's back. The preceding straws may not have had a perceptible effect but are part of the process that led to the break.*\"532 Intent is not a prerequisite, the issue is the effect of the measures in question.533 The form and purpose of the measures is irrelevant, the question being whether the measures are or are not expropriatory.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 245; *Phillips Petroleum Company Iran v.

Colombia indirectly expropriated Eco Oro's entire investment in Colombia, the date of expropriation being 8 August 2016 when Resolution VSC 829 was issued by the ANM advising that, pursuant to Judgement C-35 of the Constitutional Court, it was only extending Concession 3452 for the areas that fell outside the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo as delimited by Resolution 2090. The Challenged Measures deprived Eco Oro substantially of the use, value and enjoyment of Concession 3452. Colombia disputes this saying its actions, having been taken for the protection of the environment, do not constitute expropriation.\n\n*(i) The Nature of the Assets Expropriated*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nEco Oro's rights to undertake exploitation activities in the totality of Concession 3 4 52,534 as well as the right to extend the term of the Concession were expropriated, both rights being acquired rights.\n\nWhilst during the oral hearing there was some debate as to whether the rights Eco Oro asserts it held at the time of the expropriating measures consisted of the right to exploit, the exercise of which was subject to fulfilling the necessary legal requirements or whether it was more limited, being the right to apply for an environmental licence to enable it to undertake exploitation activities, in its Post-Hearing Brief (paragraph 3), Eco Oro confirmed it asserted it had a right to exploit, which right was expropriated.\n\n*(ii) The Challenged Measures*\n------------------------------\n\n504.\n\nThe key events are as follows.\n\na. Resolution 2090\n------------------\n\n505.\n\nResolution 2090 is an administrative act. Article 1 provided for delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo \"*in accordance with the technical, economic, social and environmental studies conducted by the* [CDMB and CORPONOR] *and the contributions of the* [IAvH]\"535 (a 2014 document titled *\"Contributions to the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo through identification of lower limits of the ecosystem at a 1:25,000 scale and analysis of the social system of the territory*\"536(the \"**Contributions Document**\") as cartographically represented on the map attached to the Resolution which was on a scale of 1:25,000 and was stated to be an integral part thereof (\"**2090 Atlas**\").\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 2090 of 2014 (19 December 2014) (**Exhibit C-34 / MR-35**).\n\nIAvH, \"Contributions to the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo\" (2014) (**Exhibit C-194**).\n\n506.\n\nResolution 2090 did not *\"confirm\"* the 2007 Atlas delimitation. Ms. Baptiste confirmed that to delineate the p\u00e1ramos, the IAvH was required to prepare a new set of criteria and adequate methodology which differed from those used to prepare the 2007 Atlas.537 The delimitation was eight times larger than Santurb\u00e1n Park, whereas previous indications (including from Ms. Baptiste538) had been that the boundaries of the area delimited by Resolution 2090 would be similar to those of Santurb\u00e1n Park. Further, the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delineated at a 1:25,000 scale by the IAvH is approximately 56% larger than the total area identified in the 2007 Atlas and the total p\u00e1ramo area in Colombia under the 2012 Atlas539 was 47% larger than that in the 2007 Atlas.540 Pursuant to Resolution 2090, 50.7% of Concession 3452 overlapped with the preservation area, a further 3.9% overlapped with the restoration area and 32% of the Angostura deposit overlapped with the preservation area and 28% overlapped with the restoration area.\n\nFirst Baptiste Statement, paras. 43 and 45.\n\nLetter from IAvH, (Ms. Baptiste) to Mayor of Vetas and others (30 October 2013) (**Exhibit C-189**), p. 1.\n\nIAvH, New Cartography of the P\u00e1ramos of Colombia \u2013 Scale 1:100,000 (2012) (**Exhibit R-140**).\n\nIAvH, \"Forest-P\u00e1ramo Transition. Conceptual Basis and Methods for its Identification in the Colombian Andes\" (2015) (**Exhibit R-123**), p. 17.\n\n507.\n\nResolution 2090 had limited impact on Eco Oro as Article 9 permitted mining activities in the restoration zone located, *inter alia*, in the municipality of California where Concession 3452 is located, subject to compliance with mining and environmental regulations and Eco Oro's rights were grandfathered by Article 5541 as Eco Oro's PMA is an equivalent environmental management and control instrument. However, Article 5 deprived Eco Oro of its right to extend its concession beyond its initial term curtailing Eco Oro's rights, although this still gave sufficient time to pursue a viable Project.542 Further, Article 5's provision that the existing environmental licenses or equivalent environmental management and control instruments \"*may be subject to revision and adjustments*\" and further that regional and environmental bodies \"*shall define more detailed guidelines, in the context of zoning and the determination of uses regulation, as well as in the corresponding environmental control and management documents\"* created uncertainty; it was unclear what these detailed guidelines and documents would consist of and thus to what extent they would impact on mine planning or how PMAs of grandfathered projects would be amended and whether they would be made stricter.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 2090 of 2014 (19 December 2014) (**Exhibit C-34 / MR-35**).\n\nFirst Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 29.\n\nb. Law 1753\n-----------\n\n508.\n\nEco Oro again benefitted from the grandfathering provisions in Article 173 of Law 175 3 543 because Concession 3452 and the PMA both pre-dated 9 February 2010. This meant that Eco Oro's mining activities, including exploration and exploitation, could continue throughout its Concession area as the transitional regime did not only apply to exploitation activities. Whilst Law 1382 expressly exempted \"*construction assembly or exploitation activities*\", Resolution 2090 did not contain such language, instead referring to \"*mining activities that have concession contracts* [...] *as well as* [...] *equivalent environmental management and control instrument*.\"544 The rights to explore and to exploit are indivisible and, in any event, Law 1753 expressly refers to exploration as well as exploitation activities. The grandfathering regime in Law 1753 therefore allowed Eco Oro to continue carrying out those activities it was permitted to do pursuant to its Concession and PMA which was the right to explore and exploit up to the end of the Concession (subject to obtaining an environmental licence), it is grandfathering the existing Concession irrespective of the stage of activity the concessionaire has reached.\n\nLaw No. 1753 of 2015 (9 June 2015) (**Exhibit C-36**), Article 173, para. 1.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 2090 of 2014 (19 December 2014) (**Exhibit C-34 / MR-35**).\n\n509.\n\nColombia is also wrong to say that an *\"equivalent environmental management and control instrument*\" is a reference to an environmental licence - given the words immediately follow after the reference to an environmental licence that would render the term duplicative and deprive it of any legal effect (*effet utile*)*.*545 An *\"equivalent environmental management and control instrument*\" is not an environmental licence but another different instrument. Given MinAmbiente Decree 2041 of 2014 (enacted just two months before Resolution 2090 was published) defines PMAs as an *\"environmental management and control instrument*\"546it is clear that the reference in Resolution 2090 to an *\"equivalent environmental management and control instrument*\" is a reference to a PMA.\n\nEco Oro notes that this principle is recognised under Colombian law \u2013 Constitutional Court Judgement C- 569/04 (8 June 2004) (**Exhibit C-316**), paras. 24, 26, 30-32, 75.\n\nDecree No. 2041 (15 October 2014) (**Exhibit C-216**), Article 39.\n\n510.\n\nEco Oro's updated PMA was submitted in 2008 after integration of the mining titles and was associated with Concession 3452 (not Permit 3452 as was the position with the original PMA) and has been used by the CDMB to monitor Eco Oro's activities since submission. It is clearly therefore an equivalent \"*environmental management and control instrument*\" for the purpose of the grandfathering regime.\n\n511.\n\nThe fact the Project was grandfathered is also evident from Colombia's acts *(i)* in lifting the suspension of Eco Oro's mining activities in all areas of the concession without any reference to any applicable mining restrictions in the concession area; *(ii)* the ANLA indicating that an underground mine could be licensed;547 *(iii)* calculating Eco Oro's canon payments in relation to the entirety of the area; *(iv)* only reducing the area over which the canon payments were calculated 18 months after Resolution 2090 was issued once judgement C-35 had been published; *(v)* appointing a PINE official to look after the Project because it was \"*the 'VIP' Project in the nation*\"; and *(vi)* the President's Minister and advisors telling an IFC representative in a meeting that \"*ANLA was willing to evaluate the underground project under the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem* [...].\"\n\nSecond Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 12.\n\n512.\n\nIf it is determined that the grandfathering regime did not apply to Eco Oro, this does not mean there was no indirect expropriation, it is just a timing issue and the effect is that the expropriation took place when Resolution 2090 was issued, rather than subsequently upon the issuance of Resolution VSC 829, which effectively applied Resolution 2090 to Eco Oro without the benefit of the grandfathering provision.\n\n513.\n\nWhilst Ms. Baptiste says in her testimony that the Resolution 2090 delimitation has not been criticised, this is incorrect.548 After publication of this delimitation, the IAvH accepted there could be a margin of error of 100 meters in altitude549 (it is unknown how this margin of error was determined as annex 8 in which this evaluation was carried out and in which it was reflected was not produced despite Colombia being ordered so to do). MinAmbiente estimated the margin of error to be even greater, as much as 150 meters in altitude in certain areas, because the *\"quality of information has limitations\",* noting that further field studies should have been carried out to verify the information.550 Given that where the Angostura Deposit is located is mountainous, this altitudinal shift could result in a shift of up to 250 meters in the Resolution 2090 delimitation boundary such that almost all of the Angostura deposit would be outside the Preservation Zone. Additionally, the town of Vetas and certain densely populated areas of the municipality of Berlin fell within the delimited zone. MinAmbiente acknowledged that certain such areas should be removed from the Resolution 2090 delimitation551 but no amendments were made. The CDMB also recommended amendments to it552 (having undertaken the delimitation of Santurb\u00e1n Park two years before) but again no amendments were made. Even the Constitutional Court noted that MinAmbiente may modify the delimitation on the basis that various participants had warned of errors in the delimitation.553\n\nFirst Baptiste Statement, para. 56.\n\nIAvH, \"Contributions to the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo\" (2014) (**Exhibit C-194**), p. 53.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Presentation \"Delimitation of the P\u00e1ramo of Santurb\u00e1n\" (December 2014) (**Exhibit C-217**), p. 43.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Presentation \"Delimitation of the P\u00e1ramo of Santurb\u00e1n\" (December 2014) (**Exhibit C-217**), p. 43.\n\nAs referred to in Constitutional Court, Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (**Exhibit C-244**), p. 321.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (**Exhibit C-244**), pp. 261 and 321.\n\nc. Judgment C-35\n----------------\n\n514.\n\nFurther uncertainty was created when the Constitutional Court first announced and then published Judgment C-35.554 Whilst the grandfathering provisions in Law 1753 were struck down by this judgment, it didn't strike down the equivalent provisions in Resolution 2090. Judgment C-35 also provided that those provisions in Article 173 of Law 1753 which allowed MinAmbiente to deviate from the mapping carried out by the IAvH on the basis of criteria other than scientific (i.e., social and economic) were unconstitutional and the Ministry could only deviate if it could scientifically demonstrate that doing so would provide a higher degree of protection to the p\u00e1ramo.555 This raised concern that the delimitation in Resolution 2090 would also be struck down as unconstitutional since social and economic criteria had not been taken into account; indeed there was a challenge pending before the Constitutional Court. Additional uncertainty was created by the Constitutional Court raising concerns, *obiter dicta*, about underground mining in p\u00e1ramo areas.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**).\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), para. 180, pp. 145-146.\n\n515.\n\nThis wide-spread level of uncertainty can be seen from the letter written by MinAmbiente to the Constitutional Court seeking certain clarifications,556 which the Court declined to provide.557 The ANM also sought clarifications which were not provided. The Minister of Mines noted the uncertainty which had been caused by this judgement and the CDMB explained to Eco Oro in a meeting on 21 November 2016 that these uncertainties prevented it from processing a request for an environmental licence. The ANM characterised the judgement as \"*radical*\" and \"*an absolute interference with contractual rights and effects, from a mining point of view, contracts executed, and investments made, under the regulations in force at the time, which could potentially cause unlawful damages to those who, on the basis of the contract, and legitimate expectations, carried out investments which could be deemed to have been indirectly expropriated, as a consequence of the unconstitutionality decision. Evidently, this situation raises national and international concerns in light of investment protection treaties* [...].\"558 This uncertainty brought the project development to a standstill.559\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Environment to the Constitutional Court (11 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-43**), pp. 10-11.\n\nDecision 097/16 of the Colombian Constitutional Court (2 March 2016) (**Exhibit C-47**).\n\nLetter from National Mining Agency to the Constitutional Court seeking clarification on the consequences of Constitutional Judgment C-35 (24 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-44**), pp. 7-8.\n\nSecond Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 30.\n\nd. Resolution 829\n-----------------\n\n516.\n\nResolution 829 was issued by the ANM and extended the exploration phase for a further two years but only over the area which did not overlap the Preservation Zone pursuant to Judgment C-35.\n\n517.\n\nEco Oro was therefore not deprived of its rights in relation to 50.73% of Concession 3452 until *(i)* the ANM's letter to Eco Oro on 26 July 2016, requesting payment of the surface canon calculated only on the 49.27% of the area Concession 3452 which did not overlap with the Preservation Zone because that overlapping area was excluded from mining pursuant to its letter dated 19 May 2016560 (which cited Judgement C-35); and *(ii)* the notification from the ANM on 8 August 2016 that it had decided, in Resolution VSC 829, only to extend the exploration phase (as requested by Eco Oro) in respect of that area of the Concession which did not overlap with the Preservation Zone of the 2090 Delimitation, i.e., 49.27%.\n\nLetter from the National Mining Agency (Mr. Garc\u00eda Granados) to Eco Oro (Ms. Arenas Uribe) (26 July 2016) (**Exhibit C-50**).\n\n518.\n\nResolution 829 was not, as argued by Colombia, mere clarification that mining was not permitted in the concession area that overlapped with the p\u00e1ramo but was issued as a consequence of Judgement C-35. This can be seen from the following: *\"p\u00e1ramo ecosystems must be excluded from mining activities by the operation of law, including those carried out pursuant to concession contracts that have already been granted and that are environmentally feasible, as indicated by the Honourable Constitutional Court in the constitutionality analysis carried out in judgement C-035 of 2016.\"* The reference to *\"concession contracts that have already been granted and that are environmentally feasible\"* is a reference to grandfathered concession contracts.\n\n519.\n\nAlthough pursuant to Resolution 829 it was clear mining would not be permitted in the Preservation Zone, there was considerable uncertainty as to what would be permitted in the Restoration Zone. This uncertainty was exacerbated when Eco Oro received Resolution 48 from the ANM (on 20 September 2016) which was in respect of another of its titles but which granted an extension over the entire concession area, notwithstanding that the area of that concession overlapped with both the Preservation Zone and Restoration Zone but which further stated that mining activities were prohibited in both of these zones. The uncertainty continued when the Director General of the CDMB advised Eco Oro that it was unclear whether mining would be permitted in the Restoration Zone.561 27.6% of the Angostura Deposit overlapped with the Restoration Zone.\n\nFirst Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 63.\n\n520.\n\nThis uncertainty also extended to the balance of Concession 3452 that did not overlap with either the Preservation Zone or Restoration Zone. The pending Constitutional Court challenge to Resolution 2090 and the 2090 Delimitation raised concerns that the MinAmbiente could be required to re-delimit the p\u00e1ramo such that it encroached further into Concession 3452. There was clear confusion within the ANM (as evidenced by the ANM's technical report VSC 3) and the Director General of the CDMB advised Eco Oro that the CDMB would not be able to process any application for an environmental licence relating to Concession 3452 until the uncertainties were lifted.562\n\nFirst Moseley-Williams Statement, paras. 63-64.\n\n521.\n\nIt is clear from the following that Eco Oro had not been deprived of its mining rights before Resolution 829:\n\na. The ANM would not have needed to refer to grandfathered concession contracts in Resolution 829;\n\nb. The ANM would not have extended the exploration phase over the entire concession area in both August 2012 and 2014;\n\nc. Surface canons would not have been charged over the entire area in 2012 to 2015; in September 2015 the 2090 Delimitation had already been completed such that Judgment C-35 was the only intervening act between then and the ANM seeking surface canons over only 49.27%; and\n\nd. The suspension of mining activities in Resolution VSC 4 would not have been lifted in January 2015, after the Resolution 2090 delimitation.\n\n522.\n\nIn further support of Eco Oro's argument that it was only deprived of its mining rights by Resolution 829, it is clear from the CIIPE minutes of August 2016 that it was only upon receipt of Resolution 829 that Eco Oro learnt of its deprivation and that this deprivation was as a result of the declaration of the unconstitutionality of the grandfathering provision in Article 173(1) of Law 1753.563 The confusion as to whether the effect of Judgement C-35 was that mining was just banned in the Preservation Zone or whether it also extended to the Restoration Zone must also have been shared by CIIPE given the reference in the minutes to the loss of 60% of the area of Concession 3452 which corresponds to the overlap with both Zones. There was further uncertainty as to whether a buffer zone would be imposed further reducing the available area in which mining would be permitted or whether mining to the border of the 2090 Delimitation would be allowed.\n\nIntersectoral Commission for Infrastructure and Strategic Projects (CIIPE) Minutes of Meeting No. 5 [CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT] (16 August 2016) (**Exhibit C-397**), p. 3.\n\n523.\n\nWhilst Eco Oro sought to maintain the *status quo* after this indirect expropriation to preserve the possibility of future mitigation, the uncertainty never lifted and the further measures undertaken by Colombia between 2017 and 2019 thwarted its mitigation efforts. Indeed, Eco Oro had been hopeful that the remaining area of Concession 3452 had value to Minesa, a mining company whose concession was landlocked within Concession 3452 and which required the building of tunnels located within the non-overlapping portion of Concession 3452, such tunnels being indispensable to Minesa's project. However, this possibility of mitigating its losses was thwarted by the ANM granting to Minesa the right to tunnel through Concession 3452 without regard to Eco Oro's rights.\n\n524.\n\nColombia's denial of any further extension to file the PTO led to the expiration of the exploration phase of Concession 3452 and Eco Oro therefore had no alternative but to renounce the Concession in further mitigation of its losses, including the need to avoid the continuing costs associated with maintaining and securing the mine site and avoiding the declaration of forfeiture which could impede the completion of the sale and transfer of certain of its other mining titles to Minesa.\n\n525.\n\nEco Oro was therefore deprived of the value or control of its investment. The fact it retained the ability to mine just under half of the area of Concession 3452 is irrelevant as the loss in resources in the area lost to delimitation destroyed the economics of the project.564 Further, the uncertainty as to the extent of Eco Oro's rights to the remaining area which did not overlap with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo as then delimited (some of which overlapped with the Restoration Zone and some of which were not covered by the Resolution 2090 delimitation) rendered any remaining rights Eco Oro may have had valueless. There was considerable uncertainty as to the ability to mine in the Restoration Zone (and this encompassed 27.6% of Concession 3452's area) and it was further unclear whether any re-delimitation would encroach yet further into the non-overlapping areas of Concession 3452. Eco Oro's Terms of Reference obtained in 2011 are irrelevant to evaluating the uncertainty caused by Colombia's measures in 2016 and beyond. Whilst Eco Oro sought to maintain the *status quo* so as to preserve the possibility of mitigating its losses should the position become clearer, Colombia ultimately caused the expiration of the exploration phase leaving Eco Oro no option but to renounce its right to Concession 3452 in a further attempt to mitigate its losses.\n\nFirst Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 59.\n\n*(iii) Effect of the expropriating measures*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n526.\n\nEco Oro was deprived of its rights under Concession 3452 by an arbitrary delimitation -Resolution 829 deprived Eco Oro of over 50% of the area of Concession 3452 which overlapped the Preservation Zone as delimited by Resolution 2090 and this loss of resources, coupled with the crippling uncertainty as to what could be achieved with the remaining area of the concession, destroyed the economic viability of the Project. But for the deprivation of its rights, Eco Oro would have produced an EIA showing that its mining project could have been carried out in an environmentally respectful way.\n\na. The FTA Does Not Establish the Primacy of Environmental Protection Over Trade and Investment\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nAs a preliminary point, Colombia's contention that the State parties agreed to subordinate investment protection to environmental preservation in the FTA is wrong. Both ideals are mutually supportive, neither is subordinated to the other. They must be applied consistently. Eco Oro does not seek restitution but compensation for measures taken by Colombia as the measures taken were not for a legitimate purpose. This \"*is a fair outcome that preserves a broad discretion for Colombia to regulate the environment whilst affording reparation in connection with the destruction of the acquired rights of Eco Oro.*\"565\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 357.\n\n528.\n\nColombia's argument that legitimate expectations that arose before the entry into force of the FTA are not protected by Article 801 and Annex 811(2) is also wrong. Article 801(2) precludes any action arising out of a State measure that pre-dates the entry into force of the FTA (the action that frustrates the legitimate expectations), it does not preclude reliance on legitimate expectations formed before the FTA entered into force. This is clear from the definition of *\"covered investment\"* in Article 838 of the FTA which includes within the scope of the Treaty's protection investments which existed on the date the FTA entered into force.\n\nb. Annex 811(2)\n---------------\n\n529.\n\nColombia's action on 8 August 2016 had \"*an effect equivalent to direct expropriation\"* Whilst it is correct that the Preservation Zone of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo only overlapped with 50.73% of the area of Concession 3452 and 32.4% of the Angostura Deposit, the economic effect of this was to destroy the viability of the Project.566 According to Eco Oro's mining experts, Behre Dolbear, having considered three similar properties located immediately adjacent to the Angostura Project which were sold between 2011 and 2012, the Angostura Project had considerable market value prior to the measures. They value it at USD 696 million as of 8 August 2016. They further opine that there is no basis to assess the current actual value such that the loss to Eco Oro is 100% of the fair market value of the project. The value of Concession 3452 has thus been eviscerated.\n\nFirst Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 59.\n\n530.\n\nIt was also impossible for Eco Oro to pursue the Project in the light of the many legal uncertainties (summarised above) surrounding the extent or existence of Eco Oro's rights in those parts of Concession 3452 which did not overlap the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo as delimited in the 2090 Delimitation.567 This rendered any remaining rights to Concession 3452 valueless.568\n\nFirst Moseley-Williams Statement, paras. 48-62.\n\nFirst Compass Lexecon Report, para. 13.\n\n531.\n\nEco Oro's rights were therefore indirectly expropriated applying the factors detailed in Annex 811(2)(a).\n\n532.\n\nColombia is incorrect to argue that its measures are excused by Annex 811(2)(b).\n\n533.\n\nFor this Annex even to apply, the measure in question must relate to the protection of the environment. Hence the following measures do not come within Annex 811(2)(b):\n\na. The ANM's refusal on 22 August 2017 to suspend Eco Oro's obligations in light of the uncertainties surrounding the Project and its rejection of Eco Oro's appeal; and\n\nb. The ANM's March 2019 deadline to submit a PMA.\n\n534.\n\nThe remaining measures are *\"rare circumstances\"* such that they constitute indirect expropriation for which compensation is payable.\n\n535.\n\nSub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Annex 811 are interpretative aids describing the circumstances in which an indirect expropriation arises and they are to be read together: sub-paragraph (a) contains a non-exhaustive list of *\"factors\"* to be *\"considered\"* as part of a \"*case-by-case, fact based inquiry*\" to determine whether the measures constitute an indirect expropriation. These \"*factors*\" are not strict conditions to finding an indirect expropriation, but part of a holistic analysis, as is clear from the wording that the factors are to be \"*consider*[ed]\"; there is no provision that they are determinative. Sub-paragraph (b) contains further guidance for the inquiry initiated by sub-paragraph (a) by clarifying the types of measures that will not constitute indirect expropriation. A measure that is adopted in good faith, is non-discriminatory and is designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives will not be expropriatory; the three requirements are cumulative (reflecting the latter part of the sub-clause, (the \"**811(2)(b) Rule**\"). The first part of the sub-clause provides an exception to this rule such that it does not apply where there are *\"rare circumstances\"* (the \"**811(2)(b) Exceptions**\") and provides a non-exhaustive illustrative example of such a *\"rare circumstance.*\"\n\n536.\n\nColombia's construction, which requires mutually exclusive analysis of the two sub-paragraphs, does not comport with the ordinary meaning of the text of these two sub-paragraphs. Firstly, the *\"economic impact\"* of a measure is a factor listed in sub-paragraph (a), however, in considering the severity of the measure to determine its proportionality pursuant to sub-paragraph (b), it is necessary to consider its economic impact. Again, sub-paragraph (a) lists the *\"character\"* of a measure as a factor however, to determine under sub-paragraph (b) whether that measure is *\"non-discriminatory\"* and the manner in which it is *\"designed and applied\",* it is necessary to consider its character. The two sub-paragraphs are thus clearly to be considered in one joint, coterminous analysis. This is further demonstrated by the fact that the two sub-paragraphs consist of one long sentence joined together by a semi-colon. Further to this analysis, Eco Oro's contentions with regard to the Annex 811(2)(a) factors is included in its submissions with respect to whether the measures were a valid exercise of Colombia's police powers.\n\n537.\n\nAnnex 811(2)(b) is a codification of, and reflects, the customary international law doctrine of police powers, as was noted by the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay*569 referring to the Canadian Model BIT whose provision is virtually identical to the sub-clause and as confirmed by Canada in *Lone Pine v. Canada*.570 This doctrine is not absolute: to meet the threshold of non-compensable and non-expropriatory government action, there are \"*a number of conditions that a measure has to comply with, including non-discrimination, good faith, non-arbitrariness and proportionality.*\"571\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 392; *Philip Morris Brand S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v.

Colombia is wrong to term this a \"severe and bad faith regulation\",572 what is required is an assessment of proportionality: when is a measure or series of measures so severe in the light of its purpose? This analysis enables a determination of whether a measure can \"be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith\" -this is the additive, aggravating element that makes a measure that would otherwise be covered by the 811(2)(b) Rule qualify as an 811(2)(b) Exception and is the factor that makes the circumstances \"rare.\" Annex 811(2)(b) does not mandate the finding of bad faith nor of severity and, as is clear from the inclusion in the provision of the words \"such as\", other measures that \"cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith\" for reasons other than disproportionality must also qualify as an exception to Annex 811(2)(b). To argue that the only measures that can qualify as 811(2)(b) Exceptions are those that cannot be reasonably be viewed as having been adopted in good faith for reasons of disproportionality (and not for any other reasons) is nonsensical and would render the words \"such as\" in Annex 811(2)(b) devoid of meaning\n\nColombia's Counter-Memorial, para. 337.\n\n540.\n\nThe criterion that measures must be adopted in good faith aligns with the police powers requirement that the measure is *bona fide.* As well as being enshrined in the text of Annex 811, good faith is a fundamental principle of international law.\n\n541.\n\nThe principle of good faith has various manifestations when considering the manner in which States are to treat foreign investors but in summary encompass a State's obligation not to act in a way that frustrates an investor's legitimate expectations, to ensure regulatory transparency with no arbitrariness or capricious in discretionary decision-making, of fairness, clarity, non-ambiguity and predictability.573 Whilst the reference cited from the Oxford Handbook on International Investment Law is in relation to fair and equitable treatment, the international law treatment of good faith is imported into the police powers doctrine by the express reference in Annex 811(2)(b) to the requirement that a measure be taken in good faith such that the analysis to be undertaken is the same whether being conducted with respect to the ability to rely on the police powers exception or a minimum standard of treatment analysis.574 Indeed, Annex 811(2)(a) expressly refers to reasonable investment-backed expectations as one of the three specified factors to take into account when considering whether there has been indirect expropriation.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 399 *et seq.*; T.

They frustrated Eco Oro's legitimate expectations; are arbitrary and disproportionate; and resulted in a non-transparent and unpredictable regulatory regime or were not otherwise implemented in good faith. Colombia is therefore obliged to compensate Eco Oro for these measures which expropriated its mining rights.\n\n*(iv) Eco Oro 's legitimate expectations*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nAn expectation is legitimate when premised on *\"assurances explicit or implicit, or on representations made by the State*\"575 and such expectations must have been formed at the time the investment was made or, where the investment is made through several steps, *\"legitimate expectations must be examined for each stage at which a decisive step is taken towards the creation, expansion, development, or reorganisation of the investment.*\"576Whilst a foreign investor may recognize a host State's right to regulate, it would expect to be able to rely on specific undertakings made by that State.577 Colombia's measures restricting mining activities in areas of Concession 3452 delimited by Resolution 2090 as p\u00e1ramo were in breach of specific commitments made by the Government on which Eco Oro had a right to rely.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 455, citing *Azurix*, Award (14 July 2006) (**Exhibit CL-35**), para. 318; A.

The 1988 Mining Code applied when Eco Oro bought these titles and it provided that \"*permits and licenses granted by means of a duly executed resolution, that remain in force and valid at the date of enacting of this Code\"* constitute acquired rights.578 Whilst Article 10 excluded certain areas from mining, Article 9 provided that any areas indicated as prohibited to mining \"*does not affect previously issued titles, whilst they remain valid.\"* These acquired rights gave Eco Oro the expectation it would have the right to mine (including the right to exploit) in the entirety of the area granted under each title, subject only to those areas excluded at the time the title was issued and to complying with the applicable regulatory and licensing requirements. As a result of these expectations, Eco Oro commenced its investment in Colombia by carrying out exploration works and acquiring additional mining titles.\n\nDecree No. 2655 of 1988 (Mining Code 1988) (23 December 1988) (**Exhibit C-64**), Art. 6.\n\n547.\n\nAlthough Eco Oro's ten titles were consolidated into Concession 3452 pursuant to the 2001 Mining Code, that did not extinguish the constitutive rights associated with and acquired from the underlying mining permits. Instead, Eco Oro obtained additional acquired rights based on the terms of Concession 3452. Colombia is wrong to say that there was no basis for Eco Oro to have had an expectation it would be permitted to conduct exploitation activities over the entire area of the Concession -Clause One explicitly provided that the sole purpose of the Concession agreement was exploitation such that Eco Oro would have rights over the entirety of the Concession area.\n\n548.\n\nSection 46 of the 2001 Mining Code further stabilised the legal framework applicable to mining projects. This applies to the provisions of the 2001 Mining Code and all norms specifically aimed at mining activities, including environmental norms. As provided by Advisory Opinion 2233, whilst Article 46 did not preclude the authorities from restricting rights to carry out mining activities in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, compensation could be payable.579\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**), p. 52.\n\n549.\n\nNone of the prior laws such as the Environmental Law, those efforts commencing in 2002 for the protection of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and the 2007 Atlas amounted to a restriction on mining activities in the area of Concession 3452. If they had, Eco Oro would not have been granted Concession 3452. Eco Oro legitimately formed expectations based on Clause One of Concession 3452 and Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code.\n\n550.\n\nWhilst the licensing regime may have been exacting, Eco Oro was deprived of its acquired right to attempt to meet the applicable environmental licensing requirements during the term of Concession 3452.580\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 488, citing *William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2009-04, Award of Jurisdiction and Liability (17 March 2015) (**Exhibit RL-18**), paras. 603-604.\n\n551.\n\nEco Oro was induced by these measures to make its investment and form legitimate expectations and, prior to Colombia's measures, Eco Oro had legitimate expectations it would *(i)* have exclusive rights to carry out mining activities within Concession 3452; *(ii)* be permitted to use the entirety of the Concession area for the duration of any term extensions subject to complying with its obligations and obtaining the necessary environmental licenses or authorisations; and *(iii)* Concession 3452 was protected from legislative or regulatory developments as well as other governmental acts having the effect of reducing the scope of Eco Oro's rights.\n\n552.\n\nThese legitimate expectations were frustrated by: *(i)* Judgment C-35; *(ii)* Resolution 829; *(iii)* ANM's statements in late 2016 that mining would also be prohibited in the Restoration Zone of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo as delimited by Resolution 2090; and *(iv)* the suggestions from the CDMB and MinAmbiente that they would be unable to issue an environmental license, even for areas that had not been delimited by Resolution 2090 as p\u00e1ramo. Indeed, the Government itself recognised the illegitimacy of its interference with the expectations of investors such as Eco Oro. The ANM wrote to the Constitutional Court noting that Judgment C-35 would result in an absolute interference with the contractual rights of concessionaires equating to indirect expropriation. By frustrating Eco Oro's legitimate expectations, Colombia failed to act in good faith and thus the 811(2)(b) Exceptions cannot apply.\n\n553.\n\nColombia is wrong to say that Eco Oro should have known since at least 2007 that it would never be permitted to mine in the entirety of the Concession area. When Eco Oro first invested in Colombia with Permit 3452 there was no ban on mining in the p\u00e1ramos. Permit 3452 expressly stated it did not contain areas within which mining was prohibited. Whilst the General Environmental Law had been passed in 1993, it did not restrict mining in the p\u00e1ramos, merely stating that p\u00e1ramos, sub-p\u00e1ramos, springs and aquifer replenishing zones are subject to *\"special protection.*\" There was no guidance as to what that special protection consisted of, nor did it establish any restrictions on carrying out any activities in those areas (and indeed no other regulation contained any such restriction at that time). Whilst it required the granting of environmental licenses for the extraction of natural resources and required environmental authorities to take account of the precautionary principle when granting such licences, it is not correct, either as a matter of law or fact, that environmental authorities denied licences to any project where they could not establish with absolute certainty such project would not have an adverse effect on the p\u00e1ramo. Environmental licences were granted to mining projects in areas later delimited as p\u00e1ramos (including areas within the 2007 Atlas) throughout the late 1990s and the 2000s. Further, the Rio Declaration specifies that the precautionary principle only applies \"*where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage\"* The General Environmental Law implemented the precautionary principle, stating that \"[...] *the environmental authorities and the individuals will apply the precautionary principle according to which, where there is a threat of irreversible and grave harm, the lack of absolute certainty should not be used as a reason to postpone the adoption of efficient measures to prevent the degradation of the environment*.\"581\n\nLaw No. 99 of 1993 (General Environmental Law) (22 December 1993) (**Exhibit C-66**), Article 1(6) (as cited in Claimant's Reply, para. 113).\n\n554.\n\nAdvisory Opinion 2233 confirmed that the mere existence of a potential risk is insufficient to permit invocation of the precautionary principle, there must be scientific evidence that the activity presents a risk and that \"*in general the duties of prevention that the Constitution assigns to the authorities in this field, do not mean that a product or process can only be used when it has been demonstrated that it has no risk, as it is impossible to demonstrate the absence of risk* [...]. *If there is no basic evidence of a potential risk, the precautionary principle cannot be arbitrarily invoked to inhibit the undertaking of specific commercial or investigative practices. Conversely, in cases where a potential risk has been identified, the precautionary principle obliges the authorities to assess whether or not the risk is tolerable and to determine the course of action on the basis of that assessment.*\"582\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**), p. 31.\n\n555.\n\nThe General Environmental Law did not impose a mining ban in the p\u00e1ramos and in any event there had been no delimitation of the p\u00e1ramos at that stage. Therefore, when Concession 3452 was granted there were no laws prohibiting or restricting mining in p\u00e1ramo areas. All that was in force was Decree 1220 of 21 April 2005,583 article 10 of which provided \"[...] *when* [mining projects] *are intended to be developed in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems* [...]*, the environmental authorities shall take into consideration the decisions taken on the matter regarding their conservation and sustainable use through the different administrative instruments of environmental management\"* Further, several environmental licences were issued in areas subsequently delimited as p\u00e1ramo around the same time. The fact that the 2007 Atlas had been published did not give the p\u00e1ramos any *\"heightened importance\"* such that \"*obtaining an environmental licence* [...] *would have been an uphill task*.\"584 Colombia's assertion is also inconsistent with the fact that Colombia created the Vetas-California Mining District less than two years before Concession 3452 was executed, the purpose of which was to develop the mining industry there by *\"increasing the participation of mining investors* [...] *both junior and development companies, as well as conglomerates and traditional mining companies to attract technical resources and national and foreign capital to the sector.*\"585\n\nDecree No. 1220 of 2005 (21 April 2005) (**Exhibit C-97**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 133.\n\nMinistry of Mines and Energy, Presentation (1 December 2008) (**Exhibit C-115**) (as cited in Claimant's Reply, para. 119).\n\n556.\n\nResolution 2090 did not *\"confirm\"* the 2007 Atlas delimitation. Firstly, Ms. Baptiste confirmed that to delineate the p\u00e1ramos required the IAvH to prepare a new set of criteria and an adequate methodology586 and, further, the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delineated at a 1:25,000 scale by the IAvH is approximately 56% larger than the total area identified in the 2007 Atlas and the total p\u00e1ramo area in Colombia under the 2012 Atlas was 47% larger than that in the 2007 Atlas.587 Indeed, the IAvH commented that regional environmental authorities used their own information with regard to the location of the p\u00e1ramos rather than using the 2007 Atlas588 and therefore Colombia is incorrect to say the 2007 Atlas was a *\"widely accepted\"* source of information on p\u00e1ramos.\n\nFirst Baptiste Statement, paras. 43 and 45.\n\nIAvH, \"Forest-P\u00e1ramo Transition.

The denial was on the basis of certain technical concerns and not on the basis of Law 1382. Whilst MinAmbiente Order 1241 of 20 April 20 1 0589 (ordering the return of Eco Oro's application) required the new EIA to take the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo into consideration as an area excluded from mining activities (pursuant to Law 1382 which was found to be unconstitutional), this Order was revoked pursuant to Eco Oro's successful appeal with the effect that no mining ban was enforced pursuant to Law 1382.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Order No. 1241 (20 April 2010) (**Exhibit R-14**).\n\n558.\n\nBy Resolution 1015 of 31 May 2011, MinAmbiente denied Eco Oro's application for an open-pit licence application590 (thereby denying Eco Oro's request to withdraw its open-pit licence application having decided instead to revert to an underground project) on the basis of the environmental impact of an open-pit mine pursuant to a 127-page analysis.591 Such a detailed analysis would not have been required had there been a mining ban pursuant to Law 1382.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 1015 (31 May 2011) (**Exhibit R-16 / R-71**), Arts. 1 and 2.\n\nFirst Sarmiento Statement, para. 24; and Ministry of Environment, Resolution No. 1015 (31 May 2011) (**Exhibit R-16 / R-71**), p. 117.\n\n559.\n\nThe purpose of appealing Resolution 1015 was only to seek certain clarifications regarding the implications of this decision for Eco Oro's future activities. The result of the appeal was Resolution 35 from ANLA (which had newly been created and the Director General of which was Ms. Sarmiento). This clarified that the decision was *\"purely technical, and never took into consideration any legal grounds.*\"592 Therefore, it was not based on Law 1382. It further confirmed there had been no reliance on the 2007 Atlas which was too imprecise to be used as a reference,593 the p\u00e1ramo delineation and regulation of land use within the p\u00e1ramo had yet to be carried out,594 and Resolution 1015 had not declared a mining exclusion ban over the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem.595 It ordered that the text of Resolution 1015 be amended to include the following: *\"Likewise, it is important to note that this Ministry is competent to determine whether or not the project in question is environmentally viable, on the basis of the applicable technical and legal considerations* [...] *and not to determine, in light of the evidence of a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, its limits and land use* [...] *which is under the direct purview of the regional environmental authority with jurisdiction over the said ecosystem.*\"596\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 35 (31 October 2011) (**Exhibit C-290**), p. 35.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 35 (31 October 2011) (**Exhibit C-290**), pp. 30 and 40.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 35 (31 October 2011) (**Exhibit C-290**), p. 48.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 35 (31 October 2011) (**Exhibit C-290**), p. 28.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 35 (31 October 2011) (**Exhibit C-290**), p. 48 (as cited in Claimant's Reply, para. 148).\n\n560.\n\nEco Oro could not have been expected to understand from this that an application for an underground mine would be rejected: there was no general mining ban based on Laws 1382 and 1450; Resolution 1015 was specific to the open pit mine; and the environmental impact of the underground mine would be significantly reduced. Indeed, Eco Oro's request for Terms of Reference for the underground mine was granted with no reference to any mining ban but simply a reference to the fact that the EIA should be prepared following the terms of reference and provisions of Decree 2820 of 5 August 2010 (which regulated the granting of environmental licences for mining projects in p\u00e1ramo areas) and that Eco Oro should take into account the fact the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was in the process of being delimited. This latter statement merely required Eco Oro to consider the nature of the ecosystems delimited within Concession 3452 in setting out its environmental mitigation measures in its EIA.\n\n561.\n\nThe ANM further did not apply a mining ban based on Law 1450. Eco Oro successfully appealed Resolution VSC 2 dated 8 August 2012,597 which had only granted Eco Oro's request for a two-year extension of the exploration phase in respect of the non-overlapping areas of the Concession, pursuant to Law 1450. Thus, Resolution VSC 2 had provided for a permanent deprivation of Eco Oro's rights in relation to the overlapping area. Resolution VSC 4 revoked Resolution VSC 2, acknowledging that the requirements for the application of a mining exclusion zone pursuant to Law 1450 had not been fulfilled,598 thereby extending the exploration phase for a two-year period over the entire Concession area. Resolution VSC 2 further temporarily suspended activities in the overlapping area *\"until the Ministry of Environment* [...] *issues the final delimitation at a 1:25,000 scale.*\"599The effect of this is that it cannot be said that Eco Oro should have realised that the 1:25,000 scale delimitation would extend to no less an area than the 2007 Atlas given that the 2007 Atlas was to apply as a *\"minimum reference\"* per Law 1450. If that were correct, Resolution VSC 4 would not have extended the exploration phase for a two-year period over the entire Concession area, knowing that the overlapping area would have come within a subsequent delimitation on a 1:25,000 scale. Instead, Resolution VSC 4 acknowledged that, until the final delimitation was carried out, the legal status of the overlapping area was \"*uncertain*\" and it was \"*impossible to confirm*\" whether there was any overlapping area. 600\n\nANM, Resolution VSC No. 2 (8 August 2012) (**Exhibit R-72**).\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution VSC-4 (12 September 2012) (**Exhibit C-25**).\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution VSC-4 (12 September 2012) (**Exhibit C-25**), Art. 1.\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution VSC-4 (12 September 2012) (**Exhibit C-25**), Art. 1.\n\n562.\n\nResolution VSC 4 shows that Law 1450 could not create a mining ban until the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo had been delimited in accordance with the requirements contained therein and that the temporary suspension ordered was exactly that, temporary, lasting only until the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo was published.\n\n563.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that Colombia supported the Project and induced Eco Oro to continue to invest in it by nominating it both as a PIN and a PINE in recognition of its \"*high impact on the economic and social growth of Colombia* [...]\",601 which designation gave the Project special government support to ensure such projects happen (as royalties were needed for development). 602 It is unrealistic to suggest that Colombia would have done this had it known that this Angostura Project had no prospect of being developed due to a ban on mining in the p\u00e1ramos. There were several other examples of Governmental support in 2015 and early 2016, including comfort provided by President Santos with respect to the licensing process for the Project.603\n\nMinistry of Mines website, \"Proyectos de Inter\u00e9s Nacional y Estrat\u00e9gico PINE\" (Undated) (**Exhibit C-439**).\n\nArticle The Northern Miner \"PDAC 2015: Mines Minister says Colombia is picking up the pace\" (25 March 2015) (**Exhibit C-222**), p. 2.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 184.\n\n*(v) Colombia's Measures were arbitrary, capricious and disproportionate*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n564.\n\nThe above also demonstrates that Colombia's measures were arbitrary, capricious and disproportionate. The FTA itself requires, as part of the objects of the Treaty, to ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment. Colombia should have conducted itself \"*in a coherent manner, without ambiguity, transparently and maintaining an environment that is sufficiently stable to permit a reasonably diligent investor to adopt a commercial strategy that it can implement over time.*\"604 Colombia's measures failed to do this, resulting in a non-transparent and unpredictable regulatory environment. Pursuant to the definition endorsed by the tribunal in *EDF v. Romania,* arbitrariness occurs where \"*a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference\", \"a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker\"* or \"*a measure* [is] *taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.*\"605 Further to be reasonable it must be proportionate to the public interest to be protected, i.e., to the policy objective sought, which policy must be rational.606 As stated by the *Tecmed* tribunal, in order to determine if measures were expropriatory, they considered \"*whether such actions or measures are proportional to the public interest presumably protected thereby and to the protection legally granted to investments, taking into account that the significance of such impact has a key role upon deciding the proportionality.* [...] *There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the charge or weight imposed to the foreign investor and the aim sought to be realised by any expropriatory measure. To value such charge or weight, it is very important to measure the size of the ownership deprivation caused by the actions of the state and whether such deprivation was compensated or not.*\"607 The European Court of Human Rights followed the same approach noting that \"*there must also be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised* [...].\"608 Other tribunals to take the same approach include those in *LG &E v. Argentina* which noted that a State measure would be disproportionately severe if it resulted in a *\"permanent, severe deprivation of* [the investor's] *rights with regard to its investment, or almost complete deprivation of the value of* [the investor's] *investment*.\"609 Eco Oro submits that the effect of Colombia's measures was exactly that: a severe and substantial deprivation of the value of its investment.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 495; *L.E.S.I.

No documents have been disclosed showing how social-economic criteria were factored into the Resolution 2090 delimitation notwithstanding the legal requirement that the delimitation be undertaken on the basis of technical, environmental, social and economic studies.\n\n566.\n\nMs. Baptiste describes the methodology for preparing proposals for the delimitation of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems in her witness statement by reference to a document titled the \"Forest P\u00e1ramo Transition\" publication,610 which she describes as \"*a reference for understanding the preparation of the biotic technical inputs used as a basis for the issuance by the [IAvH] of recommendations aimed at the delineation of p\u00e1ramos in the country\"* The methodology contained therein required the identification of the Transition Zone, based on statistical models populated with data obtained through, *inter alia*, data gathered in field studies and the accuracy of the modelling results would also be verified using field data studies. There was a detailed protocol for these field studies, consisting of 60 pages. Colombia further confirmed that the probabilistic models were supplemented and corrected to the extent necessary with targeted field studies. However, Colombia has confirmed that no field studies were undertaken for the purpose of the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. Colombia's assertion that the actual methodology was set out in the Contributions Document and not the Forest-P\u00e1ramo Transition Document cannot be correct as the Contributions Document merely sets out the P\u00e1ramo delimitation proposal and not its actual methodology.\n\nIAvH, \"Forest-P\u00e1ramo Transition. Conceptual Basis and Methods for its Identification in the Colombian Andes\" (2015) (**Exhibit R-123**).\n\n567.\n\nColombia says that targeted field studies would have been redundant because it used existing field records and secondary information to build the distribution models but again this cannot be right. The IAvH itself states, in a report dated 2013, that \"[t]*he extension of this* [ecotone or transition] *strip requires further verification with fieldwork, which will be the subject of subsequent phases, with greater levels of cartographic detail (1:25,000)*.\"611\n\nIAvH, \"Contributions to the strategic conservation of the Colombian p\u00e1ramos: Updating the mapping of the p\u00e1ramo complexes to a scale of 1:100,000\" (6 February 2014) (**Exhibit C-200**).\n\n568.\n\nFinally, Colombia justifies itself by saying it did not have the financial and logistical resources to carry out fieldwork but this cannot be correct as, at the same time it was delimiting other p\u00e1ramos, such as the Pisba p\u00e1ramo, using extensive field studies. Even were it to have been correct, given that the Angostura Deposit consisted of just 0.1% of the delimited p\u00e1ramo,612 field studies could have been undertaken in that area. Alternatively, the ECODES Report could have been adopted which was prepared by over 50 professionals along transects from over 165 sites within and outside the Angostura Deposit and which concluded there was no p\u00e1ramo within the area comprising the Angostura deposit. Instead of using this however the IAvH relied upon historic databases, with no indication as to how the data was collected, together with a field study conducted as a part of a different study by a single undergraduate biology student who only visited seven plotted sites, and which was not carried out along transects and did not meet the requirements set out in the Forest P\u00e1ramo Transition document. Additionally, the closest sample was taken 10 kilometers away from the Angostura Deposit. The IAvH also failed to use any field data to verify its results, notwithstanding that Annex 8 to the Contributions Document noted that evaluation and validation would be undertaken with field data as well as satellite images from the technical delimitation proposal.613\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, whilst in para. 26 of his first witness statement, Mr. Moseley-Williams refers to the percentage overlap as being 0.09%, in certain instances in Eco Oro's memorials (e.g., paras. 164, 199, 240 of Claimant's Reply) the reference is rounded up to 0.1%. The Tribunal does not find anything turns on this.\n\nColombia confirmed that Annex 8 only used satellite images and not field studies, the reference to \"*field studies*\" in the title being an \"*oversight*\" by IAvH \u2013 see Letter from Latham & Watkins to Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (28 May 2019) (**Exhibit C-431**).\n\n569.\n\nIn addition, what was delimited was not the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem but the Transition Zone between the High Andean forest and the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. Had the IAvH used the upper limit of the Transition Zone almost the entirety of the Angostura Deposit would have remained outside the delimited zone.614 Further, the IAvH didn't even follow the Transition Zone boundary but instead simply followed the altitudinal contour lines, in particular the 3100 masl line, most often near the lower limit of the Transition Zone but sometimes significantly deviating to include areas neither in the p\u00e1ramo nor the Transition Zone and, in the case of Concession 3452, it just follows an altitudinal line such that only 50% of the area of the 2090 Delimitation corresponds to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. MinAmbiente did not scrutinise the IAvH's proposed delineation and it has been at least twice criticised by the Constitutional Court for lacking in adequate scientific criteria in certain respects615 and for MinAmbiente's failure to properly conduct the required consultation process. It also took note of MinAmbiente's concession that serious errors were made in the delimitation process.616\n\nBy including the transition zone, the overlap with the Angostura Deposit increased from 6% to 60%.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**).\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (**Exhibit C-244**), p. 261.\n\n570.\n\nImplementation of the Resolution 2090 delimitation was also disproportionate to the legitimate interest in protecting it: the aim was to delineate on a scale of 1:25,000 based on technical, economic, social and environmental studies but instead, it employed excessive means in delimiting not the p\u00e1ramo but a different ecosystem which included not just the Transition Zone but in certain places, even areas below it. This particularly affected Eco Oro. The Angostura deposit overlapped with only 0.09% of the total delimited area, only approximately 6% of the Angostura deposit lies within the actual p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, with 65.11% lying within the Transition Zone, the remaining 29% is neither in the p\u00e1ramo nor the Transition Zone. Less stringent measures could have been taken such as delimiting the p\u00e1ramo based on the location of the ecosystem as instructed by Law 1450, employing field studies, or using the ECODES Report and allowing Eco Oro to present its project to the environmental licensing authorities. The precautionary principle does not assist Colombia as it is not applicable as there is no existing threat of serious or irreversible harm -the mere existence of a potential risk is insufficient to permit Colombia to invoke the precautionary principle.\n\n571.\n\nFinally, as Eco Oro had decided to mine using underground operations, the impact on the environment would have been minimised and the Government could have taken more circumscribed measures to protect the p\u00e1ramo.\n\n572.\n\nIn conclusion, the IAvH did not follow its own methodology (which placed heavy emphasis on conducting field studies to verify the results of probabilistic modelling) as it failed to conduct the required field studies and sampling.617 Whilst Ms. Baptiste said this would have been \"*inappropriate*\" and not \"*practicable*\", it was what the IAvH's own methodology required and this methodology was followed when delineating another p\u00e1ramo system in 2013.\n\nIAvH, \"Contributions to the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo\" (2014) (**Exhibit C-194**), pp. 37-38.\n\n573.\n\nHowever, not only was the delimitation carried out in breach of the legal requirements, it was also carried out in bad faith and in a non-transparent manner, as evidenced by the significant delays in the Minister of Environment, Ms. Sarmiento, publishing the delimitation which the Constitutional Court found (Judgement T-361) to have been in *\"bad faith.\"* The Constitutional Court further criticised MinAmbiente's actions finding that they \"*violated the right to environmental participation of the petitioners and the entire community of the area of influence of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo in issuing Resolution No. 2090\",* denied access to information, failed to involve all parties affected by the delimitation to participate in the consultation exercise but instead specified the number of people to be invited even identifying the representative group from which they should be invited and failed to ensure \"*prior, efficacious and effective forums*\" for community participation.618 Indeed the Minister even gave an interview in which she promised that the p\u00e1ramo boundary would shortly be published, yet notwithstanding that she withheld the boundaries, she announced publicly that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo overlapped with Concession 3452.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (**Exhibit C-244**).\n\n574.\n\nColombia has not produced the ANM's proposed p\u00e1ramo delimitation and memorandum summarising the reasons for its proposal, notwithstanding that Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code requires the ANM's collaboration. Eco Oro requests that the Tribunal draws an adverse inference from Colombia's failure to produce this.\n\n575.\n\nFinally, the community consultations did not happen as referred to by the Constitutional Court when striking down Resolution 2090.\n\n*(vi) There was no transparent or predictable regulatory environment*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n576.\n\nEco Oro was also subjected to a regulatory turmoil as a result of:\n\na. MinAmbiente announcing in late 2013 that the delimitation had been finalised but then refusing to provide the co-ordinates (provoking a letter from the Attorney General to MinMinas, MinAmbiente and the ANM deploring the legal uncertainty this caused to the mining industry619);\n\nb. the Resolution 2090 delimitation;\n\nc. Resolution VSC 3;\n\nd. whilst Article 5 of Resolution 2090 provided that regional environmental authorities such as the CDMB should issue more detailed environmental guidelines and PMAs for the p\u00e1ramos in their localities, this has yet to be done by the CDMB for the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo;\n\ne. Law 1753 (it is unclear how mining activities could be prohibited in practice for grandfathered projects (pursuant to Article 173, paragraph 1) if damage to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem could not be avoided given that the CDMB has not issued the requisite environmental guidelines);\n\nf. Judgment C-35 only striking down the grandfathering exceptions in Law 1753 but not those in Resolution 2090 leading the Minister of Mines and Energy to say *\"we have been left in a very serious situation: there are so many norms and we do not know what the rule is.\";*620\n\ng. the inconsistent decisions and communications from MinAmbiente and ANM;\n\nh. the ANM's declaration on 8 August 2016 that Eco Oro was prohibited from mining in the Preservation Zone but with no reference to the Restoration Zone;\n\ni. Resolution VSC 906;\n\nj. Judgment T-361;\n\nk. the initial extension to file a PTO until the new delimitation was complete followed by the failure to agree a concomitant extension when the period for completing the delimitation was extended;\n\nl. Resolution VSC 906 (rejecting Eco Oro's request for a further suspension) and requiring preparation of the PTO which, pursuant to the 2001 Mining Code, required identification of the *\"definitive delimitation of the exploitation area\"* yet in the absence of final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo this was impossible. It should be noted that Resolution VSC 906 was predicated on the basis Judgment C-35 was foreseeable but Eco Oro could not have planned for the risk a legislative act would be struck down as unconstitutional. It was also arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory because firstly, the ANM had approved a suspension request for a different mining company that had requested a suspension on the same basis621 and, secondly, two weeks earlier the ANM had granted Eco Oro the same suspension request on the grounds of *\"unforeseeab*[ility]\" which had been made on the same grounds but for a different concession area (Concession 22346);\n\nm. ANM Resolution VSC 343 rejecting Eco Oro's appeal was arbitrary and unreasonable and nonsensical given that Judgement T-361 required the re-delimitation of the 2090 Delimitation;\n\nn. ANM's letter dated 24 December 2018 refusing to grant an extension for filing the PTO was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable in refusing to grant a concomitant extension for filing the PTO as was given for MinAmbiente to complete the re- delimitation; and\n\no. ANM Resolution VSC 41 ordering Eco Oro to submit its PTO within 30 days which was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable given the ANM was aware that this was impossible for Eco Oro to achieve.\n\nLetter from Attorney General (Mr. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez Maldonado) to Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Mines and National Mining Agency (9 September 2013) (**Exhibit C-28**), p. 4.\n\nArticle El Mundo \"Sector minero crece pese a la amenaza de la inseguridad jur\u00eddica\" (11 May 2017) (**Exhibit C-243**).\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution GSC 239 (5 August 2016) (**Exhibit C-396**).\n\n577.\n\nIn conclusion, Colombia's measures were not implemented in good faith as demonstrated by the following:\n\na. The act of delineating areas of Concession 3452 as being within the p\u00e1ramo without conducting any supporting field study was arbitrary and non-transparent;\n\nb. The withholding by MinAmbiente of the coordinates of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo for many months was, as described by the Constitutional Court, bad faith;\n\nc. MinAmbiente's failure both to consult with all potentially affected parties and to allow them to participate meaningfully in the delineation process;\n\nd. The various inconsistent, unresponsive and confusing communications from the ANM;\n\ne. The ANM's refusal to suspend Eco Oro's obligations until the uncertainty ended;\n\nf. The admission by MinAmbiente that the delineation in Resolution 2090 was deeply flawed and required correction, as endorsed by the Constitutional Court; and\n\ng. The Government's failure to prevent illegal miners using mining and processing methods that pose a threat to the environment compared with professional miners such as Eco Oro demonstrates a failure to implement its policies in a consistent and coherent manner.\n\n578.\n\nThus, the day before Resolution 2090 was published, Eco Oro's Treaty-protected rights arising out of Concession 3452 and its regulatory framework consisted of: *(i)* the exclusive right to explore and exploit mineral resources in the entirety of the concession area; *(ii)* the right to a stabilised mining legal framework such that only those new, more favourable mining laws enacted after the execution of Concession 3452 in February 2007 would apply to its concession; and *(iii)* the right to renew the Concession for an additional 30 years upon fulfilling the requisite conditions.\n\n579.\n\nHaving demonstrated that Colombia's measures do not fall within the 811(2)(b) Exceptions and are compensable, it is also clear that taking into account the factors in Annex 811(2)(a), that there has been an indirect expropriation. Concession 3452 is valueless and thus the economic effect is equivalent to direct expropriation.\n\n580.\n\nAs no compensation has been offered, this expropriation is unlawful. Accordingly, Eco Oro seeks compensation and it elects the valuation date to be the date of the expropriation.\n\n***(b) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n*(i) The FTA Establishes the Primacy of Environmental Protection Over Trade and Investment*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nFor Eco Oro to succeed it must show *(i)* that its mining rights were not curtailed by the mining ban established by Law 1382 because it had grandfathered rights and *(ii)* that its rights were not curtailed by the mining ban established by Law 1450 because it did not become effective until the issuance of Resolution 2090. Eco Oro cannot demonstrate either of these.\n\n582.\n\nEco Oro did not have grandfathered rights under Law 1382, Resolution 2090 or Law 1450 because grandfathering was only available to concessions which had already reached the construction or exploitation phase. This can be seen from the wording of the relevant provisions. Starting with Resolution 2090, it is undisputed Eco Oro did not have an environmental license, but neither was it in possession of \"*the equivalent environmental control and management instrument duly granted before 9 February 2010.*\"622 The key word is \"*equivalent*\", namely equivalent to an environmental license. To be the equivalent of the environmental licence it must have an equivalent effect to that of an environmental license, namely the right to exploit. Eco Oro's PMA is not equivalent to an environmental license. The only PMA that was approved was dated in 1997 which was before Eco Oro had acquired all the titles which comprised Concession 3452. It did not permit exploitation but was expressly limited to the exploration phase and on its face stated that the relevant environmental license would need to be obtained to undertake exploitation activities. It only covered an area of 250 hectares whereas Concession 3452 comprised more than 5,000 hectares and its scope was very limited in terms of the work it covered, being only in relation to some roads and tunnels. Whilst Eco Oro provided an updated PMA in 2008 (notably again only in relation to exploration activities), it was also not approved. It should be noted that the 1997 PMA provided that any planned modifications had to be reviewed and approved. Further, at the time both the 1997 and 2008 PMAs were prepared, they were both in respect of the proposed open cast mine; they did not contemplate the underground mine.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 2090 of 2014 (19 December 2014) (**Exhibits C-34 / MR-35**).\n\n583.\n\nThe PMA was therefore not equivalent to an Environmental Licence and consequently Eco Oro did not benefit from the grandfathering provision. It is also of note that Eco Oro did not argue that its rights were grandfathered at the relevant time and, when ANM issued Resolution VSC 2 reducing Eco Oro's concession area, it expressly noted that the transition regime did not apply, yet when Eco Oro appealed this decision, Eco Oro did not explicitly assert that its rights were grandfathered.\n\n584.\n\nTurning to the construction of the FTA, on a good faith reading of Chapters Eight, Seventeen (particularly Article 1702) and Twenty-Two (particularly Article 2201(3)) the primacy of environmental protection over trade and investment is clear. This is confirmed by the Government of Canada which stated that the FTA *\"allow\\s] the countries to take certain measures to protect human, animal and plant life or health which may be inconsistent with trade or investment obligations.*\"623 In the absence of arbitrariness, unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, a State cannot be held liable for adopting measures to protect the environment unfettered from any obligation to compensate investors. Whilst the preamble to the FTA does refer to the objective of ensuring a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment, it is notable that this is to be done only in a manner that is consistent with environmental protection and conservation, as stated in Chapter Seventeen and the Canada-Colombia Environment Agreement (the \"**Environment Agreement**\")624 which was intended to be complementary and *closely interrelated with the FTA pursuant to Article 1704(1) and is indeed expressly referred* to in the Article 1703 of the FTA. The statement of the Government of Canada must also be taken into consideration, providing: \"[t]*he Environment Agreement, signed in parallel to the* [FTA]*, reinforces the concept that free trade should not take place at the expense of the environment.\"**625* This deliberate policy decision must inform the interpretation of Chapter Eight.\n\nGovernment of Canada, Information on the Canada-Colombia Environment Agreement (Undated) (**Exhibit R- 154**).\n\nCanada-Colombia Environment Agreement (signed on 21 November 2008 and in force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit R-138**).\n\nGovernment of Canada, Information on the Canada-Colombia Environment Agreement (Undated) (**Exhibit R- 154**).\n\n*(ii) Colombia Did Not Expropriate Eco Oro's Investment*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n585.\n\nAs well as not having a covered investment (as Eco Oro had no acquired right to exploit), the measures complained of by Eco Oro did not have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation as there was no deprivation. Colombia had reserved to itself the right to designate Mining Exclusion Zones by Articles 34 and 36 of the 2001 Mining Code. This right is a contractual right, the exercise of which cannot constitute deprivation. Thus, up to the point at which Eco Oro acquired rights to exploit (which it never acquired) Colombia had the right to make that designation and remove areas from Concession 3452, the exercise of which could not constitute a violation of international law. Even if it were found to be a deprivation, it occurred pursuant to VSC 2 and 4 of August and September 2012 and therefore it occurred prior to the mandatory cut-off date.\n\n586.\n\nFurther, the measures did not affect the totality of the concession area, indeed over a third of the Angostura Deposit remained unaffected such that substantial value in concession 3452 remained unadulterated. Eco Oro's loss was partial and therefore not expropriatory. Whilst Mr. Moseley-Williams asserted that the uncertainty over the remaining areas of Concession 3452 *\"made developing plans impossible\",*626 this was unsupported and, in any event, Eco Oro was not prevented from carrying out mining in those areas of the concession which did not overlap the p\u00e1ramo -it just had to comply with the applicable requirements. The possibility of Eco Oro obtaining a license but for Colombia's measures was remote at best given the lack of any evidence adduced (other than the bare assertions in Mr. Moseley-Williams' statement) as to the technical, economic or environmental feasibility of such a project. Indeed, it is \"*overwhelmingly likely*\" that any mining project would have been rejected in light of the precautionary principle which must be complied with by public agencies when assessing environmental impact and taking licensing decisions.627\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 260, citing First Moseley-Williams Statement, paras. 59, 65-69.\n\nMinister Sarmiento Statement, para. 24; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 325.\n\n587.\n\nTurning to the first stated factor in Annex 811(2)(a), there was no economic impact from the measures complained of by Eco Oro. Firstly, on 26 April 2010 Eco Oro's share price collapsed by more than half when its open cast mining licence application was rejected (from $463 million on Friday 23 April to $220 million on Monday 26 April 2010) and then dropping very significantly when Law 1382 was applied to Concession 3452 by Resolution VSC 4, in September 2012, with the entire enterprise value falling to below $20 million. This was all before the measures complained of. Any economic impact of the alleged expropriatory measures would be demonstrated by a significant fall in Eco Oro's share price but there was no significant deterioration in the share price at the time of or after the measures complained of - that drop had already occurred, as a result of Laws 1382 and 1450 and Resolution 937. Additionally, the 2090 Atlas did not significantly increase the area which had already been delimited as p\u00e1ramo by the 2007 Atlas.\n\n588.\n\nTurning to the second factor, it is important to note that this does not direct the analysis towards a frustration or violation of legitimate expectations; the provision is narrower, referring to the extent to which there is interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations. A reasonable investment-backed expectation is one held at the time of making the investment, it causes the investor to make the investment, and there is clearly an obligation on the investor to undertake due diligence both before making the investment and before making further investments.\n\n589.\n\nEco Oro cannot have had any distinct reasonable investment-backed expectations that it would have been permitted to undertake exploitation activities in the p\u00e1ramo.\n\n590.\n\nColombia did not give Eco Oro any specific assurance that measures would not be taken to protect the p\u00e1ramo within Concession 3452 and Eco Oro could not have held any reasonable investment-backed expectation that it would be permitted to mine in the entirety of Concession 3452. Such a belief could not have survived even basic due diligence. No commitments were given to Eco Oro, nor is there any evidence that Eco Oro made its investment in reliance upon any such commitment. No stabilization agreement was entered into and, by entering into Concession 3452, Eco Oro voluntarily subjected itself to the regime provided for under the 2001 Mining Code; it is irrelevant whether any previous regime did contain such a guarantee. The 2001 Mining Code and applicable legislation at that time did not contain any guarantees that measures would not be taken to protect the environment from the effects of mining exploitation. It merely confirmed that the laws applicable to the concession are the *\"mining laws in force at the time that the concession contract is perfected.*\"628\n\nLaw No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Art. 46.\n\n591.\n\nThe environmental legislation in force in 2007 restricted Eco Oro's ability to proceed with the Angostura Project due to the requirement to obtain an environmental licence before undertaking mining activities. Indeed, had Eco Oro undertaken even basic due diligence prior to investing in Concession 3452 it would have realised that mining would be prohibited as a significant portion of the area overlapped with p\u00e1ramo and Colombia had a long-standing policy to protect the p\u00e1ramo which is demonstrated by:\n\na. Article 4 of the General Environmental Law which designated p\u00e1ramos as ecosystems subject to *\"special protection\"* as a general environmental principle and Article 1 refers to the Rio Principles, Principle 15 of which provides for the application of the precautionary principle which principle is directly enshrined into Colombian law by Article 1.6 of the General Environmental Law. Eco Oro must have known at the time it entered into the concession that the prospect of obtaining an environmental licence for a project located in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem was very limited if non-existent.\n\nb. Resolution No. 769 of 2002, pursuant to which CDMB and CORPONOR had engaged in significant efforts to delineate the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, assess its condition and take steps to protect it.\n\nc. The 2007 Atlas which confirmed that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo overlapped a part of Concession 3452.\n\nd. Eco Oro should further have been aware of the authorities' approach to licensing applications pursuant to the precautionary principle (Colombia's environmental authorities have never granted licences for projects adversely impacting p\u00e1ramo ecosystems) and could not have had any reasonable expectation that the authorities would derogate from this principle.\n\n592.\n\nEco Oro's legitimate expectations could not have been frustrated by Judgment C-35 because Eco Oro had no grandfathered rights. The ANM's August 2016 decision was fully in line with the then existing legislation to protect the p\u00e1ramo, including Laws 1382 and 1450. Eco Oro has not adduced any credible evidence that the statements it asserts were made by CDMB and MinAmbiente were in fact made and, even if they had been made, they could not have frustrated Eco Oro's legitimate expectations as they were not made by the authority responsible for the licensing of Eco Oro's project, namely ANLA.\n\n593.\n\nEven had Eco Oro had legitimate expectations that Colombia would take measures to protect the p\u00e1ramo in a way that would prevent it from mining in the entirety of the concession area, as the facts upon which Eco Oro says it based its expectations all took place before the entry into force of the FTA, those facts are not binding on Colombia (Article 801(2)). Eco Oro knew by August 2011 that Colombia had decided to take measures to ban mining in the p\u00e1ramo areas delineated in the 2007 Atlas; this is why its application for an environmental licence for an open pit mine failed. It knew that even though the 2007 Atlas delineation was not definitive, mining in a significant part of its concession area would not be possible.\n\n594.\n\nIt knew open-cast mining would not be permitted (its application for a mining licence for this had been rejected) and there can be no violation of legitimate expectations where a State is just exercising an expressly reserved right.\n\n595.\n\nEco Oro would have been required to satisfy itself that the basis for its expectations were reasonable and accurate and yet it has adduced no evidence of having undertaken such due diligence. It was no secret that Colombia was seeking to protect the p\u00e1ramo in accordance with its international obligations so to do. Eco Oro could not have had any legitimate expectation that that right would not have been exercised. Eco Oro must have been aware that Colombia had been taking steps to protect the p\u00e1ramo \"*in the strongest possible way*\"629 and indeed by the time Concession 3452 took legal force upon registration, 54% of the Concession 3452 area had been designated as p\u00e1ramo pursuant to the 2007 Atlas. Eco Oro has adduced no evidence of any due diligence having been carried out in relation to this investment.\n\nTr. Day 2 (Mr. Pape), 374:15-18.\n\n596.\n\nThe *Bilcon* case is not applicable as, in that case, the concessionaire had already applied for an environmental licence (which was rejected forming the basis of the alleged deprivation) and in the relevant Treaty there was no express reservation of a right by the State to revoke part of the contractual entitlement of the concessionaire.\n\n597.\n\nIn summary, Eco Oro could not have formed any legitimate expectations that it would be permitted to conduct mining exploitation activities throughout Concession 3452 notwithstanding the existence of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems.\n\n598.\n\nThe third listed factor is equally of no avail to Eco Oro. The measures were regulatory measures taken pursuant to Colombia's long-standing policy to protect the p\u00e1ramo, resulting from the Ramsar Convention, the Biodiversity Convention and the laws Colombia implemented to give effect to these obligations. The measures were all *bona fide*, regulatory and non-discriminatory.\n\n599.\n\nOnly if the Tribunal finds a *prima facie* case for indirect expropriation can it then turn to apply Annex 811(2)(b). It is therefore not necessary to consider the meaning and application of Annex 811(2)(b) as Eco Oro doesn't succeed in showing that having investigated the facts surrounding Eco Oro's claim, considering the relevant factors, that it suffered deprivation of its rights.\n\n600.\n\nHowever, even if Annex 811(2)(b) were relevant, Colombia's measures fall squarely within its ambit. Eco Oro has not established any \"*rare*\" circumstances supporting a finding that Colombia's non-discriminatory regulatory measures for the protection of the environment could amount to an indirect expropriation under the FTA.\n\n601.\n\nWhilst Annex 811(2)(b) is the embodiment of the police powers doctrine, it clearly applies to the measures complained of as they were taken to protect the environment and were *bona fide* and not discriminatory (as accepted by Eco Oro); p*rima facie* it must be common ground that the measures cannot constitute indirect expropriation. It is clear from *(i)* the object and purpose of the FTA; *(ii)* Canada and Colombia's mutual undertakings contained in Article 1702; and *(iii)* the provisions of the Environment Agreement, that non-discriminatory measures designed and applied to protect the environment would only constitute indirect expropriation in *\"rare circumstances.\"* This is a high bar given the example contained in the provision, namely \"*a measure or series of measures so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith*\" and Eco Oro has failed to meet it, having identified no circumstances that it can identify as *\"rare.\"* The delineation was conducted *\"responsibly, carefully, eminently reasonably, in accordance with the methodology adopted by the IAVH at the time, in accordance with the* [...] *long standing legal definition of the p\u00e1ramo*\"630 such that no rare circumstances arise; the measures Colombia took were a legitimate exercise of its sovereign powers to protect the environment and no compensation is payable even if Eco Oro has suffered loss. As confirmed by the tribunal in *Tecmed,* it is *\"undisputable\"* that \"*the State's exercise of its sovereign powers within the framework of its police power may cause economic damage to those subject to its power as administrator without entitling them to any compensation whatsoever*.\"631 Colombia's measures were taken pursuant to its legitimate right to regulate and were not expropriatory measures.\n\nTr. Day 2 (Mr. Pape), 381:5-12.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 374 *et seq.*; *Tecmed*, Award (29 May 2003) (**Exhibits CL-22 / RL-61**), para. 119. See also *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v.

The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award (17 March 2006) (**Exhibit RL-71**), para. 255.\n\n*(iii) Legitimate expectations*\n-------------------------------\n\n602.\n\nIt is incorrect that Annex 811(2)(b) incorporates the requirement that measures must be undertaken in good faith bringing in notions such as legitimate expectations, proportionality and transparency. Just because frustration of legitimate expectations is an exception to the police powers doctrine, does not mean it must equally be an exception to Annex 811(2)(b). Whilst Annex 811(2)(b) embodies the police powers doctrine, it is a *lex specialis,* is unambiguous and goes beyond the police powers doctrine to give effect to the contracting parties' agreed intended subordination of investment protection to environmental concerns. The concept of interference with expectations comes into Annex 811(2)(a) and it would be nonsensical if, having addressed this in considering whether there is *prima facie* an indirect expropriation that one was then directed to reconsider exactly the same notion in considering whether the measure is excepted as being a *\"rare circumstance.\"* This would be *\"importing through the backdoor all of the broad notions of the fair and equitable treatment standard which form part of* [...] *the notion of good faith* [...].\"632 Annex 811(2)(b) specifically is addressed at rare circumstances and so the provision must be construed narrowly.\n\nTr. Day 2 (Mr. Pape), 370:20-371:3.\n\n603.\n\nHowever even if the frustration of legitimate expectations were covered by Annex 811(2)(b), Colombia's measures could not have frustrated Eco Oro's legitimate expectations as it had none (whether or not investment backed) as detailed above.\n\n*(iv) Colombia's Measures were not arbitrary, capricious nor disproportionate*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n604.\n\nA requirement of proportionality, lack of capriciousness and non-arbitrariness is also not enshrined in the text of the provision and the authorities cited by Eco Oro are of no assistance as Annex 811(2)(b) is *lex specialis.* Annex 811 does not refer to *\"bad faith\"* as a general exception, the requirement is for good faith which is not akin to fair and equitable treatment, and thus does not import requirements such as \"*fairness*\", \"*transparency*\", \"[non]*arbitrariness*\", *\"clarity\", \"[non]ambiguity\"* and *\"predictab*[ility].\" The FTA only provides for the more limited minimum standard of treatment in accordance with customary international law. Even were the requirement of good faith contained within the FTA, it carries a high burden which Eco Oro has failed to meet. Each of Colombia's measures was taken for the sole purpose of protecting the p\u00e1ramo.\n\n605.\n\nEven again if that were not so, Colombia's actions were proportionate; there were no less stringent actions which it could have taken to protect the p\u00e1ramo. The fact that the overlapping area is small does not make it proportionate to allow mining activities which could be damaging to the p\u00e1ramo in that area. Eco Oro has not proposed what form such less stringent measures could have taken. Colombia's long-standing policy was to protect the entire p\u00e1ramo. Additionally, \"[t]*he delineation process was carried out scientifically by the IAVH in accordance with international standards, and with the input of many senior experts in the field* [...] *carrying out extensive field work to delimit the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem would have been inappropriate* [...] *and an impossible task* [...] *the IAVH developed - and submitted for peer review - a methodology which relied primarily on satellite imaging and altitude data, which was then subjected to probabilistic modelling.*\"633 Targeted field studies confirmed and, as necessary, corrected the Transitional Zone delineation. This methodology has not been the subject of serious challenge or debate and thus Colombia's measures were proper and proportionate.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 346.\n\n*(v) The regulatory regime was transparent and predictable*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n606.\n\nThe delimitation process for Resolution 2090 was neither arbitrary nor non-transparent and was entirely predictable.\n\n607.\n\nIAvH's proposal for the delimitation exercise resulting in the 2090 Atlas was contained in a peer-reviewed document titled \"Contributions to the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo\" (i.e., the Contributions Document**)**.634 This document was \"*the sole scientific report that was produced in terms of a technical ecological delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo.*\"635 The relevant extracts from the executive summary provide as follows:\n\n*\"This document was produced [...] with the aim of providing elements of judgement in biophysical, economic, legal and social aspects that contribute to the delimitation at 1:25,000 scale of the Complex of p\u00e1ramos of the Santurb\u00e1n-Berl\u00edn jurisdictions (CJSB) performed by the pertinent authorities.*\n\n[...]\n\n*For the construction of this document, the starting point was the delivery of the studies to the MADS by the appropriate CAR in November and December of 2012, with the assistance of different sources of supporting information, including research projects carried out by the [IAvH] in said complex, as well as the P\u00e1ramos and Life Systems Project, financed by the European Union, studies conducted by universities, NGOs, private companies, and documents provided by the community in this process.*\n\n*Therefore, we present, on one hand, a proposal for the identification of the lower strip of the P\u00e1ramo ecosystem, outlined with the assistance of different techniques, which included fieldwork data collected from different sources, both recent and historical, models of potential distribution of the ecosystem and representative species, as well as high resolution spatial satellite imagery (5m) that attests to the current condition of the territory. The mapping systems implemented in this process are at 1:25,000 scale.*\n\n*The basic fact is that the boundaries between ecosystems are not presented as precise lines in the land, and their identification in a map is an abstraction exercise on an ecological process (transition) which is actually a gradual process and appears in the form of a strip, and its extension on the altitudinal gradient is variable and conditioned by topoclimatic features and the trajectory of the historical and recent transformations of the landscape. In line with the delimitation criteria laid down since 2010, this strip is deemed to show clear elements of the P\u00e1ramo ecosystem (climate, soils, vegetation, etcetera) and is therefore undoubtedly part of the p\u00e1ramo in its different definitions (some of which are supported by law), and necessary for the preservation of its biodiversity and ecological functions.*\n\n*Delimitation criteria of the p\u00e1ramos are call attention to the need to appropriately identify the lower limits of the ecosystem under the following consideration: 1) the lower p\u00e1ramo or sub-p\u00e1ramo is a part of the ecosystem and its altitudinal position is not homogenous (which has been observed by different experts and also recognised in Law 99 of 1993 and in Resolution MADVT 0769 of 2002 among other regulations) 2) the ecotones, defined as transitions to adjacent ecosystems 3) connectivity to other ecosystems.\"*\n\nIAvH, \"Contributions to the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo\" (2014) (**Exhibit C-194**).\n\nTr. Day 1 (Mr. Adam), 329:1-4.\n\n608.\n\nThis document was created for the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and does not contain any reference to field studies needing to be undertaken but instead permits the use of existing field studies that were carried out under a previous project in 2013. The IAvH therefore followed properly the methodology contained in this document. Lessons learned from the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation were included in the 2015 Forest P\u00e1ramo Transition Conceptual Framework along with all the other work the IAvH had been doing and this formed the basis for the delineation of all subsequent p\u00e1ramos. However, the pilot, the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation, was conducted pursuant to the 2014 document.\n\n609.\n\nThe Transition Zone was included in the original definition of the p\u00e1ramo in 2002 in Resolution 769 (the subp\u00e1ramo or lower level of the p\u00e1ramo) being the low high-Andean forests which was deemed to be of fundamental importance to the integrity of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems as explained in the above extract from the IAvH proposal.\n\n610.\n\nWhilst the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation contained in Resolution 2090 was a pilot,636 the only scientific criticism of it was that raised by Eco Oro's expert, Mr. Aldana. The IAvH could not have undertaken its study in the same manner as was undertaken by ECODES as the area to be delimited by the IAvH was too large and it did not have the resources to undertake field studies in the entire area. In any event, the exercise was undertaken by the use of *\"satellite imagery\"* and the use of *\"probabilistic distribution models using secondary data on vegetation, climate data and topographic data to capture* [...] *the integrity of the ecosystem, and determine*[] *the extension of the p\u00e1ramo, including p\u00e1ramo areas altered by human activity and atypical p\u00e1ramo patches*\"637 which identifies not only where the p\u00e1ramo is but also where it had been disrupted which, the IAvH had determined, should still be included as p\u00e1ramo.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Mr. Adam), 326:8-9.\n\nTr. Day 1 (Mr. Adam), 335:7-15, 339:19-20.\n\n611.\n\nThe ECODES Report was not able to assist IAvH as it was performed according to a different methodology, and it was of little utility as it related to the Angostura Polygon which had been affected by ongoing activities for many years. It would also have been inappropriate to use it as it would have been giving Eco Oro special treatment which IAvH clearly could not do.\n\n612.\n\nWhilst the IAvH study for the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation did not include field studies whereas the subsequent delimitation studies in the Pisba p\u00e1ramo did, this is because there was additional funding from the Fondo Adaptaci\u00f3n which provided funds for p\u00e1ramos that had been affected by La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon. This did not apply to the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.\n\n613.\n\nMinAmbiente did not withhold the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo's coordinates, they were published when MinAmbiente issued its decision to adopt them. The Constitutional Court neither found bad faith on the part of MinAmbiente nor that it had withheld the coordinates. Whilst it did find that it should have disclosed its preparatory work, this is a different matter.\n\n614.\n\nThe ANM's Technical Report, VSC 3, was an internal document, not a communication to Eco Oro.\n\n615.\n\nThe ANM's rejection of Eco Oro's request to suspend its concession obligations was neither arbitrary nor unfair but carefully reasoned, concluding that there was no *force majeure* such that the requirements for a suspension were not satisfied.\n\n616.\n\nFinally, Eco Oro has presented no evidence of any failure by the Colombian authorities to prevent the alleged influx of illegal miners.\n\n**(2) Canada's non-disputing party submission**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n617.\n\nIn its non-disputing party submission, Canada confirms that Article 811 reflects and incorporates the customary international law with respect to expropriation.638 In applying this Article, the first step is to identify whether there is a valid (i.e., vested) property right capable of being expropriated: this is a threshold question. A conditional right is insufficient for the purposes of the FTA. The relevant law is the domestic law of Colombia, being the host State, and deference should be accorded to any interpretation by domestic courts on this issue.639 There must have been a taking of fundamental ownership rights, either directly or indirectly that causes a substantial deprivation of economic value of the investment; mere interference with the use or enjoyment of the benefits associated with the investment being insufficient. However a host State will not be required \"*to compensate an investment for any loss sustained by the imposition of a non-discriminatory, regulatory measure designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives\"* i.e., measures taken pursuant to its police powers.640 This police power is reflected in the FTA in Annex 811 which *\"provides guidance on how to distinguish measures that constitute indirect expropriation from otherwise legitimate governmental action not requiring compensation.*\"641\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 4, citing to *Glamis*, Award (8 June 2009) (**Exhibit CL-59**), para. 354.\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 6, citing to *Eli Lilly and Company v.

As none of these factors is determinative, nor can be considered in isolation, the impact of the measure on the investment is only one of the relevant factors to consider and ultimately if a measure falls within the provisions of Annex 811(2))(b) it will not constitute indirect expropriation \"*reflec*t[ing] *the deference given to States in their determination of the level of protection they seek to achieve and the regulatory choices to achieve these objectives. If the impact of a measure is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith, this may however indicate that an indirect expropriation is at issue not the exercise of police powers. The use of the phrase 'except in rare circumstances' and the reference to measures that 'cannot reasonably be viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith' are consistent with the high degree of deference that States' regulatory choices should be accorded. Therefore bona fide non discriminatory regulatory measures to protect the environment even if they are based on precaution (i.e. in dubio pro ambiente) will ordinarily nor require compensation even if they affect the value and/or viability of an investor of another party.*\"642\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 11.\n\n**(3) Colombia's comments on Canada's non-disputing party submission**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n619.\n\nAs an over-riding point in response, Colombia notes that the Tribunal should place significant weight on Canada's submission given *(i)* Canada has no interest in the outcome of the dispute; *(ii)* having been involved in negotiating the FTA, Canada has a *\"unique perspective on how the treaty should be interpreted\";**643* and *(iii)* the systemic interest of States in ensuring consistency of interpretation.\n\nRespondent's Response to Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, section A, citing M. Kinnear, Transparency and Third Party Participation in Investor-State Dispute Settlement, delivered at Symposium Co-Organised by ICSID, OECD and UNCTAD - Making The Most Of International Investment Agreements: A Common Agenda (2005), p. 8, available at: https://www.oecd.org/investment/internationalinvestmentagreements/36979626.pdf.\n\n620.\n\nColombia then notes, with approval, Canada's submission that Annex 811 reproduces a State's police powers and that this *(i)* accords with Colombia's submission that it should be afforded a *\"wide margin of appreciation to the policy decisions\"* of its regulatory authorities and *(ii)* that it is irreconcilable with Eco Oro's submission that compensation is payable where the measure adopted is \"*disproportionate*\", \"*contrary to legitimate expectations*\" or *\"unreasonable*.\" Colombia further notes Canada's submission that only a fully vested right can be the subject of expropriation and Colombia reiterates that Eco Oro had no such right. The determination of the *\"existence, nature and scope of the 'property right* '\"must include any applicable limitation and Eco Oro's rights were always limited by Colombia's right to designate mining exclusion zones without payment of compensation pursuant to Articles 34 and 26 of the 2001 Mining Code.644\n\nRespondent's Response to Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, pp. 2-3.\n\n**(4) Eco Oro's comments on Canada's non-disputing party submission**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n621.\n\nEco Oro first observes that Canada supports its submission that Annex 811(2)(b) is a codification of the police powers doctrine applicable under customary international law and is not *lex specialis* going far beyond the police powers doctrine. This further means that, insofar as Annex 811(2)(b) reflects the police powers doctrine under customary international law, the recognised exceptions will apply under Annex 811(2)(b).645 In particular, a central tenet of the police powers doctrine is that the measure in question must be *bona fide* which, Eco Oro submits, is acknowledged by Canada.646\n\nClaimant's Response to Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 5; *Oxus*, Award (17 December 2015) (**Exhibits CL-84 / RL-99**), para. 744; *Tecmed*, Award (29 May 2003) (**Exhibits CL-22 / RL-61**), para. 122; *Philip Morris*, Award (8 July 2016) (**Exhibit RL-102**), para. 295.\n\nClaimant's Response to Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 6; Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 11 and fn. 7.\n\n622.\n\nEco Oro further notes Canada's acceptance that Annex 811(2)(b) *\"does not constitute an exception that applies after an expropriation has been found but is a recognition that the exercise of police powers does not engage State responsibility.*\"647 This acknowledges that \"*the determination as to whether the police powers doctrine applies must form part of the overall evaluation of whether there has been indirect expropriation*\" such that Annex 811(2)(a) (identifying factors to be taken into account when determining whether there has been an indirect expropriation) and (b) (identifying circumstances where the measure will not be treated as indirect expropriation) must be \"*applied holistically and coterminously\"* which undermines Colombia's argument that the analysis under Annex 811(2)(a) and (b) are entirely separate.\n\nClaimant's Response to Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 7; Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, fn. 14.\n\n**(5) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n623.\n\nAs the majority of the Tribunal has determined in paragraph 440 above, Eco Oro had certain vested rights capable of being expropriated, namely the right to explore, the right to exploit (albeit a right which could only be exercised upon its PTO being approved and obtaining an Environmental Licence) and the right to extend its concession at the end of the concession period. The Tribunal has further determined that no permanent mining exclusion zone had been established over the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo at the time the FTA entered into force. Given this finding, the Tribunal does not need to consider here whether Eco Oro's rights were grandfathered (whether pursuant to the transition regime adopted under Article 5 of Resolution 2090 or Article 173(1) of Law 1753): this is a question which goes to the date on which the expropriation, if there was one, occurred and thus to the quantum of damages and not to the question of whether an expropriatory act took place.\n\n624.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore turns to consider whether the Challenged Measures constitute an indirect expropriation of Eco Oro's vested rights or a legitimate exercise by Colombia of its police powers.\n\n625.\n\nCanada notes in its non-disputing party submission that \"*the police powers of the State are expressly reflected in Annex 811*\"648 and both Parties accept this. They disagree as to the applicability of the generally accepted international law exceptions to the police powers doctrine. Eco Oro contends that Annex 811(2)(b) reflects a State's police powers as understood in international law such that the exceptions under international law apply, namely whether the measures violated specific commitments given by the State to the investor,649 were disproportionate to the public interest650 or not implemented in good faith being arbitrary, unnecessary or otherwise not *bona fide* requiring consideration of good faith tenets of fairness, transparency, non-arbitrariness, clarity, non-ambiguity and predictability. Colombia says that Annex 811(2)(b) is *lex specialis* such that the Tribunal does not need to consider these general international law exceptions.\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 9.\n\n*Oxus*, Award (17 December 2015) (**Exhibits CL-84 / RL-99**), para. 744.\n\n*Tecmed*, Award (29 May 2003) (**Exhibits CL-22 / RL-61**), para. 122.\n\n626.\n\nThe tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay,* having considered provisions similar to Annex 811(2)(b), held that such provisions reflect the more general doctrine of police powers in customary international law.651 The Tribunal concurs. Annex 811(2) does not expressly exclude the application of general international law when seeking to understand and apply it. Indeed, parties to a Treaty cannot contract out of the system of international law.652 When States contract with each other it is inherent that they do so within the system of international law. Therefore, in interpreting and applying the provisions of Annex 811(2), awards on the police powers doctrine under customary international law may provide some guidance (by analogy).\n\n*Philip Morris*, Award (8 July 2016) (**Exhibit RL- 102**), para. 301.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award (15 April 2009), para. 77 and fn. 48 (not available on record).\n\n627.\n\nWhilst these awards indicate that various tribunals have taken different approaches on the order in which to analyse the issues -do you first determine whether the criteria for an indirect expropriation are met, and then determine whether the exception applies, or vice versa?- there is no clear consensus in the practise. One approach is to consider whether the relevant measure falls within the exercise of a State's police powers before moving to a careful assessment of whether there may have been an expropriation, including consideration of deprivation. Applied to the text of Annex 811(2), this approach means considering sub-paragraph (b) before (a). The tribunals in *Methanex v. USA*,653*Saluka v. Czech Republic,*654 *Investmart v. Czech Republic,*655*WNC Factoring v. Czech Republic*656 and *A11Y v. Czech Republic*657 took this approach. A second approach is to consider the threshold issue of whether there has been a substantial deprivation, before turning to the question of whether the measures at issue were an exercise by Colombia of its police power. This approach was followed in *Tecmed v. Mexico*658 and *Chemtura v. Canada.*659 In both these approaches, tribunals have apparently proceeded on the basis that a decision on police powers is also a decision on whether there has been an indirect expropriation. In other words, the inquiry into indirect expropriation and police powers is not distinguishable. In reaching this conclusion, the following passage in *Saluka* is relied upon:\n\n*\"It is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona fide regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.*\"660\n\n*Methanex*, Award (3 August 2005) (**Exhibit CL-32**), Part IV, Ch.

See also *Tecmed*, Award (29 May 2003) (**Exhibits CL-22 / RL-61**), para. 122.\n\n628.\n\nA third approach is to evaluate all the relevant facts and then make a decision on whether the relevant measures were expropriatory or an exercise of the State's police powers. Rather than following a two-stage analysis as the first and second approaches summarised above do, this approach takes all factors into account before reaching a conclusion. This approach can be seen in *Marfin Investment Group and Others v. Cyprus.*661\n\n*Marfin Investment Group Holdings S.A., Alexandros Bakaselos and Others v. Republic of Cyprus*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/27, Award (26 July 2018) (not available on record), in particular paras. 1031-1126.\n\n629.\n\nWhichever approach is adopted, the exception in Annex 811(2)(b) is best seen as a reflection or explanation of the factors that are relevant to the expropriation inquiry in Annex 811(2)(a). An assessment of whether there has been interference *\"with distinct, reasonable investment-backed measures*\" and \"*the character of the measure or series of measures*\" (in Annex 811(2)(a)) can only take place with reference to whether those measures \"*are designed and applied to protect legitimate welfare objectives*.\" This is most obvious in connection to the 'character' criterion but is also true of the 'expectations' criterion, as investors must be taken to understand that States retain the power to regulate in the public interest. The Tribunal further finds that the question of whether the measure has been adopted in good faith or *bona fides* is the same for both the inquiry into expropriation and that into police powers (or Annex 811(2)(b)) and necessitates consideration of the purpose of the measures and the degree to which the State's public policy concern is genuine as opposed to the process by which the measures were created. Having considered these alternative approaches, the Tribunal first considers whether the effect of the Challenged Measures was equivalent to direct expropriation. If so, it then considers whether the Challenged Measures were a legitimate exercise of Colombia's police powers or constituted an indirect expropriation.\n\n630.\n\nIt is clear that the measures had a level of adverse economic impact on Eco Oro's covered investment however was there a substantial deprivation of Eco Oro's rights? Eco Oro says that it was deprived of its right to exploit. This included the right to submit its proposed environmental measures, as detailed in the submitted PTO, for approval by the environmental authorities and to apply for an Environmental Licence. The Tribunal notes Eco Oro's application for an environmental license for an open-cast mining project was rejected on environmental grounds. Further, no application was made by Eco Oro for its proposed underground mining project. Finally, the Tribunal has not been provided with any evidence as to how this underground project would be acceptable from an environmental perspective. The difficulty as the Tribunal sees it is that once it was clear that a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem overlapped with a significant part of the Concession area, it would inevitably have been challenging for Eco Oro to satisfy the environmental authorities that it could undertake exploitation activities without damaging the p\u00e1ramo, particularly in circumstances where the precautionary principle had been enshrined into Colombian law. However, whilst no doubt a difficult proposition to sustain, Eco Oro says that such an application was not doomed to inevitable failure. In support of its contention that it could have satisfied the environmental authorities as to the way in which its underground mining project would have been environmentally satisfactory, Eco Oro says that 67 environmental licenses have been granted in areas overlapping p\u00e1ramo ecosystems since the General Environmental Law enshrined the precautionary principle, covering an area of 14,000 hectares, 29% of which titles had more than 90% of their surface area within the surface area of a p\u00e1ramo and a further 43 environmental licences were being processed (referring to section 6.4.3 of a study prepared by the IAvH using data as at 2011 for the 1:100,000 delimitation662).\n\nIAvH, \"Contributions to the strategic conservation of the Colombian p\u00e1ramos: Updating the mapping of the p\u00e1ramo complexes to a scale of 1:100,000\" (6 February 2014) (**Exhibit C-200**).\n\n631.\n\nMs. Baptiste advised she did not have full knowledge of this. However, in paragraph 77(a) of its Post-Hearing Brief, Colombia says that: \"[...] *in accordance with the information collected by the IAVH in 2011, there were 65 mining titles overlapping with the IAVH Atlas reference area of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. However of those 65 mining titles, only 15 had obtained environmental authorisations to conduct mining exploitation activities. Further by December 2014, when Resolution 2090 was issued, the number of mining titles in the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo had decreased to 54. Of these 54 mining titles, only 10 had environmental authorisations to conduct exploitation activities. None of the mining titles or environmental authorisations in force in December 2014 were issued after 9 February 2010, when the mining ban in p\u00e1ramo areas under Law 1382 entered into force. Furthermore, none of these authorisations were for large-scale industrialized mining projects. The footprint of these projects on the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was minimal. In fact, less than 1% of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo (a mere 174.5 hectares) was covered with mining titles with environmental authorisations issued prior to 9 February 2010.\"*\n\n632.\n\nWhilst Colombia says that only 10 of the 54 mining titles in existence at the time Resolution 2090 came into force had obtained exploitation authorisations and these did not relate to *\"large-scale industrialised mining projects\",* Colombia has not explained the current status of the remaining 44 mining titles. It is unclear whether PTOs have been approved for exploitation activities and environmental licences issued in respect of any of the other 44 mining titles or indeed whether applications are currently under consideration. Given this, whilst it is unarguable that Eco Oro would have faced significant difficulties in obtaining an approved PTO and Environmental Licence for an underground mining project, the Tribunal cannot say that Eco Oro had no prospect of success. It cannot be said with certainty that an application for a PTO for an underground mine and an environmental licence will inevitably be rejected. As a result of the Challenged Measures, Eco Oro has lost such opportunity to apply for an approved PTO and an environmental licence in relation to that part of the concession which overlaps with the area delimited by Resolution 2090 to enable it to exercise its vested right to exploit.\n\n633.\n\nEco Oro next says that those areas of Concession 3452 which do not overlap Resolution 2090 were also rendered valueless by the Challenged Measures. Although no expert evidence was adduced in support of Mr. Moseley-Williams' testimony, Colombia did not challenge his testimony that whilst the Angostura Deposit only overlaps 0.09% of the 2090 Atlas, the effect of the Challenged Measures deprives Eco Oro of more than 50% of its mining rights such that the economics of the Angostura Project are destroyed. On this basis, Eco Oro has been deprived of its acquired right to exploit, pursuant to which right it has been deprived of the opportunity to obtain approval of a PTO and apply for an environmental licence with respect to the totality of the concession area.\n\n634.\n\nEco Oro's expectation in entering into the Concession was to make a profit. The purpose of the Concession was, as specified in Clause One, exploitation and it is typically only in the exploitation phase of a project such as this that significant economic benefits may be obtained, the costs of exploration having been incurred. It is indisputable that a deprivation of this right will have caused potential economic loss to Eco Oro, but does this comprise severe deprivation? Eco Oro's share price had already dropped significantly when its open-pit mining application was rejected in April 2010 (being before the cut-off date) and at this point there was certainly a devastating economic impact to Concession 3452. Whilst the share price did rise in early 2015 before again falling after implementation of the Challenged Measures, the decline in share value in April 2010 appears more significant than that caused by the Challenged Measures. However, Eco Oro suffered the complete deprivation of a potential right to exploit. Without a right to exploit, albeit a right which was dependent upon an approved PTO and environmental licence, there was no possibility of exploiting the Angustura Deposit such that the Concession became valueless. Whilst of course the actual economic value of the right to exploit in that area was uncertain, given the need to obtain a future approval of the PTO and to obtain an Environmental Licence in circumstances where the chances of making a successful application appear to be minimal, that exploitation right was lost in totality as a result of the Challenged Measures. The Tribunal finds that this loss is capable of being considered to be a substantial deprivation, such as to amount to an indirect expropriation.\n\n635.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore turns to consider whether the Challenged Measures were a legitimate exercise of Colombia's police powers pursuant to Annex 811(2)(b): were they a non-discriminatory measure or series of measures designed and applied to protect the environment. If the answers to these questions are both yes, there is no indirect expropriation unless they comprise a rare circumstance.\n\n636.\n\nTurning first to their purpose, it cannot be disputed that the Challenged Measures were for the protection of the environment, and it could not be argued the concern to protect the p\u00e1ramo was in all respects a legitimate one. P\u00e1ramos have significant environmental importance, recognised at the national and international levels. Firstly, they provide ecosystem services, the most important of which is water supply (supplying 70% of Colombia's water) and the regulation of the water cycle. P\u00e1ramos effectively act like sponges, taking in water from the atmosphere and enabling it to move down to the water tables and so the soil plays a critical role in absorbing and carrying the water. The Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo is a particularly humid p\u00e1ramo, providing water to about 2.5 million people in 68 surrounding municipalities. Secondly, p\u00e1ramos capture large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere.\n\n637.\n\nP\u00e1ramos are under threat from both human intervention and climate change. Due to the predominantly cold weather and low availability of oxygen, they have a very slow metabolism, which produces low growth and decomposition rates which makes their ability to recover particularly slow663 and there is *\"consensus that the p\u00e1ramo's ability to recover from either open pit or underground mining activities is very low. Underground mining, for example, can modify water drainage systems and carries the risk of drying out or reducing water bodies and surface water flows.*\"664 Indeed, in determining the EIA submitted by Eco Oro for its open pit mining project, Ms. Baptiste notes that *\"mining activities are frequently harmful for biodiversity and soil recovery*\" and, as detailed in IAvH's report rejecting Eco Oro's EIA, the IAvH noted that restoration measures would not be feasible or viable.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), para. 155.\n\nFirst Baptiste Statement, para. 36.\n\n638.\n\nThe Constitutional Court notes in paragraphs 155 and 158-160 of Judgment C-35 that:\n\n*\"restoration or recovery of a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem is virtually impossible [...]. Therefore when the soil and subsoil ecosystem functions suffer negative impacts, such impacts are generally irreversible.*\n\n[...]\n\n*In a nutshell, given the different factors of vulnerability that may affect the subsoil, the soil, the flora, the fauna and the air in paramo ecosystems, we can conclude that they are vulnerable ecosystems. Such vulnerability increases if we take into account that their recovery capacity is slower than other ecosystems.*\n\n*Apart from the vulnerability factors mentioned above, paramo ecosystems have very low resistance and resilience thresholds, that is to say they are fragile ecosystems [...].*\n\n*Currently the most common disturbances in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems are: [...] (iv) open pit and underground mining [...].*\n\n*Thus we should conclude that, owing to the vulnerability of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, and the role they play in the regulation of the water cycle and in carbon capturing, the p\u00e1ramo delimitation process carried out by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development is of essential importance [...].*\"665\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**).\n\n639.\n\nThe Constitutional Court further noted in Judgment T-361 that:\n\n\"*The right to environmental participation is reinforced in the p\u00e1ramos governance. This is due to the fact that such biomes are of great importance to the legal**666* *system because: (i) they are an ecosystem featuring great diversity that needs to be preserved; and (ii) they offer environmental services that are most significant for society life, such as the regulation of the hydrologic cycle and the sequestration of atmospheric carbon.*\n\n*In turn that biome is exposed to multiple disturbances that can destroy it, such as crop farming, animal farming, mining or global warming, which processes would bring societal wellbeing levels down. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt tools that will preserve such natural environments: delimitation is an example of such environmental management. However, the protection of paramo ecosystems stands as a difficult task due to the debate concerning the concept of paramos and the delimitation of the boundaries separating paramos from the upper Andean forest. In view of this situation, paramo management should seek the sustainability of such ecological niches and take into consideration paramo interactions with other natural environments. An example of this is the inclusion of the forest paramo buffer zone (FPBZ) within its boundaries.*\"667\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in both the Spanish original and English translation the word \"*legal*\" is used. \"*El derecho de la participaci\u00f3n ambiental se refuerza en la gobernanza que recae sobre los p\u00e1ramos. Lo anterior, en raz\u00f3n de que ese bioma reviste gran importancia para el Sistema jur\u00eddico* [\u2026]\"].\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgement No. T-361 (**Exhibit C-244**), pp. 253-254.\n\n640.\n\nThe Tribunal further does not understand it to be contended that the measures were discriminatory in any way. The measures affected all mining concessionaires whose concessions overlapped the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. The Tribunal understands that there were around 65 mining titles covering approximately 10% of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo which would potentially be affected by a mining ban, some locally owned and some owned by foreign companies. Whilst there was clearly a tension between the aspirations of MinMinas and MinAmbiente, the Tribunal does not find there was any evidence of an intention expressly to target Eco Oro, or that Eco Oro was inadvertently targeted. It is clear from the local demonstrations that many artisanal miners and local populations were equally concerned at the prospect of losing both their mining rights (to the extent they had such rights) and their livelihood, which had been dependent upon mining being undertaken in their localities. Indeed, the Mayors of Soto Norte and other relevant localities sent a letter to MinAmbiente and CDMB, with 70 pages of signatures attached, complaining of the lack of opportunity for them to participate in the consultation exercise, noting that *(i)* 90% of the population in the affected area relied directly or indirectly on mining activities; *(ii)* legal uncertainty with respect to delimitation had led to unemployment and illegal mining; *(iii)* any delimitation should not ignore the acquired rights of existing mining title holders; and *(iv)* that a transitional regime be established.\n\n641.\n\nMinMinas and MinAmbiente therefore had to balance the competing interests of the environment and of the economic rights of private persons. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that whilst the artisanal miners and local populations were relocated or compensated by the State,668 no such offer was made to Eco Oro. The Tribunal also notes the Constitutional Court's reference to the right of an affected holder of a mining title, such as Eco Oro, to seek compensation from the State. In response to questions from the Tribunal, Professor Ricaurte advised that, in her view, a private party, such as Eco Oro, which had suffered harm as a result of the State taking measures to protect the general interest in preserving the p\u00e1ramo, was entitled to make an application for compensation, the assessment of which would be conducted by the court. An action could be brought against the Government before the administrative courts claiming compensation for violation of such private contractual rights although, as explained by Professor Ricaurte, no such claims have yet reached the Colombian High Courts, as the declaration of excluded areas is quite recent and there are therefore no final judgements at the present time.669 This possibility of recourse is also supported by the *Consejo de Estado* in Advisory Opinion 2233. Whilst Eco Oro was required to, and did, waive such rights when commencing this arbitration, the Tribunal accepts there was a constitutional right available to Eco Oro to seek compensation from the State in the Colombian courts.670 Accordingly, whilst the solution to this \"*balancing exercise*\"671 directly affected Eco Oro, the Tribunal does not find, on the basis of the evidence before it, that the solution adopted by Colombia in terms of the measures complained against could be said to have been targeted (negatively) against Eco Oro; instead, the measures had a positive objective, namely to preserve the p\u00e1ramo.\n\nThis can be seen from, for example, Art. 5 (1) of Law No. 1930 (**Exhibit R-51**).\n\nTr. Day 4 (Professor Ricaurte), 964:18-974:9.\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**).\n\nAs designated by ANM in its Letter from National Mining Agency to the Constitutional Court seeking clarification on the consequences of Constitutional Judgment C-35 (24 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-44**).\n\n642.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal therefore finds that the Challenged Measures were non-discriminatory and designed and applied to protect a legitimate public welfare objective, namely the protection of the environment. They were adopted in good faith. The Challenged Measures were therefore a legitimate exercise by Colombia of its police powers unless they comprise a rare circumstance such that they constitute indirect expropriation pursuant to Annex 811(2)(a).\n\n643.\n\nIn determining whether the Challenged Measures are a rare circumstance, the Tribunal is informed by the factors detailed in Annex 811(2)(a) as well as by the example contained in Annex 811(2)(b): are the measures so severe that they cannot reasonably be regarded as having been adopted in good faith. To be clear, whilst the Tribunal does not accept, if it were so contended, that it must make a finding of bad faith or disproportionality with respect to the effect of the measures taken, equally, a measure adopted in good faith is unlikely to comprise a rare circumstance for the purposes of Annex 811(2)(b). In undertaking this exercise, the Tribunal notes that the ordinary meaning of the word 'rare' in the context of 'a rare event' is one which seldom occurs, is unusual, uncommon, or exceptional (as detailed in the Oxford English Dictionary). Whilst the Oxford English Dictionary does not provide a definition of the word 'severe' in the context of a 'severe' measure, common uses of the word in such a context connote *\"something bad or undesirable\", \"harsh\", \"brutal\", \"serious\"* or *\"grave\"* and the addition of the word 'so' before 'severe' emphasises the extreme nature of the severity contemplated. Accordingly, for the Challenged Measures to comprise an actionable indirect expropriation, as opposed to a legitimate exercise of a State's police powers, there must be a very significant aggravating element or factor in the conduct of the State and not just a bureaucratic muddle or State inefficiency.\n\n644.\n\nThe Challenged Measures were clearly implemented to protect the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. There was a recognised need to protect these ecosystems which was first highlighted a significant time before Concession 3452 was granted, as can be seen from the following:\n\na. Article 79 of Colombia's (Green) Political Constitution imposes on the State a legal duty to conserve areas of special ecological importance.\n\nb. In 1992 Colombia signed the Biodiversity Convention.\n\nc. In 1993 Colombia enacted the General Environmental Law (Law 99 of 1993) which provided that p\u00e1ramos were to be the subject of special protection.\n\nd. In 1996 it ratified the Biodiversity Convention and in 1998 it ratified the Ramsar Convention.\n\ne. A \"Programme for the Restoration and Sustainable Management of High Colombian Mountain Ecosystems: P\u00c1RAMOS\" was launched in 2001 and published in February 2002,672 framed in accordance with the General Environmental Principles of the General Environmental Law. This programme was contained in a lengthy document which detailed the important cultural and economic functions fulfilled by the p\u00e1ramos and specified the aim of *\"special protection of p\u00e1ramos, sub-p\u00e1ramos, springs and aquifer replenishing zones.\"* Pursuant to Article 2.1, the general objective was \"[t]*o provide national, regional and local orientation for environmental management of P\u00e1ramo ecosystems and promote actions for their sustainable management and restoration* [...].\" Article 2.2 detailed the specific objectives including, *inter alia*: \"*Perform environmental zoning and planning of the paramo ecosystems at a regional and local level and implement environmental management plans with an ecological approach\"* and *\"*[p]*romote the conservation of paramo ecosystems on the basis of ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable forms of land use.\"* Article 1.1 of the General Environmental Law referred to the relevance of the Rio principles, Principle 15 of which contained the precautionary principle (namely that \"[w]*here there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation\"*) which was enshrined into Colombian Law by Article 1.6 and Article 1.4 of the General Environmental Law providing that \"*the p\u00e1ramo and sub p\u00e1ramo areas, water springs and aquifer recharge zones shall be the subject of special protection*.\"673\n\nf. The Ministry of Environment Resolution 769 (dated 5 August 2002) was issued titled *\"Establishing provisions for p\u00e1ramo protection, preservation and sustainability*\" pursuant to which MinAmbiente established a legal definition of \"P\u00e1ramo*.*\" In particular it *(i)* identified the p\u00e1ramos it applied to as being those on the western cordillera from approximately 3300 masl, on the central cordillera from approximately 3700 masl, on the eastern cordillera from approximately 3000 masl and in any other regions from approximately 3300 masl; *(ii)* noted that p\u00e1ramos comprise three strips (the sub-p\u00e1ramo, the p\u00e1ramo itself and the superp\u00e1ramo); and *(iii)* noted that it included man-altered p\u00e1ramos. Article 3 provided for regional studies to be completed within one year of terms of reference being established detailing, *inter alia*, their geographical location and cartographic distribution and using GPS to ascertain the Gauss-Kruger and latitude-longitude coordinates and reporting on the current condition of the p\u00e1ramos in that region with the support of, *inter alia*, the IAvH and to prepare an Environmental Management Plan containing, *inter alia,* zoning and environmental organisation of p\u00e1ramos.\n\ng. On 13 July 2004 CORPONOR created the Regional System of Protected Natural Areas for the Department of Norte de Santander which was specified to include \"*the p\u00e1ramo areas, sub-p\u00e1ramos, springs, and aquifer recharge areas*.\"674\n\nMinistry of Environment, \"Program for the Restoration and Sustainable Management of High Mountain Ecosystems: P\u00e1ramos\" (February 2002) (**Exhibit R-113**).\n\nLaw No. 99 of 1993 (General Environmental Law) (22 December 1993) (**Exhibit C-66**), Art. 1.\n\nCORPONOR, Directing Council Agreement No. 11 (13 July 2004) (**Exhibit R-143**).\n\n645.\n\nTherefore, both at the time Concession 3452 was originally entered into in 2007 and at the time the FTA came into force in 2011, well before the Challenged Measures were enacted, there was already significant understanding and awareness of the importance of protecting the p\u00e1ramo and its fragility. Indeed, Eco Oro should have been aware of this at the time it made its original investment in 1994. The intended purpose of the Challenged Measures as designed and applied is therefore clearly *bona fide*, even if all the necessary measures to achieve the underlying purpose have not yet been finally implemented.\n\n646.\n\nThe Tribunal next considers the manner in which the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem was delimited. Was it proportionate given its purpose? Whilst the Parties do not disagree as to the importance of protecting the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, they disagree both as to the criteria to be applied in determining the boundaries of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and as to whether the delimitation was in accordance with the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Annex 811(2)(b) does not impose an obligation to comply with such domestic laws, although it is a relevant factor to consider in ascertaining the *bona fides* of the measures.\n\n647.\n\nThe IAvH's study was the basis for the delimitation applied in the Challenged Measures. Whilst it is accepted by both experts that there is no single definition of a p\u00e1ramo, there is substantial agreement on the essential elements of the p\u00e1ramo. The main differences with respect to the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo are, firstly, where the lower boundary of the p\u00e1ramo is to be delimited and, in particular, whether the transition area (the \"**Transition Zone**\") is to be treated as p\u00e1ramo and, secondly, whether those areas which no longer exhibit the typical characteristics and functions of a p\u00e1ramo can be described as p\u00e1ramo or not: Eco Oro says no to both and Colombia says yes to both.\n\n648.\n\nThe Tribunal found both Parties' experts to be honest and credible with respect to the importance of protecting the p\u00e1ramo. Ms. Baptiste is of the opinion that it is important to include the Transition Zone to ensure complete protection whereas Mr. Aldana took an arguably more technical definition of the p\u00e1ramo. It is not unusual for scientists to disagree but the Tribunal did not find either to be seeking to promote the interests of the Party which had appointed them. In considering the relevance of including the Transition Zone in the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo, the Tribunal finds of assistance the following statement from the Constitutional Court in Judgment C-35:\n\n*\"Then, as we can see, the criteria on which different scientists have relied to define the p\u00e1ramo differ, not only in quantitative terms -regarding their altitude above sea level- but also in qualitative terms -as to the factors or elements used to define the p\u00e1ramo. Some scientists adopt merely operative definitions, such as the location between forest ecosystems and eternal snow, while others add elements such as, inter alia, the type of vegetation, latitude and geological morphology. These definitions pose a challenge to delimitation -hence to the protection of these ecosystems. Yet some points of the definition converge, which are related to the ecological functions or services provided by these ecosystems, facilitating the adoption of some delimitation criteria. As we will see below, these ecological functions or services are the most efficient criterion in furtherance of certain legal interests that are protected by the constitution.*\n\n[...]\n\n*Two services stand out among the different environmental services provided by the p\u00e1ramos, which are fundamental to society. On the one hand, p\u00e1ramos are a cornerstone of the regulation of the water cycle (in terms of quality and availability), for they collect and provide drinking water of high quality and easy distribution. On the other, p\u00e1ramos are carbon 'sinks', that is they store and capture carbon from the atmosphere at least ten times as much as tropical forests, according to the most conservative calculations, contributing to mitigating the effects of global warming.*\n\n[The Constitutional Court then summarises the qualities of the p\u00e1ramos in performing these services:]\n\n\"*After studying the characteristics and the main environmental services provided by p\u00e1ramos, we should indicate that ecosystems are not to be understood in a fragmented manner. In the case being analysed by the Court, the functioning of the p\u00e1ramo cannot be understood in isolation from that of the forests that surround it along the lower parts, since these two ecosystems interact with, and depend on, each other. This has been recognised by the CBD, which defines an ecosystem as '*[...] *a dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism communities and their non-living environment interacting as a functional unit.'*\n\n*To the extent that the different resources that form part of the p\u00e1ramo serve specific functions to the biological and chemical processes that develop in them, the scope of the measures to protect this ecosystem cannot be determined by a single criterion, for example their altitude, or the presence of frailejones. Likewise impacts on the ecosystem cannot be analysed in isolation, for an impact on the soil or on biological diversity may also result in an impact on water.*\n\n*In addition, p\u00e1ramos should not be considered independent ecosystems, for they are closely related with the other adjacent ecosystems such as forests, mainly in connection with water.* [...]*.*\"675\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), paras. 137, 142, 152-154.\n\n649.\n\nThe extract cited above from Judgment C-35 demonstrates the difficulties in reaching a commonly agreed definition of a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and whether the Transition Zone should be encompassed within the ecosystem boundaries. It is clear from this that Colombia's alternative approach to determining the correct boundary of the p\u00e1ramo does not of itself equate to *male fides*.\n\n650.\n\nThe Constitutional Court further noted in Judgment T-361 that:\n\n*\"The right to environmental participation is reinforced in the paramos governance. This is due to the fact that such biomes are of great importance to the legal**676* *system because: (i) they are an ecosystem featuring great diversity that needs to be preserved; and (ii) they offer environmental services that are most significant for society life, such as the regulation of the hydrologic cycle and the sequestration of atmospheric carbon.*\n\n*In turn that biome is exposed to multiple disturbances that can destroy it, such as crop farming, animal farming, mining or global warming, which processes would bring societal wellbeing levels down. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt tools that will preserve such natural environments: delimitation is an example of such environmental management. However, the protection of paramo ecosystems stands as a difficult task due to the debate concerning the concept of paramos and the delimitation of the boundaries separating paramos from the upper Andean forest. In view of this situation, paramo management should seek the sustainability of such ecological niches and take into consideration paramo interactions with other natural environments. An example of this is the inclusion of the forest paramo buffer zone (FPBZ) within its boundaries.*\"677\n\nThe Tribunal notes the use in the English translation of the word \"*legal*\": this is the same as in the Spanish original where the text also refers to the legal system. The provision is as follows: \"*El derecho de la participaci\u00f3n ambiental se refuerza en la gobernanza que recae sobre los p\u00e1ramos. Lo anterior, en raz\u00f3n de que ese bioma reviste gran importancia para el Sistema jur\u00eddico* [\u2026].\"\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgement No. T-361 (**Exhibit C-244**), pp. 253-254.\n\n651.\n\nMr. Aldana says that once there has been a disturbance in the Transition Zone, the p\u00e1ramo species descend and take over the areas previously occupied by the forest (paramisation) but the paramised area does not normally have the composition, structure and functions of a p\u00e1ramo and so may not be considered as p\u00e1ramo. Further, the Angostura area was an area where there had been significant intervention as a result of intensive development for hundreds of years of different activities such as grazing, agriculture and felling as well as traditional mining.\n\n652.\n\nMs. Baptiste on the other hand says that a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem should include areas which have been transformed by human activity: ecosystems are socio-ecological systems and it is not possible to proceed on the basis that a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem loses its nature when it has interacted with human activity. The question of whether or not to include the Transition Zone in the p\u00e1ramo depends on the definition adopted for the ecosystem, and \"[n]*o objective response exists to the question of whether the transition zone is part of the adjacent ecosystem.\"* The IAvH believed the transition strip should be included as p\u00e1ramo as they are areas of maximum biological diversity in the high mountains and a key element for the p\u00e1ramos' water regulation function. They also protect the connectivity between the p\u00e1ramo and the forest, preventing the isolation of certain species. This is consistent with the definition adopted by MinAmbiente in Resolution 769 of 2002 and *\"from the ecological point of view, boundaries or limits correspond more precisely to transition zones. Delimiting an ecosystem, including this transition area with adjacent ecosystems, permits the protection of flows between ecosystems and thus guarantees comprehensive protection.*\"678\n\nFirst Baptiste Statement, para. 41.\n\n653.\n\nMs. Baptiste confirmed in her testimony that the IAvH provided MinAmbiente with a strip representing the Transition Zone together with a line that was the outside border of the transitional strip to protect it as much as possible. This required some, albeit minimal, field data and was effected by means of a probabilistic model with certain specific data. Ms. Baptiste further confirmed that the Transition Zone was subject to a slight degree of uncertainty (in an interview she confirmed it could move 50 meters up or 100 meters down) but that the IAvH recommended line maximised protection for the Transition Zone.\n\n654.\n\nGiven the evidence from both experts and as noted by the Constitutional Court, it is clear p\u00e1ramos require protection and it is also clear that once damaged it is uncertain whether or not they can be restored and, if so, the length of time such restoration will take. Whilst Eco Oro says that the precautionary principle is not applicable, it seems to the Tribunal that this is precisely the circumstance in which this principle -as for example reflected in the preamble to the 1992 Biodiversity Convention and set out in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development- does apply. As discussed above, concern with respect to the fragility of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and the need to ensure \"special protection\" has been expressed since before Concession 3452. The Constitutional Court references a number of studies and reports authored by public and private entities which conclude that *\"p\u00e1ramo ecosystems are very fragile and that mining may have negative consequences on the vegetation cover and geomorphological, chemical and physical changes in the soil and subsoil* [...].\"679 and then summarises the *\"vulnerability, fragility and capacity for recovery of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem.*\"680 The precautionary principle is clearly relevant when considering the effect and proportionality of the measures with respect to the protection of the p\u00e1ramos.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), p. 87 and fn. 82.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35, paras. 155-158 (**Exhibit C-42**).\n\n655.\n\nWhilst the Tribunal does not, for the purposes of this Decision, need to reach a determination of whether such a delimitation should or should not include the Transition Zone, it can conclude that it was certainly not unreasonable for the Transition Zone to have been included when delimiting the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, having regard to the precautionary principle. This is particularly the case in a circumstance such as this where *(i)* there is no certainty as to the damage that could be caused by mining activities and whether or not such damage would be irreversible and *(ii)* if not irreversible, the time it would take for the p\u00e1ramo to regenerate. The Tribunal further recognises the importance, as explained by the Constitutional Court, of ensuring the p\u00e1ramo is both able to interconnect with other ecosystems to ensure it can fulfil its environmental services but equally is protected from any potential adverse interaction with another natural environment. Accordingly, whether or not the delimitation was conducted in accordance with Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code, it cannot be said to be disproportionate in terms of its purpose of protecting the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem to include the Transition Zone in the delimited area. The Tribunal considers below whether or not Colombia's failure to re-delimit the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo as ordered by the Constitutional Court was proportionate.\n\n656.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore does not find that including the Transition Zone in the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was unreasonable or evidences a lack of good faith, and cannot be said to amount an exercise of State power that is characterised by bad faith.\n\n657.\n\nThe Tribunal next turns to consider how the IAvH undertook its task of determining the lower boundary line of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, specifically its lack of field studies. Whilst the Tribunal understands Eco Oro's reservations given the impact of the IAvH's determination on Concession 3452, it does not find the work undertaken by IAvH to have been undertaken in breach of its agreed methodology. The study appears to have followed the methodology which (along with the proposal for the delimitation for the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo) was contained in the Contributions Document.681 This was published in 2014 together with Resolution 2090.\n\nIAvH, \"Contributions to the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo\" (2014) (**Exhibit C-194**).\n\n658.\n\nThe executive summary prepared by Mr. Sarmiento notes that the aim of the document is to *\"provid[e] elements of judgement in biophysical, legal and social aspects that contribute to the delimitation at 1:25,000 scale of the* [Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo]*, performed by the pertinent authorities. In this respect, this document is a contribution requested by the environmental authority, after the formal delivery of the studies, and in accordance with the legislation.\"* Ms. Baptiste confirmed that this document was a *\"concept\",* being technical in nature and fully backed up by the quality of the scientists that issued it. Ms. Baptiste further confirmed that the IAvH was asked by MinAmbiente to *\"contribute its capabilities,* [...] *research in connection with biodiversity and ecosystems. But it also has - this also has to do with the conditions in the communities and related to the people in the circumstances*\".682 She explained that the IAvH *\"worked with the people as well. We worked describing very well the conditions of infrastructure, demographics, population matters. These are factors that cannot be ascended from ecology* [...]*. We assessed all the work that had been developed in connection with mining, history and the region.* [...] *There shouldn't be individuals that are adversely affected and improperly affected so we have documents. We conducted a very careful set of works to work with the persons and this apart from the other activities we conducted in the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.\"* Ms. Batiste confirmed that this was \"[t]*o determine the level of presence of persons, what kinds of activities there are\"* and she noted that she referred to these reports in her statement (paragraphs 38 onwards) such that there were brief references to this work in the reports and the content was to be found in the 2014 Contributions Document.683\n\nTr. Day 3 (Ms. Baptiste), 715:18-716:2.\n\nTr. Day 3 (Ms. Baptiste), 717:21-723:20.\n\n659.\n\nThis 2014 methodology did not refer to the necessity of undertaking new field studies, although it does provide for the use of field work studies that had previously been undertaken. The Tribunal notes that the methodology was peer-approved and that the only criticism it has been referred to is that from Mr. Aldana.684\n\nFirst Gonz\u00e1lez Aldana Statement, paras. 72, 103, 109, 118-119.\n\n660.\n\nWhilst Eco Oro criticises the study undertaken by the IAvH for not including any field studies, the Tribunal notes that a requirement for field studies was only included in a later methodology, the Forest-P\u00e1ramo Transition Conceptual Framework (the \"**Forest-P\u00e1ramo Transition**\") and was not provided for in the Contributions Document methodology. The Tribunal understands that this may well have been because the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation was a pilot exercise and the 2015 document contained a revised methodology partially updated to take account of lessons learnt from undertaking the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation to be used in the subsequent delimitations.\n\n661.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds it understandable that Colombia did not follow a different methodology to give effect to any desire to ensure that the Angostura Deposit was not included in the delimited p\u00e1ramo. Any methodology applied to the area in Concession 3452 would have had to be applied to all other affected concessions and, given Colombia's stated insufficient resources, it is understandable that this could not be undertaken. The Tribunal also accepts Colombia's evidence that it could not have accepted the ECODES Report; it would have been inappropriate to expect Colombia to follow a different methodology with respect to the area overlapping with Concession 3452 or to adopt the delimitation prepared by Eco Oro's own expert in a situation where there were a further approximately 64 titles affected by the delimitation exercise. Firstly, the IAvH needed to follow a methodology that could be applied homogenously across all the p\u00e1ramos to be delineated, to ensure integrity in the delimitation process. Secondly, the IAvH could not have been seen to have adopted a concessionaire's own report or accepted findings from Eco Oro which could have been said to have compromised IAvH's impartiality and scientific integrity. The ECODES Report could also have been perceived as being self-serving, although the Tribunal emphasises that it found Mr. Aldana to be a genuine and honest witness and it was clear that the ECODES Report had been prepared with considerable resources and professionalism.\n\n662.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal does not find that the IAvH's work in preparing its proposal of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation was not *bona fide* and certainly there is no evidence that the manner in which it was undertaken was so severe that it cannot be reasonably be viewed as having been adopted in good faith. The Tribunal found Ms. Baptiste to be a compelling and honest witness. IAvH followed the 2014 methodology. The Tribunal appreciates that given the sizeable area of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo there could have been shortages of logistical and financial resources preventing field studies being undertaken in the totality of the area to be delimited. It is clear that there are different views as to what a p\u00e1ramo comprises, but the Tribunal did not see any evidence that the exercise undertaken by the IAvH was done other than in a genuine attempt to determine the p\u00e1ramo boundaries in the prevailing circumstances. The Tribunal has sympathy with Eco Oro's submissions that had field visits been undertaken the delimitation may have been different and that had the margin of error been applied in Eco Oro's favour, the Angostura Deposit would not have been subject to the mining exclusion zone, however the Tribunal has to balance that with the enormity of the task which had to be undertaken, the difficulties in defining the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem as summarised by the Constitutional Court and the importance of protecting the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. Whilst a wide boundary of the Transition Zone was included, considering that *(i)* damage to the ecosystem has very significant adverse effects; *(ii)* it is unknown whether damaged p\u00e1ramo ecosystem can be restored but that even if it can be restored, the length of time to achieve this is significant; and *(iii)* underground as well as open pit mining is believed to be a threat to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, the Tribunal does not find that there was any arbitrariness, unreasonableness or capriciousness in the way that the IAvH proposed the Resolution 2090 delimitation.\n\n663.\n\nWhilst the Tribunal does not find reason for significant criticism of the manner in which the IAvH undertook its studies, it is, however, more troubled by the manner in which the delimitation was declared by MinAmbiente.\n\n664.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes the dearth of evidence that any form of reliable social and economic studies were undertaken in compliance with the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code. Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code required delimitation *\"by the environmental authority on the basis of technical, social and environmental studies with the collaboration of the mining authority.\"* It is further stated that the administrative act by which any exclusion zone is established must be *\"expressly based on studies that establish the incompatibility of or need to restrict mining activities*.\"685 In addition, Law 1450 added the necessity for an economic study in addition to the technical, social and environmental studies required when undertaking a delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo.\n\nLaw No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Art. 34.\n\n665.\n\nThe Tribunal has reservations as to the legitimacy or adequacy of the social and economic studies that had to be undertaken; the only evidence that was adduced being the reference in a document titled *\"Technical Specifications for the Territory's Comprehensive Management for the Conservation of the P\u00e1ramo Jurisdicciones - Santurb\u00e1n - Berlin. Incorporation of Social and Economic Aspects\"* (the ***\"Memoria T\u00e9cnica\"****).*686 Whilst Colombia says that the socioeconomic inputs are *\"described in detail*\"687 in this *Memoria T\u00e9cnica,* which accompanied Resolution 2090, the document merely states as follows:\n\n*\"The water that originates in the 'P\u00e1ramo Complex Jurisdictions - Santurb\u00e1n - Berlin' supplies the Zulia River Basin - which supplies the district of Riego Asozulia, which groups 1,400 associated bodies of water with a concession of 14.3 m3/s - and supports various activities: agricultural uses, the Tasajero thermal power station, and water supply for the population. Only in the Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area, the number of users of these waters for human consumption comes to one million. 30 percent of the water for the city of Cucurta comes from the p\u00e1ramo complex.*\n\n*Additionally, they emphasise that if the complex's area of regional influence is defined based on seven hydrographic subzones, it consists of 68 municipalities in which approximately 2,500,000 people benefit directly or indirectly from the water sources that originate from there.*\"688\n\nIAvH, \"Technical Specifications for the Territory's Comprehensive Management for the Conservation of the P\u00e1ramo Jurisdicciones \u2013 Santurb\u00e1n \u2013 Berlin.

Whilst the document referred to above suggests that some technical, social and economic studies were undertaken, the Tribunal would have anticipated, if not the level of detail as was undertaken by the IAvH with respect to the environmental and technical aspects of the delimitation exercise, at least more sophisticated studies than appear to have been carried out as identified in the Technical Report. Indeed, Colombia itself accepts that there was significant criticism of the social and economic aspects of the delimitation, but not of the scientific exercise undertaken by IAvH.689\n\nTr. Day 1 (Mr. Adam), 330:3-11.\n\n667.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Colombia says that the social and economic studies are specified at page three of Resolution 2090 and pages five to eleven of the Technical Report. Colombia says it provided these reports to Eco Oro during the document production stage, including the following: *(i)* studies prepared by the CDMB and CORPONOR assessing the physical, biological and socio-economic features of the p\u00e1ramo; *(ii)* corine land covers (being maps showing land cover in the areas identified as being p\u00e1ramo); and *(iii)* the information used by MinAmbiente to map the preservation, restoration and sustainable use areas of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.690 These documents are not on the record and the Tribunal is therefore unable to clarify the level of detail or utility of such reports.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, p. 31; IAvH, \"Technical Specifications for the Territory's Comprehensive Management for the Conservation of the P\u00e1ramo Jurisdicciones \u2013 Santurb\u00e1n \u2013 Berlin.

Pursuant to Request No. 6(e), Colombia produced all the underlying information cited in the Memoria T\u00e9cnica, namely:*\n\n*\u2022* *Corine land covers* [...];\n\n\u2022 *The information used by the Ministry of Environment to map the preservation, restoration and sustainable use areas of the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo* [...];\n\n\u2022 *Map of the Berl\u00edn Integrated Management District* [...];\n\n\u2022 *Landsat Satellite imagery included in Nicolai Ciontesu's study titled 'An\u00e1lisis Multitemporal de Coberturas de la Tierra para el Proyecto P\u00e1ramos Sistemas de Vida' of 13 november 2012* [...]*;*\n\n\u2022 *Map of the p\u00e1ramo slopes, based on 30 m resolution imagery from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission* [...];\n\n\u2022 *Slope steepness classification information from the Instituto Agust\u00edn Codazzi ('IGAC')* [...]*;*\n\n\u2022 *Polygons used by the Ministry of environment to carry out aggregation study* [...]; *and*\n\n*\u2022* *Basic cartography from the IGAC* [...]*.*\n\n*Regarding the Claimant's allegations concerning the alleged deficiencies of Colombia's document production in Request No. 6, Colombia notes the following.*\n\n*First, the 'technical, economic, social and environmental studies for the delineation of the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo submitted by the CDMB to the Ministry of Environment filed under number (radicado) 4120-E1-57045 requested by the Claimants under Request 6(a) were in fact produced by Colombia under Request No. 3 [...].

As discussed above, Resolution 2090 and the Memoria T\u00e9cnica comprehensively include the technical, social and economic information used by the Ministry of Environment to conduct the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo. No information outside that listed in these two documents was used for the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo. The information referenced in page 38 of Exhibit C-217, but was not included in Resolution 2090 or the Memoria T\u00e9cnica, does not constitute 'socio-economic criteria taken into account for the delimitation' and is therefore not responsive to request No. 6(g).*\n\n*In particular, the 'studies to determine the economic value or ecosytems prepared by Fedesarrollo, the Universidad Industrial de Santander - UIS, among others' are not referenced in Resolution 2090 and the Memoria T\u00e9cnica.

Colombia did not produce these studies because they are not responsive to the Claimant's request.*\n\n[...].\"\n\nLetter from Latham & Watkins to Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (28 May 2019) (**Exhibit C-431**), pp. 5-7.\n\n669.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal clear from this response that:\n\na. the only social and economic criteria relied upon by MinAmbiente is that which was set out *\"comprehensively\"* in the *Memoria T\u00e9cnica,* however the information contained therein is extremely sparse;\n\nb. the underlying information cited in the *Memoria T\u00e9cnica* and listed in Colombia's response to Eco Oro's document production request is that which was listed (and quoted in the preceding paragraph) which appears to consist predominantly of biogeophysical data as opposed to social and economic data;\n\nc. the *\"technical, economic, social and environmental studies for the delineation of the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo\"* submitted by the CDMB were relied upon by the IAvH in preparing its proposal for the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo - they were not relied upon by MinAmbiente; and\n\nd. no other documents responsive to Eco Oro's request exist.\n\n670.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal also recalls that Ms. Baptiste confirmed in her oral testimony that the IAvH's capabilities extended to *\"research in connection with the biodiversity and ecosystems\"* which extended to *\"conditions in the communities and related to the people in the circumstances*\"692 which entailed *\"work[ing] with the people as well. We worked on describing very well the conditions of infrastructure, demographics, population matters. These are factors that cannot be ascended from ecology.* [...] *We assessed all the work that had been developed in connection with mining, history, and the region\"**693* Ms. Baptiste further confirmed that the nature of this type of work undertaken by IAvH was as described \"*in the guide to disseminate the criteria for delimitation, well it defines three elements. This is at page 15, biogeophysical criteria for identifying the lower strip or the lower part of the ecosystem; the criteria of ecological integrity which define a reference area, which implies a connected and integral ecosystem; and, finally, socioeconomic and cultural elements which imply, considering the impact on the p\u00e1ramo of the presence of communities and their systems of production, considering also the areas of the p\u00e1ramo that have been totally or partially transformed, are the areas that have been 'paramised.'

And in this way, the ecological line on the identification of the paramo could have become very chaotic. It wouldn't have been possible to draw or propose a line.

It was for MinAmbiente to review economic and social studies before determining the delimitation to be published in compliance with Article 34.\n\n672.\n\nMinister Sarmiento, in her testimony, confirmed that the technical study required by Article 202 of Law 1450 was the final IAvH report, the Contributions Document.696 However she accepted she had no knowledge of the required economic study.697 With respect to the requisite social study, Minister Sarmiento explained her knowledge was limited to the following: different minutes were drawn up and a document was drawn up with the University of Los Andes as a result of meetings and there were also meetings with miners, farmers and the women of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo (led by Minister Sarmiento). However, she confirmed she was not aware of a single document that comprised the social study, explaining that the social aspect was included in a number of documents. Indeed, she explained that whether the women of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo could be paid for environmental services was a part of the economic aspect that she covered.698\n\nTr.

Day 2 (Minister Sarmiento), 661:7-662:13 and 665:14-666:4.\n\n673.\n\nWhilst Minister Sarmiento explained that the boundary line drawn for the lower altitudinal level was based exclusively on environmental and technical considerations, stating that \"[t]*he social and economic criteria do not delimit or cannot be part of the delimitation of an ecosystem*\"699 she then explained that the delimitation was a *\"complete exercise\"* as the State \"*could not set aside the impact that might happen on the paramo, particularly the social concerns around this limitation*.\"700 The State had to strike a balance in circumstances where there was confrontation between the people of the p\u00e1ramo and the people living in Bucaramanga and whilst \"*the technical line is an ecosystem matter, but the State needs to take into consideration, among its obligations, how to handle the special and economic situation of the persons living there, particularly when there was such a high level of conflict and so many threats that we are - were seeing in this regard*.\"701 She continued by saying that the process was not just about drawing the technical line, for the State \"*it is an economic and social issue because it is an issue that goes to, overall, or integral development, which is what one always seeks in dealing with such matters.*\"702 Drawing the boundary line was part of a development question and, as such, social and economic actions would also have been taken as it is an integral process, also requiring consensus building and coordination with the mayors of the regions directly impacted. Having received the proposal from the IAvH, they received further inputs and so *\"moved step by step both on the technical side and social side*.\"703\n\nTr.

Day 2 (Minister Sarmiento), 662:21-663:21.\n\n675.\n\nMinister Sarmiento testified that she visited \"*on a weekly basis,* [...] *with the communities, the most vulnerable Parties, the ones that were going to be affected the most with the delimitation* [and] *organised the issue around the youth and women* [and] *started several processes with the miners* [and] *met on a weekly basis with the Mayors and also with* [Eco Oro].\"705 However again the documentary evidence of economic and social studies was extremely limited and no documentary evidence was adduced demonstrating any collaboration of the mining authority.\n\nTr. Day 2 (Minister Sarmiento), 689:9-15.\n\n676.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes the criticisms levelled by the Constitutional Court at the Minister of Environment for the lack of public consultation undertaken. The Constitutional Court explained as follows:\n\n\"*the* [MinAmbiente] *has been vested by law with discretionary planning -regulatory/law-making powers to delimit p\u00e1ramos* [...]*. This power entails a flexible subjection to the legal system, as the authority enjoys freedom in performing such function, to an extent such that the administration need only wait for the maps prepared by the IAvH and is allowed to deviate from them if it provides a justifying reason aimed at protecting the p\u00e1ramo niche. However, the exercise of such discretionary powers is controlled by the legal system and does not entail a scenario where no law applies. In actual fact, in the p\u00e1ramo delimitation proceedings, the authorities are bound by basic rights and other constitutional principles such as the imperatives of optimising proportionality and reasonableness.*\n\n*Illustrating this premise, the Ministry must guarantee the following parameters: (i) distributive justice i.e. an equal allocation of environmental burdens in the region of the Santurb\u00e1n massif; (ii) participation in the delimitation proceeding and the planning, implementation and evaluation of measures affecting people; (iii) sustainable development through territory classification and the authorization or banning of activities; and (iv) the application of the precautionary principle in managing the area's environment.*\n\n*In connection with environmental participation, this Division notes that it must guarantee the principle's normative contents, which criteria were specified [above]. We even outlined the specifics of such right in p\u00e1ramo delimitation* [...]*. These include: (i) access to public information; (ii) public and deliberative participation by the community; and (iii) the availability of administrative and judicial remedies to enforce such rights.\"*\n\n677.\n\nThe Constitutional Court held that MinAmbiente had not respected the principle of good faith by having denied protection of the rights to environmental participation, failed to provide access to information and not ensured the community's active and deliberative participation. This finding supports the Tribunal's concerns as to the manner in which MinAmbiente enacted the delimitation.\n\n678.\n\nConsidering the above, the Tribunal does not accept that the delimitation exercise undertaken by the MinAmbiente was compliant with the requirements of Article 34 of the 2001 Mining Code and Law 1450. However, whilst MinAmbiente was found by the Constitutional Court not to have respected the principle of good faith under domestic law in certain respects in confirming the delimitation, the Tribunal finds by a majority that this does not mean the Challenged Measures themselves are of a sufficiently egregious nature to comprise a lack of *bona fides* on the part of Colombia. The importance of protecting the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems is unquestionable and there was no doubting the genuine motivation of those responsible to protect the environment. The purpose of the Challenged Measures is clearly not in bad faith and MinAmbiente's breaches in failing to consult were not directed towards Eco Oro but to the local farmers and miners. Thus, whilst the execution of the measures was not carried out in compliance with the domestic law requirements, the Tribunal does not find that such non-compliance, in itself, is sufficient to constitute a lack of *bona fides* on the part of Colombia, viewed in the context of the *bona fide* purpose of the measures and the *bona fides* of the IAvH in undertaking its analysis.\n\n679.\n\nWhen considering the proportionality of the Challenged Measures, given the Angostura Deposit only overlapped with 0.09% of the delimited Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo the Tribunal can understand that moving the boundary, so as to ensure the Angostura Deposit was not subject to the mining ban, would seem to Eco Oro a minor and insignificant change. However, the Tribunal does not accept that it was disproportionate of Colombia not to move the boundary to ensure there was no overlapping with the concession area, or not to undertake field studies to verify the delimitation where it overlapped with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. To undertake this with respect to Concession 3452 would have required Colombia to follow an alternative and unapproved methodology just for the area comprising Concession 3452, potentially to the detriment of other concession holders and other interested parties who were affected by the 2090 Atlas. Whilst the Tribunal appreciates that for Eco Oro the overlap with Concession 3452 was an insignificant part of the delimitation, the consequential ramifications could have been significant and it would have been in breach of the IAvH's integrity to change the limitation boundaries in one specific area to benefit one party. The Tribunal also accepts Ms. Baptiste's evidence that they did not have the resources to carry out the same field study checks in all areas subject to delimitation and again it would have been incorrect for the IAvH solely to carry out field studies in areas where concerns had been raised by one affected concessionaire.\n\n680.\n\nA further criticism is that even to this day the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo has not been finally delimited giving rise to considerable uncertainty. Whilst it is certainly correct that it has still not been delimited and Colombia must accept responsibility for this, it does not mean that the Challenged Measures themselves are disproportionate in the light of their purpose to protect the p\u00e1ramos. It has not been argued by Eco Oro that the p\u00e1ramos are not deserving of protection, the issue is whether the Challenged Measures are a proportionate way to achieve this.\n\n681.\n\nIn considering the Annex 811(2)(a) factors in carrying out this exercise, the Tribunal also considers whether the Challenged Measures interfered with any distinct reasonable investment-backed expectations. To determine this the Tribunal follows the test applied by the tribunals in *Methanex* and *Oxus:* did the State give specific commitments that it would refrain from the acts complained of. A distinct reasonable investment-backed expectation cannot be the same as a legitimate expectation and the Tribunal agrees with the answer given by Mr. Pape to Professor Sands at the Hearing that there must be an obligation on an investor claiming that its reasonable investment-backed expectations has been breached, to have undertaken its own due diligence before relying on any encouragement or support given by the Government in making its investment. 706\n\nTr. Day 2 (Mr. Pape), 377:13 - 379:7.\n\n682.\n\nWhilst the Tribunal appreciates that the individual permits were obtained a significant time ago and that Eco Oro had changed its corporate identity and direction in 2011707 such that it is not unreasonable that there may not now be any records of due diligence undertaken, even the most cursory due diligence even before Concession 3452 was granted would have revealed *(i)* the potential existence of a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem within the boundaries of Concession 3452; *(ii)* the Government's commitment and obligation to protect these ecosystems; and *(iii)* that such protection could be achieved by the imposition of a mining ban.708 Indeed, Eco Oro's own initial reports acknowledged the presence of p\u00e1ramos within its concession area.709\n\nSee para. 136 above.\n\nSome examples include: Colombia's (Green) Political Constitution, Article 79 which imposes on the State a legal duty to conserve areas of special ecological importance; the Biodiversity Convention; the General Environmental Law which provided that p\u00e1ramos were to be the subject of special protection; the Biodiversity Convention; the Ramsar Convention; the Programme for the Restoration and Sustainable Management of High Colombian Mountain Ecosystems: P\u00c1RAMOS which was launched in 2001 and published in February 2002, detailed the important cultural and economic functions fulfilled by the p\u00e1ramos and specified the aim of \"*special protection of p\u00e1ramos, sub-p\u00e1ramos, springs and aquifer replenishing zones;* and CORPONOR's creation of the Regional System of Protected Natural Areas for the Department of Norte de Santander on 13 July 2004 which was specified to include \"*the p\u00e1ramo areas, sub-P\u00e1ramos, springs, and aquifer recharge areas.*\"\n\nGreystar (Mr. Macedo) presents the Works Program (*Programa de Trabajo y Obras* -PTO) to INGEOMINAS (Mr. Bautista) (23 September 2009) (**Exhibit R-44 / R-84**); and Angostura Project Environmental Impact Study (December 2009) (**Exhibit C-321** (Chapter 3) / **Exhibit R-158** (Chapter 1)).\n\n683.\n\nThe potential applicability of the precautionary principle to the p\u00e1ramo should also have been understood by Eco Oro. The precautionary principle was enshrined into Colombian Law by Article 1.6 of the General Environmental Law and Article 1.4 of the same Law states that \"*the p\u00e1ramo and sub p\u00e1ramo areas, water springs and aquifer recharge zones shall be the subject of special protection\"* Constitutional Court Judgment C-293 of 2002 upheld the constitutionality of the precautionary principle such that private rights, including acquired rights, are not violated \"*if, as a consequence of a decision made by an environmental authority that, applying the precautionary principle, within the limits enshrined by the legal provision itself, decides to suspend the work or activity carried out by a private person, by way of a grounded administrative act, harm or hazard to renewable resources or human health derives therefrom, even in the absence of any absolute scientific evidence to that effect.\"*710\n\nSee reference in the Constitutional Court Judgement C-35 at page 98 citing with approval this extract from Judgement C-293 of 2002 upholding the constitutionality of section 85(20)(c) of Law 99 of 1993 providing for the application of the precautionary principle to suspend activities and works. Constitutional Court Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), para. 128.\n\n684.\n\nIn considering the consequences of this judgement, Professor Ricaurte accepted \"*as impeccable reasoning)\"* Professor Sands' summary that any investor would have known that the general right of the State to act to protect the environment prevails over the narrower particular right of the investor where the State's resources are at issue and that a lawyer advising a reasonable investor would have had to say \"*I'm bound to alert you to the possibility that, because you are investing in an area that concerns nonrenewable resource, you are subject to an overriding interest of the State to protect other interests, including environmental interests.*\"711\n\nTr. Day 4 (Professor Ricaurte), 960:7-15.\n\n685.\n\nTherefore, at the time Concession 3452 was entered into, there was already significant understanding and awareness of the importance of protecting the p\u00e1ramo and events subsequent to Concession 3452 being registered, but prior to the FTA coming into force, should further have given rise to an awareness on the part of Eco Oro of the potential for a mining exclusion ban to be imposed over a part of Concession 3452. These include the following:\n\na. In July 2007 draft Senate Bill 010 of 2007 was introduced to amend parts of the 2001 Mining Code stating that \"*the five years that have transpired since the approval of* [the 2001 Mining Code] *have allowed the detection of deficiencies which must be corrected and identification of the need to strengthen the Mining Authority in the exercise of its powers, especially its duty to manage the mining resources owned by the State in a rational and responsible manner*.\"712\n\nb. The 2007 Atlas had been published which overlapped 54% of Concession 3452.713\n\nc. On 23 November 2007 CORPONOR and the CDMB created the Berlin P\u00e1ramo Renewable Natural Resources Integral Management District.714\n\nd. In June 2008 the Santurb\u00e1n-Sisivita Regional Park was created and 7.9% of Concession 3452 overlapped it.\n\ne. By the time the FTA came into force, Laws 1383 and 1450, Resolution 937, and the Santurb\u00e1n National Regional Park had been created all of which evidenced the possibility that the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo would overlap a significant area of Concession 3452.\n\nf. There was less than a 0.2% difference between the overlap created by the 2007 Atlas and the 2090 Atlas.\n\nDraft Senate Bill No. 010 (1 November 2007) (**Exhibit R-50**).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the 2007 Atlas was published in May 2007, which was after Concession 3452 was executed but before it was registered. Whilst Article 50 of the 2001 Mining Code provides that \"[i]*n order to be concluded, and for proof thereof, it shall be registered in the National Mining Registry*\", the Tribunal also notes that the timing of this registration is entirely in the hands of Colombia and that, whilst it was not registered until after the 2007 Atlas was published, it had been executed beforehand, on 8 February 2007. It would be difficult, therefore, for Colombia to argue that there is any significance to the fact that the 2007 Atlas was published before Concession 3452 became legally effective given it was published after Eco Oro had entered into it. It was not suggested that having executed Concession 3452 Eco Oro could have withdrawn from it without penalty. Equally however it was issued many years before the FTA came into effect.\n\nCDMB Agreement No. 1103 and CORPONOR Agreement No. 17 (23 November 2007) (**Exhibit R-115**).\n\n686.\n\nIt is also clear that Eco Oro was aware that if a p\u00e1ramo was declared over any part of its concession, mining activities in such overlapping areas were at risk of no longer be permitted. This can be seen from the content of a letter dated 7 July 2011 pursuant to which Eco Oro renounced the part of its concession which overlapped with the Santurb\u00e1n-Sisivita Regional National Park not only on the basis that \"*there are no indicators that indicate the presence of precious metals in that area\"* but also because of \"*the impossibility of performing deeper exploration tasks because this is an environmentally-protected area*.\"715\n\nLetter from Greystar (Mr. Ossma G\u00f3mez) to INGEOMINAS (Mr. Neiza Hornero) (7 July 2011) (**Exhibit R- 88**).\n\n687.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that Article 46 was not a stabilisation clause and, as found by the *Consejo de Estado* in Advisory Opinion 2233 (expressly with respect to Law 1450) laws may be applied retrospectively without breaching the Constitution where it is for a public nature such as protection of the environment, albeit that there may be an obligation to pay compensation. In particular, the *Consejo de Estado* advised in section 3 of its Advisory Opinion:\n\n\"[...] *It can then be concluded for the analyzed case that Section 202 of Law 1450 of 2011, being an environmental rule of public order and social interest nature, has immediate general effect and can be applied with retrospectivity, unless there is a constitutional reason of greater weight that prevents this or demands its moderation, as will be seen later.*\"716\n\n*Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**).\n\n688.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore does not find that Colombia made any specific commitment, either in the 2001 Mining Code or the Concession itself, that there would be no retrospective mining exclusion zone imposed on any part of the concession area. Indeed, the reverse was the case, as can be seen from the Tribunal's analysis of Articles 34 and 36 of the 2001 Mining Code and from Judgement C-293 of 2002.\n\n689.\n\nDid Colombia make any other representations that gave rise to distinct, investment-backed expectations? It is correct that Colombia made representations to Eco Oro as to its support for the project. It was known by Colombia at the time Concession 3452 was granted to Eco Oro that the p\u00e1ramo overlapped with the concession area and yet not only was Concession 3452 granted to Eco Oro but Eco Oro also received significant encouragement from a number of different State bodies that it would be permitted to undertake exploitation activities throughout its concession area. For example, Eco Oro says that President Santos expressed his support at a meeting Eco Oro attended with him and his Chief of Staff in February 2016 during which he encouraged Eco Oro to apply for its environmental licence as soon as possible so that the Project could be showcased as a post p\u00e1ramo delimitation success story.717 Whilst the only evidence of what was apparently said by President Santos was given by Mr. Moseley-Williams, it was not denied that this meeting took place. Indeed, two years before Concession 3452 was executed, the Vetas-California Mining District was created to attract foreign mining investment.\n\nFirst Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 41.\n\n690.\n\nThe Project was designated both a PIN and a PINE at various times to enable Eco Oro to receive \"*special support*\" to move the Project forward, as publicly confirmed by the then Minister of Mines (Mr. Gonzalez) in March 2015718 in the context of Colombia's efforts to attract foreign mining investment.\n\nStatement made at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (\"**PDAC**\") Annual Convention. Article The Northern Miner \"PDAC 2015: Mines Minister says Colombia is picking up the pace\" (25 March 2015) (**Exhibit C-222**), p. 2.\n\n691.\n\nEco Oro itself received significant encouragement from MinMinas, which was keen to encourage mining companies to enter into mining concessions as a much-needed contribution to the country's economy. As well as actually being awarded Concession 3452, which clearly anticipated the possibility of exploitation activities in the totality of the concession area, Eco Oro says it received full support from the Minister of Mines immediately after the issuance of Resolution 2090,719 According to Mr. Aldana, the day after Resolution 2090 was published, the Minister of Mines pledged his full support to assist Eco Oro in advancing the Project.720\n\nFirst Gonz\u00e1lez Aldana Statement, para. 123.\n\nFirst Gonz\u00e1lez Aldana Statement, para. 123.\n\n692.\n\nIndeed, Eco Oro attended many meetings with Government officials in preparation for the environmental licensing process yet at no point did the relevant Government agency give any indication that the Project would not be possible as a result of the p\u00e1ramo delimitation. None of these events gave Eco Oro any indication that the Project would not be possible as a result of the p\u00e1ramo delimitation.\n\n693.\n\nEven after Judgment C-35 was published, it was clear to Eco Oro that notwithstanding uncertainty as to its effect, MinAmbiente and MinMinas, the ANM and the Attorney General still believed that mining activities would be permitted in Concession 3452 and positively encouraged Eco Oro to maintain that belief.\n\n694.\n\nIt is concerning that Eco Oro received such support from parts of the government of Colombia at a time when Colombia was both well aware of the presence of the p\u00e1ramo within the concession area and was fully conversant with its obligations to protect the p\u00e1ramo given its commitment to protect the p\u00e1ramo. However, the Tribunal does not find these representations constitute specific commitments not to impose a mining exclusion zone in the area of Concession 3452; rather, they comprised nothing more than general expressions of support for the project. Given Eco Oro's apparent failure to undertake any due diligence before relying on such representations as were made to it by Colombia, the Tribunal does not find Eco Oro had any distinct reasonable investment backed expectations that exploitation would be permitted in the entirety of the concession area. The Tribunal appreciates that Eco Oro's failure to undertake due diligence would not have enabled it to predict Colombia's breach of its own, constitutionally mandated obligations to protect the p\u00e1ramos, but this *per se* is not relevant to whether Colombia made a specific commitment to Eco Oro that it would not subsequently prevent mining in any part of the concession.\n\n695.\n\nThe Tribunal finally turns to consider where there are any other circumstances that it should consider in determining Colombia's *bona fides* in designing and implementing the Challenged Measures. In this regard the Tribunal questions whether Colombia should bear any responsibility for its role in attracting investments through the enticement of a concession based on the agreement between the State and a private party in connection with an activity the legal regime of which is unilaterally controlled by the State and for its actions in granting Concession 3452. If Eco Oro should have been aware of the presence of p\u00e1ramo, surely all parts of the State machinery should also have been aware: the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was first identified as p\u00e1ramo as early as 1851.721 If Eco Oro is to be criticised for not understanding the potential implications of generalised statements as to environmental protection on the scope and validity of its concession rights, prior to entering into the Concession, so too should Colombia. Colombia should have understood that it should not grant concession rights over such environmentally sensitive land. If the State did not have this foresight, it cannot be right to expect Eco Oro to have had it.\n\n\"El tal p\u00e1ramo de Santurb\u00e1n s\u00ed existe\", La Silla Vac\u00eda (8 September 2014) (**Exhibit R-110**).\n\n696.\n\nFurther, surely Colombia should have anticipated (in compliance with its basic political and social obligations) the clash of interests between different sectors of its population (as testified by Minister Sarmiento) which in substantial part accounts for the State's meandering decisions regarding the p\u00e1ramo. This cannot be held to be the responsibility of Eco Oro and nor should Eco Oro be penalised for this. Eco Oro could not have anticipated through due diligence the immense confusion in the applicable legal regime created by the contradictory State decisions and changing positions of different State organs, including from the highest courts of the land, on vital State and international environmental matters, such as the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo, impacting on a natural resource invaluable for Colombia and the World.\n\n697.\n\nIt is also of concern that as a result of Colombia's actions having implemented Resolution 2090, there have been instances of illegal mining in the area of Concession 3452 which have not been prevented by Colombia and which pose a significant threat to the protection of the p\u00e1ramo.\n\n698.\n\nThe Tribunal must weigh in the balance all these factors in determining whether Colombia's actions in designing and applying the Challenged Measures were *bona fide*. Taking a step backwards, it is clear there was an (inevitable) tension between the needs of environmental protection and economic development and (as explained by the *Consejo de Estado* in its Advisory Opinion 2233) Colombia had to weigh up the balance between the private interest and the prevalence of the general interest; pursuing the protection of one could not always similarly protect the other. Does the failure of Colombia at all times to respect its obligations to preserve and protect the p\u00e1ramo in its interactions with Eco Oro rise to the level of a lack of *bona fides*? Whilst it is clear that there may have been failings, at times significant failings, on the part of Colombian State organs and officials in the manner in which they have sought to comply with their domestic and international obligations with respect to the protection of the p\u00e1ramo, the Tribunal's task under Annex 811(2) is to consider the Challenged Measures and not to judge Colombia's actions or its failure to act to preserve the p\u00e1ramo. As stated by Canada, \"[...] *bona fide non-discriminatory regulatory measures to protect the environment even if they are based on precaution (i.e. in dubio pro ambiente) will ordinarily not require compensation even if they affect the value and/or viability of an investment of an investor of another Party\"**722* The Tribunal accepts that there was a lack of clarity as to the meaning or effect of Resolution 2090, Judgment C-35, Resolution VSC 829 and Decision T-361 such that even now there is still no clarity as to whether or not there is a valid mining exclusion zone over any part of Concession 345 and no final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo has been effected. The Tribunal also notes that notwithstanding the Constitutional Court's ruling in Decision T-361 that the delimitation carried out could be modified in the event of errors and the direction to delimit the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo within one year, this has still not been undertaken with the consequence that any errors which may have had such a deleterious effect on Eco Oro remain uncorrected. However, the Tribunal asks itself: do these measures amount to a measure that is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith? By a majority, the Tribunal does not find that the necessary element of severity is present given the undoubted *bona fide* purpose of these Challenged Measures and the overall proportionality of the current boundary of the delimitation when viewed against a reasonable (albeit not unanimous) scientific conclusion as to the need to include a Transition Zone in the delimited area, the size of the resulting p\u00e1ramo and the need to adopt a consistent methodology for the entirety of the area delimited. The fact that this does not result in compensation, notwithstanding that under Colombian law an acquired right cannot be expropriated without the payment of compensation, does not mean there was indirect expropriation for the purposes of Article 811. Given the measures were adopted as a part of Colombia's valid and legitimate exercise of its police powers, pursuant to Annex 811(2)(b), under international law, no compensation is payable.\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 11.\n\n699.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal therefore does not find the Challenged Measures to have been so severe that they cannot be reasonably viewed as having been undertaken in good faith. The majority of the Tribunal finds that they were motivated both by a genuine belief in the importance of protecting the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and pursuant to Colombia's longstanding legal obligation to protect it. In sum, the Challenged Measures were adopted in good faith, are non-discriminatory and designed and applied to protect the environment such that they are a legitimate exercise of Colombia's police powers and do not constitute indirect expropriation.\n\n**E.** **A****rticle** **805** **of the** **T****reaty and** **M****inimum** **S****tandard of** **T****reatment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n700.\n\nArticle 805 of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n*\"(1) Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. The concepts of 'fair and equitable treatment' and 'full protection and security' do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.*\n\n*(2) The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide 'fair and equitable treatment' includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process.*\n\n*(3) A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.*\"723\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**). Footnote 2 to Article 805 of the FTA provides that \"[i]*t is understood that the term 'customary international law' refers to international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law, in accordance with subparagraph 1(b) of Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.*\"\n\n701.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the factual matrix and many of the legal arguments contained in the Parties' submissions with respect to Eco Oro's claim that Colombia is in breach of Article 805 of the FTA are the same as those referred to in the Parties' submissions with respect to Eco Oro's claim for breach of Article 811. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not repeat these submissions either in its summary of the Parties' positions or in its analysis of the merits of Eco Oro's claim.\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n*(i) Colombia Failed to Accord Eco Oro's Investment Fair and Equitable Treatment and Full Protection and Security*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n702.\n\nThe acts and omissions of the Colombian State referred to above do not comply with customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\").\n\n703.\n\nColombia cannot rely on the content of the Commission's Decision724 that specifies a claimant bringing a claim under Article 805 has *\"the burden to prove a rule of customary international law invoked under Article 805, through evidence of elements of customary international law referred to in footnote 2 of Chapter Eight.\"* Footnote 2 provides that customary international law refers to international custom as evidence of a general practice accepted as law, in accordance with subparagraph 1(b) of Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. This decision was rendered nearly one year after this arbitration was commenced and is therefore inapplicable pursuant to Article 28 of the VCLT as it cannot retroactively modify Article 805. Even if it did apply, Colombia is wrong to say that Eco Oro has not proved the content of the MST it relies upon through the elements of customary international law, namely State practice and *opinio juris.* Eco Oro relied upon the decisions of international tribunals which are an acceptable source for establishing the existence and substance of rules of customary international law.725\n\nJoint Commission of the Free Trade Agreement Between the Republic of Colombia and Canada, Decision No. 6 (24 October 2017) (**Exhibit R-139**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 414 *et seq.*\n\n704.\n\nThe International Law Commission (\"**ILC**\")'s study on the accepted sources of customary international law found that crucial evidence of State practice includes conduct in connection with treaties and that *opinio juris* may be ascertained through \"*public statements made on behalf of States;* [...] *treaty provisions; and conduct in connection with resolutions adopted by an international organisation or at an intergovernmental conference*.\"726 Additionally, decisions of international courts and tribunals are acceptable sources for determining customary international law. For example, as stated by Professor Reisman \"[...] *the same formulas recur in many other BITs that are then interpreted by tribunals. Where there is a convergence of practice and opinio juris among a significant number of such tribunals, it may serve as evidence of customary international law. Hence, in the context of customary international law in investment law, BITs and decisions of tribunals adjudicating the disputes arising from these investment treaties have come to play a significant role in the ongoing formation of law in this field. These two sources are particularly important* [...] *because much of international investment law is developed through them - they represent State practice and opinio juris in this area of law*.\"727\n\nInternational Law Commission, *International Law Commission Report on the Work of the Seventieth Session* (A/73/10) (2018) (**Exhibit CL-195**), pp. 140-41.\n\nW.M. Reisman, \"Canute Confronts the Tide: States versus Tribunals and the Evolution of the Minimum Standard in Customary International Law\", Vol 30 ICSID Review (2015) (**Exhibit CL-185**), pp. 620, 622.\n\n705.\n\nColombia is also incorrect to say that the customary international law MST is still rooted in *Neer*728; this standard has been overtaken such that the relevant standard is that investments of aliens are protected from, *inter alia,* unfair and inequitable treatment. As explained by Professor Weiler in the Oxford Handbook on International Investment Law:\n\n*\"From the perspective of the investor, the promise of 'fair and equitable treatment', or the prohibition found in some BITs against discriminatory or arbitrary interference, also amounts to a guarantee of freedom from arbitrariness or caprice in discretionary decision making. A customary international law formulation of the same freedom, conferred as a right in the treaty context, is the prohibition against abuse of authority (or abus de droit). Professor Bin Cheng devoted an entire chapter of his renowned treatise on the principles of international law to the manner in which the doctrine of abuse of rights rises, as understood in international law generally, from the general international law principle of good faith* [...]*.*\"729\n\n*L. F. H. Neer v. United Mexican States* (\"***Neer***\"), Award, IV RIAA 60 (15 October 1926) (**Exhibit RL-46**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 430; T.J. Grierson-Weiler and I.A. Laird, \"Chapter 8: Standards of Treatment\" in: P. Mulchinski, F. Ortino and C. Schreuer (eds), *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law* (2008), (**Exhibit CL-46**), pp. 284-285.\n\n706.\n\nIn addition, treaty practice demonstrates that the fair and equitable treatment language was equivalent to the international minimum standard, as the connection is drawn between FET and customary international law in a number of treaties and model BITs of Canada, Colombia and the United States as well as the IISD Model International Agreement on Investment for Sustainable Development. Whilst repetition of treaty language on its own may be insufficient to give rise to a binding customary international law obligation, FET is distinct because it is almost universally included in contemporary treaties with similar language, model BITs and has been identified in a number of treaties as being a component of the MST under customary international law. This leads to the conclusion that FET has become a widely recognised standard for the treatment of foreign investors and constitutes a part of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.\n\n707.\n\nFinally, case law also supports this conclusion. The ordinary meaning of the FET standard is a broad concept that cannot be summarised in a precise statement of legal obligation allowing for independent and objective determination of whether it has been reached. Many tribunals have expressed the view that there has been a substantive convergence of the FET standard and the MST under customary international law. For example, in *Waste Management II,* the tribunal concluded that \"*the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.\"*730\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 450; *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award (30 April 2004) (**Exhibit RL-64**) (\"***Waste Management***\"), para. 98. See also *Merrill & Ring Forestry LP v.

Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/4, Decision on Liability and Principles of Quantum (22 May 2012) (**Exhibit CL-179**) (\"***Mobil***\").\n\n708.\n\nThere is therefore little material difference between MST under customary international law and the FET standard. To the extent this is not accepted, Article 804 guarantees that Colombia will accord Canadian investors and their investments \"*treatment no less favourable\"* than that which it accords to the investments of any other country. In its bilateral investment treaty with Switzerland, Colombia ensures the *\"fair and equitable treatment\"* of investments made by Swiss investors without reference to the minimum standard of treatment.731\n\nAgreement between the Republic of Colombia and the Swiss Confederation on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (17 May 2006; entered into force on 6 October 2009) (**Exhibit C-106**), Art. 4(2).\n\n709.\n\nThis standard has been described by an international arbitral tribunal as requiring States:\n\n\"[T]*o provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations. [...] The foreign investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the State that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and business activities.\"* 732\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 400; *Tecmed*, Award (29 May 2003) (**Exhibits CL-22 / RL-61**), para. 154.\n\n710.\n\nAs it is a broad concept, conduct that is *\"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic or is discriminatory*\"733 is in breach of this obligation and Colombia is required to follow an approach that is: \"*just*\", *\"even-handed\", \"unbiased\"* or \"*legitimate*.\"734 Tribunals applying FET as part of customary international law have generally converged on interpretative criteria, including that a State must, *inter alia, (i)* not frustrate an investor's legitimate expectations; *(ii)* provide a stable and transparent legal and regulatory environment; and *(iii)* act in good faith and not in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, disproportionate or the like. With respect to this third limb, the principle of good faith is a central tenet to the minimum standard of treatment and Eco Oro relies upon the same arguments as it does with respect to Colombia's breaches of Article 811: Colombia must not frustrate Eco Oro's legitimate expectations and must act in good faith incorporating the concepts of fairness, transparency, (non)arbitrariness, clarity, (non)ambiguity and predictability.\n\n*Mobil*, Decision on Liability and Principles of Quantum (22 May 2012) (**Exhibit CL-179**), paras. 152-153.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 305; *Azurix*, Award (14 July 2006) (**Exhibit CL-35**), para. 360; *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA, and Vivendi Universal SA v.

Firstly, it breached Eco Oro's legitimate expectations to explore and exploit in the entirety of Concession 3452. Eco Oro had received Colombia's encouragement for over 20 years and its rights were legitimate as they were premised upon explicit or implicit assurances or representations, contained in:\n\na. Permit 3452;\n\nb. The 1988 Mining Code, particularly Article 1 (the Code was enacted to \"*encourage investment in* [the mining] *industry, and promote the development of the regions where* [mining activities] *are carried out*\"), Article 6 (\"[p]*ermits and licences granted by means of a duly enforceable resolution, that remain in force and valid as of the date of the entry into force of this Code\"* constitute acquired rights) and Article 9 (environmental zones could not apply retroactively to previously issued titles);\n\nc. The 2001 Mining Code, particularly Article 46 (a stabilisation clause); and\n\nd. Concession 3452, particularly Clause One.\n\n713.\n\nAs explained above, it is incorrect that Eco Oro should have been aware both that it may not have had access to all parts of Concession 3452 for the duration of the concession or of the difficulties it would face in successfully obtaining an environmental licence. None of the instruments referred to by Colombia (the General Environmental Law, the P\u00e1ramo Programme and the 2007 Atlas) amounted to a restriction on mining activities in the area of Concession 3452 and as a function of Colombia's measures, Eco Oro was deprived of the right to attempt to meet the applicable environmental licensing requirements during the term of the concession which was an acquired right.\n\n714.\n\nThe legitimacy of its expectations is reinforced by the Colombian law doctrine of *confianza leg\u00edtima* which protects expectations formed by commitments or assurances given by the Government from subsequent Government actions that undermine those expectations (as referred to by the Attorney General in his letter to both the Ministries of Mines and Environment and also to the ANM urging the delimitation process to respect existing and acquired mining rights so as not to incur State liability.735\n\nLetter from Attorney General (Mr. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez Maldonado) to Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Mines and National Mining Agency (9 September 2013) (**Exhibit C-28**).\n\n715.\n\nThese expectations were formed each time Eco Oro took a decisive step towards the \"*creation, expansion, development, or reorganisation of the investment*.\"736 It was reasonable for Eco Oro to rely on these assurances that purported to have a stabilising effect. As stated by Professor Reisman and Dr. Arsanjani: \"[w]*here a host state which seeks foreign investment acts intentionally, so as to create expectations in potential investors with respect to particular treatment or comportment, the host state should* [...] *be bound by the commitments and the investor is entitled to rely upon them in instances of decision.*\"737\n\n*Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award (12 November 2010) (**Exhibit CL-67**), para. 287.\n\nW.M. Reisman and M. H. Arsanjani, \"The Question of Unilateral Governmental Statements as Applicable Law in Investment Disputes\" 19(2) ICSID Review 328 (2004) (**Exhibit CL-25**), p. 342.\n\n716.\n\nThese legitimate expectations were frustrated by those Government measures described in detail with respect to Eco Oro's arguments above in relation to the breach of Article 811, but in summary: *(i)* Resolution 2090; *(ii)* Judgement C-35; *(iii)* VSC 829; and *(iv)* the opinions and decisions issued by the ANM indicating mining would be prohibited in the Restoration Zone as well as the Preservation Zone.\n\n717.\n\nThe FET standard also requires Colombia to maintain a stable and transparent investment environment in accordance with Eco Oro's legitimate expectations and enabling Eco Oro to plan its business and investments in an orderly fashion.\n\n718.\n\nColombia failed to provide this. As described in more detail with respect to Colombia's breach of Article 811, the delimitation was arbitrary, inconsistent and confusing, such that Eco Oro has been on a regulatory roller coaster and Colombia has not provided a stable legal and business environment. Colombia's failures are numerous. Specific examples include its failure to delimit the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems in the Santurb\u00e1n area as required by Law 1450 for more than four years at all times exhibiting an absolute lack of transparency, preventing Eco Oro from understanding the legal status of its investment in the Angostura Project. Even the Attorney General of Colombia complained of the *\"legal uncertainty\"* caused by this failure to map out p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. The delay in the delimitation was followed by opaque and constantly changing rules with respect to Eco Oro's ability to carry out mining activities within the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.\n\n719.\n\nThe principle of stability and predictability also protects against \"inconsistency of action between two arms of the same government vis-\u00e0-vis the same investor\"738 which requires a government to act \"coherently and appl[y] its policies consistently.\"739\n\n*MTD Equity*, Award (25 May 2004) (**Exhibit CL-26**), para. 163.\n\n*Garanti Koza LLP v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/20, Award (19 December 2016) (**Exhibit CL- 89**), para. 381.\n\n720.\n\nColombia's measures have not been applied coherently nor consistently and there has been inconsistency between the different government bodies which has affected Eco Oro's capability to take any material decision with respect to its investment. These acts have been described in detail above but comprise*, inter alia:*\n\na. The delays to releasing the delimitation coordinates;\n\nb. the Project being designated a PIN and PINE;\n\nc. the suspension of mining activities being lifted over the entirety of Concession 3452 after Resolution 2090 was issued;\n\nd. the failure of CDMB to issue the detailed environmental guidelines and environmental management plans for the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, or carry out the zoning required or issue an environmental management plan as required by Article 5 of Resolution 2090;\n\ne. the fact Eco Oro was unable to carry out all the provisions of Law 1753 in the absence of the environmental guidelines required by Article 5 of Resolution 2090 being issued;\n\nf. Judgement C-35 only striking down the grandfathering provisions in Law 1753 but not referring to the equivalent grandfathering provisions in Resolution 2090;\n\ng. the failure of the Constitutional Court to provide clarification of the state of the law, notwithstanding the request from the ANM and Minister of Environment;\n\nh. inconsistent decisions and communications from MinAmbiente and ANM with respect to where mining activities were and were not permitted;\n\ni. unreasonable and arbitrary rejections of Eco Oro's requests for further suspensions of the deadline to complete the exploration phase and apply for an environmental licence;\n\nj. the confusion resulting from the striking down of Resolution 2090; and\n\nk. the final refusal to grant an extension to Eco Oro to file its PTO until such time as the new delimitation was complete; although the time for publishing the new delimitation was extended, Eco Oro was not given a concomitant extension by the ANM.\n\n721.\n\nNot only is a transparent and stable legal and business environment a component of the obligation of FET, it is also a cornerstone of the FTA. The Preamble provides that the Contracting Parties resolve to ensure a \"*predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment.\"* Colombia cannot refer to any legal authority or other support for its contention that \"*regulatory change taken specifically for the purposes of enhancing and/or enforcing environmental laws and regulations cannot therefore, in any view, violate the minimum standard in the absence of very specific undertakings to the contrary*.\"740\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 406.\n\n722.\n\nFinally, Colombia has failed to act in good faith which is inherent in FET as it acted arbitrarily, capriciously and disproportionately. 741 Arbitrariness occurs where \"*a measure* [is not] *based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference.*\"742A measure also must be reasonable and thus proportionate, requiring the existence of a rational policy against which to measure the proportionality.\n\n*Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award (12 November 2010) (**Exhibit CL- 67**), para. 297.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 505, quoting *EDF*, Award (8 October 2009) (**Exhibit CL-174**), para. 303.\n\n723.\n\nColombia breached Article 805 by enforcing Resolution 2090, which was arbitrary and shambolic. There is no evidence of the socioeconomic studies having been undertaken, and the transition zone is not a part of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem but is a different ecosystem and therefore should not have been included in the delimitation. Colombia delimited the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo without undertaking the necessary field work, in breach of its methodology; this is particularly egregious in the area including the Angostura Project which was historically a mining district and where there had been significant foreign investment from Eco Oro and others. This is particularly so given the Angostura Deposit covered only 0.09% of the total area of the delimited Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. Colombia also failed to delimit the p\u00e1ramo in accordance with specific criteria but just traced a line, most often near the lower limit of the Transition Zone, but sometimes deviating to include areas which were neither in the p\u00e1ramo nor in the Transition Zone. MinAmbiente accepted the IAvH delimitation without scrutiny and yet it has been criticised by the Constitutional Court both in Judgement C-35, for lacking adequate scientific criteria in certain respects,743 and Judgement T-361, for inadequate consultation. The Court further took note of MinAmbiente's concession that serious errors had been made in the delimitation process.744\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), paras. 140, 180.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (**Exhibit C-244**), p. 261.\n\n724.\n\nImplementation of Resolution 2090 was also disproportionate as the IAvH delineated a different ecosystem to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and Eco Oro was particularly affected by this. IAvH's own data shows that the Angostura Deposit does not lie within a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. Only approximately 6% of the deposit lies within the actual p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, 65.11% lies within the Transition Zone (which is not a part of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem) and the remaining 29% is outside both the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and the Transition Zone. However, the delimitation pursuant to the 2090 Atlas neutralised 32.4% of the deposit area.\n\n725.\n\nThere are other less stringent measures which could have been adopted by Colombia such as not including the Transition Zone in the area delimited, conducting field studies which would have shown that Concession 3452 was not in a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, adopting the ECODES Report, or allowing Eco Oro to present its project and EIA to the environmental authorities and allowing them to determine the compatibility of the Project with the requisite environmental requirements. This could not have been undertaken invoking the precautionary principle as that can only be invoked where there exists a specific and scientifically proven risk of serious or irreversible harm; the mere existence of a risk being insufficient.\n\n726.\n\nFurther elements of bad faith are displayed by Colombia's significant delay in undertaking the delimitation exercise and then withholding in bad faith the coordinates for many months even after the exercise had been completed (as determined by the Constitutional Court in Judgement T-361). Since Judgement C-35, the Government has failed to give any clarity to Eco Oro as to what is permissible in the Restoration Zone nor what is the status of the remaining part of Concession 3452 which does not overlap the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. Notwithstanding that Eco Oro was advised on two occasions that so long as the regulatory uncertainty persisted, the Project would be unlicensable, Colombia refused to suspend Eco Oro's obligations pending resolution of the regulatory uncertainty.\n\n727.\n\nColombia also issued arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable regulatory decisions and orders, specifically (as explained in more detail in respect of Eco Oro's arguments as to Colombia's breach of Article 811):\n\na. The ANM's refusal in Resolution VSC 906 on 22 August 2017 of Eco Oro's 7 March 2017 request for a suspension of its obligations pending clarification regarding the scope of its remaining rights;\n\nb. The ANM's rejection in Resolution VSC 343 on 16 April 2018 of Eco Oro's appeal against VSC 906;\n\nc. The ANM's extension for Eco Oro to file its PTO to coincide with the date when the revised delimitation was issued but then the refusal to agree a further extension concomitant with the extended date by which the re-delimitation was to be issued;\n\nd. The ANM's notification of 14 February 2019 ordering Eco Oro to submit its PTO within 30 days, the failure to do so leading to rendering the Concession liable to forfeiture.\n\ne. In addition, without Eco Oro's knowledge or consent, Colombia granted rights to a third-party (i.e., Minesa) to tunnel through Concession 3452.\n\n728.\n\nIn summary, Colombia's acts and omissions have failed to satisfy Eco Oro's legitimate expectations that Colombia would respect the solemn stability commitments established in its 2001 Mining Code and apply in a consistent and non-arbitrary manner the Political Constitution and laws of Colombia in place at the time when it made its investments. Colombia has consequently breached Article 805 of the FTA.\n\n***(b) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n*(i) Colombia Treated Eco Oro's Investment in Accordance with the Minimum Standard of Treatment Under Customary International Law*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n729.\n\nIt is clear from the text of footnote 2 to Article 805 that both FET and FPS under this Article do not require treatment \"*in addition to or beyond*\" the MST.\n\n730.\n\nEco Oro has firstly failed to prove the content of the standard it is relying on by reference to State practice and *opinio juris* pursuant to the Commission's Decision. The fact the Commission's Decision was issued after the commencement of this arbitration is irrelevant; it merely confirms the meaning of the FTA as it existed upon entering into force.\n\n731.\n\nInvestment treaty tribunal decisions are not acceptable sources, at best they only reflect State practice and *opinio juris.*745 This can be seen in Canada's non-disputing party submission in *Bear Creek.*746 Eco Oro cannot rely on decisions of tribunals interpreting an autonomous FET standard that is not qualified by customary international law in order to prove the existence of rules of customary international law.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 428; *Cargill, Incorporated v.

All the cases cited by Eco Oro relate to tribunals applying the autonomous FET standard, not the MST under customary international law, and the Tribunal should disregard those cases not decided on the MST standard.\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission in *Bear Creek* (9 June 2016) (**Exhibit RL-174**); and United States' Non-Disputing Party Submission in *Gramercy Funds Management LLC, And Gramercy Peru Holdings LLC v.

Colombia does not say that *Neer* still defines the standard for Eco Oro to meet but it does remain relevant to the interpretation of the MST FET standard and numerous tribunals subsequently have confirmed that the bar is high.751\n\n*Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v. Sultanate of Oman*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/33, Award (27 October 2015) (**Exhibit RL-154**); *Glamis*, Award (8 June 2009) (**Exhibit CL-59**); *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Award (26 January 2006) (**Exhibit RL-69**).\n\n735.\n\nAs already detailed above with respect to Eco Oro's claim for breach of Article 811, Colombia did not provide any specific or unambiguous assurances to Eco Oro that it would be permitted to mine in the p\u00e1ramo area of Concession 3452. As Eco Oro did not have any legitimate expectations, none could be frustrated.\n\n736.\n\nColombia's policy of protecting the p\u00e1ramo was consistent; there was no regulatory turmoil. In particular, even if there was a delay in publishing the 2090 delimitation, it did not cause legal uncertainty for Eco Oro as the MinAmbiente was not required to issue its delineation within any specific timeframe and merely gave advance notice to the mining companies as a matter of courtesy. It published the delineation when it was ready to do so and Eco Oro has not challenged this and in any event it was 99% identical to the 2007 Atlas. The delay in the CDMB publishing the guidelines is also irrelevant as Eco Oro has no grandfathered rights so would have been unable in any event to prepare a PTO for approval. Equally, all the measures relating to the grandfathering provisions are irrelevant to Eco Oro.\n\n737.\n\nMinAmbiente and ANM's communications and decisions in relation to the treatment of the Restoration Area were neither inconsistent nor confusing as Eco Oro was never informed it would be able to mine in the Restoration Zone.\n\n738.\n\nThe ANM always responded to Eco Oro in a prompt and responsible manner and was justified in denying Eco Oro's request for an indefinite suspension pending the re-delineation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.\n\n739.\n\nEco Oro has adduced no credible evidence to support its contentions and it is clear that all arms of the government were working together towards one paramount goal, protecting the p\u00e1ramo.\n\n740.\n\nThe FPS standard does not include legal protection and security as stated in the Commission's Decision and in any event this is clear as has been endorsed by numerous tribunals such as *Crystallex, Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA and Vivendi Universal SA v. The Argentine Republic* and *Gold Reserve Inc v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.*\n\n741.\n\nFinally, Colombia did not act arbitrarily, capriciously or disproportionately. The Resolution 2090 delimitation was not shambolic, nor disproportionate and ANM's decisions were all fully and properly justified.\n\n742.\n\nIn any event, given the substantial deference which should be given to Colombia's right to balance important policy decisions with those of private parties, to accept Eco Oro's claims would be for the Tribunal to second-guess Colombia's decision-making. It is not appropriate for a host State to be required to elevate unconditionally the interests of a foreign investor above all other considerations, where there is no evidence of irrationality or bad faith.752 Clearly, Colombia had the right not to elevate unconditionally the interests of Eco Oro above the well-being of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 462-464, citing *Electrabel S.A. v. the Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability (30 November 2012) (**Exhibit RL-153**), para. 8.35; and *Charanne and Construction Investments v.

The Tribunal must therefore ascertain what that level comprises and then apply it to the facts.\n\n744.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Tribunal does not accept that the meaning of MST under customary international law must remain static. The meaning must be permitted to evolve as indeed international customary law itself evolves;753 it should be understood today to include today's notions of what comprises minimum standards of treatment under customary international law. Colombia correctly accepts that the Tribunal is not rigidly bound by the standard set out in *Neer*754 and it is the Tribunal's view that the standard today is broader than that defined in the *Neer* case.755\n\nSee, e.g., *Merrill*, Award (31 March 2010) (**Exhibit CL-176**), para. 193: \"*customary international law has not been frozen in time and that it continues to evolve in accordance with the realities of the international community. No legal system could endure in stagnation.*\"\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 441; *Neer*, Award, IV RIAA 60 (15 October 1926) (**Exhibit RL-46**).\n\nSee, e.g., *Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award (22 September 2014) (**Exhibit RL-96**), para. 567: \"*It is the Tribunal's view that public international law principles have evolved since the Neer case and that the standard today is broader than that defined in the Neer case*\"; *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award in Respect of Damages (31 May 2002 (not on the record), paras. 57-65; \"*The Tribunal rejects this static conception of customary international law* [\u2026] *It is a facet of international law that customary international law evolves through state practice. International agreements constitute practice of states and contribute to the grounds of customary international law.* [\u2026] *since the 1920's, the range of actions subject to international concern has broadened beyond the international delinquencies considered in Neer to include the concept of fair and equitable treatment.* [\u2026] one must conclude that the practice of states is now represented by those treaties [i.e., BITs]\"; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Arbitral Award (26 January 2006) (**Exhibit RL-69**), para. 194 (\"*The content of the minimum standard should not be rigidly interpreted and it should reflect evolving international customary law.*\"); *Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. The Argentina Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Award (21 July 2017) (**Exhibit CL-193**), para. 666 (\"*The minimum standard of treatment is a customary international law principle that sets out the obligations owed by a State to aliens and, as such, evolves over time as State practice and opinio juris changes to include today's notions of minimum standards.*\").\n\n745.\n\nThe Tribunal also accepts that Colombia is under no obligation to exceed this standard and, as it is not considering an autonomous treaty standard of FET but a \"minimum\" standard, the Tribunal further accepts the obligation should not be interpreted expansively. The Tribunal does not, however, accept that footnote 2 to Article 805 limits it as to what sources the Tribunal may refer to as evidence in analysing the meaning of MST under customary international law; the concept has been considered by several tribunals and where the Tribunal finds it to be of assistance in ascertaining what is the current meaning of MST under customary international law, it considers those decisions which it finds to be relevant. As stated by the tribunal in *Merrill*756*\"State practice and opinio juris will be the guiding beacons of this evolution*.\"\n\n*Merrill*, Award (31 March 2010) (**Exhibit CL-176**), para. 193.\n\n746.\n\nIn construing Article 805, the Tribunal is again guided by Article 31 of the VCLT,757 such that it is necessary to *\"interpret*[] [it] *in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the* [FTA] *in their context and in light of its object and purpose\"*.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S 331 (**Exhibit CL-3**).\n\n747.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of 'fair' and 'equitable' is *\"just\" \"even-handed\" \"unbiased\"* and \"*legitimate.*\"758 Thus, actions that infringe a sense of fairness, equity and reasonableness will fall afoul of Article 805.\n\nCfr., *inter alia*, *MTD Equity*, Award (25 May 2004) (**Exhibit CL-26**), para. 113, citing to the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, fifth edition; *Saluka*, Partial Award (17 March 2006) (**Exhibits CL-104** / **RL-71**), para. 297.\n\n748.\n\nThe Preamble to the FTA provides that its purpose is, inter alia, to *\"ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment*\" and \"*enhance and enforce environmental laws and regulations, and to strengthen cooperation on environmental matters.\"* Applying the ordinary meaning of Article 805 to the object and purpose of the FTA (as relevant to Eco Oro's claim), Eco Oro was entitled to expect that Colombia would treat its investment in an even-handed and just manner to ensure a predictable business environment and foster the promotion of foreign investment but that, in doing so, it would ensure the enhancement and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, such that neither investment protection nor environmental protection takes precedence.\n\n749.\n\nThis does not mean that Colombia was under an obligation to guarantee that the domestic regulatory environment would remain stable. The Tribunal has found that Concession 3452 did not contain a stability clause and it accepts that a State cannot be rigidly bound to those rules and regulations in force at the time the investment is made. Indeed, as noted by the tribunal in *Mobil Investments*:\n\n*\"This applicable standard does not require a State to maintain a stable legal and business environment for investments, if this is intended to suggest that the rules governing an investment are not permitted to change, whether to a significant or modest extent. Article 1105 may protect an investor from changes that give rise to an unstable legal and business environment, but only if those changes may be characterized as arbitrary or grossly unfair or discriminatory, or otherwise inconsistent with the customary international law standard. In a complex international and domestic environment, there is nothing in Article 1105 to prevent a public authority from changing the regulatory environment to take account of new policies and needs, even if some of those changes may have far-reaching consequences and effects, and even if they impose significant additional burdens on an investor. Article 1105 is not, and was never intended to amount to, a guarantee against regulatory change, or to reflect a requirement that an investor is entitled to expect no material changes to the regulatory framework within which an investment is made. Governments change, policies changes and rules change. These are facts of life with which investors and all legal and natural persons have to live with. What the foreign investor is entitled to under Article 1105 is that any changes are consistent with the requirements of customary international law on fair and equitable treatment. Those standards are set at, as we have noted above, at a level which protects against egregious behaviour.*\"759\n\n*Mobil*, Decision on Liability and Principles of Quantum (22 May 2012) (**Exhibit CL-179**), para. 153. See also *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award (11 September 2007) (**Exhibit RL-75**), para. 332: \"*It is each State's undeniable right and privilege to exercise its sovereign legislative power. A State has the right to enact, modify or cancel a law at its own discretion. Save for the existence of an agreement, in the form of a stabilisation clause or otherwise, there is nothing objectionable about the amendment brought to the regulatory framework existing at the time an investor made its investment. As a matter of fact, any businessman or investor knows that laws will evolve over time. What is prohibited however is for a State to act unfairly, unreasonably or inequitably in the exercise of its legislative power*.\"\n\n750.\n\nWhilst *Mobil Investments* was an arbitration under NAFTA, the Tribunal agrees with the principle that Article 805 cannot act as a restraint upon Colombia's legitimate ability to regulate matters within its borders.\n\n751.\n\nThe Tribunal further understands it is inevitable that, in exercising its police powers, a State will find itself at times having to make difficult and potentially controversial choices, particularly when considering issues of environmental protection and public health. The Tribunal therefore agrees with the tribunal's statement in *Cargill* that \"*an actionable finding of arbitrariness must not be based simply on a tribunal's determination that a domestic agency or legislature incorrectly weighed the various factors, made legitimate compromises between disputing constituencies, or applied social or economic reasoning in a manner that the tribunal criticises*.\"760 In determining whether Colombia's actions were in breach of Article 805, the Tribunal therefore does not seek either to second-guess Colombia's decision-making nor to judge the calibre of the administration of Colombia's governmental programmes.761 Equally, deference to the State's powers cannot require the Tribunal to condone actions that would otherwise comprise a breach of Article 805.\n\n*Cargill*, Award (18 September 2009) [Redacted] (**Exhibit RL-81**), para. 292.\n\nSee, e.g., *Philip Morris*, Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Gary Born (8 July 2016) (**Exhibit RL-102**), para. 137: \"*It is important to recognize that the fair and equitable treatment standard, and the protection against arbitrary measures, does not empower this, or any other, tribunal to second-guess legislative or regulatory judgments. On the contrary, it is well-settled that the judgments of national regulatory and legislative authorities are entitled, under the fair and equitable treatment guarantee, to a substantial measure of deference.*\"; *TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/17, Award (19 December 2013) (**Exhibit CL-184**), para. 493: \"*although the role of an international tribunal is not to second-guess or to review decisions that have been made genuinely and in good faith by a sovereign in the normal exercise of its powers, it is up to an international arbitral tribunal to sanction decisions that amount to an abuse of power, are arbitrary, or are taken in manifest disregard of the applicable legal rules and in breach of due process in regulatory matters.*\"\n\n752.\n\nEco Oro contends that good faith and the prohibition of arbitrariness are basic obligations of international law and the Tribunal is satisfied that FET encompassing concepts of non-arbitrariness, transparency and fairness are recognised elements of customary international law within the confines of reasonableness. Article 805 encapsulates the *bona fide* obligation upon a State and, as such, constitutes a guarantee to investors that whilst regulatory changes may be made, any such changes will be consistent with the requirements of FET under customary international law and not made in an arbitrary or otherwise egregious fashion. The regulatory changes effected by Colombia will therefore amount to a breach of Article 805 if Colombia has acted in a way which is *\"arbitrary or grossly unfair or discriminatory, or otherwise inconsistent with the customary international law standard*\"762always bearing in mind how these terms are understood in the context of customary international law.\n\n*Mobil*, Decision on Liability and Principles of Quantum (22 May 2012) (**Exhibit CL-179**), para. 153.\n\n753.\n\nA similar approach has been followed by other tribunals. For example, the tribunal in *S.D. Myers*763 noted that the starting point for analysis is that such a violation occurs *\"only when it is shown that an investor has been treated in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective. That determination must be made in the light of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.\"* Although a case determined under NAFTA regarding a breach of Article 1105, this supports the proposition that there is a high threshold for finding a violation of the MST.\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award (13 November 2000) (**Exhibit RL-55**), para. 263.\n\n754.\n\nReviewing past decisions, concepts such as transparency, stability and the protection of the investor's legitimate expectations play a central role in defining the FET standard, as does procedural or judicial propriety and due process and fairness, refraining from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures, or from frustrating the investor's reasonable expectations with respect to the legal framework affecting the investment. Unjust or idiosyncratic actions,764 a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards, or even subjective bad faith have all been found to be in breach of FET. 765 A State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith.766\n\n*Waste Management*, Award (30 April 2004) (**Exhibit RL-64**), para. 98; *Saluka*, Partial Award (17 March 2006) (**Exhibits CL-104 / RL-71**), para. 288; *TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v.

The conduct in question must engender a sense of outrage or shock, amount to gross unfairness or manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable standards,767 or there must have been a lack of due process which has led to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety. 768 The treatment complained of must therefore be unacceptable from an international perspective whilst set against the high measure of deference that international law extends to States to regulate matters within their own borders.\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v.

Tribunals have wrestled with the meaning of 'arbitrary' and 'arbitrariness.'\n\n757.\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, 'arbitrary' means *\"*[d]*ependent on will or pleasure\"* or *\"*[b]*ased on mere opinion or preference as opposed to the real nature of things, capricious, unpredictable, inconsistent.*\"769 A similar definition is found in Black's Law Dictionary which defines the word 'arbitrary' as \"[d]*epending on individual discretion; of, relating to, or involving a determination made without consideration of or regard for facts, circumstances, fixed rules or procedures*\" and 'arbitrary' (of a judicial decision) is defined as *\"founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact.\"*770\n\nSee also Oxford English and Spanish Dictionary, Synonyms, and Spanish to English Translator, available at https://www.lexico.com, where 'arbitrary' is defined as \"[b]*ased on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system*\".\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary, 9th ed. (2009), p. 119.\n\n758.\n\nThe starting point for this analysis is the decision of the International Court of Justice in *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.* (*\"****ELSI****\"*)*:*\n\n*\"Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law. This idea was expressed by the court in the Asylum case, when it spoke of 'arbitrary action' being 'substituted for the rule of law'* [...]*. It is a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.\"*771\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI)* (*United States of America v. Italy*), 1989 I.C.J. 15, 76 (Judgment of 20 July 1989) (**Exhibits CL-153 / RL-50**), para. 128. See also *Asylum Case (Colombia v. Peru)*, [1950] ICJ Reports 266 (Judgment of 20 November 1950) (**Exhibit RL-139**), para. 284, cited to in *ELSI*: \"*In principle, therefore, asylum cannot be opposed to the operation of justice. An exception to this rule can occur only if, in the guise of justice, arbitrary action is substituted for the rule of law. Such would be the case if the administration of justice were corrupted by measures clearly prompted by political aims. Asylum protects the political offender against any measures of a manifestly extra-legal character which a government might take or attempt to take against its political opponents. The word \"safety\", which in Article 2, paragraph 2, determines the specific effect of asylum granted to political offenders, means that the refugee is protected against arbitrary action by the government, and that he enjoys the benefits of the law*\".\n\n759.\n\nIn considering what is meant by a sense of juridical propriety, the Tribunal again turns to the definitions contained in the Oxford English Dictionary and Black's Law Dictionary. There is no definition of 'juridical impropriety' in Black's Law Dictionary. The Oxford English Dictionary defines 'impropriety' as \"*the quality of being improper\"* such that there is a *\"want of accordance with the nature of the thing, or with reason or rule, incorrectness, erroneousness, inaccuracy*\" or \"*want of accordance with the purpose in view; unsuitableness, unfitness, inappropriateness.\"* Turning to Black's Law Dictionary, impropriety is \"*behaviour that is inappropriate or unacceptable under the circumstances*.\"\n\n760.\n\nOf further guidance are the indicia of arbitrary measures which were formulated by Professor Christoph Schreuer when acting as an expert in *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*772 and which have been cited with approval, most recently773 by the tribunals in *Teinver v.*\n\n*Argentina,*774*Glencore v. Colombia,*775 and *Global Telecom v. Canada.*776 These indicia are:\n\na. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose;\n\nb. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice, or personal preference;\n\nc. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision-maker; and\n\nd. a measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.\n\n*EDF*, Award (8 October 2009) (**Exhibit CL-174**), para. 303.

As determined in *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, \"even if a measure or conduct by the State, taken in isolation, does not rise to the level of a breach of the FET, such a breach may result from a series of circumstances or a combination of measures.\"* 777\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc. v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award (31 October 2011) (**Exhibit CL-73**), para. 459. On point is also the *dictum* in *William Ralph Clayton and others v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2009- 04, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability (17 March 2015) (**Exhibit RL-18**), para. 593: \"*Canada is one entity for the purposes of NAFTA responsibility. There is a saying that sometimes 'the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing'. For the purposes of state responsibility the combined impact of its left hand and right hand can be determinative even if the actions of either in isolation do not rise to the level of a breach.*\" See also *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sayani A.\u015e. v. Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award (27 August 2009) (**Exhibit RL-79**), para. 181 (\"*a breach need not necessarily arise out of individual isolated acts but can result from a series of circumstances, and that it does not presuppose bad faith on the part of the State*\").\n\n762.\n\nTo establish a violation of Article 805, Eco Oro must therefore firstly show that Colombia either *(i)* breached Eco Oro's legitimate expectations as such expectations were, or should have been, informed by the exercise of due diligence; or *(ii)* failed to provide at all times a stable and transparent investment environment; or *(iii)* did not act in good faith as required by international law. Secondly, if such a breach is found, it must be determined whether Colombia's actions are unacceptable from an international law perspective.\n\n763.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to apply this standard to the facts.\n\n***(a) Legitimate Expectations***\n---------------------------------\n\n764.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that Colombia did not make any specific representations to Eco Oro that it would not bring in a mining exclusion ban in any part of Concession 3452 with retrospective effect. Did Eco Oro have other legitimate expectations that were frustrated by Colombia? Eco Oro says that Colombia created its legitimate expectations and induced its investment, referring to the mining permits it obtained which were consolidated into Concession 3452, the Concession itself, and the legislation pursuant to which the permits and Concession 3452 were issued.\n\n765.\n\nIn the context of considering whether Colombia is in breach of Article 811, the Tribunal determined by a majority that Eco Oro did not have any investment-backed legitimate expectations on the basis that the statements made in Permit 3452 and the 1988 Mining Code did not constitute legitimate representations on which Eco Oro could rely in making its investment. The Tribunal has also determined by a majority that Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code is not a stabilisation clause and, had Eco Oro undertaken appropriate due diligence, it would have been advised that Colombia could retrospectively impose a mining ban on all or part of Concession 3452 to protect a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem.\n\n766.\n\nHowever, Eco Oro says Colombia made other representations. It granted Concession 3452 to Eco Oro in full knowledge that a significant part of the concession area overlapped the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo (there was a general awareness of the existence of p\u00e1ramo in the area where Concession 3452 was granted since 185 1 778), that mining exploitation activities were being conducted in the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo area (and indeed had been for centuries779) and of the likely adverse effect of mining on the p\u00e1ramo which it had accepted responsibility to protect pursuant to Law 373 of 1997,780 the General Environmental Law,781 Articles 8, 58, 79 and 80 of the Political Constitution,782 as well as the environment-related international conventions it had signed up to such as the Ramsar Convention783 and the Biodiversity Convention.784 Indeed the Constitutional Court observed in Judgement T-411/92785 that Colombia had a \"[...] *duty to safeguard the environment due to a fundamental constitutional right.\"* Thus, at the time Concession 3452 was granted to Eco Oro in 2007, Colombia knew both that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo existed and that it had an obligation to protect it. Colombia could have chosen not to grant a mining concession over this area. Colombia had the power to delimit the p\u00e1ramo and, pursuant to section 16 of Law 373 of 1997, it was obliged to acquire p\u00e1ramo areas such as the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo \"*as a priority\"*786 as well as to initiate a recovery, protection and conservation process to ensure protection of the p\u00e1ramo. However, Colombia did not take the necessary action it was legally required to take to protect the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo; instead, it granted a mining concession over the area in question. Indeed, notwithstanding Colombia's obligation to protect p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, the Tribunal notes there was a considerable increase in the granting of mining titles in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems between 1990 and 2009 with an approximate consequential 555% increase in investments in the mining sector.787\n\nArticle La Silla Vac\u00eda \"El tal p\u00e1ramo de Santurb\u00e1n s\u00ed existe\" (8 September 2014) (**Exhibit R-110**).\n\nSee Constitutional Court Judgment No. T-361 (30 May 2017) (**Exhibit C-244**), e.g., pp. 214-215, where the Constitutional Court acknowledges that gold mining \"*has always been connected to* [the great Department of Santander] *and its populations*\".\n\nLaw No. 373 of 1997 (6 June 1997) (**Exhibit C-68**).\n\nLaw No. 99 of 1993 (General Environmental Law) (22 December 1993) (**Exhibit C-66**).\n\nPolitical Constitution of Colombia (1991) (**Exhibit C-65**).\n\nRamsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (2 February 1971) (**Exhibit RL-31**).\n\nDecree No. 205 of 1996 (29 January 1996) (**Exhibit R-54**).

Examples include statements to the effect that Colombia supported the Project and wanted to ensure successful exploitation as the Angostura Project was a 'VIP' project, on one occasion from President Santos and, on other occasions, from various ministers and other government officials. Further, the repeated nominations of Concession 3452 as a PIN/PINE all led to Eco Oro's understanding that the Angostura Project was supported by Colombia. Given these circumstances, Eco Oro's belief that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo did not overlap the Angostura Deposit, as concluded by the ECODES report, is therefore reasonable and gave rise to a legitimate expectation that the Angostura Project was supported by Colombia.\n\n768.\n\nCould reliance on these representations have been displaced by due diligence? Whilst there is no evidence on the record of the due diligence actually undertaken by Eco Oro, it cannot be disputed that proper due diligence would have notified Eco Oro of the presence of p\u00e1ramo within the area of the Concession. Equally, due diligence would have alerted Eco Oro to the fact that p\u00e1ramo presence had been known to Colombia since 1851788 and Eco Oro would also have been alerted to the fact that Colombia had had the duty to protect p\u00e1ramo ecosystems since Law 373 of 1997 but had not taken any action. Eco Oro should also have been aware that given the terms of Constitutional Court Judgment C-293 of 2002, its rights pursuant to Concession 3452 were subject to the overriding interests of the State to protect the environment. Against this, however, Eco Oro should also have been aware of Article 58 of the Political Constitution, the Colombian law principle of *'confianza leg\u00edtima'* (legitimate expectation) and Colombian law relating to acquired rights (such as Eco Oro's right to exploitation) which, as confirmed by the *Consejo de Estado* in its Advisory Opinion 2233, ensures that in the event of a retroactive application of the law leading to loss of an acquired right, compensation must be paid, such compensation including compensation for actual damages suffered as well as certain future losses and the loss of a chance.\n\n\"El tal p\u00e1ramo de Santurb\u00e1n s\u00ed existe\", La Silla Vac\u00eda (8 September 2014) (**Exhibit R-110**).\n\n769.\n\nIn weighing up the various factors, it is also relevant to note that Colombia encouraged foreign miners into the country and held up Eco Oro as an example of a successful investor. These statements were clearly made to encourage foreign investment, although again basic due diligence would have alerted any potential investor of the need to clarify whether the proposed concession overlapped any suspected p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and of the potential risk of a mining exclusion ban being imposed. Indeed, a disclaimer was included in the December 2015 brochure published by the ANM,789 alerting investors to the risk that the applicable rules could be amended at any time and that prospective investors should verify whether the proposed title was or was not within the prohibited areas for mining and/or in an environmental exclusion zone.\n\nNational Mining Agency Brochure \"Exploring Opportunities\" (December 2015) (**Exhibit C-294**), p. 4.\n\n770.\n\nIn considering Eco Oro's legitimate expectations, regard must also be had to the object and purpose of the FTA: Colombia was obliged to ensure a predictable business environment. Indeed, predictability is essential in enabling an investor properly to plan its business strategy and ensure its compliance with the rules and regulations which will govern its business. Eco Oro was entitled to an expectation that \"*its business may be conducted in a normal framework free of interference from Government regulations which are not underpinned by appropriate policy objectives\"*790 whilst recognising that Colombia could not be rigidly bound to those rules and regulations in force at the time the investment was made.\n\n*Merrill*, Award (31 March 2010) (**Exhibit CL-176**), para. 233.\n\n771.\n\nEqually, Eco Oro was not entitled to any guarantee of success: mining is inherently uncertain and given the nature and location of the project it must have been foreseeable to Eco Oro that it would inevitably face significant challenges in seeking successfully to explore and then exploit the concession area, but such anticipated challenges would have related to the nature of the project itself and not to Colombia's actions.\n\n772.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is Colombia's failure to comply with its legal obligations to delimit the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo pursuant to the provisions of Colombian law. Did Colombia ensure that the regulatory changes it both instituted and, of equal relevance, failed to institute with respect to the designation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo were consistent with its treaty obligations to ensure a predictable business environment and with the requirements of customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, and not made in an arbitrary or otherwise egregious fashion?\n\n773.\n\nSince at least 1991, Colombia has been subject to a legal duty to conserve areas of special ecological significance791 as evidenced by its signatory of the Biodiversity Convention in 1992 and the passing of the General Environmental Law. Colombia has thus committed itself to the protection of the p\u00e1ramo and its actions were, it submits, undertaken pursuant to its obligation to protect the p\u00e1ramo. The FTA also emphasises this environmental obligation. Any analysis of whether Colombia's actions, viewed as a whole, were the result of reasoned judgement and were related to and reasonably proportionate to Colombia's articulated objectives or were instead arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic must be undertaken in this context.\n\nPolitical Constitution of Colombia (1991) (**Exhibit C-65**), Art. 79.\n\n774.\n\nThe existence of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo had been known since 1851 and although Colombia had been under an obligation to delimit and acquire all p\u00e1ramos since the passing of Law 373 in 1997, at the time the Concession was granted in 2007, the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo had not been delimited. Further, whilst Colombia was aware that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo overlapped at least a part of Concession 3452, it took no steps to issue a mining exclusion zone over this area at the time the Concession was granted. At the time Eco Oro made its investment, Colombia had therefore failed to comply with its constitutional obligations to protect the p\u00e1ramo.\n\n775.\n\nSince Concession 3452 was granted and to this day, no lawfully compliant final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo has been effected, such that the legal status of the p\u00e1ramo remains in a state of paralysed confusion. Colombia was and is well aware of the temporary nature of the delimitation; for example, the ANM concluded in Resolution VSC 4 (issued on 12 September 2012)792 that the 2007 Atlas delimitation was only temporary and the suspension of the mining activities in those areas identified as p\u00e1ramo would be maintained *\"until the* [MinAmbiente] *issues the final delimitation to a scale of 1:25,000.\"* This recognition that the delimitation is temporary in nature can also be seen from the Attorney General's Video Tweet on 12 February 2018 when he stated that Colombia was \"[...] *working towards the paramo's delimitation before the end of the current administration.*\"\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution No. VSC-4 (12 September 2012) (**Exhibit C-25**).\n\n776.\n\nIt is also clear that some of Colombia's actions appear to facilitate or support mining in areas of p\u00e1ramo; for example, Decree 2820 (5 August 2010) provides, *inter alia*, that environmental licences could be issued for mining exploitation activities in special ecosystems, including p\u00e1ramo areas (Article 10). Again, whilst Colombia says that ANM's designation of Concession 3452 as a PINE on 22 February 2011 (and again on 19 June 2013) was due to the potential environmental implications of the Project, the express wording of the designation provides that it is given not only due to the relevant project's *\"environmental impact\",* but also on the basis, *inter alia,* of its *\"social importance\"* and \"*its important reserves destined for international markets*.\"793 Indeed, of the seven criteria listed (a project must meet at least one to be designated a PINE) only one relates to the environmental impact of the project whilst the remaining six relate to economic and socio-economic reasons (the declaratory resolution does not state the reasons for which the PINE designation was awarded to Concession 3452). It is unclear whether the Project was designated a PINE due to its economic importance to Colombia or for reasons of environmental sensitivity.\n\nINGEOMINAS, Resolution No. DSM-28 (22 February 2011) (**Exhibit C-19**).\n\n777.\n\nThe failure to carry out a delimitation at 1:25,000 also means that the inevitable errors in both the 2007 Atlas and the 2090 Atlas remain uncorrected such that the Angostura Deposit cannot be said with any certainty to be within the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. Ms. Baptiste explained that the 2007 Atlas was not a delimitation and was so large scale and imprecise that the area of Concession 3452 was *\"invisible.\"*794 It is inevitable that the 2007 Atlas would have given rise to significant confusion as to what mining activity would be permitted and where it would be permitted within the concession area. Again, the ANM noted in Resolution VSC No. 4 that \"*it cannot be said with complete certainty, due to the absence of technical parameters, that* [the concession area] *is located within the p\u00e1ramo\".*795\n\nTr. Day 3 (Ms. Baptiste), 730:13-18.\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution No. VSC-4 (12 September 2012) (**Exhibit C-25**).\n\n778.\n\nIt is also uncontroversial that the lengthy and continuing delay in publishing a final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo led to considerable uncertainty for Eco Oro and indeed for the mining industry more generally, as to what mining operations would and would not be permissible in potentially affected areas. This can be seen, for example, from a letter dated 9 September 2013 written by the then Colombian Attorney General, Alejandro Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez Maldonado, to the Minister of Mines, the Minister of the Environment and the President of the ANM.796\n\nLetter from the Attorney General to the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Mines and National Mining Agency (9 September 2013) (**Exhibit C-28**).\n\n779.\n\nThe Attorney General noted that pursuant to Law 1450 the mining sector was one of the cornerstones for the financing of the Development Plan and that \"[t]*he many reforms required by the State to make the mining industry the 'locomotive' contributing to Colombian prosperity were based on this assumption.\"* He further noted that there was a responsibility under the Constitution to develop mining in a responsible manner, however, he then referred to the failure of the Environment Ministry to delimit the p\u00e1ramos (and also its failure to delimit the reserve forests which failure continued even 54 years after the enactment of the relevant law) and stated that this delay had *\"hindered not only the execution of mining activities in these areas but also the implementation of social measures by the State* [...].\" He then explained that these delays and consequential issues:\n\n\"*created an uncertain legal environment that resulted in the discussion becoming ideological, which made it seem in some respects that the development of an environmentally responsible mining industry is incompatible with the conservation of the environment, which criminalizes the activity, exaggerating its effects and creating suspicions about any decision taken by the mining or environmental authorities.*\"797\n\nLetter from the Attorney General to the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Mines and National Mining Agency (9 September 2013) (**Exhibit C-28**), p. 4.\n\n780.\n\nThe Attorney General concluded by stating as follows:\n\n\"*In short, the Ministries and ANM are hereby compelled to take appropriate action in order to:*\n\n*1. Coordinate efforts to comply with their obligations as established by law and the Constitution;*\n\n*2. Whenever possible and as mandated by the Political Constitution, settle existing queries given that there are mining areas that had been granted to black and native communities in some of the areas intended to be regulated;*\n\n*3. Avoid ideologization of the debate and make decisions based on comprehensive supporting studies;*\n\n*4. Regularly share any progress made in the zoning and delimitation process for the sake of transparency;*\n\n*5. Recognize any consolidated situations and vested rights to prevent the filing of legal claims against the Colombian state;*\n\n*6. The National Mining Agency is required to proceed with caution to refrain from rejecting proposals or terminating agreements if there are conditions - such as the decisions made by the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development - that may threaten citizens and companies that, relying on the principle of confianza leg\u00edtima, have approached the State to propose or develop mining concessions.*\"798\n\nLetter from the Attorney General to the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Mines and National Mining Agency (9 September 2013) (**Exhibit C-28**), p. 5.\n\n781.\n\nIt can be seen that Colombia's inconsistent approach continued, however. Whilst Minister Sarmiento announced on 30 November 2013 that the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo had been completed, she did not publish the coordinates. Instead, although she had announced that the coordinates had been agreed, she then initiated consultations with affected communities, an action which contributed to the Constitutional Court's finding of bad faith on the part of the Environment Ministry. Even after these consultations had concluded, the coordinates were still not released. On 30 March 2014, Minister Sarmiento announced she would be publishing the coordinates to put an end to the uncertainty, but although a map was published, it did not contain coordinates. Instead, Minister Sarmiento publicly stated that the delimited p\u00e1ramo would be four times bigger than Santurb\u00e1n Park and that there was an overlap between Concession 3452 and the delimited p\u00e1ramo. Whilst Eco Oro says it was advised that the official coordinates would be released \"*in the coming days\"* this still did not transpire. Minister Sarmiento then announced the coordinates would be published by 1 August 2014 but again this did not happen and shortly thereafter Minister Sarmiento was replaced as Minister of Environment by Mr. Gabriel Vallejo, the fifth environment Minister in less than four years.\n\n782.\n\nThe uncertainty and confusion as to what the parameters of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo should be can also be seen from the following. Whilst the IAvH was progressing with the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, it submitted a formal opinion to the CDMB as a part of the process by which the CDMB created the Santurb\u00e1n Park on 16 January 2013. Eco Oro's submission during this arbitration to the effect that this Park comprised 11,700 hectares and only overlapped with a small fraction of the Angostura Deposit and would not have impeded its development was not contested. Article Two of CDMB's Decision declaring this Regional National Park, noted that the preservation purposes for which the Park was declared included the preservation of the *\"ecosystems of the p\u00e1ramo, sub p\u00e1ramo and Andean forest\"* and to *\"guarantee the connectivity of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and the High Andean forests of the Santurb\u00e1n ecoregion, which extend up to the department of Norte de Santander.\"*799Article Four expressly provided that no mining exploration or exploitation activities could be authorised in the Santurb\u00e1n Park. The Tribunal notes that Ms. Baptiste wrote to the Mayors of each of the affected regions advising that whilst the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo and the delimitation of a Regional Park are different processes from a legal and technical standpoint, she was *\"certain that the lines of both figures will be similar because they involve a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem* [...].\"800 It is therefore not only inconsistent but also no explanation has been given why, when the coordinates were released as the 2090 Atlas, the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo at 98,950 hectares was approximately eight times bigger than the Santurb\u00e1n Park resulting in approximately 50.7% of Concession 3452 laying within the preservation area, 3.9% within the restoration area, 32% of the surface area of the Angostura Deposit overlapping with the preservation area and 28% located beneath it.\n\nCDMB Directing Council Agreement 1236 (16 January 2013) (**Exhibit C-175**).\n\nLetter from IAvH (Ms. Baptiste) to the Mayor of Vetas and others (30 October 2013) (**Exhibit C-189**).\n\n783.\n\nThe 2090 Atlas also did not satisfy the requirements of the 2001 Mining Code and therefore did not create a permanent mining exclusion zone as it was not a delimitation for the purposes of the 2001 Mining Code. Whilst it must have been clear to Eco Oro (and to the mining community and local population) that when the 2001 Mining Code compliant delimitation was finally undertaken, it was likely that it would be no smaller in overall size than the 2090 Atlas, given *(i)* that the Angostura Deposit only comprised 0.1% of the overall delimited area;801 *(ii)* Colombia accepted there was a 5-13.9% margin of error802 in determining where the boundary should lie and the margin of error could be as much as 150 meters in altitude in certain areas, because the *\"quality of the information has limitations\";*803 and *(iii)* there were clear errors in the 2090 Atlas boundaries with towns included within the boundaries, Eco Oro cannot have been expected to assume with any certainty that the Angostura Deposit would be determined to be within a mining exclusion zone. This clearly would have given rise to uncertainty as to in which parts of Concession 3452 Eco Oro could undertake mining activities.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, para. 199; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, para. 235.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 258.\n\nMinistry of Environment Presentation, \"Delimitaci\u00f3n del P\u00e1ramo de Santurb\u00e1n\" (December 2014) (**Exhibit C-217**).\n\n784.\n\nThis confusion as to whether the Angostura Deposit would or would not fall within the delimited area can only have been compounded by subsequent acts of the government and its officials. Firstly, the Minister of Mines gave Eco Oro a pledge of full support to assist it in advancing the Angostura Project.804 The Tribunal notes no evidence was adduced by Colombia to dispute this and Mr. Aldana was not cross-examined on this point.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Wilmer Gonz\u00e1lez Aldana, para. 123.\n\n785.\n\nSecondly, although a further two-year extension was granted for the exploration phase limited to that area of Concession 3452 which did not overlap the p\u00e1ramo (Resolution VSC 727 dated on 6 August 20 1 4),805 only 5 months later, pursuant to Resolution VSC 3 (dated 6 January 20 1 5),806 the ANM lifted the suspension on mining activities in the totality of Concession 3452, basing its decision on the following conclusion reached by the *\"Office of the Vice-President of Mining Supervision, Control and Safety (Technical Opinion No. VSC-088 of November 22, 2013)\":*\n\n*\"3. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS*\n\n*3.1. After review of the technical considerations submitted by the company holding title with respect to the requested stay of exploration activities, it is hereby deemed technically feasible to grant such request because the arguments raised by ECO ORO are found to be reasonable. Indeed, to conduct hydrogeological and geotechnical studies, information should be gathered* ***both in unrestricted and in restricted areas****, for the construction of the hydrogeological model is highly relevant to this project, due to the environmental implications it has,* ***considering the location of the contract area having an impact on the p\u00e1ramo, which relates to the aquifer recharging zone and its location on the La Baja Creek basin, a tributary of the Surata river.*** *The Geotechnical Model is based on the Geological and Structural and the Hydrogeological Models, and similarly require* ***a comprehensive evaluation of the rock massif that is part of both the restricted and unrestricted areas****.*\n\n*A pending water concession application, and the difficulty caused by the lack thereof for the development of exploration activities, constitutes an additional argument in support of the foregoing, given that the alternatives ECO ORO considered are economically unfeasible, a situation which negatively impacts on the execution of the exploration program.**\"*807 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution VSC No. 727 (6 August 2014) (**Exhibit C-212**).\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution VSC No. 3 (6 January 2015) (**Exhibit C-35**).\n\nAs cited in National Mining Agency, Resolution VSC No. 3 (6 January 2015) (**Exhibit C-35**). Technical Opinion No. VSC-88 of 22 November 2013 is not available on the record.\n\n786.\n\nThirdly, Concession 3452 was again designated a PINE and in March 2015 the then Minister of Mines, Mr. Tomas Gonzalez stated publicly in March 2015 at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (\"**PDAC**\") Annual Convention that:\n\n\"[PINEs such as Eco Oro] *will receive special support from the government so that they can move forward as fast as possible. Under the new system, the responsible ministers meet every week and look at the projects with that designation, and see how each one is progressing. The meetings include the ministers of Mines and Energy, Environment, Defence, Labour and the Interior. We sit around the table and look at what issues face each project, and then assign tasks to the various ministers. In the following meeting, we then evaluate each task, and see how the project has progressed. [...] We need to make sure these projects happen, because we need royalties for development.*808\n\nArticle The Northern Miner \"PDAC 2015: Mines Minister says Colombia is picking up the pace\" (25 March 2015) (**Exhibit C-222**).\n\n787.\n\nThis statement is against a backdrop of Colombia's efforts to attract foreign mining investment. In the previous annual PDAC Conference, in early 2012, the Minister of Mines had referred to \"*a transition to a new era in which mining and energy are going to lead economic growth for the coming decades.*\"809\n\nArticle Dinero \"Colombia tranquiliza a inversionistas sobre futuro de la miner\u00eda\" (3 June 2012) (**Exhibit C- 162**).\n\n788.\n\nFourthly, the new four-year national development plan, Law 1753 of 2015, declared that the CIIPE may confer PINE status upon projects regarded as being of social interest and serving a public purpose and that PINES would be subject to licensing and administrative processes before national rather than regional authorities.810\n\nLaw No. 1753 (9 June 2015) (**Exhibit C-36**).\n\n789.\n\nFinally, on 8 February 2016, Eco Oro received support for Concession 3452 from President Santos who explained Eco Oro should apply for its environmental licence as soon as possible to enable Colombia to \"*showcase*\" the Angostura Project as a post-p\u00e1ramo delimitation 811 success story.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Moseley-William's testimony was not challenged in this regard by Colombia.\n\n790.\n\nIt cannot be said that the purpose of these actions of Colombia was in support of its stated aim to protect the p\u00e1ramo; it is clear they were supporting and facilitating the continuation of the Angostura Project. Had protection of the p\u00e1ramo been Colombia's aim, it would have ensured delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was completed reasonably promptly and in a manner compliant with the 2001 Mining Code. It is not unreasonable that on the basis of the above, Eco Oro believed that Colombia was supportive of the project and that the regulatory framework would enable it to proceed to explore and exploit the Angostura deposit.\n\n791.\n\nGiven this and given what then happened as described below, the Tribunal finds Eco Oro's description of being on a regulatory roller-coaster to be apt.\n\n792.\n\nThe same day that President Santos expressed his support, the Constitutional Court issued a press release announcing it had reached a decision on the challenge to Law 1753, striking down as unconstitutional certain provisions, including Article 173(2) of Law 1753 such that MinAmbiente could only deviate from the IAvH's mapping insofar as it could scientifically demonstrate that its decision would result in a higher degree of protection of the p\u00e1ramo (Judgment C-35). It is clear that this press release exacerbated the already present confusion amongst both the mining and environmental authorities and provided no clarity as to whether or not mining activities could be carried out in Concession 3452. The position was not assisted as the actual judgment was not released for several months after the press release.\n\n793.\n\nThe extent of this confusion can be seen from the statement of the then Minister of Mines, German Arce Zapata in his speech to the third National Mining Congress that \"*we have been left in a very serious situation: there are many norms and we do not know what the rule is. We fill legal loopholes with decrees.* [...] *The Court is breaking a golden rule by legislating. The Court is legislating and laws are made by Congress.*\"812 In its request to the Constitutional Court for clarification (which request was denied), the ANM noted that:\n\n\"*The Constitutional Court itself understands that its decision may be controversial and decides in favor of the protection of p\u00e1ramos given the ecosystem fragility that makes them extremely vulnerable to human intervention and mining or hydrocarbon activities.*\n\n*Nonetheless, the Constitutional Court admits there is a wide array of mining methods, and sustains that proper environmental monitoring could mitigate mining adverse effects.*\n\n*This leads to a practical legal problem:* ***the decision of the Constitutional Court, regardless of its relative and surmountable nature, thanks to the use of increasingly sophisticated methods or systems aiming at guaranteeing environmentally friendly and sustainable respectful mining as well as the application of increasingly efficient monitoring tools, could result in the acceptance of mining even in fragile ecosystems such as p\u00e1ramos.***\n\n*The paragraphs declared unenforceable were intended to promote the above: tolerance for mining under environmental neutral conditions, guaranteed through administrative acts that made exploration and mining conditional on the observance of strict environmental protection standards by those title holders that obtained said titles before the entry into force of the legal prohibition of mining in p\u00e1ramos.*\n\n*In a state governed by the rule of law, a legislative decision that responded to an initiative of the Executive smoothly translated into an act of government: not allowing mining in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems unless a prior mining contract has been executed.*\n\n*The existence of a mining contract forced the Legislature and the Executive to permanently safeguard public heritage from potential monetary claims for wrongful damage attributable to the Legislature. At the same time, the rule provided for the protection of the ecosystem through legal instruments such as the issuance of environmental licenses and the implementation of monitoring tools.* [...]\n\n*Notwithstanding the above,* ***the Court has handed down its opinion and it is final. Legal enforcement agencies such as the Mining Authority are now abiding by a legal provision that, as certain subsections of the first paragraph of Article 173 of Law No. 1753 are no longer enforceable, amounts to an absolute interference with contractual rights and affects, from a mining point of view, contracts executed, and investments made, under the regulations in force at the time, which could potentially cause unlawful damages to those who, on the basis of the contract, and legitimate expectations [confianza leg\u00edtima], carried out investments which could be deemed to have been indirectly expropriated, as a consequence of the unconstitutionality decision****.*\n\n*Evidently, this situation raises national and international concerns in light of investment protection treaties.* ***Therefore, the judgment handed down by the Constitutional Court needs to be clarified so that the applicable (environmental, mining or hydrocarbon) enforcement agency can perform its duties in a proper manner and in compliance with the law, through the implementation of the administrative act that best suits the purpose of protecting the p\u00e1ramo, at all times mitigating the potential damage that may be caused to those adversely affected by the declaration of unconstitutionality***.\"813 [Tribunal's emphasis]\n\n\"Sector minero crece pese a la amenaza de la inseguridad jur\u00eddica\", El Mundo [English Translation] (11 May 2017) (**Exhibit C-243**).\n\nLetter from the National Mining Agency to the Constitutional Court seeking clarification on the consequences of Constitutional Judgment C-35 (24 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-44**).\n\n794.\n\nEco Oro sought clarification from both the ANM and ANLA as to the effect of this judgment on its concession but none was forthcoming. The Tribunal does not find this surprising given the obvious confusion this judgment created in both MinMinas and MinAmbiente as well as in the ANM and indeed more widely. This can be seen, for example, from the unchallenged evidence of Mr. Moseley-Williams814 and from a statement from the Environment Minister in March 2016, that pursuant to Judgement C-35, all existing environmental licenses shall \"*cease to be in force*\" and that they were working with MinMinas \"*to make a decision regarding* [mining] *titles currently in force to have them terminated on the basis of the Constitutional Court decision.*\"815 Again, in a letter dated 11 May 2016, MinAmbiente advised that by analogy with Judgement C-35, the grandfathering provision in Law 1753 must be treated as having \"*disappeared from the legal framework since*\" Judgement C-35 was entered.816\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mark Moseley-Williams, paras. 46-47.\n\n\"Miner\u00eda: \u00bfseguridad jur\u00eddica o soberan\u00eda?\", El Espectador (26 March 2016) (**Exhibit C-227**).\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Environment (Mr. Rinc\u00f3n Escobar) to (Ms. Figueroa Cort\u00e9s) (11 May 2016) (**Exhibit C-231**).\n\n795.\n\nIt is further clear that there was utter confusion as to whether mining activities were permitted in the restoration and sustainable use areas of the p\u00e1ramo. The relevance of this for Eco Oro was that the Restoration Zone covered nearly 30% of the area of the Angostura Deposit.\n\n796.\n\nThis confusion can be seen from the following differing and untransparent approaches of MinMinas, MinAmbiente, CIIPE and the ANM:\n\na. MinAmbiente advised that restoration areas in traditional mining communities and sustainable use areas were not encompassed by the prohibition enacted by Judgment C-35.\n\nb. The approach of MinMinas and the ANM was not consistent with MinAmbiente's approach (indeed it was not even internally consistent) as can be seen from the manner in which Eco Oro's request for its final extension of the exploitation period was dealt with:\n\ni. By Resolution 839 dated 2 August 2016, Eco Oro's application to extend Concession 3452 was only granted in respect of that area which did not overlap the preservation area, with no reference to what it was and was not permitted to do in the restoration area. Resolution 839 referred to a technical opinion dated 1 August 2016 on which it had relied, which differentiated between the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo area and the restoration zone but which further concluded that in addition to the ban on exploration activities in the p\u00e1ramo, the ban should also be applied to mining activities within the restoration zone. 817\n\nii. However, a contradictory approach was adopted by the ANM with respect to another mining title of Eco Oro (EJ1-159) which also overlapped the preservation and restoration areas of the delimited p\u00e1ramo, yet the ANM's Resolution 48 dated 7 April 2016 (but only notified to Eco Oro on 20 September 2016) granted an extension of the exploration phase over the entire area of the Concession. This indicates further confusion within the ANM as to the status of the restoration zone.\n\niii. Upon seeking clarification, the ANM advised with respect to title EJ1-159 that Eco Oro could carry out mining activities in those areas that did not overlap the preservation areas. Thus, with respect to Concession 3452, Eco Oro could not undertake exploration activities in the restoration zone whereas with respect to title EJ1-159 it was permitted to undertake exploration activities in the restoration zone. This is clearly completely contradictory.\n\niv. This inconsistent behaviour can further be seen in ANM Resolution 683 of 9 August 2017 which stated that Eco Oro could not undertake mining activities in any overlapping sustainable use areas in another of Eco Oro's Concessions, number 22346.818\n\nc. The CIIPE (which included the Minister of the Environment and the Vice Minister of Mines) understood that the mining ban covered the preservation and restoration zones of the 2090 Atlas.\n\nNational Mining Agency, Technical Report No. VSC 169 (1 August 2016) (**Exhibit C-51**).\n\nNational Mining Agency, Resolution VSC 683 (9 August 2017) (**Exhibit C-248**).\n\n797.\n\nThe level of uncertainty as to what was and was not permitted can also be seen from a statement made by the Director General of the CDMB who, albeit expressing a personal view, stated that mining activities would be permitted in the restoration zone but not in the preservation zone and that he was unsure whether any buffer zone would be required or whether mining activities would be permitted up to the boundary of the delimited area. However, he noted that the uncertainty would prevent the CDMB from processing an application for an environmental licence for Concession 3452.819\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mark Moseley-Williams, paras. 63-64; Letter from Eco Oro (Mr. Moseley-Williams) to CDMB (Mr. Carvajal) (5 December 2016) (**Exhibit C-57**).\n\n798.\n\nA further example of the inconsistent treatment received by Eco Oro relates to the sums charged by way of surface canons. Up to July 2016 (thus including a period after the 2090 Atlas had been issued), the ANM had claimed, and Eco Oro had paid, surface canons based on the total area of Concession 3452. On 6 July 2016, after Judgment C-35 had been handed down, the ANM changed its policy and sought payment only in respect of that part of the concession area which did not overlap the preservation area of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo (49.27% of the concession area).\n\n799.\n\nIn a final twist, Constitutional Court Decision T-361 struck down Resolution 2090 and thus also the 2090 Atlas, and ordered that a new delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo be undertaken. Whilst it was stated that the new delimitation was to take into account the criteria set out in Resolution 2090, there was a marked lack of clarity as to the true meaning and effect of this decision given the vague terms used and a number of questions were raised. What was the status of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo at this point? It was unclear precisely what was meant by the Constitutional Court's requirement that the protection offered by the new delimitation to be carried out cannot be lower \"*as to the protection of the environment*\" than that provided by Resolution 2090. Given it also specified that the demarcation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo could be modified in the event of errors (and it was accepted that the 2090 Atlas contained errors), could this mean the boundary lines could not be reduced at any point? Or did it mean that where there were accepted errors, the boundary could be redrawn even if it meant a reduced area of protection? Or indeed did it mean that if the p\u00e1ramo boundary was reduced in one area it had to be increased in another area so as to ensure the total area within the p\u00e1ramo stayed the same or was even increased? Indeed, how could it be verified whether any subsequent demarcation provided lower or higher protection - the p\u00e1ramo is the p\u00e1ramo and once it is fully protected it surely cannot be protected to an even greater extent? The Constitutional Court further stated that any ensuing modification could not adversely affect measures to protect or safeguard the p\u00e1ramo \"*in global terms*\" without providing any clarification as to what this meant. Yet more uncertainty was generated by this decision and yet the Constitutional Court's order to MinAmbiente that the delimitation be completed within one year was not complied with.\n\n800.\n\nA week after the publication of Judgment T-361, the Environment Minister stated that pursuant to this decision, no environmental licenses could be issued for mining projects in the vicinity of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo until the new delineation had been completed and yet, even as of now, no delimitation has been undertaken and there is still no certainty as to where the boundary of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo falls and the extent to which there is overlapping with Concession 3452.\n\n801.\n\nThe effect of this on Eco Oro can be seen from the fact that, after Judgment T-361 had been issued, the ANM refused to give Eco Oro an extension for its exploration phase to enable it not to have to take any further steps until after the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo were certain. This meant that Eco Oro had to submit its PTO by June 2018 failing which it would forfeit its concession. However, until the delimitation was published, it was uncertain in what areas of Concession 3452 mining activities would or would not be permitted. The Tribunal fails to comprehend how Eco Oro could have been expected to undertake this exercise given Colombia's continued failure finally to delimit the p\u00e1ramo. And yet, whilst Colombia was refusing to give any extension of time to Eco Oro, it was itself seeking an eight-month extension of time to comply with the time limit imposed by the Constitutional Court to complete the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.\n\n802.\n\nFurther failure to act can be seen from the fact that whilst Article 5 of Resolution 2090 required regional environmental authorities such as CDMB to issue more detailed environmental guidelines and environmental management plans for the p\u00e1ramo in their locality, again this has yet to be undertaken with respect to the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. This failure renders the provision in Article 173 of Law 1753 that mining activities would not be permitted in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems if environmental damage could not be avoided difficult to apply in practice.\n\n803.\n\nIn considering the level of consistency (or inconsistency) in Colombia's actions the Tribunal also notes that various laws, resolutions and court decisions, commencing with Law 373 of 1977, imposed on Colombia an obligation to acquire (and hence first delimit) p\u00e1ramo areas in compliance with its constitutional duties.820 Colombia did not do this. It is approximately twenty years since the 2001 Mining Code set out the regulatory regime to achieve a final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and yet the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo has still not been finally delimited and no reason for this has been given. Indeed, the Constitutional Court noted in Judgment T-361 that *\"according to the information provided by the Alexander von Humboldt Institute, there are currently 385 mining concessions in force related to p\u00e1ramo areas that have not been delimited by the Ministry of the Environment.**\"*821\n\nThis obligation was also contained in Article 8 of Resolution 769 of 2002, Advisory Opinion 2233 at pp. 7-8, Art. 14 of Law 1930 of 2018 and Constitutional Court Decision T-361 at para. 15.3.4. Ministry of Environment, Resolution No. 769 (5 August 2002) (**Exhibit C-9**), Art. 8; *Consejo de Estado*, Advisory Opinion No. 2233 (11 December 2014) (**Exhibit R-135**), pp. 7-8; Law No. 1930 (27 July 2018) (**Exhibit R-51**), Art. 14; Constitutional Court, Judgment T-361 (30 May 2017) (**Exhibit C-244**), para. 15.3.4.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment T-361 (30 May 2017) (**Exhibit C-244**).\n\n804.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its analysis with respect to Article 805 is as to legitimate expectations and not \"*reasonable investment-backed expectations*\", as is the case with an Article 811 analysis. Having weighed up the respective positions of the Parties, the majority of the Tribunal finds that Eco Oro had legitimate expectations that *(i)* it would be entitled to undertake mining exploitation activities in the entirety of Concession 3452; *(ii)* in the event the State were to expropriate Eco Oro's acquired rights, compensation would be payable; and *(iii)* that Colombia would ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment. The majority of the Tribunal finds that Colombia's actions in refusing to allow mining exploitation activities to take place in the entire area of Concession 3452 without payment of compensation, its inconsistent approach to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n paramo and its ultimate (and continuing) failure to delimit the Santurban Paramo frustrated Eco Oro's legitimate expectations.\n\n805.\n\nA majority of the Tribunal finds that Colombia's actions, including its failure finally to delimit the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo in circumstances where Eco Oro was advised that no environmental licenses could be issued for mining projects in the vicinity of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo until the new delineation had been completed and the failure to give Eco Oro an extension to submit its PTO, comprise conduct that failed to provide Eco Oro with a stable and predictable regulatory environment.\n\n***(b) Are Colombia's actions unacceptable from an international law perspective?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n806.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to consider whether Colombia's frustration of Eco Oro's legitimate expectations is unacceptable from an international law perspective. In this regard, it should be noted a finding of bad faith is not required.822 The fact the majority of the Tribunal found Colombia did not act in bad faith in implementing the Challenged Measures does not mean, *per se,* that Colombia is not in breach of Article 805. Whilst the intention of the Challenged Measures may have been in good faith, the delimitation is still not finally completed such that Eco Oro was left in limbo for a very considerable period of time, with no certainty as to where the final boundaries of the delimited boundary would be sited, and yet equally not granted an extension of time to file its PTO and seek an environmental licence pending Colombia's publication of the final delimitation undertaken in compliance with Colombian law.\n\nSee *The Loewen Group Inc and Raymons L.

According to the Indicators of Mining in Colombia, Monitoring the National Mining Development Plan 2007-2010: *\"The National Government's policies, such as Decree 4743 of 2005, have boosted this result and have given continuity to the Vallejo Plan, which, since 1967, has granted a series of tariff exemptions to imports of machinery and equipment used in the mining cycle, as well as to activities related to the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons.* [...] *Similarly, in the mining sector, investments increased from US$466 million in 2002 to approximately US $3.054 billion in 2009, an increase of 555%.*\"823\n\nIndicators of Mining in Colombia, Monitoring the National Mining Development Plan 2007-2010 (December 2010) (**Exhibit C-277**).\n\n809.\n\nIn Judgment C-35, Constitutional Court commented on Colombia's continued failure to protect the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems by delimiting the p\u00e1ramos as follows:\n\n*\"135. [...] although p\u00e1ramos are ecosystems that, pursuant to the law, call for special protection, they are not protected areas per se, since the 'protected area' category is tied to a declaratory and implementation procedure by the environmental authorities. In other words, although these ecosystems have been identified as areas that require special protection, no category of specific or automatic protection has been regulated for such biomes. To that extent, at present there are p\u00e1ramo areas that have been declared to be protected areas and others that have not.*\n\n[...]\n\n*140.* [...] *Therefore, to the extent that the protection of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem depends directly on strict compliance with the delimitation duty by the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development, the Court shall integrate the regulatory unit with the first two subsections of section 173 of Law No. 1753 of 2015 since, to the extent that the responsibility to delimit p\u00e1ramo areas lies with the Ministry of the Environment, the decision to be adopted would be completely ineffective, especially if we take into account that the Ministry of the Environment has delimited only one p\u00e1ramo.*\n\n[...]\n\n*165. First, the Court would like to note that the Legislature is currently working on two bills in the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate to establish a general framework to protect p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. At the speech for the second debate before the Plenary Session of the Senate to discuss Bill No. 45 of 2014 (Senate), the legislature acknowledged that '[p]\u00e1ramos should be protected permanently, because they are not isolated and are related to other systems that have suffered serious impacts in terms of thaw levels and loss of vegetation cover and glacier masses. P\u00e1ramos are closely related to glaciers, and specialized literature has warned that in 30 years' time, approximately, snow would no longer occur in the country if current conditions persist. In that regard, the IDEAM has warned that, while Colombia had 17 glaciers in 1850, at present only 6 glaciers continue to exist, decreasing from 374 km2 to 45.3 km2, and this phenomenon has accelerated over the last 30 years.'*\n\n*In turn, at the speech for the first debate on the Bill No. 106 of 2015 (Representatives), note was made of '[...] the importance of relying on a regulatory instrument to assert greater legal and technical strictness regarding the conservation and protection of p\u00e1ramo complexes and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems in Colombia. Such bill should be in line with the current environmental and socio-economic conditions in those areas, reiterating their nature as strategic ecosystems, as an integral part of the Protected Areas National System. With a view to the foregoing, it should include a clear definition of the financing sources for the implementation and application thereof. Likewise, the participation and mandatory and priority cooperation of the different administrative authorities in the different orders, not only in the declaratory process, but also in the execution of the respective environmental management plans* [...]*.'*\n\n*Notwithstanding the foregoing, this was not the first attempt to create a legal provision concerning the exclusive protection of p\u00e1ramos. Indeed, over the last decade there have been several attempts to expand a law to design p\u00e1ramo protection measures, but such attempts have proven fruitless, and the bill has been disregarded and all of the projects have been shelved. [...]*\n\n*166. Based on the considerations made above, it is clear that, at present, p\u00e1ramos as ecosystems are not subject to special protection, nor has the use thereof been defined, nor has an authority specifically responsible for their administration, management and control been appointed. In spite of all the attempts to create regulations to protect p\u00e1ramos, the truth is that there is a statutory and regulatory deficit in complying with the constitutional mandate to protect areas of special ecological importance, in this case, p\u00e1ramo ecosystems.*\n\n[...]\n\n*167.*[...] *there is no present guarantee that p\u00e1ramos are being protected.*\n\n[...] .\"824\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), pp. 101, 104, 111 and 112.\n\n810.\n\nWhilst the Tribunal accepts that Article 805 cannot be invoked to restrain Colombia from regulating matters within its borders, it can be invoked where the State acts in an arbitrary manner. Even viewed in isolation, it is difficult to comprehend on what basis the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo has still not been undertaken. No reason has been given by Colombia and, although the Tribunal understands that a paucity of resources may have contributed to the length of time taken to prepare the 2090 Atlas, this cannot excuse the fact the delimitation has still not been concluded so many years after the process was initially commenced. Indeed, the fact that, even after the Constitutional Court ordered the Environment Ministry to complete the delimitation within a year of Decision T-361, such delimitation has still not been completed is grossly unfair to those such as Eco Oro whose rights depend upon knowing where mining is and is not permitted. Even after the Santander Administrative Tribunal opened contempt proceedings against the Minister of Environment for failure to progress the delimitation in violation of Judgement T-361, the delimitation has still not been concluded. This failure is also clearly troubling in the light of the FTA's express terms as to the importance of environmental preservation. Had the delimitation been undertaken in accordance with Judgment T-361 it could be understood that Colombia was acting pursuant to a legitimate purpose, but this is not the case with respect to a failure to delimit the p\u00e1ramo whilst suspending rights granted under the Concession.\n\n811.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, when considering the reasonableness of both Colombia's actions and more particularly its failure to act, it is of relevance that the Angostura Deposit comprised less than 1% of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo as delimited by the discredited 2090 Atlas and thus, whilst the Tribunal accepts the applicability of the precautionary principle, it should also not be ignored that it is not possible accurately to determine the actual threat of damage to the p\u00e1ramo. Indeed, whilst of course Eco Oro could have reached certain assumptions as to the likely parameters of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, the Tribunal does not believe it is reasonable to expect Eco Oro to prejudge the boundaries of the final delimitation in circumstances where Colombia has itself failed to determine the boundaries.\n\n812.\n\nThe Tribunal also does not accept Colombia's submission that all arms of the Government were working towards the same objective, namely the preservation of the p\u00e1ramo.\n\n813.\n\nThe Constitutional Court acknowledged in Judgment C-35 that:\n\n*\"Long-term environmental effects, that is, the environmental sustainability of a legal provision, is a decisive factor for constitutionality review. It is up to the legislative and executive branches of the Government to meet the population's immediate needs, and from this standpoint, they are especially concerned with guaranteeing that the Government obtains revenue from the fees and taxes on extraction activities. However, in a democratic system, it is up to the constitutional courts to counterbalance the short-term importance valued by the other branches of government, especially if elected democratically. In this way, although the constitutional courts shall not discard the short-term effects, they should consider especially the long-term effects, which offer a full panorama of the constitutional problem and the tension with legally protected interests. Thus, it should give special weight to the effects of mining and hydrocarbon activities on p\u00e1ramo ecosystems.\"*825\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), para. 176.\n\n814.\n\nGiven the increasing and dominant focus on the protection and preservation of the environment, as seen from the Constitutional Court judgments referred to above, the actions of Government officials, including even President Santos, in supporting a mining project which undoubtedly was in or neighbouring an area which Colombia had undertaken to protect is hard to comprehend other than that such actions were supportive of Eco Oro mining the Angostura Deposit. It is recognised that Colombia saw the mining industry as key to its economic growth but the existence of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was known at that time to Colombia. Whilst MinMinas' objective of promoting foreign investment into the mining sector, providing support to Eco Oro and wanting the Angostura Project to succeed in order to encourage other foreign investment is understandable, the support to Concession 3452 and indeed to the other foreign mining companies and those local mining communities ran directly contrary to the parallel obligation to ascertain the correct delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and take the necessary steps to protect it. The conflicting motivations of MinMinas (in its drive for investment) and MinAmbiente (seeking the protection of the p\u00e1ramos) could not be clearer.\n\n815.\n\nIt can be seen from the above review that not only were there at all times two competing approaches within the Colombian ministries, on the one hand the need for the economic benefits derived from a vibrant mining industry and on the other a belief in the need to protect the p\u00e1ramo, but there was also a complete lack of agreement or even co-ordination in any part of the Government as to what should be done with respect to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. This did not need to be the case. As stated by the Attorney General, the delay in completing the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo created an environment in which it appeared that *\"the development of an environmentally responsible mining industry is incompatible with the conservation of the environment* [...].\"826\n\nLetter from the Attorney General to the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Mines and National Mining Agency (9 September 2013) (**Exhibit C-28**), p. 4.\n\n816.\n\nThe effect of this has been a near total failure to resolve the competing demands of the relevant interests: the environment, the need for water in the surrounding areas, the livelihood of the local farmers and artisanal miners, protection of jobs provided by the foreign mining companies and the rights of those mining companies. It has also contributed to the existence of illegal mining with the inevitable harmful impact on the p\u00e1ramo.\n\n817.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there are a number of contemporaneous records detailing the existence of illegal mining. By way of example:\n\na. Various articles were published describing the emergence of illegal mining in the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo including one published in Portofolio on 6 February 2014 titled *\"Illegal mining creeps into parts of Santurb\u00e1n\"* in which it was noted that the towns of Vetas and California *\"have been the most seriously affected\"* and that mercury and explosives were being used in these operations and another dated 1 August 2014 reporting that the number of illegal miners illegally entering the tunnels of those mining companies that had had to suspend mining (such as Eco Oro) was in the region of 1,000.827\n\nb. Eco Oro issued a communique on 25 February 2014 to the community of Soto Norte containing a *\"respectful but firm call to the people\"* to refrain from carrying out illegal mining operations;828\n\nc. Minister Sarmiento was reported to have assured the mayors that tough measures would be announced to clamp down on such illegal mining.829\n\nd. A letter from the Municipality of Vetas to the Attorney General dated 20 February 2015 seeking his intervention before the MinAmbiente for assistance for the local community and noting that *\"illegal mining is increasingly becoming the only option for workers to make a living.\"*830\n\ne. On 2 June 2016 a Ms. Uribe (citizen of Bucaramanga) wrote to the Vice President, Mining Supervision, Control and Safety of the ANM seeking to be added to the petition in respect of illegal mining within the area of Concession 3452;831\n\nf.

The minutes of CIIPE meeting number 9 dated 21 November 2016 in which it was noted that: *\"As regards illegal mining, different strategies are being implemented, given that in the case of Angostura illegal miners are operating inside the p\u00e1ramo area Illegal miners are permanently intruding in the mines left by Eco Oro in order to exploit them. Inter-institutional roundtables have been established with formal companies in order to adjust their PTO. In any event illegal mining activities in the p\u00e1ramo area require more decisive planning based on the CONPES (Colombian Council of Economic and Social Policy). Coordination with the National Planning Department (DNP) and the Ministries of Environment, of Mines and Energy and of Defence shall be progressed in order to define a schedule and action plans regarding any paramos to be delimited in the future.*\n\n*[redacted text]*\n\n*As regards security issues, the Ministry of Defence has requested that the companies strengthen their private security.

So, illegal mining is something that the Government takes very seriously, and it is attacking the illegal mining. And I make a parentheses because it is not only linked with ancestral mining, in areas where mining has taken place since forever, but also because it has some links in some instances to a grave situation and to natural consequences. So, it is something that Colombia takes extremely serious, and it is something that is not exclusively related to the p\u00e1ramo. Actually, it is less marketed in p\u00e1ramo areas than in other areas in the country. I will not dwell on that. But the second point is also very important because precisely I mentioned it before, that Colombia's interpretation of p\u00e1ramo has enacted clearly that, even if they, through human intervention has been deterioration in the p\u00e1ramo, that doesn't take out the qualification of p\u00e1ramo, and, actually, on the contrary, that insists that this sort of restoration area, areas in which the p\u00e1ramo has been degraded and, therefore, has to be reinstated to whatever kind of measures can be taken. And on the measures taken is, first of all, try to avoid illegal mining, try to prevent alternatives to the people because there is not only illegal mining, there is literature--there is other aspects of human intervention that may deteriorate the p\u00e1ramos. So, that's the situation in Colombia.*\"835\n\nTr. Day 1 (Mr. Mantilla-Serrano), 263:14-265:2.\n\n819.\n\nIt is not in dispute that illegal mining is generally far more harmful to the environment than mining undertaken lawfully in compliance with an approved EIA. In circumstances where it is acknowledged that the p\u00e1ramo is fragile and in need of special protection such that the State has determined no mining activities should be permitted in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, as well as taking steps to prevent mining activities lawfully undertaken pursuant to a legal title, Colombia should have taken steps to prevent the more damaging activities carried out by illegal miners. Whilst it is clear that Colombia was aware of the issue, proposing inter-institutional coordination and establishing inter-institutional roundtables, the Tribunal has not seen any evidence as to actual action taken by Colombia other than to require the companies to strengthen their private security.836\n\nSee Tr. Day 2 (Mr. Moseley-Williams), 504:17-21 (\"*the irony of it all is that that material will get mined, and mercury will be used, and so, the whole idea of protecting the water ecosystem is\u2014it's sad, but that's exactly what is going to happen.*\").\n\n820.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal finds that Colombia's actions with respect to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo have been grossly inconsistent and given rise to considerable confusion and uncertainty as to *(i)* what activities may and may not be undertaken within the p\u00e1ramo as currently delimited; *(ii)* what the final boundaries will comprise; and *(iii)* when the final delimitation will be announced. The Tribunal therefore asks itself whether Colombia's conduct amounts to gross unfairness or manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable standards. The majority of the Tribunal answers this in the affirmative. Colombia's failure to lawfully and finally delimit the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo in breach of the Constitutional Court's judgement is a wilful neglect of Colombia's statutory duty and caused harm to Eco Oro as it was made clear that no environmental licenses could be issued for mining projects in the vicinity of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo until the new delimitation had been completed. Colombia's refusal to allow Eco Oro a concomitant extension of time to submit its PTO, in circumstances where the p\u00e1ramo boundary had not been finally determined such that Eco Oro had no certainty as to where the p\u00e1ramo overlapped with the Angostura Deposit, if at all, and where Colombia itself was being given extensions of time to complete the delimitation, can only be viewed as grossly unfair. This comprises conduct that was arbitrary and disproportionate, and which has inflicted damage on Eco Oro without serving any apparent purpose, falling within Professor Schreuer's first indicium.\n\n821.\n\nWhilst the bar is a high one and the Tribunal does not expect that Colombia should have elevated unconditionally Eco Oro's interests above its obligation to protect the p\u00e1ramo, equally Colombia should have ensured that its various arms took the necessary steps to comply with Colombia's constitutional obligation to protect the p\u00e1ramo such that they acted in parallel and in a coordinated manner with respect to Concession 3452. It should be reminded that, for purposes of attribution, \"[t]*he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.**\"*837 It is clear from the above review of Colombia's actions, viewed as a whole, that Colombia's approach to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was one of arbitrary vacillation and inaction which inflicted damage on Eco Oro without serving any apparent legitimate purpose. Colombia was not willing to address and manage the widely disparate interests of those impacted by where the boundary of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was drawn; it found itself torn between the competing interests of protecting the p\u00e1ramo and obtaining much needed royalties. It has failed to act coherently, consistently or definitively in its management of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and in so doing has infringed a sense of fairness, equity and reasonableness and indeed has shown a flagrant disregard for the basic principles of fairness. This is more than just inconsistency or inadequacy by Colombia and its officials. Colombia has not accorded Eco Oro's investment treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, and the Tribunal therefore finds by a majority that Colombia is in breach of article 805 of the FTA.\n\nInternational Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) (**Exhibits CL-17 / CL-202** / **RL-115**), Art. 4(1).\n\n**F.** **A****rticle** **2201(3)** **of the** **T****reaty and the** **FTA'****s** **E****nvironmental** **E****xception**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n822.\n\nArticle 2201(3) of the Treaty838 provides as follows:\n\n\"*(3) For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:*\n\n*(a) To protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and health;*\n\n*(b) To ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Agreement; or*\n\n*(c) For the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.*\"\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit R-137**).\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n823.\n\nEco Oro's position is set out in paragraphs 367 *et seq.* above.\n\n***(b) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n824.\n\nColombia's position is set out in paragraphs 362 *et seq.* above.\n\n***(c) Canada's Non Disputing Party Position***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n825.\n\nCanada's position is set out in paragraphs 373 *et seq.* above\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n826.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Colombia's construction of Article 2201(3).839\n\nSee Respondent's Memorial, paras. 155-163; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, Section VI.D; Respondent's Reply, paras. 123-126; Respondent's Rejoinder, Section IV.C.1; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 44- 49.\n\n827.\n\nPursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the Tribunal's task is to interpret this provision *\"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\"840\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S 331 (**Exhibit CL-3**).\n\n828.\n\nThe Preamble to the FTA details, *inter alia,* that its object and purpose is to ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment in a manner that is consistent with environmental protection and conservation.841 Canada accepts that \"*the Parties* [to the FTA] *did not view their investment obligations as being at odds with the protection of* [....] *their environment and human rights obligations.*\"842 and that *\"trade and environment policies are mutually supportive* [...]\".843 In determining the ordinary meaning of Article 2201(3) it is therefore necessary to understand, as has been held by the Tribunal, that neither environmental protection nor investment protection is subservient to the other, they must co-exist in a mutually beneficial manner.\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**).\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 24.\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 25.\n\n829.\n\nIn the context of the FTA's object and purpose, the Tribunal construes Article 2201(3) as being permissive, ensuring a Party is not prohibited from adopting or enforcing a measure to protect human, animal or plant life and health, provided that such measures are not arbitrary or unjustifiably discriminatory between investment or between investors or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment. Such a construction is consistent with the FTA's objective of environmental protection: by prohibiting an investor from applying for restitution pursuant to Article 834(2)(b), the State is not precluded from adopting or enforcing the measure in question. Equally, however, there is no provision in Article 2201(3) permitting such action to be taken without the payment of compensation. Given that the FTA is equally supportive of investment protection, had it been the intention of the Contracting Parties that a measure could be taken pursuant to Article 2201(3) without any liability for compensation, the Article would have been drafted in similar terms as Annex 811(2)(b), namely making explicit that the taking of such a measure would not give rise to any right to seek compensation under Chapter Eight. In this regard, it is of note that there is no reference in Article 2201(3) to claims for breaches of the FTA. Indeed, given that the Contracting Parties drafted other provisions, such as Annex 811(2)(b), to include an express stipulation as to the circumstances in which a measure is not to constitute a treaty breach, it is simply not credible that the Contracting Parties left such an important provision of non-liability to be implied when considering the operation of Article 2201(3).\n\n830.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore construes Article 2201(3) such that whilst a State may adopt or enforce a measure pursuant to the stated objectives in Article 2201(3) without finding itself in breach of the FTA, this does not prevent an investor claiming under Chapter Eight that such a measure entitles it to the payment of compensation.\n\n831.\n\nThis construction comports with Colombian constitutional law (as described above). Further, if all measures that were not arbitrary, not unjustifiably discriminatory between investment or between investors or were not a disguised restriction on trade and which were taken to protect the environment gave rise to no liability on the part of the State, it would render certain provisions of Chapter Eight redundant. For example, the reference to environmental measures in Article 807(2) would be otiose. Such a construction also conflicts with Annex 811(2)(b) which expressly acknowledges that in certain circumstances a measure taken for the protection of the environment may constitute indirect expropriation. If Colombia's construction were correct, there would be a clear conflict between Article 2201(3) and Annex 811(2)(b): a State would refer to Article 2201(3) asserting that as a result it had no liability to pay any compensation, whereas the investor would refer to Annex 811(2)(b) in support of its right to claim damages. Colombia did not explain this inconsistency.\n\n832.\n\nColombia also provided no justification as to why it is necessary for the protection of the environment not to offer compensation to an investor for any loss suffered as a result of measures taken by Colombia to protect the environment, nor explained how such a construction would support the protection of investment in addition to the protection of the environment.\n\n833.\n\nThe Tribunal's interpretation is reinforced by the title of this Article, namely \"General Exceptions\" and the fact it expressly refers to being an exception to Chapter Eight. To be an exception to Chapter Eight must equally mean there are applicable provisions in Chapter Eight, such that there must be circumstances in which an investor needs to seek recourse to arbitration with respect to a measure which comes with the meaning of Article 2210(3), which can only be to claim compensation for losses suffered as a result of such measure.\n\n834.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis is supported by the decision of the tribunal in *Bear Creek* which considered an identical provision. Whilst Colombia refers to this as a single decision,844 this does not lessen its validity as supporting the Tribunal's construction of the provision.845\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 466.\n\nThe second case cited by Eco Oro, *Infinito*, relates only to whether Article 2201(3) acts as a jurisdictional hurdle and is therefore of no relevance to this issue.\n\n835.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis is further supported by the provisions of Articles 27(b) and 36(1) of the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"**ILC Draft Articles**\"),846 which establish as follows:\n\n*\"Article 27*\n\n*Consequences of invoking a circumstance precluding wrongfulness*\n\n*The invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in accordance with this chapter is without prejudice to:*\n\n[...]\n\n*(b) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question.*\n\n[...]\n\n*Article 36*\n\n*Compensation*\n\n*1.

See also Claimant's Rejoinder, para. 208; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 117.\n\n836.\n\nCanada, in its non-disputing party submission, says that if the measure in question meets the requirements of Article 2201(3) then \"[...] *there is no violation of the Agreement and no State liability. Payment of compensation would therefore not be required*.\"847 Whilst the Tribunal accepts that the State cannot be prohibited from adopting or enforcing an environmental measure in accordance with Article 2201(3), it cannot accept Canada's statement that in such circumstances payment of compensation is not required. This does not comport with the ordinary meaning of the Article when construed in the context of the FTA as a whole and specifically in the context of Chapter Eight, as analysed in the preceding paragraphs.\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, para. 16.\n\n837.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal does not find that Article 2201(3) operates to exclude Colombia's liability to pay compensation to Eco Oro for its damages suffered as a result of Colombia's breach of Article 805.\n\n**VIII. DAMAGES**\n-----------------\n\n838.\n\nArticle 834(2) to (4) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n*\"2.

National Iranian Oil*, Case No. 495, Award (1983 \u2013 Vol. 2), Iran-U.S. CTR 41 (**Exhibit RL-47**), p. 2.\n\n840.\n\nFirstly, as explained in detail in Colombia's submissions on the merits, at the time the FTA came into force a mining ban was in existence over 54% of the Concession area such that the value of Eco Oro's Concession was already compromised and the post cut-off date measures did not cause any further loss.\n\n841.\n\nSecondly, the burden is on the Claimant to prove the certainty of its damages but Eco Oro's claim is inherently speculative. The Angostura Project did not progress beyond the conceptual exploratory stage despite approximately twenty years of exploration activities, the asset was non-operative at the time of the alleged wrongful conduct and Eco Oro had no acquired right to exploit. The Discounted Cash Flow (\"**DCF**\") calculation performed by Golder Associates (\"**Golder**\") in Eco Oro's Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"**PEA**\") purporting to show the economic viability of the Angostura Project is *\"utterly flawed and speculative\"*.850 Colombia's underground mining expert, Mr. Johnson, adjusted Golder's DCF to correct for its flaws, to show the Angostura Project yielded a negative net present value. Mr. Johnson's assessment is corroborated by the economic behaviour of actual buyers. Thus, Eco Oro has failed to discharge its burden of proving the economic viability of the Angostura Project.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 487.\n\n842.\n\nIt is not to the point that the cases on which Colombia rely for its proposition that damages should not be awarded for \"speculative\" projects all relate to damages calculated on a DCF and not fair market value basis: Behre Dolbear's expert opinion as to the viability of the Angostura Project is based on a DCF calculation performed by Golder in Eco Oro's PEA.\n\n843.\n\nThirdly, Eco Oro has failed to show that it could have secured an environmental license to allow it to undertake mining exploitation activities. Pursuant to the General Environmental Law, Colombia's licensing authorities were legally prohibited from issuing environmental licenses for mining exploitation activities where those activities could cause harm to the p\u00e1ramo. Given the relevant authorities' strict application of the precautionary principle, it was *\"highly improbable\"* that Eco Oro would have been able to satisfy the ANLA and other relevant authorities that either an underground or open pit large scale mining project could cause no harm to the p\u00e1ramo such that but for Colombia's actions it would have secured an environmental licence.\n\n844.\n\nEco Oro is basing its claim for damages on a *\"remote hypothetical possibility that it may have, somehow, been able to prepare a viable plan, obtain all necessary licenses and permissions, and proceeded to extract minerals profitably.*\"851 There can be no liability for damages.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 451.\n\n***(b) Claimant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n845.\n\nEco Oro refers back to its detailed arguments with respect to the merits. Firstly, there was no mining ban in force at the time the FTA entered into force. Secondly, it had an acquired right to exploit notwithstanding that its exercise required fulfilling certain legal requirements such as obtaining an environmental license. Thirdly, it is for Colombia to prove that Eco Oro would not have successfully applied for an environmental licence and given Colombia has issued environmental licenses in p\u00e1ramo areas since the General Environmental Law, Colombia's argument as to the manner in which the General Environmental Law and the precautionary principle will be applied cannot be correct. In any event, the Angostura Project is not located in p\u00e1ramo as is demonstrated by the ECODES report and it is the wrongful manner in which Colombia delimited the Santander P\u00e1ramo that has deprived Eco Oro of the right to attempt to meet the applicable environmental licensing requirements.\n\n846.\n\nFinally, the Angostura project was not speculative. Eco Oro was a going concern at the time of the Challenged Measures and Mr. Rossi confirmed in his testimony that \"[...] *there* [are] *reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction\".*852 The valuation methodology applied by Compass Lexecon factors in the risk factors associated with the stage of development of the Angostura Project by using comparable companies in a similar or earlier stage of development. The cases referred to by Colombia all relate to damages claimed using a DCF income-based approach which is not the approach adopted by Eco Oro.\n\nTr. Day 5 (Mr. Rossi), 1302:14-1303:4.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n847.\n\nBy a majority, the Tribunal finds that Colombia's breach of Article 805 entitles it to make a claim for damages in respect to any loss that it can show to have been caused as a result of that breach.\n\n848.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that there was no mining ban in existence at the time the FTA came into force. The Tribunal has further found, by a majority, that Eco Oro had an acquired right to exploit, albeit such right could only be exercised upon its PTO being approved and upon obtaining an environmental licence to allow it to engage in exploitation. It is common ground that in absence of such a license Eco Oro could not engage in any exploitation. The Tribunal further does not find, by a majority, that Eco Oro's claim is necessarily speculative; Colombia has not shown that no environmental licences were issued for mining activities in p\u00e1ramo areas since the General Environmental Law came into force such that the precautionary principle cannot be said to apply, or that Eco Oro had no prospect whatsoever of obtaining an environmental licence.\n\n849.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal does not accept, to the extent it is pleaded by Colombia, that it was Eco Oro's intervening acts and omissions that caused its loss, that the casual link has been broken by Eco Oro's renunciation. To the extent that Eco Oro is able to establish that it has suffered losses as a result of the breach of Article 805, such losses will have been incurred before the renunciation of the Concession and the renunciation was effected by Eco Oro in order to mitigate its continuing losses as detailed in its letters to MinMinas and MinAmbiente.853\n\nLetter from Eco Oro (Mr. Orduz) to the Ministry of Mining and Energy (Ms. Su\u00e1rez) (29 March 2019) (**Exhibit C-423**); Letter from Eco Oro (Mr. Orduz) to Ministry of Environment (Mr. Lozano) (29 March 2019) (**Exhibit C-424**).\n\n**B.** **W****hether** **E****co** **O****ro is** **E****ntitled to** **F****ull** **R****eparation** **B****ased on** **F****air** **M****arket** **V****alue**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***(a) Claimant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n*(i) Appropriate Methodology*\n-----------------------------\n\n850.\n\nThe only provision in the FTA relating to the standard of compensation is Article 811(2) with respect to lawful expropriation. Eco Oro therefore turns to customary international law principles as contained in Articles 31, 35 and 36(1) of the ILC Draft Articles.854 These provide for *\"full reparation\"* which, where restitution is not possible, entails \"[...] *an obligation to compensate for the damage caused* [...]\".\n\nInternational Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) (**Exhibits CL-17 / CL-202** / **RL-115**).\n\n851.\n\nFull compensation should be assessed on the basis of the resultant diminution of the fair market value of the affected asset. This is the appropriate methodology for valuing the loss caused by both a breach of Article 811 and Article 805 of the FTA.\n\n852.\n\nAn income-based valuation methodology is not appropriate; although a preliminary economic assessment has been prepared, on the basis of which Behre Dolbear concludes the Angostura Project would be economically viable, no final plans had been made as to the development of the project and there is insufficient certainty for a feasibility study. Where a project is at an early development stage, such as this, the necessary inputs cannot be established with sufficient precision and an income-based valuation is not the preferred valuation approach.855\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 385, citing to *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v.

Firstly, at the Valuation Date, the market had already priced in the negative effect of key aspects of the Challenged Measures such that the market capitalisation cannot be used to derive a fair market value. Secondly, Eco Oro's stock is thinly traded and highly illiquid.\n\n855.\n\nColombia's arguments as to other tribunal's concerns as to the validity of a market-based assessment are not applicable here: it is unnecessary to consider a hypothetical buyer as data is available relating to three genuinely comparable market transactions (the \"**Comparable Transactions**\").\n\n*(ii) The comparable transactions valuation*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n856.\n\nThe Comparable Transactions used are three purchases by AUX Canada of the outstanding shares *(i)* in March 2011 of Ventana Gold Corporation (\"**Ventana**\") which held the rights to develop mining titles located in the California-Vetas Mining District including the La Bodega and La Mascota deposits (the \"**Bodega Project**\"); *(ii)* in December 2012 of Galway Resources Ltd. (\"**Galway**\") which held 14 mining titles in the California-Vetas Mining District; and *(iii)* also in December 2012, of Calvista Gold Corporation (\"**Calvista**\") which held the rights to 12 mining titles again in the California-Vetas Mining District (the \"**Comparable Companies**\"). Whilst all three are comparable, the Bodega Project is the most similar to the Angostura Project in terms of size and mineralisation.\n\n857.\n\nThe comparability can be seen as they each concern mining properties *(i)* located directly adjacent to and landlocked by Concession 3452 on an eleven kilometre continuous mineralized stretch of land starting in California and ending at the far end of the Angostura deposit; *(ii)* at similar or earlier stages of development than the Angostura Project; *(iii)* in the case of the largest Comparable Transaction, involves an underground project similar to the one projected for Angostura; and *(iv)* owned by publicly traded Canadian companies subject to the same regulatory reporting requirements as Eco Oro. Indeed, the extreme level of comparability can be demonstrated in respect of each of the ten *\"modifying factors\"* identified by the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (\"**CRIRSCO**\") in its International reporting Template.857 They are all independently identified as *\"adjacent properties\"* to each other in their respective NI 43-101 reports meaning they have *\"geological characteristics similar to those of the property being reported on*\".858 The comparability of these properties answers the concerns raised by the tribunal in *Khan Resources v. Mongolia*859 and is consistent with the approaches in a number of recent cases, such as *Windstream v. Canada*860 This addresses Mr. Rossi's concerns as to the mineralization differences between the three projects.\n\nCommittee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO), International Reporting Template for the Public Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (November 2013) (**Exhibit C-190**), pp. 9-10.\n\nCanadian Securities Administrators, National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (2011 version), with Form 43-101F1 (January 2011) (**Exhibit BD-18**), section 1.1.

Indeed, CRA advances a methodology that is practically identical, but uses additional comparable transactions in addition to the three chosen by Compass Lexecon.\n\n859.\n\nIt is of note that whilst Colombia's expert, CRA, says that the Comparable Transactions are not appropriate to be used for valuation purposes, it uses them when calculating its Valuation Multiple. The other nine transactions and companies used by CRA have underlying properties that are not as comparable to the Angostura Project or are not appropriate to be used for valuation purposes with four subject to different economic, political and social contributions and risk factors, for example a distressed asset in Ecuador, an operation in China with dissimilar reporting requirements, and four significantly smaller North American transactions with vastly different mineralization than that at the Angostura Project.\n\n860.\n\nIn calculating the value of the Angostura Project, Compass Lexecon first computes a per-ounce value for the volume of extractable minerals Eco Oro had the right to exploit (\"**Extractable Minerals**\") based on values ascribed by the market to other comparable projects. Eco Oro and the Comparable Companies, being publicly traded Canadian mining companies, report in a standardized manner pursuant to the guidelines established in NI 43-101.861 Such NI 43-101-compliant reports are authored by a recognised Qualified Person and the authors of the reports relied upon by Eco Oro are independent of Eco Oro. NI 43-101-compliant reports are considered in the industry to be *\"rigorous and inherently reliable*\". 862 Eco Oro and the Comparable Companies report their Extractable Minerals in such NI 43-101-compliant reports such that there is a common basis for comparing them and the Comparable Companies each published NI 43-101-compliant Extractable Minerals estimates just prior to their sales.\n\nCanadian National Instrument 43-101 on Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (***NI 43-101***) (June 2011) (**Exhibit C-152**); Ontario Securities Commission, Under the Securities Act National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, Form 43-101F1, Technical Report, and Companion Policy 43-101CP (17 November 2000) (**Exhibit C-78**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 394; First Behre Dolbear Report, para. 55.\n\n861.\n\nBehre Dolbear have reviewed the estimates prepared by Golder in 2012, Micon International Limited in 2015 and Eco Oro itself in 2017 and concludes that Eco Oro's resource base of the Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent is 2.97 million ounces of gold. Colombia's expert Mr. Rossi's criticism of Behre Dolbear's inclusion of a value for Extractable Minerals below the selected cut-off grade is not valid. There are circumstances where an operator will extract resources below the cut-off grade and further Ventana's Board of Directors persuaded its shareholders to reject AUX's initial offer on the basis, *inter alia,* that it did not take into account the fact that \"[h]*igher commodity prices effectively result in a greater proportion of the deposit being economically mineable, resulting in a lower cut-off grade and a meaningful increase in the resource.*\"863 Some value should be ascribed to such lower grade materials, albeit significantly discounted vis-\u00e0-vis the materials at or above grade.\n\nVentana Gold Corp., Director's Circular Recommending Rejection of the Offer by AUX Canada Acquisition Inc. of Ventana Gold Corp. (22 December 2010) (**Exhibit C-141**), p. 2.\n\n862.\n\nFurther, Colombia's argument that a deduction should be made for those resources that fall outside the Preservation Zone of the 2090 Delimitation must fail given that the totality of Concession 3452 was rendered valueless as a result of the prevailing uncertainty.\n\n863.\n\nHaving computed an adjusted transaction enterprise value for each of the Comparable Companies to capture all market changes between the dates each transaction took place as against the Valuation Date, Compass Lexecon then derives a common denominator (the Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent) to apply across the three transactions given each of the Comparable Companies and Eco Oro have differing amounts of mineral material divided amongst different mineral resource categories (measured, indicated and inferred). Proven and probable reserves are valued at 100%, measured and indicated resources have a weighting of 50% and inferred resources have a weighting of 25%. Such weightings are used practically uniformly in the mining industry. Compass Lexecon also converts other extractable minerals (such as silver and copper) to a Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent by dividing the volume of declared minerals by the ratio of the gold price to the applicable silver or copper price prevailing on the date of the transaction.\n\n864.\n\nThe effective price paid per ounce of Extractable Minerals is ascertained by dividing the Adjusted Transaction Enterprise Value by the Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent (the Valuation Multiple) and this figure is multiplied by the Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent of Eco Oro's Extractable Minerals.\n\n865.\n\nThis method has been approved by the Tribunal in Crystallex as being a method which is \"[...] *widely used as a valuation method of businesses, and can thus be safely resorted to, provided it is correctly applied, and, especially, if appropriate comparables are used.\"* 864\n\n*Crystallex*, Award (4 April 2016) (**Exhibit CL-85**), para. 901.\n\n866.\n\nCompass Lexecon has calculated the price paid by AUX per Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent, the Valuation Multiple, for each of the three transactions as follows: for the Ventana transaction, USD 366 (and it should be noted that the Bodega Project is now operating under the ownership of Minesa (a Mubadala subsidiary) with declared resources in 2017 of 10.2 million ounces of gold and 58.6 million ounces of silver); for the Galway transaction, USD 196; and for the Calvista transaction, USD 45.\n\n867.\n\nCompass Lexecon then computes a weighted average of the three Valuation Multiples based on the relative Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent at each property (Ventana 1.57 million ounces, Calvista 0.80 million ounces and Galway 0.83 million ounces) to reach a Valuation Multiple of USD 242 per ounce of Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent. Compass Lexecon then sense-check this figure by benchmarking it against the multiples implied by the market capitalisation of publicly traded companies similarly placed to Eco Oro and show that it is a reasonable metric, falling between the median and the 7th percentile of the observed market multiples.\n\n868.\n\nCompass Lexecon then multiplies Eco Oro's resource base of the Weighted Gold Ounce Equivalent (2.97 million ounces of gold as determined by Behre Dolbear) by the Valuation Multiple to reach a valuation of USD 696 million (having adjusted to account for certain private royalty agreements).\n\n*(iii) Colombia's proposed market capitalisation methodology*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n869.\n\nColombia's market capitalisation methodology was only submitted in Colombia's Rejoinder. Whilst Compass Lexecon does not accept that Colombia's proposed methodology is correct given the early development stage Eco Oro was at, it does agree that the three steps proposed by CRA are the correct steps to undertake a market capitalisation valuation, namely: *(i)* selection of the base date or last clean date and ascertain the market capitalisation at that date; *(ii)* adjustment by reference to how the mining industry would have evolved up to the valuation date using the Junior Gold Mining Index; and *(iii)* make any necessary additional adjustments to reflect such specific factors relating to Eco Oro as may not have been captured by the Junior Gold Mining Index.\n\n870.\n\nCRA has not, however, correctly followed these steps in its valuation; it has used data that is not market based. For example, instead of ascertaining Eco Oro's market capitalisation on the base date, (23 April 2010), it takes Eco Oro's enterprise value instead, a sum that is USD 80 million lower as a result of cash held by Eco Oro for further investment. Further, it has made adjustments on the basis of the differential production size between Eco Oro's 2009 technical report which included a PEA prepared in anticipation of an open-pit mine and the 2012 Golder Report which was prepared on the basis of an underground mine; this has no relevance to an inference in the stock price value. CRA have also made no adjustment for the difference between a minority stake in a stock market transaction with a very small flotation percentage and the controlling stake.\n\n871.\n\nCRA should have reviewed all market news and press releases between the base date and the date on which the Golder underground resources were announced to give the market impact of that assessment compared to the evolution generally in the junior gold mining industry. Any adjustment to Eco Oro's market capitalisation should have been effected on the basis of that public news, calculated by Compass Lexecon to give rise to a reduction in value of Eco Oro's stock of 14.7%, which means a market capitalisation of USD 251 million. This then needs further adjustment as it is the value of a minority stock. A 40% acquisition premium should be applied to give a market capitalisation of USD 351 million for a controlling stake and a USD 350 million enterprise value.\n\n*(iv) Valuation date*\n---------------------\n\n872.\n\nEco Oro's loss is its total loss of value in its investment pursuant to NMA Resolution VSC 829 on 8 August 2016 being the date when \"*the interference has ripened into a more or less irreversible deprivation of the property rather than on the beginning date of the events.*\"865\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 552.\n\n873.\n\nColombia's argument that the valuation date should be either 19 December 2014 (the date of the 2090 Resolution) or 8 February 2016 (the issuing of Judgement C-35) should be ignored: neither of these measures had the effect of irreversibly depriving Eco Oro of its rights and having instead been chosen on the basis of the prevailing (adverse) market conditions (the Junior Gold Miners Total Return Index being 46.1 and 44.9% of the value on Eco Oro's identified valuation date).\n\n874.\n\nThe only possible alternative valuation date is 1 April 2019 when the NMA rejected Eco Oro's requests for a suspension of obligations and a request for the filing of its PTO.\n\n***(b) Respondent's Position***\n-------------------------------\n\n875.\n\nThe burden is on the Claimant to prove the certainty of its damages866 and Eco Oro's claim is inherently speculative. The Angostura Project never progressed beyond the conceptual level, despite approximately twenty years of exploration activities and was non-operative at the time of the alleged wrongful conduct with limited, if any, economic value. This is evidenced by the fact even before the Challenged Measures, Eco Oro's enterprise value had fallen below USD 20 million. There can be no liability to compensate for speculative or uncertain damage.867\n\n*Gemplus S.A., SLP S.A., Gemplus Industrial S.A. de C.V. v.

It is incontrovertible that the price actually paid for an asset in the market is inherently more reliable as an indicator of value than the price paid for other assets. Eco Oro's concerns as to the illiquidity of its stock issue are not valid; Eco Oro's stock was traded with sufficient frequency and volume to be reliable for valuation purposes.\n\nFirst CRA Report, para. 39.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, fn. 799: S.

Reference is also made to Eco Oro's reliance upon the definition of fair market value adopted by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in *Starrett*, which provides:\"*the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in circumstances in which each had good information, each desired to maximize his financial gain, and neither was under duress or threat.* [The expert] *appropriately assumed that the willing buyer was a reasonable businessman.*\" See *Starrett Housing Corporation, Starrett Systems, Inc, and Others v. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Bank Markazi Iran, and Others*, Iran-US Claims Tribunal Case No. 24 (\"***Starrett***\"), Final Award (14 August 1987) (**Exhibit CL-7**), para. 277.\n\nFirst CRA Report, paras. 45-46.\n\n878.\n\nAs the economic viability of the Angostura Project has not been established, the market multiples methodology is *\"highly conjectural\"*. Any reasonable (hypothetical) buyer would assess the technical and economic viability of the Angostura Project, an exercise Compass Lexecon has not undertaken. The only available analysis is Eco Oro's PEA which is insufficient and does not show the project's viability. Indeed, the document notes it is only a \"[...] *preliminary assessment based on conceptual mine plans and process flowsheets.\"* Mr. Johnson confirms that reasonable potential purchasers would not rely on a PEA when considering an acquisition or investment into a junior mining company, being considered no more than a \"*scoping study*\".872 A serious buyer would develop its own technical due diligence to estimate the resources and viability of the project. In the absence of any such due diligence from Behre Dolbear or Compass Lexecon, Eco Oro cannot be said to have proved its loss.\n\nJohnson Report, paras. 26-27 (\"*As per the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Ontario Securities Commission, only a Prefeasibility Study ('PFS') could give a 'reasonable expectation' of the technical and economic viability of a mining project. A PFS can give an understanding, in relation to a mining project of: a) 'What it should be' \u2013 (i.e. 'a strong belief'). b) Realistic economic and engineering studies sufficient to demonstrate economic viability and establish mineral reserves. c) To have a cost accuracy of +/- 25%. d) To have engineering detail of 1 to 5%.*\") and 187 (\"*No reasonable buyer or valuer would rely on the results of a PEA to place value on a Mineral Project, especially that of a Junior Mining Company. Buyers are aware that the seller is motivated to view their project through 'rose-colored glasses', to maximise the perceived value of the Mineral Project, in the case it is a motivated seller or is seeking to attract capital investment.*\" See also Mining Disclosure: NI 43-101 fundamentals, best practices, and useful guidance for TSX and TSX Venture issuers (4 March 2015) (**Exhibit CJ-3**).\n\n879.\n\nEven were a PEA reliable for the purposes of a potential acquisition, Behre Dolbear's resource estimation cannot be relied upon. It merely endorses reports prepared by third-party consultants (and as argued with respect to causation, the Golder PEA is not reliable), and a non-NI 43-101-compliant report prepared by Eco Oro itself, without carrying out any actual analysis themselves. NI 43-101 reports are just *\"marketing tools\"* with a *\"significant bias towards optimism*\" and are \"*not accepted at face value, not even by securities regulators*\"*.*873 Behre Dolbear also inflates Eco Oro's alleged loss by: *(i)* including \"*low grade resources*\" and ascribing a value to them; *(ii)* the use of weighting factors for the different categories of reserves which are not used in the mining industry; and *(iii)* wrongfully ascribing value to Exploration Potential.\n\nFirst Rossi Report, paras. 129-141.\n\n880.\n\nThus, Eco Oro cannot show that any reasonable purchaser would have had a reasonable expectation that the Angostura Project would have been viable.\n\n*(ii) Market capitalisation*\n----------------------------\n\n881.\n\nWhilst CRA adopts the market approach, it does so on the basis of the actual market data; CRA follows a three-step process. Firstly, CRA selects a date that predates the market's awareness, then it projects the market capitalisation forward to the valuation date by reference to the movement in price of the market index for listed junior mining companies between the chosen date and the valuation date. This resolves any concern that the market had already priced in the effect of the Challenged Measures.\n\n882.\n\nColombia has calculated Eco Oro's market capitalisation on the basis of the following base dates or last clean dates: *(i)* 23 April 2010 being the last trading day prior to the date on which Eco Oro publicly disclosed that its EIA licence application had been rejected due to concerns with regard to the presence of p\u00e1ramo and is the last day on which the market had not anticipated and priced the possibility of any of Colombia's measures; *(ii)* 18 December 2014 being the day before Resolution 2090 was adopted; *(iii)* 6 September 2013 being the closest trading day to the cut-off date, 8 September 2013; and *(iv)* 1 August 2011, the closest trading day to the day the FTA entered into force on 15 August 2011. These calculations show market capitalisation ranging between USD 13.79 million and USD 77.53 million depending on which base date and valuation date are applied. Colombia contends that if damages are to be awarded, the correct base date is 6 September 2013.\n\n883.\n\nThe second step is to adjust the calculated market capitalisation by reference to the Junior Gold Mining Index to take account of how the industry would have evolved from the base date to the valuation date.\n\n884.\n\nThe third step is a further adjustment of the market capitalisation to take account of any company specific factors that may not be captured by the evolution of junior gold mining index. This gives rise to a market capitalisation of USD 78 million on Colombia's preferred base and valuation dates.\n\n885.\n\nHowever, this valuation is for the entire area of the Concession and the residual value of that part of the deposit not impacted by Resolution 2090 should be deducted, namely 47.7% of the total Concession area under which is estimated to be approximately 40% of the total resource.874 Eco Oro has not adduced any technical or expert evidence to show that no project was viable in that part of the Concession which did not overlap the p\u00e1ramo and there was no uncertainty with respect to the ability to mine in the non-overlapping part of the concession.\n\nFirst Rossi Report, paras. 233, 236.\n\n*(iii) Eco Oro's Comparable Transactions approach*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n886.\n\nThe methodology adopted by Compass Lexecon is speculative and unreliable.\n\n887.\n\nThe three Comparable Companies identified by Compass Lexecon are not sufficiently comparable to the Angostura Project. It is rare in the mining industry to find assets that are closely comparable. The fact that the deposits are on the same mineralised trend does not of itself make them comparable as deposits and trends are \"*complex*\" and \"*generally exhibit significant differences in short distances*\".875 The area where the Angostura Project is located is the subject of extreme variation over a short distance and has a *\"complex array of veins, unique to the Angostura deposit*\"876 as a result of events before, during and after mineralisation. There are significant differences between Angostura and La Bodega and even considerable geotechnical variation within the La Bodega Project. There are also differences with Galway and Calvista has a different deposit type, containing \"*breccias*\" as opposed to \"*veins*\".877 The fact there are differences between the Comparable Transactions is evident from the fact the per-ounce price paid for each is significantly different, ranging from USD 78 to 546 per ounce.878\n\nFirst Rossi Report, para. 251.\n\nFirst Rossi Report, para. 54.\n\nFirst Rossi Report, paras. 275-276.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 483; CRA: Compass Lexecon Transaction Multiples (Undated) (**Exhibit CRA-14**).\n\n888.\n\nThe Comparable Companies are also not genuinely comparable because the relevant transaction dates were in 2010 and 2011, significantly before Eco Oro's asserted valuation date, potentially giving rise to significant additional errors. Finally, three comparables is insufficient, a broader spread is required, particularly where, as here, each transaction involves the same buyer.\n\n889.\n\nCompass Lexecon's analysis is also flawed as not only is the comparable data unreliable, the underlying data from the Behre Dolbear estimate of resources (based on Eco Oro's 2017 Resource Estimation) has been demonstrated by Mr. Rossi to be unreliable. The significant variation in capital costs between the assets requires adjustment which has not been undertaken and the weighted average approach to the performance values of the Comparable Transactions distorts the multiple in favour of Eco Oro, increasing the Weighted Gold Equivalent Ounce from USD 347 per ounce to USD 407 per ounce giving rise to a 15% inflation in the final valuation.\n\n890.\n\nFinally, Compass Lexecon's bench-check cannot be relied upon as it is performed against a skewed selection of publicly traded companies that are not comparable to Eco Oro such as companies at a significantly advanced stage with established economic viabilities or in countries with lower country risk, but that notwithstanding, the median (USD 124 per weighted ounce) is still well below Compass Lexecon's valuation of USD 177 per weighted ounce. This is why Compass Lexecon adds a 40% acquisition premium to equal the calculations. There is no place in a fair market valuation for the inclusion of an acquisition premium.\n\n891.\n\nWhilst Colombia does not accept the validity of a comparables-based valuation in this factual matrix, it has prepared an alternative valuation based on comparables. Using Eco Oro's resource estimations, CRA examines valuation data from twelve properties globally being the most comparable to the Angostura Project by reason of their inherent characteristics. From this it can be seen that the Galway and Ventana transactions are clear outliers and CRA concludes that the enterprise value of Angostura Project would have been USD 180 million. However, this is not an accurate valuation of Angostura as *(i)* the data set includes Ventana (which had lower capital and operating costs); *(ii)* it includes two companies whose development was far more advanced than the Angostura Project; and *(iii)* most of the companies included were based in countries with lower country risk. It is further of note that a reasonable buyer would have factored in the risks associated with environmental licensing and permitting.\n\n*(iv) Valuation Date*\n---------------------\n\n892.\n\nThe correct valuation date should be 19 December 2014, when Resolution 2090 was issued and Eco Oro lost any right to conduct mining exploitation activities in the area of Concession 345 falling within the Resolution 2090 delimitation. Alternatively, 8 February 2016 when Judgement C-35 struck down the transitional regime which Eco Oro says it is entitled to benefit from. Resolution VSC 829 merely confirmed the fact that Eco Oro could not conduct any mining activities in the area delimited by Resolution 2090, it did not impact on the extent of Eco Oro's rights to conduct mining activities. Neither date proposed by Eco Oro has merit; its loss crystalised earlier, at the time of the Challenged Measures.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n893.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have sufficient information at this stage to determine the quantum of damages, if any, that flow from Colombia's breach of Article 805.\n\n894.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's majority finding that there was a breach of Article 805 of the FTA, it is necessary to ascertain the quantum of loss suffered by Eco Oro as a result of that breach. The Tribunal accepts Eco Oro's submissions that the appropriate standard is full reparation for the loss suffered as a result of the breach, as provided for in the ILC Draft Articles, whilst recognising that the burden is on Eco Oro to establish that loss. Eco Oro does not seek restitution (nor could it given the terms of Article 2201(3) of the FTA). Where restitution is not possible, pursuant to Article 36(1) the ILC Draft Articles, a State's obligation is to pay compensation for the damage caused.\n\n895.\n\nWhat is less clear is the nature and extent of the loss suffered by Eco Oro as a result of Colombia's breach of Article 805. Eco Oro was not able to engage in exploitation without an environmental license, and the breach of Article 805 found by the majority precluded Eco Oro from applying for such a license. The question therefore arises as to whether Eco Oro's loss is limited to the value of the loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence, or whether it may also claim for further losses that may be proven to be a direct consequence of the breach? Relatedly, a question arises as to how such losses, if they occurred, are to be valued?\n\n896.\n\nThe Parties made submissions as to the appropriate methodology for calculating damages. It is common ground that, given the stage at which the Angustura Project had reached, an income-based approach would not be appropriate and that the correct methodology is a market-based methodology. The principles of fair market value are also not in dispute, although the Parties provide slightly different definitions:879 in summary a fair market valuation determines the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller, after taking into account all relevant circumstances such as the nature and duration of the investment and where neither party is under any duress or threat.\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, para. 374, making reference to the definition in *Starrett*, Final Award (14 August 1987) (**Exhibit CL-7**), para. 277: \"*the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in circumstances in which each had good information, each desired to maximize his financial gain, and neither was under duress or threat.* [The expert] *appropriately assumed that the willing buyer was a reasonable businessman.*\"; and Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 457, making reference to World Bank, \"Legal Framework for the Treatment of Foreign Investment\" (1992) (**Exhibit CRA-42**), p. 26: \"*the price that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller of the investment, after taking into account all relevant circumstances such as the nature and duration of the investment.*\"\n\n897.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to how the fair market value should be determined; on the basis of Comparable Transactions (as contended for by Eco Oro) or calculating Eco Oro's market capitalisation (as contended for by Colombia).\n\n898.\n\nIt is also common ground that there is relatively little actual data in the record before the Tribunal upon which to assess Eco Oro's loss. No Feasibility or pre-Feasibility study was undertaken for Eco Oro's underground mining project for the Angostura Deposit, the PEA it submitted to the Colombian authorities related to the open-pit mine (which it abandoned of its own volition) and there is no equivalent document in relation to the underground tunnel or underground mining. There is also a paucity of independent documentation detailing the nature and quantum of the Angostura Deposit's Extractable Minerals. Colombia itself accepts that, in the absence of the block model, drilling logs, and the information on process metallurgy and process economics, an independent resource estimation cannot be carried out880 leaving Eco Oro's NI 43-101 reports as the only source of available data. Equally, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Colombia's market capitalisation methodology in the circumstances of this dispute, particularly given the fact that there was not a significant volume of trade in Eco Oro's stock over the course of the Challenged Measures and the use by CRA of the Junior Gold Mining Index to adjust Eco Oro's market capitalisation as opposed to calculating the impact of the actual market news and press releases publicly available.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 503; First Rossi Report, para. 334.\n\n899.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that, of the alternative market basis methodologies put forward by the Parties for determining Eco Oro's loss, as a matter of principle the Comparable Transactions methodology may be preferable. However, the Tribunal is uncertain as to whether - and if so, how - this methodology might be used to value the loss of Eco Oro's right to apply for an approved PTO and environmental licence permitting it to engage in exploitation.\n\n900.\n\nIn preparing its Comparable Transactions analysis, Eco Oro relies on three Comparable Transactions, whereas Colombia relies on twelve. Whilst the Tribunal appreciates the concerns raised by Colombia as to whether Eco Oro's three Comparable Transactions are as similar as contended for by Eco Oro, it seems to the Tribunal that they have more similarity to the Angostura Deposit than those proposed by Colombia. The properties identified by Eco Oro are neighbouring properties on the same mineralised trend, at equally early stages of development (none having obtained environmental licenses), the sellers were each publicly traded Canadian companies and the properties are subject to the same country risk. The Tribunal understands that merely by virtue of the deposits being on the same mineralised trend does not of itself make them comparable and that there is no certainty that there are no geotechnical variations between the deposits under the mining titles held by Galway, Ventana and Calvista and the Angostura Deposit. However, the Tribunal further notes that they were described as *\"adjacent properties\"* in the NI 43-101 reports, which means the consultant who prepared such reports appears to have taken the view they had similar geological characteristics.\n\n901.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the Comparable Transactions took place several years before the Challenged Measures, but notes that whilst the transactions identified by Colombia are similar from an economic perspective, there are considerable other differences (excluding with respect to Ventana, Galway and Calvista which Colombia includes in its identified comparable properties). In particular, none are in Colombia, which means that the regulatory and other country risks are different (the Tribunal accepts that for some the country risk may be smaller). Moreover, one of the properties (Shandong Ruiyin) is not compliant with the CRIRSCO's reporting requirements and four of the properties have much smaller sizes than the Angostura Deposit. Further, just as there is no certainty that the Ventana, Galway and Calvista deposits had similar geological characteristics to the Angostura Deposit, there is equally no certainty that the deposits for the properties proposed by Colombia had similar geological characteristics.\n\n902.\n\nHaving weighed up the similarities between the transactions identified by Eco Oro and Colombia - and subject to the point made above in relation to the absence of a license to engage in exploitation - the Tribunal considers that, in the absence of any track record of established trading, and given the presence of the three similar projects in the vicinity of Concession 3452, the evidence relating to the three Comparable Transactions identified by Eco Oro appears to offer the best evidence before the Tribunal as to the methodology that might be followed. The Tribunal therefore finds it reasonable to consider this approach in considering what loss has been suffered by Eco Oro. However, there is no evidence before the Tribunal as to the application of that methodology - or indeed any other - to the valuation of a loss that could be established as a direct consequence of the loss of the right to apply for an environmental license. In this context, before the Tribunal determines the quantum of loss suffered by Eco Oro, the Tribunal raises a number of questions to be addressed by the Parties, to be supplemented with such expert evidence as the Parties each considers to be necessary to adduce in support of their further submissions. In this regard, given, as Eco Oro accepts,881 it has the burden of proof to make its case on damages, Eco Oro is ordered to file its submissions responsive to the following questions and Colombia is then to file its submissions in response, if any. To the extent either the Parties agree or the Tribunal so orders, a second round of sequential reply submissions will be permitted. The questions are as follows:\n\na. Are the losses suffered by Eco Oro for a breach of Article 805 and Article 811 the same, and to be measured in the same way? If not, given the majority Tribunal's reasoning, what is the nature of the loss that Eco Oro has actually suffered, if any?\n\nb. Should the expert evidence adduced by the Parties be revised, given the majority Tribunal's findings that Colombia is not in breach of Article 811 but is in breach of Article 805? If so, how?\n\nc. Given the Tribunal's findings on the merits and given its analysis above with respect to the inapplicability both of an income-based valuation methodology and Colombia's chosen comparable transactions, is Eco Oro's proposed Comparable Transactions methodology the one to be applied, or is there an alternative methodology which should be considered given the nature of Eco Oro's losses?\n\nd. How can Eco Oro's loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence to allow exploitation be valued? On what basis is the quantum of that loss, if any, to be assessed?\n\ne. What is the probability that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo overlaps with the Angostura Deposit and to what extent?\n\nf. What is the probability that Eco Oro would have been awarded an environmental licence to allow exploitation in the following scenarios:\n\ni. The Angostura Deposit is not within the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo as determined by the final delimitation;\n\nii. The Angostura Deposit is partially within the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo as determined by the final delimitation; or\n\niii. The Angostura Deposit is wholly within the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo as determined by the final delimitation.\n\ng. What is the effect on the identification of the loss suffered, and its valuation, if any, if Eco Oro failed to establish that an exercise in due diligence had been carried out prior to the decision to move to the development of an underground mine?\n\nh. What is the correct valuation date for a breach of Article 805 of the FTA?\n\ni. If there is a significant gap between the identified valuation date and the dates on which the Comparable Transactions took place, what adjustment, if any, should be made to the Comparable Transactions valuation?\n\nj. What evidence, if any, is there on the record, in addition to Mr. Moseley-William's testimony that the area of Concession 3452 that does not lie within the current delimitation cannot be ascribed a value,882 such that no deduction should be made in the event that a fair market valuation is adopted to value Eco Oro's loss?\n\nk. What evidence is there to support Eco Oro's assertion of the costs it has incurred to date?\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 651.\n\nSecond Moseley-Williams Witness Statement, para. 31; Tr.

The ILC Draft Articles provide that \"[i]*nterest on any principal sum payable under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.*\"883\n\nInternational Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) (**Exhibits CL-17 / CL-202** / **RL-115**), Art. 38(1).\n\n904.\n\nArticle 811(3) of the FTA provides that compensation should accrue at a \"[...] *commercially reasonable rate* [...] *from the date of expropriation until the date of payment\".* A commercially reasonable interest rate is the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\"**LIBOR**\") plus 4 %884 and this should be the floor of what is to be considered reasonable. Eco Oro therefore claims interest at 6.6% being the rate that best represents a \"[...] *reasonable commercial rate*\" by reference to the cost of borrowing \"[...] *for prime corporations in Colombia which, on average, is equivalent to 6.6% per year during the relevant period since the Valuation Date.*\" 885\n\n*Murphy Exploration & Production Company - International v.

A State's duty is to make full reparation immediately after its unlawful act has caused harm and to the extent such payment is delayed (as is the case here) compound interest compensates Eco Oro for its lost opportunity to use the funds for productive ends. Compound interest is thus an element of full reparation as has been held by numerous tribunals.886 As held by the tribunal in *Gemplus, \"there is now a form of 'jurisprudence constante' where the presumption has shifted from the position a decade or so ago with the result it would now be more appropriate to order compound interest, unless shown to be inappropriate in favour of simple interest, rather than vice-versa.*\"887\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v.

Williams, Damages in International Investment Law (2008) (**Exhibit CL-49**), p. 389.\n\n907.\n\nColombia's submission with respect to the low risk of enforcement against Colombia does not address the question of full reparation. The rate at which a private corporation can obtain financing does not take account of the situation of the borrower and the cases cited by Colombia do not arise under treaties with the same wording as Article 811(3), which expressly provides for a *\"commercially reasonable rate\"*. A short-term risk-free interest rate does not take account of the economic realities for Eco Oro, namely that it was subject to commercial risk after the valuation date and therefore before it renunciated the Concession it still had to, in that period, raise and maintain capital at a commercial rate. Further, given the relevant period is three years, this makes the use of a short-term rate inappropriate. Finally, the rate proposed by Colombia is considerably lower than the cost of financing faced by most corporations and nearly four times lower than Colombia's own cost of borrowing giving rise to a substantial windfall to Colombia in its own costs.\n\n908.\n\nFinally, Colombia is unable to cite any case law to support its submissions with respect to the inappropriateness of compound interest in this case. Compound interest \"[...] *reflects the economic reality that a dollar foregone could otherwise have been invested, and that the income on that investment could have also been reinvested, so that funds grow at a compound rate.*\"889\n\nSecond Compass Lexecon Report, para. 94(c).

No. 2 (1996) (**Exhibit CLEX-95**), pp. 306-308.\n\n***(b) Respondent's Position***\n-------------------------------\n\n909.\n\nWhilst Colombia accepts tribunals have a right to award interest in principle, Article 811(3) of the FTA is not applicable as it applies only to compensation for a lawful expropriation and the applicable rate should reflect a \"*low risk\"* investment890 compensating for the time value of money, the loss of purchasing power and certain macroeconomic risks. Eco Oro faces no commercial or market risk during the pendency of these proceedings and therefore the applicable rate does not need to compensate for such risks. Finance charges or lost investment should be claimed as separate heads of damages and Eco Oro has not made any such claims. The rate should reflect a lower country risk given the fact Colombia has a strong track record of paying arbitral awards rendered against it.\n\n*Sistem M\u00fchendislik In\u015faat Sanayi ve Ticaret A. \u015e. v.

The applicable interest rate should be a 'risk free' rate such as the US Treasury Bill Rate. This should be payable on any monetary sum awarded to Colombia in respect of costs, including arbitration costs and professional fees and disbursements made to Colombia.\n\n911.\n\nPursuant to the Commentary to the ILC Draft Articles,891 compound interest is only appropriate when justified by \"*special circumstances*\" and no such special circumstances exist in the present case.\n\nInternational Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries (2001) (**Exhibit CL-17**), Article 38, commentary 9.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n912.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that, to the extent that Eco Oro has suffered loss as a result of Colombia's breach of Article 805 of the FTA, Eco Oro should receive full reparation and such reparation should include interest.

As set forth at para. 2 of my Note of Dissent of 9 September 2021 (the \"Note\"), I did not entirely share the majority Decision on the FET violation.\n\n4.\n\nIn that connection, I hereby refer to and incorporate by reference paras. 16-32 of my Note, which found that the 2090 Resolution P\u00e1ramo delimitation was not a lawful exercise of Colombia's police powers under international law. Such illicit conduct is determinative both of the FET breach and the breach of BIT Annex 811 found in the Note. Such findings and conclusions are particularly relevant and meaningful in respect of the matters and issues addressed at the present stage of this arbitration, exclusively concerned, from an international law perspective, with the causation, determination and quantification of damages originated in a FET breach, i.e., irrespective of whether the exercise by Colombia of its police powers was lawful or not under Colombian national law.\n\n5.\n\nAs to damages causation, as alleged by the Claimant, the 2090 Resolution delimitation (part and parcel of Respondent's illicit conduct under international law) destroyed the Project and was thus a direct cause of damages to be compensated.\n\n6.\n\nIllicit conduct under international law cannot be brought to bear to deny application of the method to calculate damages resulting from the very breach causing damages ensuing from such conduct. Such method and the facts and circumstances taken into account to determine and value damages flowing from the Respondent's illicit conduct cannot be neutralized by the causative effects of the Respondent's illicit conduct (i.e., the 2090 Resolution) itself. This is consistent with the principle that reparation must, as far as possible, restore the situation that would have existed had the illegal act not been committed4.\n\n*Factory of Chorz\u00f3w,* Judgment, PCIJ Series A, No. 17, 13 September 1928, at 47.\n\n7.\n\nTherefore, the fact that transactions considered when applying the Comparative Transactions Method (\"CT Method\") respectively took place in February 2011 and October 2012 (well before 8 August 2016, the valuation date) is not relevant, not only for the above reasons, but also because the Respondent has not shown changes in the market between such dates and the date of valuation (2016) adversely affecting the market bases for the Claimant's damages calculation. On the contrary, as set forth by the Claimant in its Reply to the Arbitral Tribunal Questions5, a transaction of 21 March 2022 for the sale of a minority interest in one of the properties considered when applying the CT Method yielded an acquisition price close to a billion US$, a circumstance showing that the CT Method applied by the Claimant and its economic outcome are both persuasive and correct.\n\nAt para. 6 (b).\n\n8.\n\nFurther circumstances (in part addressed below) militate in favor of reaching the above conclusions, because, as set forth in the Damages Award6, \"*the majority of the Tribunal accepts that Colombia may be benefitting from its failure to issue a final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo given it is the absence of the final delimitation that prevents the Tribunal from assessing the percentage likelihood that economic exploitation could have been possible*\".\n\nAt para. 317.\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimant claims it had acquired rights to explore and exploit within the entirety of Concession 3452 (the \"Concession\")7. In furtherance of its acquired rights, the Claimant alleges that Respondent's conduct created uncertainty as to the Claimant's rights under the Concession, including as a result of the 2090 Resolution8. In addition to curtailing the Claimant's rights, this Resolution \"*\u2026.created uncertainty; it was unclear what these detailed guidelines and documents would consist of and thus to what extent they would impact on mine planning or how PMAs of grandfathered projects would be amended and whether they would be made stricter*\"9*.* This Resolution created *widespread level of uncertainty* as to the Claimant's Concession rights10. Also, implementing Resolution 2090 delimitation would be disproportionate to the legitimate interest in protecting the P\u00e1ramo ecosystem11.\n\nDecision, at para. 499.\n\nDecision, at para. 502.\n\nDecision at para. 507.\n\nDecision at paras. 514, 515, 520.\n\nDecision at para. 570.\n\n10.\n\nIn my opinion, the arbitral record substantiates the Claimant's allegations referred to above.\n\n11.\n\nAs indeed set forth in the Decision, the level of uncertainty prejudicial to the Claimant's rights inaugurated by the 2090 Resolution is a clear source of \"*\u2026 a level of adverse economic impact on Eco Oro's covered investment\u2026*\"12. Although the Decision (of which I dissented in this respect) concluded that the Respondent's conduct did not constitute an expropriation, the 2090 Resolution is in itself conduct in breach of FET causing damages and entitling to damage compensation.\n\nDecision at para. 630.\n\n12.\n\nAs established in the Decision, the main source of uncertainty as to the Claimant's rights (already present in connection with the 2090 Resolution and the 2090 Atlas13, the latter is an attachment and integral part of the 2090 Resolution cartographically representing the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo14) was the lack of a lawfully compliant delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, for which the Respondent was solely responsible15, as accepted by Colombia's Attorney General16 and confirmed by other circumstances set forth in the Decision, including the unexplained coordinates released as the 2090 Atlas and other errors as to the 2090 Atlas boundaries17, the existence and continuation of which was confirmed by Decision T-361 of the Colombian Constitutional Court that struck down the 2090 Resolution18 (although the 2090 Resolution was struck down, such Resolution was already in itself Colombia's conduct rendering the foreign investor's rights uncertain and confused and not later purged by Colombia). It should be noted that such conduct and its corresponding detrimental effects to such rights persisted after the issuance of the Colombian Constitutional Court decision and, apparently, persist until now.\n\nDecision at para. 777.\n\nDecision at para. 505.\n\nDecision at paras. 775, 778.\n\nDecision at paras. 779, 780, 781,782.\n\nDecision at paras. 781, 782, 783.\n\nDecision at para. 799.\n\n13.\n\nThese, among other things further described in the Decision, led to the Arbitral Tribunal's finding that \"*Eco Oro's description of being on a regulatory roller-coaster to be apt*\"19. The normative and regulatory framework confusion was further illustrated by remarks of Colombia's Minister of Mines20, including whether mining activities were permitted in the restoration and sustainable use areas of the P\u00e1ramo, already evidenced by the 2090 Atlas21.\n\nDecision at para. 791.\n\nDecision at para. 793.\n\nDecision at para. 795.\n\n14.\n\nAs the Decision shows, such continuing conduct - actions or omissions - has not been discontinued22; as also found by the Decision, a central part of such conduct was the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation \"*\u2026by the discredited 2090 Atlas*\"23, a basic component of the 2090 Resolution*.*\n\nDecision at para. 810.\n\nDecision at para. 811.\n\n15.\n\nIn sum, the issuance of the 2090 Resolution and the accompanying 2090 Atlas constitute illicit conduct attributable to Colombia in violation of the Claimant's legitimate expectations protected by the FET standard under international law which: a) was not cured by later conduct of the Respondent; b) denoted the failure of Colombia to \"*\u2026ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment\u2026*\"24; and c) was a direct source of damages caused by the Respondent the Claimant has the right under international law to be fully compensated for. In view of the above conclusions, arbitral and other fees and costs are to be borne by the Respondent.\n\nHoracio A.

However, the Claimant has been successful in part, on its claims regarding issues of Jurisdiction (unanimously) and aspects of Liability (by a majority). For this reason, I agree that it is reasonable that each Party should bear half the costs of the proceedings, and cover its own legal fees and other costs.\n\n3.\n\nThat might be the end of the matter, but it is necessary to say something about the legal costs incurred by the Parties in these proceedings.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent has incurred total costs of just under US$6.3 million. This appears to be somewhat higher than the mean costs for respondents in investor-State proceedings,1 but given the various stages of the proceedings, and the time they have taken, it is within the bounds of reasonableness.\n\nBIICL-Allen & Overy, '2021 Empirical Study: Costs, Damages and Duration in Investor-State Arbitration' (2021), pp. 9-15, which finds that the mean costs for respondents in 2021 was US$ 4.7 million.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant, on the other hand, has incurred total costs of just under US$33.3 million. This is, by any reasonable standard, a jaw-dropping figure. In the context of facts and an environmental context which ought to have caused any reasonable lawyer to alert the Claimant to the serious risk of failure, the amount is indecent. Having been involved as counsel in dozens of investor-State cases, and an equal number as counsel in inter-State cases at the International Court of Justice and other international courts and tribunals, often involving matters of far greater complexity but being litigated at a far lower cost, I have trouble understanding how it is possible to rack up such legal costs. By way of comparison, a 2021 report found that the mean costs for claimants in investor-State disputes was US$6.4 million \u2013 around 20% of the Claimant's costs here.2\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n6.\n\nThere is much that could be said about a decision to expend such a sum of money on a case with such limited prospects of material success. I shall make just two points.\n\n7.\n\nThe *first* concerns the expense incurred in retaining the assistance of Compass Lexecon, at a cost of US$2,885,733.87. Compass Lexecon produced two reports for the case. One was 88 pages long, the other 70 pages. The principal drafters of these pages were examined at the hearing on damages, for no more than one day. They valued the loss suffered by the Claimant at US$ 696 million. A majority of the Tribunal ruled that 'it can award no damages from Colombia's breach of Article 805, or for any remediation costs'. It is apparent from the Award on Damages that the Tribunal obtained no assistance from that company's work.\n\n8.\n\nIn this regard, it is to be noted that at paragraph 920(4)(d) in its Decision on Quantum, the Tribunal addressed a specific question to both parties: 'How can Eco Oro's loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence to allow exploitation be valued? On what basis is the quantum of that loss, if any, to be assessed?'.3 Neither the Claimant nor Compass Lexecon offered the Tribunal any material assistance to help it to answer the question it posed. Perhaps Compass Lexecon was instructed not to answer the question. Perhaps Compass Lexecon was unable to answer the question. Perhaps Compass Lexecon knew that the answer to the question was: zero. For US$2.8 million, it is not unreasonable for a Tribunal to expect to receive an answer to the question. Indeed, the failure to provide the Tribunal with an answer to this question made its task more difficult and contributed to the length of the quantum phase.\n\nAward on Damages, para. 134 *et seq*.\n\n9.\n\nThe *second* concerns the Claimant's request that it be reimbursed for 'a portion of the costs that Eco Oro had no option but to incur to obtain financing to enable it to pursue the arbitration'.4 This portion is said to amount to US$4,492,899.48. Since the Tribunal has declined to make an order in favour of the Claimant, this claim falls away, and no view is expressed as regards the principle of whether such costs could have been included in an order.\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, 8 March 2024, para. 13.\n\n10.\n\nNevertheless, the Claimant's request raises issues concerning the financing of proceedings such as these, including by third parties. The Claimant asserted that 'Absent financing from third parties, [it] would have had no means to bring its claims against Colombia.'5 In this case the third party funding included financial support in the amount of an investment in the Claimant of US$14 million provided by Trexs Investments, LLC, an entity managed by Tenor Capital Management Company, L.P.6 This investment entitled the investor to up to 'to 51% of the gross proceeds of the Arbitration'.7\n\n*Ibid*., para. 17.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 18, Eco Oro Minerals Corp., Press Release titled \"Eco Oro Minerals Announces Investment by Tenor Capital\", 22 July 2016, **R-1**; available at https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/880-cse/eom/22636-eco-oro-minerals-announces-investment-by-tenor-capital.html.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n11.\n\nThird party funding is said by some to have an important role in ensuring that parties of limited means are able to pursue claims and vindicate their rights. That may be true, in some cases, but in my view that justification cannot be invoked in this one. I have the most serious concerns regarding such arrangements. The overriding purpose of investor-State proceedings is to allow claimants to bring claims and recover losses when the host State has breached its investment obligations. Yet there is a real risk of that purpose being subverted when claims are controlled or directed by a third-party funder which has no prior relationship with the purported investment or the host State. The risk is even greater where the third-party funder is entitled to recover a significant proportion, or even a majority, of any damages awarded by a tribunal, and is not required to contribute to the costs of the opposing party if the claim fails. Dr Kamal Hossain put the point well in his dissenting opinion in *Teinver v Argentina*:\n\n\"The BIT is not intended to enable payment of awards to third party funders who are not 'investors' and who have no protected 'investment', and who only come into the [dispute] to advance funds in order to speculate on the outcome of a pending arbitration\".8\n\n*Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Dissenting Opinion of Kamal Hossain, 13 July 2017, para. 72.\n\n12.\n\nI welcome the move towards greater transparency of third-party funding arrangements, as well as consideration by UNCITRAL Working Group III on a range of related issues, including conditions on the availability of third-party funding,9 although these initiatives may well be too little, too late. The current inability of tribunals to make cost awards against third-party funders is a real and serious issue, and has attracted the concern of arbitrators in previous cases.10 In my view, the creation of a \"gambler's Nirvana\"11 by allowing third-party funders to use investor-State dispute settlement as a means of financial speculation without any possibility of making costs awards against those funders is deeply problematic. Such funders may be closely engaged in the conduct of proceedings which can be burdensome, time-consuming and sensitive.12 Their involvement may add to the costs of the proceedings. For that reason, as a matter of principle, a tribunal should be able to make a costs order against a third-party funder. Nor do I see any reason, as a matter of principle, why a successful party should not be able to bring legal proceedings \u2013 in such fora as may be available, at the national or international level - to recover its costs from a third party funder that has contributed to significant expenses being incurred in unsuccessful claims. Such approaches are increasingly finding favour with domestic courts and with individual arbitral institutions.13\n\nSee e.g. ICSID Arbitration Rules (adopted 2022) Rule 14; UNCITRAL, 'Reports of Working Group III on the work of its forty-third session' (7 October 2022) UN Doc. A/CN.9/1124, p. 24; UNCITRAL, 'Possible reform of investor-State dispute settlement: Draft Provisions on procedural reform' (11 July 2022) UN Doc. A/CN.9/WG.III/WP.219, p. 12-21.\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v Saint Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Assenting Reasons of Gavan Griffith on the Saint Lucia's Request for Security for Costs, 13 August 2014, paras. 13-14.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nReport of the ICCA-Queen Mary Task Force on Third-Party Funding in International Arbitration (2018), p. 28.\n\nSee e.g. *Excalibur Ventures LLC v Texas Keystone Inc & Ors* [2016] EWCA Civ 1144; Article 35 SIAC Arbitration Rules 2017.\n\n13.\n\nArbitration proceedings of this kind are a form of privatised 'justice'. The proceedings can be costly, especially where there is a need for specialist knowledge. Yet it is surely incumbent on all involved in the system to keep in mind its original and aspirational mandate: to offer an effective and fair system to resolve serious disputes between foreign investors and host States, in a manner that is efficient, cost-effective and consistent with rules agreed by States. Those who designed it and put it in place had good intentions. It was not envisaged to be a system to leverage financial speculation and financial gains by third parties. A case such as this, incurring vast financial and human resource costs, and which could not have been brought without the support of a third-party funder, will, I fear, serve to undermine confidence in an important system, and foster perceptions that it lacks essential legitimacy and will, without fundamental reform, soon take the path of investor-state arbitration under the NAFTA and the Energy Charter Treaty.\n\n4 April 2024"}], "Content": "Award on Damages\n----------------\n\n**I.

The Decision**\n-------------------\n\n11.\n\nThis dispute relates to measures adopted by the Respondent in connection with the *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystem in Santurb\u00e1n, which allegedly have deprived Eco Oro of its mining rights under a concession contract for the exploration and exploitation of a deposit of gold, silver, chromium, zinc, copper, tin, lead, manganese, precious metals and associated minerals entered into on 8 February 2007 between Eco Oro and INGEOMINAS. The contract relates to the Angostura gold and silver deposit located in the Soto Norte region of the department of Santander, within the Vetas-California gold district: Concession Contract 3452 (\"**Concession 3452**\" or the \"**Concession**\").\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Colombia has breached its obligations under *(i)* Article 811 of the FTA by means of the unlawful, creeping and indirect expropriation of its investment; and *(ii)* Article 805 of the FTA by failing to accord Eco Oro's investment the minimum standard of treatment (\"**MST**\"). The Claimant seeks full reparation for what it deems to be the destruction of its investment in Colombia, claiming compensation for damage caused as a result of the Respondent's breaches and violations of the FTA and international law in an amount of USD 696 million, plus pre-award and post-award interest. The Respondent submits that Eco Oro's claims ought to be dismissed in their entirety as the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this dispute and there is no basis of liability accruing to Colombia under the FTA.\n\n13.\n\nIn its Decision, the Tribunal declared its jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims in the present arbitration. By a majority, the Tribunal *(i)* dismissed the claim concerning expropriation, concluding that Colombia was not in breach of Article 811 of the FTA and *(ii)* upheld the claim concerning MST, finding that Colombia was in breach of Article 805 of the FTA. The Tribunal further decided that \"[a]*ny award of damages will be expressly ordered to be net of all applicable Colombian taxes. Colombia will be ordered not to tax or attempt to tax the award and to indemnify Eco Oro in respect of any adverse consequences that may result from the imposition of a double taxation liability by the Colombian tax authorities if the declaration in the award recognising that the award is net of Colombian taxes is not accepted as the equivalent of evidence of payment.*\" The Decision was accompanied by a Partial Dissenting Opinion of Professor Grigera Na\u00f3n and a Partial Dissent of Professor Sands.\n\n14.\n\nEven though the Tribunal has considered that Eco Oro was entitled to make a claim for damages in respect of any loss that it could show to have been caused as a result of Colombia's breach of Article 805,6 the Tribunal considered that it did not have sufficient information at that stage to determine the quantum of damages, if any, that flowed from Colombia's said breach.7 Therefore, at paragraphs 902, 913 (with regard to interest), 919 (with regard to remediation costs) and 920(4) of the Decision, the Tribunal, underscoring that Eco Oro had the burden of proof to make its case, posed certain questions to the Parties to assist the Tribunal in determining the quantum of loss suffered by Eco Oro (\"**Questions**\"), based on the following considerations:\n\n\"*Having weighed up the similarities between the transactions identified by Eco Oro and Colombia - and subject to the point made above in relation to the absence of a license to engage in exploitation - the Tribunal considers that, in the absence of any track record of established trading, and given the presence of the three similar projects in the vicinity of Concession 3452, the evidence relating to the three Comparable Transactions identified by Eco Oro appears to offer the best evidence before the Tribunal as to the methodology that might be followed. The Tribunal therefore finds it reasonable to consider this approach in considering what loss has been suffered by Eco Oro. However, there is no evidence before the Tribunal as to the application of that methodology \u2013 or indeed any other \u2013 to the valuation of a loss that could be established as a direct consequence of the loss of the right to apply for an environmental license. In this context, before the Tribunal determines the quantum of loss suffered by Eco Oro, the Tribunal raises a number of questions to be addressed by the Parties, to be supplemented with such expert evidence as the Parties each considers to be necessary to adduce in support of their further submissions. In this regard, given, as Eco Oro accepts, it has the burden of proof to make its case on damages, Eco Oro is ordered to file its submissions responsive to the following questions and Colombia is then to file its submissions in response, if any. To the extent either the Parties agree or the Tribunal so orders, a second round of sequential reply submissions will be permitted.* [\u2026]\"8\n\n*The questions are as follows:*9\n\n*a. Are the losses suffered by Eco Oro for a breach of Article 805 and Article 811 the same, and to be measured in the same way? If not, given the majority Tribunal's reasoning, what is the nature of the loss that Eco Oro has actually suffered, if any?*\n\n*b. Should the expert evidence adduced by the Parties be revised, given the majority Tribunal's findings that Colombia is not in breach of Article 811 but is in breach of Article 805? If so, how?*\n\n*c. Given the Tribunal's findings on the merits and given its analysis above with respect to the inapplicability both of an income-based valuation methodology and Colombia's chosen comparable transactions, is Eco Oro's proposed Comparable Transactions methodology the one to be applied, or is there an alternative methodology which should be considered given the nature of Eco Oro's losses?*\n\n*d. How can Eco Oro's loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence to allow exploitation be valued? On what basis is the quantum of that loss, if any, to be assessed?*\n\n*e. What is the probability that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo overlaps with the Angostura Deposit and to what extent?*\n\n*f. What is the probability that Eco Oro would have been awarded an environmental licence to allow exploitation in the following scenarios:*\n\n*i. The Angostura Deposit is not within the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo as determined by the final delimitation;*\n\n*ii. The Angostura Deposit is partially within the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo as determined by the final delimitation; or*\n\n*iii. The Angostura Deposit is wholly within the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo as determined by the final delimitation.*\n\n*g. What is the effect on the identification of the loss suffered, and its valuation, if any, if Eco Oro failed to establish that an exercise in due diligence had been carried out prior to the decision to move to the development of an underground mine?*\n\n*h. What is the correct valuation date for a breach of Article 805 of the FTA?*\n\n*i. If there is a significant gap between the identified valuation date and the dates on which the Comparable Transactions took place, what adjustment, if any, should be made to the Comparable Transactions valuation?*\n\n*j. What evidence, if any, is there on the record, in addition to Mr. Moseley-William's testimony that the area of Concession 3452 that does not lie within the current delimitation cannot be ascribed a value, such that no deduction should be made in the event that a fair market valuation is adopted to value Eco Oro's loss?*\n\n*k. What evidence is there to support Eco Oro's assertion of the costs it has incurred to date?*\n\n*l. What is a commercially reasonable interest rate?*\n\n*m.

POST-DECISION PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of 17 September 2021, the Respondent objected to the majority of the Tribunal's decision not to dismiss the Claimant's claim for damages and to order the conduct of an additional procedural phase including further submissions and evidence. The Respondent further reserved its rights to apply for the annulment of the Decision upon its incorporation into the Tribunal's final award, including, without limitation, because, in the Respondent's opinion, the majority of the Tribunal *(i)* had manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to dismiss Claimant's claims for damages as unproven and by ordering that a further phase be held; and *(ii)* had violated Colombia's right of due process when issuing its Decision without allowing the Parties an opportunity to address the Tribunal on its appropriateness.\n\n17.\n\nOn 27 September 2021, the Claimant provided observations on the Respondent's letter to the Tribunal of 17 September 2021. The Claimant opposed the Respondent's objections, arguing that they were without merit and noting that Colombia's \"*attempt to create a record upon which to seek the annulment of the Tribunal's eventual award* [was] *unavailing*\".\n\n18.\n\nIn accordance with paragraph 920(5) of the Tribunal's Decision, on 7 October 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were conferring on the format and timetable for the additional submissions on quantum requested by the Tribunal and requested an extension to the deadline to apprise the Tribunal on the terms of their agreement until 11 October 2021. The Tribunal approved the extension on the same date.\n\n19.\n\nOn 11 October 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed the following with respect to the format and timetable for the additional submissions requested by the Tribunal (\"**Parties' Agreed Procedure**\"):\n\n1. *The parties agree that they will file one round of written submissions as follows:*\n\n*a. Claimant will file its First Submission within 120 days of the issuance of the Tribunal's Decision on 9 September 2021;*\n\n*b. Respondent will file its Response Submission 120 days from the date on which Claimant filed its First submission.*\n\n*2. The parties agree that the filing of a second round of written submissions is optional:*\n\n*a. Claimant may, at its discretion, file a Reply Submission within [a specified period] of the date on which Respondent filed its Response Submission. Claimant will indicate whether it intends to exercise its right of response within 14 days of the filing of Respondent's Response Submission;*\n\n*b. Insofar as Claimant has filed a Reply Submission, Respondent may, at its discretion, file a Rejoinder Submission within [a specified period] of the date on which Claimant filed its Reply Submission. Respondent will indicate whether it intends to exercise its right of response within 14 days of the filing of Claimant's Reply Submission.*\n\n*c. A party's decision not to exercise its right of response does not imply that that party is in agreement with the arguments and allegations put forward by the opposing party in its last written submission.*\n\n*d. The parties disagree on the deadlines for responsive submissions and will make separate proposals to the Tribunal in this regard.*\n\n*3. The parties agree that their written submissions will only address the questions raised by the Tribunal in paragraphs 902, 913, 919 and 920 of the Decision, and in the case of any responsive submissions, the allegations put forward by the other party in its previous submission.*\n\n*4. The parties disagree on whether additional evidence may be adduced with their submissions and will make separate proposals to the Tribunal in this regard.*\n\n*5. The parties disagree on whether either party should have the right to request a hearing, and will make separate proposals to the Tribunal in this regard.*\n\n*6. The parties shall send their respective proposals on the outstanding points referenced above to the ICSID Secretary only (without copying opposing counsel or the Tribunal) by COB on Tuesday 12 October 2021. The ICSID Secretary will then circulate both proposals simultaneously to the parties and the Tribunal.*\n\n20.\n\nOn 12 October 2021, pursuant to paragraph 6 of the Parties' Agreed Procedure, the Parties submitted their respective proposals on the outstanding points referenced in the Parties' Agreed Procedure concerning the submission of additional evidence, the deadlines for potential second-round submissions, and the right to request a hearing.\n\n21.\n\nOn 21 October 2021, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit brief responsive comments on each other's proposals in relation to the procedural matters on which the Parties disagreed by 28 October 2021.\n\n22.\n\nOn 28 October 2021, each Party filed its respective comments on the opposing Party's proposals in relation to the procedural matters on which the Parties disagreed.\n\n23.\n\nOn 3 November 2021, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 12** (On the Format and Timetable for the Additional Submissions Requested by the Tribunal in its Decision) (\"**PO12**\"). The Tribunal determined that: *(i)* a period of 90 days was reasonable to ensure each Party had a fair opportunity to present its case with respect to the Questions; *(ii)* the Parties could submit further expert evidence with their submissions; and *(iii)* the need of an oral hearing would be determined on the basis of the written submissions and taking into account its own views on the matter. In addition, the Tribunal established the following procedural rules at paragraph 38 of PO12:\n\n\"*38.1. Eco Oro will file its First Submission within 120 days of the issuance of the Tribunal's Decision on 9 September 2021.*\n\n*38.2. Colombia will file its Response Submission 120 days from the date on which Eco Oro filed its First Submission.*\n\n*38.3. Eco Oro may, at its discretion, file a Reply Submission within 90 days of the date on which Colombia filed its Response Submission. Eco Oro will indicate whether it intends to exercise its right of response within 14 days of the filing of Colombia's Response Submission.*\n\n*38.4. Insofar as Eco Oro has filed a Reply Submission, Colombia may, at its discretion, file a Rejoinder Submission within 90 days of the date on which Eco Oro filed its Reply Submission. Colombia will indicate whether it intends to exercise its right of response within 14 days of the filing of Eco Oro's Reply Submission.*\n\n*38.5. A Party's decision not to exercise its right of response does not imply that that Party is in agreement with the arguments and allegations put forward by the opposing Party in its last written submission.*\n\n*38.6. The Parties agree that their written submissions will only address the questions raised by the Tribunal in paragraphs 902, 913, 919 and 920 of the Decision, and in the case of any responsive submissions, the allegations put forward by the other Party in its previous submission.*\n\n*38.7. The Parties may submit such additional evidence as the Parties each considers to be necessary in support of their further submissions addressing the Questions.*\n\n*38.8. The Tribunal will determine whether an oral hearing will take place at the request of either of the Parties, such request to be made within 14 days from the date of the last written submission of the Parties. If the opposing Party does not consent to such application, it must make its reasoned objection within 14 days of the date on which the application is filed.*\n\n*38.9. Subject to the provision in paragraph 38.8 above, following receipt of the Parties' additional submissions, the Tribunal will deliberate and proceed to render its award on damages.*\"\n\n24.\n\nOn 6 January 2022, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to modify the procedural calendar for the filing of submissions addressing the Tribunal's Questions.\n\n25.\n\nOn 10 January 2022, the Tribunal approved the Parties' agreement. Accordingly: *(i)* the Claimant was authorised to file its first submission within 127 days of the issuance of the Tribunal's Decision (i.e., by 14 January 2022); and *(ii)* the Respondent was authorised to file its response submission 127 days from the date on which the Claimant filed its first submission (i.e., if the Claimant filed its submission on 14 January 2022, by 23 May 2022).\n\n26.\n\nOn 15 January 2022, the Claimant filed its First Submission on the Tribunal's Questions, together with factual exhibits C-458 to C-461,10 legal authorities CL-217 to CL-230,11 a consolidated list of factual exhibits, and a consolidated list of legal authorities (\"**Claimant's First Submission**\").\n\nEco Oro Closure Plan (5 July 2019) (**Exhibit C-458**); Letter from Eco Oro to the CDMB (5 July 2019) (**Exhibit C-459**); Minutes of Bilateral Liquidation of Concession Contract 3452 (30 December 2020) (**Exhibit C-460**); and Email from Eco Oro (Ms Arenas) to the ANM (Mr Garc\u00eda) (2 June 2021) (**Exhibit C-461**).\n\nB.

THE PARTIES' GENERAL REMARKS**\n------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nIn addition to providing specific answers to the fourteen questions posed by the Tribunal, the Parties seized the opportunity to make the following submissions.\n\n**A. Background and Majority Tribunal Findings**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nEco Oro recalls that the Majority Tribunal had made two noteworthy findings regarding Eco Oro's development of the Angostura Project21:\n\na. Eco Oro had acquired exploitation rights in respect of the Angostura Project through Concession 3452. While that right to exploit could only be exercised upon fulfilling licensing conditions, Eco Oro's right to exploit means that \u2013 upon fulfilling those conditions \u2013 it had the right to proceed with a commercial operation designed to generate revenue; and\n\nb. Eco Oro developed and continued investing in the Angostura Project with the \"*significant encouragement from a number of different State bodies*\", even after Judgment C-35 was issued in February 2016.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 7-10, referring to Decision, paras. 439, 440, 634, 689-691, 693, 767, 848.\n\n58.\n\nEco Oro notes that the Majority Tribunal had considered that Resolution VSC 829 of 8 August 2016 had been the critical measure causing Eco Oro to suffer a loss.22\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 11, referring to paras. 633-634 of the Decision.\n\n59.\n\nEco Oro submits that, in light of the Majority Tribunal's findings regarding Colombia's extinguishment of Eco Oro's exploitation rights, Eco Oro's loss must be measured as the difference between the value of a project with the right to generate revenues through exploitation discounted to reflect the risks associated with permitting risks and a project without any right or ability to proceed to exploitation.23\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 12.\n\n60.\n\nEco Oro notes that, while the Tribunal dismissed Eco Oro's Article 811 claim on other grounds, it found that \"*this loss is capable of being considered to be a substantial deprivation, such as to amount to an indirect expropriation*\", and it is those very same measures that the Tribunal found amounted to a breach of Article 805 of the Treaty.24\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 13, referring to para. 634 of the Decision.\n\n61.\n\nEco Oro submits that, as the Angostura Project was destroyed in its totality by Colombia's unlawful conduct, Eco Oro is entitled to an award of damages for the full value of the Angostura Project but-for Colombia's unlawful measures. According to Eco Oro, it has submitted expert valuation evidence from Compass Lexecon, based on the three Comparable Transactions, showing that the Angostura Project had a value of USD696 million as of 8 August 2016 (on which interest is owing), excluding the effects of Colombia's unlawful conduct. Eco Oro further notes that, while the Tribunal has not rendered a conclusion on damages, it has provisionally observed that Eco Oro's valuation involving \"*the three Comparable Transactions* [\u2026] *appears to offer the best evidence*\" of the value of Eco Oro's Angostura Project but-for Colombia's unlawful conduct.25\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 15, referring to Decision, paras. 894, 902; Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 3; Direct Presentation of Compass Lexecon (**Exhibit CH-7**), slide 26.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nAccording to Colombia, the Majority Tribunal found that the Challenged Measures \u2013 \"*the totality of the events commencing with Resolution 2090 and concluding with the deprivation created by Resolution VSC 829*\" \u2013 were a valid exercise of Colombia's police powers and did not breach either Article 811 or Article 805.26\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 14, referring to Decision, paras. 502, 806.\n\n63.\n\nColombia submits that Eco Oro seeks to recast the Tribunal's Decision in order to claim USD696 million for the loss of an opportunity to apply for an environmental licence that had no real chance of ever being granted. Despite the Tribunal giving Eco Oro a further opportunity to prove its case on damages, Eco Oro has still failed to do so. Rather than submitting any revised expert evidence or answering the Tribunal's questions as to how a loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence could actually be valued in light of the Tribunal's findings, Eco Oro has attempted to re-package its previous damages valuation in order to continue to claim a windfall.27\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 2-3.\n\n64.\n\nColombia recalls that the Majority Tribunal had made the following noteworthy findings:\n\na. The only measures that breached Article 805 of the Treaty were adopted after Resolution VSC 829 had already lawfully deprived Eco Oro of its rights over the area of the Concession overlapping with the Resolution 2090 Delimitation;28 and\n\nb. Eco Oro's prospects of securing an environmental licence were \"*minimal*\", and Colombia had the right to curtail the area over which Eco Oro may apply for an environmental licence through a final delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo.29\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 4, referring to Decision, paras. 699, 502, 804, 762, 820.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 6, 53, referring to Decision, paras. 634, 698.\n\n65.\n\nColombia further submits that Compass Lexecon's assessment is not an appropriate valuation of Eco Oro's lost opportunity because it reflects no such risks. As Professor Spiller admitted in cross-examination, Compass Lexecon did not carry out any assessment of the risk of an environmental licence being denied or how that risk compared with the environmental permitting risk faced by the three properties identified as comparable by Behre Dolbear.

The Standard of Proof**\n----------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nEco Oro submits that the computation of damages to make a claimant whole for its loss is not an exact science.31 In that regard, Eco Oro's standard of proof requires it *(a)* to prove, with a sufficient degree of certainty, that it has suffered a loss caused by Colombia's breaches of the Treaty, and *(b)* to provide a reasonable basis to compute that loss.32\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 18, citing to *Gold Reserve Inc. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1) Award (22 September 2014) (**Exhibit RL-96**), para. 686; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3) Award (20 August 2007) (**Exhibit CL-43**), para. 3.8.16; *Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v The Republic of Georgia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15) Award (3 March 2010) (**Exhibit CL-62**), para. 594.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 18, citing to *Hydro S.R.L. and others v Republic of Albania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28) Award (24 April 2019) (**Exhibit CL-226**), para. 845; *Watkins Holdings S.\u00c1.R.L. and others v The Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/44) Award (21 January 2020) (**Exhibit CL-229**), para. 685; *Crystallex International Corporation v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2) Award (4 April 2016) (**Exhibit CL-85**), paras. 867-869.\n\n67.\n\nSo far as the 'sufficient degree of certainty' requirement is concerned, Eco Oro contends that the balance of probabilities test applies.33\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 19, citing to *Gold Reserve Inc. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1) Award (22 September 2014) (**Exhibit RL-96**), para. 685.\n\n68.\n\nSo far as the 'reasonable basis' requirement is concerned, Eco Oro submits that residual uncertainty associated with the computation of damages should not be used to deprive a claimant of its damages where that uncertainty is a consequence of the State's unlawful conduct.34\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 19-23, citing to *Gold Reserve Inc. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1) Award (22 September 2014) (**Exhibit RL-96**), para. 686; *Crystallex International Corporation v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2) Award (4 April 2016) (**Exhibit CL-85**), paras. 869 and 871; *Hydro S.R.L. and others v Republic of Albania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28) Award (24 April 2019) (**Exhibit CL-226**), paras. 845, 849; and *Watkins Holdings S.\u00c1.R.L. and others v The Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/44) Award (21 January 2020) (**Exhibit CL-229**), para. 685.\n\n69.\n\nEco Oro submits that it has established that it has suffered a loss \u2013 i.e., a total loss of its Angostura Project, referring to the Tribunal's finding in paragraph 634 of the Decision that \"*without a right to exploit* [\u2026] *the Concession became valueless*\". Eco Oro further notes that the Angostura Project had substantial value, which could be observed from objective market behaviour, i.e., the Comparable Transactions.35\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 26-31.\n\n70.\n\nEco Oro submits that it has provided a more than reasonable basis upon which to compute its losses. In this regard, Eco Oro points to the leading guidelines on the valuation of mining assets prepared by CIMVAL, which endorses the comparable transactions methodology as being a \"*primary*\" and \"*widely used*\" methodology to value projects at the Angostura Project's stage of development.36 Eco Oro further notes that this methodology has been accepted by the Parties' experts37 and that the Tribunal has manifested an inclination to follow it in its Decision.38\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 32-36, referring to CIMVAL, Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties (February 2003) (**Exhibit C-85**), pp. 23-24. Eco Oro notes that it is only \"*reasonable*\" to use the comparable transactions methodology to value the Angostura Project if there exist arms-length transactions involving comparable mining properties.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 33, referring to Decision, paras. 899-901; First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 47; First CRA Report, paras. 44 and 64.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 34-35, referring to Decision, paras. 856-858, 902.\n\n71.\n\nEco Oro notes that the Comparable Transactions provide a more than reasonable basis for valuing the Angostura Project, especially when *(i)* the Angostura Project was used to leverage a higher offer by Ventana and *(ii)* numerous independent mining experts, known as qualified persons under NI 43-101 (\"**Qualified Persons**\"), have opined that the Angostura Project is geologically comparable to the mining properties owned by the Comparable Companies \u2013 which were, in fact, described as 'adjacent properties' in the NI 43-101 reports.39\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 35-36, referring to Ventana Gold Corp., Director's Circular Recommending Rejection of the Offer by AUX Canada Acquisition Inc of Ventana Gold Corp (22 December 2010) (**Exhibit C-141**), p. 26; Samuel Engineering, Preliminary Assessment of the La Bodega Project (prepared for Ventana Gold Corp.)

Therefore, Eco Oro argues that there is no need to ascribe an additional precise probability on the likelihood of Angostura's licensability or to amend further Eco Oro's damages computation because the risk that, but-for Colombia's measures, Eco Oro would not have been granted an environmental license for the Angostura Project is already reflected in the valuation.40\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 40-41, 52. Eco Oro notes that if there were any meaningful difference in terms of permitting risk profile between the Angostura Project and the properties that were the subject of the Comparable Transactions, Colombia and its experts would have already raised it.\n\n73.\n\nEco Oro alludes to the fact that Colombia had a legal framework for the granting of environmental licenses in p\u00e1ramos and that Colombia had in fact granted dozens of such licenses.41\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 42, referring to Letter from the National Mining Agency to the Constitutional Court (24 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-44**), p. 8; Decision, para. 793.\n\n74.\n\nEco Oro stresses that the uncertainty associated with the extent to which the Angostura Project would have obtained an environmental license was a consequence of Colombia's own unlawful acts. Therefore, allowing Colombia to reduce the damages owing to Eco Oro on such grounds would not only discount Eco Oro's damages twice for the same risk (because Eco Oro's Comparable Transactions valuation already factors in the negative value effect of the Angostura Project's permitting risks), but it would also reward Colombia for its own wrongdoing.42\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 43-44, citing to *Hydro S.R.L. and others v Republic of Albania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28) Award (24 April 2019) (**Exhibit CL-226**), para. 848; *Crystallex International Corporation v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2) Award (4 April 2016) (**Exhibit CL-85**), para. 871.\n\n75.\n\nEco Oro points to an erroneous reliance on *Bilcon* by Colombia, submitting that there is an important and obvious distinction between Eco Oro's approach to valuation in the present arbitration and the claimant's approach in *Bilcon*: according to Eco Oro, a market-based valuation does not call for an inquiry on licensing probability whereas a discounted cash-flow (\"**DCF**\") valuation does. Finally, Eco Oro notes that the issue limiting the *Bilcon* tribunal's ability to rely on prior transactions for valuation purposes that resulted in the tribunal taking a hybrid approach to valuing damages \u2013 a mid-way point between the claimant's sunk costs and the value implied by the prior transactions \u2013 does not exist in the present case, as each Party's experts accept that the Comparable Transactions must be used in a valuation of the Angostura Project.43\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 45-52, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware v Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 136, 168-169, 220, 276-303. First CRA Report, paras. 47, 64.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nColombia asserts that the burden of proving its losses to the requisite standards falls squarely on Eco Oro. It is Eco Oro's affirmative case that the opportunity that it lost as a result of Colombia's breach of Article 805 had value and consequently it falls on Eco Oro to prove both its losses to a sufficient degree of certainty and that the assumptions underlying its valuation are reasonable rather than speculative.44\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 62.\n\n77.\n\nColombia concurs that the 'balance of probabilities' standard applies so far as causation is concerned.45 In this regard, Colombia asserts that Eco Oro must prove that Colombia's conduct caused its losses \"*in all probability*\" or \"*with a sufficient degree of certainty*\".46\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 49, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), para. 87.

Colombia stresses that, even then, damages for loss of opportunity can only be awarded where the claimant can establish a realistic prospect of the threshold event or assumption materialising.47\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 49-50, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), para. 303; *Infinito Gold Ltd. v Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5) Award (3 June 2021) (**Exhibit RL-197**), para. 585; *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13) Award (27 September 2017) (**Exhibit RL-192**), paras. 943, 945, 986, 1165; *Burlington Resources Inc v Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5) Decision on Reconsideration and Award (7 February 2017) (**Exhibit CL-90**), paras. 250, 278, 279, 287-288.\n\n79.\n\nAccording to Colombia, loss of opportunity damages are calculated on a different \u2013 significantly lower \u2013 basis to damages which can be claimed when causation has been established to the requisite standard. That is because such damages must reflect the likelihood of the opportunity not materialising in light of all relevant risks. Thus, loss of opportunity damages are not calculated on the basis of fair market value, but rather by multiplying expected profits by the probability of such profits materialising.48\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 51, citing to *Joseph Charles Lemire v Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18) Award (28 March 2011) (**Exhibit CL-177**), para. 251, which paraphrases the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (with comments) (2016) (**Exhibit RL-191**), Article 7.4.3(2), comment 2, p. 275: \"*The compensation will therefore be calculated as a proportion of the profit which A might have made.*\"\n\n**C.

Colombia's measures that breached Article 805 deprived Eco Oro of an opportunity to apply for an environmental licence over the Remaining Area of the Concession only, and Eco Oro's own case is that such an opportunity was valueless.51\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 35-36, 82, referring to the Claimant's Memorial, paras. 175-176; Decision, para. 634.\n\n83.\n\nIn the alternative, Colombia considers that Eco Oro would still not be entitled to damages because it has not formulated a loss of opportunity claim nor provided any evidence to assess the value of that opportunity.52\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 84-87, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and* *Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), para. 175 (as the claimants had not proven a causal link between their claimed losses and Canada's NAFTA breach, they were at most entitled to compensation for loss of opportunity).\n\n84.\n\nIn the further alternative, even if the Tribunal were to accept Eco Oro's Comparable Transactions methodology as capable, in principle, of valuing Eco Oro's lost opportunity, the Tribunal should reject Compass Lexecon's valuation because it fails to account for differences in environmental permitting risk and risks associated with a lawful final delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo.53\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 87.\n\n85.\n\nIn the further, further alternative, if the Tribunal were minded to rely on Compass Lexecon's valuation notwithstanding its failure to account for such differences, Colombia submits that the Tribunal should make the adjustments set out in Exhibit R-267.54 Applying such adjustments, Colombia asserts that the Angostura Project would be valued at USD93.84 million, as of the valuation date that Colombia deems correct, 21 December 2018.55\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 87, referring to the Adjusted Compass Lexecon Comparable Transactions Model (**Exhibit R-267**).\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 98, referring to Adjusted Compass Lexecon Comparable Transactions Model (**Exhibit R-267**).\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' ANSWERS TO THE TRIBUNAL'S QUESTIONS**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Question A**\n-----------------\n\n86.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(a) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*Are the losses suffered by Eco Oro for a breach of Article 805 and Article 811 the same, and to be measured in the same way? If not, given the majority Tribunal's reasoning, what is the nature of the loss that Eco Oro has actually suffered, if any?*\"\n\n**(1) The Claimant's First Submission**\n---------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows56:\n\n\"*57. Yes, Eco Oro's losses for breach of Article 805 (**Article 805 (MST) Damages**) and Article 811 (**Article 811 (Expropriation) Damages**) are to be measured in the same way.*[57] *The Majority Tribunal has held that the applicable standard of compensation is the international law standard of full reparation.*[58] *That standard requires the assessment of compensation sufficient to 'wipe out' the effects of Colombia's unlawful measures. As a practical matter, investment tribunals assess compensation to give effect to the principle of full reparation by computing the diminution in fair market value of an investment (ie, the difference in the value of the investment with and without the effects of the unlawful State measures).*[59] *Both Parties are in agreement with respect to that approach.*[60] *In successful expropriation cases, the value of the investment after the unlawful measures is nil, and so damages are computed by determining the fair market value of the investment*[61] *without the effects of the unlawful State measures. Here, while the Majority Tribunal has dismissed Eco Oro's expropriation claim, it has found as a factual matter that the effect of Colombia's measures was tantamount to expropriation given that Eco Oro suffered a 'complete deprivation' that resulted in its investment becoming 'valueless'.*[62] *The Majority Tribunal determined that those same measures breached Article 805 of the Treaty. Therefore, Eco Oro's loss suffered as a result of Colombia's breach of Article 805 is equal to the full value of the Angostura Project.*\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 57. In paragraphs 87-116 of Claimant's First Submission, Eco Oro expands on these arguments.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 87, referring to Claimant's Memorial, para. 376: \"*The harm suffered by Eco Oro as a result of Colombia's unlawful expropriation is the same as the harm suffered as a result of Colombia's unfair and inequitable treatment, and Colombia's failure to provide full protection and security: the total loss of value in its investment.*\" Eco Oro further submits that what matters is the effects of Colombia's measures that breach the Treaty, which calls for a finding of fact, not which Treaty provision was breached (Claimant's First Submission, paras. 88, 100).\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 88, 95-96, 105, referring to Decision, para. 894.

Eco Oro underscores that its covered investment under the Treaty consists of its rights under Concession 3452, i.e., acquired and indivisible rights to explore and to exploit (Claimant's First Submission, paras. 102 *et seq.*, referring to Decision, paras. 439-440, 421-422). Eco Oro adds that the Tribunal had also found that Eco Oro had a right to compensation in the event of a retroactive application of the law leading to the loss of an acquired right (Claimant's First Submission, para. 102, referring to Decision, paras. 435, 439, 467, 470, 473, 476, 641, 687 and 768).\n\nClaimant's First Submission, fn. 88, referring to Decision, para. 634. See also Claimant's First Submission, para. 89, referring to Decision, paras. 633-634.\n\n88.\n\nFinally, Eco Oro argues that, of the market-based methodologies available, the comparable transactions methodology \u2013 which ascribes a value to the Angostura Project based on the value paid for the purchase of other comparable mining projects in real-world transactions \u2013 is considered in the industry to be a \"*primary*\" and \"*widely used*\" methodology for valuing properties that are at the Angostura Project's stage of development.63 Eco Oro underlines that this methodology is only viable where there are transactions involving properties that are genuinely comparable, which is the case with the Comparable Transactions. Eco Oro notes that, given the close similarities to the Angostura Project, these transactions build in the effect on value of any market perception of risk involved in permitting an underground project in the immediate vicinity of the Angostura Project as applicable in the \"but-for\" scenario. Moreover, the Parties' experts have thus accepted that the projects underlying the Comparable Transactions faced sufficiently comparable permitting risks to the Angostura Project, making the Comparable Transactions suitable for valuation purposes.64 Eco Oro further notes that the Tribunal had already expressed a preference for the methodology and the use of the Comparable Transactions for valuation purposes.65\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 113, citing to CIMVAL, Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties (February 2003) (**Exhibit C-85**), pp. 23-24 (referring to the \"*Market*\" methodology, including \"*comparable transactions*\", as being the preferred methodology for \"*Mineral Resource Properties*\"); Rudenno, Victor, *The Mining Valuation Handbook*, 4th ed.

On Eco Oro's own case, the opportunity to pursue a project over the Remaining Area had no value whatsoever: without the part of the deposit lost to the Resolution 2090 Delimitation, the Angostura Project was not economically viable and the remainder of the Concession was therefore worthless.67 Colombia submits that the Tribunal should therefore award Eco Oro zero damages.68\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 22 *et seq.*, referring to Decision, paras. 502, 632, 634, 642, 662, 678, 762, 804- 806, 820-821.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 14-15, 40-42, citing to *Infinito Gold Ltd. v Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5) Award (3 June 2021) (**Exhibit RL-197**), para. 585 (internal citations omitted).\n\n91.\n\nColombia adds that, if Eco Oro's interpretation of the Decision were correct, the respective reasonings of the Tribunal in relation to Article 805 and Article 811 would cancel each other out, which would amount to a failure of the Tribunal to state the reasons on which the Decision is based, in violation of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention. Moreover, according to Colombia, no tribunal has ever found that a substantial deprivation carried out as a valid exercise of police powers amounted, at the same time, to a violation of the MST.69\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 31-32, citing to *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy de Levi v The Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/17) Award (26 February 2014) (**Exhibit RL-95**), paras. 391, 474, 476; *Chemtura Corporation v Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award (2 August 2010) (**Exhibit RL-84**), paras. 192-193, 266-267; *Philip Morris Brand S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v Oriental Republic of Uruguay* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7) Award (8 July 2016) (**Exhibit RL-102**), paras. 307, 420, 434; *Saluka Investments B.V. v The Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL) Partial Award (17 March 2006) (**Exhibit RL-71**), paras. 276, 407, 447; *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and InterAgua Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17) Decision on Liability (30 July 2010) (**Exhibit RL-189**), para. 148; *Marfin Investment Group Holdings S.A., Alexandros Bakatselos and others v Republic of Cyprus* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/27) Award (26 July 2018) (**Exhibit RL-193**), paras. 1218, 1219, 1226, 1227, 1228, 1233.\n\n92.\n\nColombia further submits that, even if it were open to Eco Oro to re-imagine the Tribunal's Decision and to claim that it has suffered a loss of opportunity to apply for a licence over the entirety of the Concession Area as a result of Colombia's Article 805 breach, such a loss could still not be measured as the loss of the fair market value of the Concession as Eco Oro contends. While fair market value is the applicable standard of compensation for expropriation, in all other cases damages must be measured according to the actual harm caused by the breach.70 To the extent the harm suffered by Eco Oro is a loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence, such a loss would need to be measured in a manner that takes account of all relevant risks associated with the Angostura Project, including those identified as significant in the Tribunal's Decision.71 Here, the Tribunal has found that Eco Oro's prospects of securing an environmental licence for the Angostura Project were \"*minimal*\", and that Colombia had the right to lawfully remove parts of the Concession in order to protect the p\u00e1ramo. Neither risk is reflected in Eco Oro's valuation of the fair market value of the Concession. The Tribunal cannot therefore rely on such a valuation.72\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 17 *et seq.*, citing to Decision, para. 894; FTA, Article 819: \"*An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that the other Party has breached: (a) an obligation under Section A* [\u2026] *and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach*\"; International Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) (**Exhibit CL-202**), Article 36(1), pp. 9, 99; *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany/Poland)* (PCIJ), Merits (1928) (**Exhibit CL-1**), p. 47; *S.D.

Eco Oro underscores that the Tribunal's findings derive from an analysis of Colombia's actions \"*viewed as a whole*\".74\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 19-20, referring to Decision, paras. 762, 804-806, 821.\n\n95.\n\nEco Oro takes issue with Colombia's argument, which, according to Eco Oro, consists of ignoring the text of paragraph 821 of the Decision and then relying on the Tribunal's findings in relation to Article 811 of the Treaty that the Challenged Measures were adopted in good faith and thus as part of Colombia's exercise of police powers in order to infer that they therefore must have been acceptable from an international law perspective and thus not in breach of Article 805 of the Treaty. Eco Oro submits that the police powers analysis is based upon a different Treaty provision (Annex 811(b)) and upon different legal criteria than the analysis of the breach of Article 805 of the Treaty.75\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 22.\n\n96.\n\nEco Oro further submits that there is no inconsistency in the Tribunal's conclusion that good faith measures falling within the exercise of a State's police powers pursuant to Annex 811(b) can rise to the level of a breach of the MST/FET standard under Article 805 of the Treaty. According to Eco Oro, this derives from the Tribunal's determination that \"*bad faith is not required*\" to determine that Colombia's actions are unacceptable from an international law standpoint and breach the MST/FET standard and is in keeping with a consistent line of case law holding that state measures need not be in bad faith to rise to the level of a breach of MST/FET.76 Eco Oro stresses that the Tribunal applied two distinct legal obligations separately and, contrary to Colombia's contention, the Tribunal's reasoning under Article 811 and under Article 805 do not \"*cancel each other out*\".77\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 23, citing to Decision, para. 806; *Siemens AG v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8) Award (6 February 2007) (**Exhibit CL-41**), paras. 292-300; *Mondev International Ltd. v United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2) Final Award (11 October 2002) (**Exhibit CL-161**), para. 116; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v The Republic of Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8) Award, (12 May 2005) (**Exhibit CL-31**), para. 280.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 24.\n\n97.\n\nEco Oro also dismisses Colombia's invocation of the *Marfin* award. According to Eco Oro, in none of the cases cited by Colombia did the tribunals hold that a legitimate exercise of police powers was a valid defence against a breach of the FET standard. Eco Oro submits that there is no inconsistency insofar as the Tribunal has interpreted each provision as setting out a different legal test and has made different findings in the context of each analysis.78\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 26, citing to *Marfin Investment Group Holdings S.A., Alexandros Bakatselos and others v Republic of Cyprus* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/27) Award (26 July 2018) (**Exhibit RL-193**), paras. 868-870, 888, 893-894, 991, 993, 1218; *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy de Levi v Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/17) Award (26 February 2014) (**Exhibit RL-95**), paras. 324-392; *Philip Morris Brand S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v Oriental Republic of Uruguay* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7) Award (8 July 2016) (**Exhibit RL-102**), paras. 388-435; *Chemtura Corporation v Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award (2 August 2010) (**Exhibit RL-84**); *Saluka Investments B.V. v The Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL) Partial Award (17 March 2006) (**Exhibit RL-71**), paras. 276-278, 497-499.\n\n98.\n\nEco Oro further dismisses Colombia's invocation of the *Suez v Argentina* decision, as, on that tribunal's own analysis, the police powers doctrine cannot be used as a defence to an FET claim. Moreover, Eco Oro invoked the decisions in *Vivendi v Argentina* and in *AWG v Argentina* to depict an instance where a substantial deprivation carried out as a valid exercise of police powers amounted, at the same time, to a violation of the MST.79\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 27-29, citing to *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19) Decision on Liability (30 July 2010) (**Exhibit CL-65**), paras. 139-140, 147-148, 236-238, 243, 247. Despite invoking *AWG v Argentina* at paragraph 28 of its Reply, Eco Oro does not cite to any specific decision in this case nor does this case feature in Eco Oro's Consolidated Index of Legal Authorities. For completeness, *AWG v Argentina* was entered into the record with Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits: *AWG Group Ltd. v The Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL) Decision on Liability (30 July 2010) (**Exhibit RL-83**).\n\n99.\n\nEco Oro submits that the Tribunal would not have proceeded to consider damages insofar as the Challenged Measures (which the Tribunal held rendered Eco Oro's investment valueless) did not breach the Treaty. In other words, having concluded that the Challenged Measures resulted in Eco Oro's investment having zero value, had the Tribunal found that these Measures did not breach the Treaty, and only *subsequent* measures gave rise to a breach of Article 805 of the Treaty, there would have been no need to proceed to a damages analysis. Eco Oro adds that it would not have been necessary to make any finding as to causation if the Challenged Measures, which the Tribunal concluded caused 100% of any loss suffered by Eco Oro, had not breached the Treaty.80\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 30-40.\n\n100.\n\nEco Oro further dismisses Colombia's invocation of the *Infinito Gold* decision, because, unlike Eco Oro, the *Infinito* claimant only had an exploration concession.81 According to Eco Oro, it is the value of the right to exploit that must be assessed by the Tribunal, as it is a self-standing right that can be transferred and sold by its titleholder, and it is Eco Oro's investment under the Treaty.82\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 42, citing to *Infinito Gold Ltd. v Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5) Procedural Order No. 2 (1 June 2016) (**Exhibit RL-137**), paras. 584-585.

Eco Oro submits that the Tribunal has already decided to apply the fair market valuation standard, which has been the common position of the Parties and their experts throughout the arbitration, and that decision cannot be reopened at this stage.83 Eco Oro adds that Colombia's newfound invocation of the loss of opportunity doctrine is unavailing.84 Eco Oro submits that in this case there is objective market data in the form of the three Comparable Transactions in connection with three properties adjacent to and landlocked within Concession 3452. Both Parties' valuation experts agree these properties are comparable and should be used in a valuation of Claimant's losses based on the comparable transactions methodology.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 47-49, citing to Respondent's Response, paras. 44-45; First CRA Report, para. 19; B.

Colombia adds that the Majority Tribunal found that Colombia breached Article 805 by failing to provide clarity as to Eco Oro's rights in respect of the Remaining Area of the Concession (the area not deprived by the Challenged Measures), while not preserving Eco Oro's rights with respect to the Concession until such clarity was provided.85\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 14.\n\n103.\n\nColombia asserts that Eco Oro was unable to rebut Colombia's arguments. First, the acts which gave rise to the MST breach occurred after the Challenged Measures, and are distinct from the Challenged Measures.86 Second, the finding that there was no mining ban when the FTA entered into force means nothing more than that the implementation of the ban after the FTA entered into force could, in principle, breach the FTA.87 Third, there is no reason to presume that the Challenged Measures breached Article 805 and doing so would render the second stage of the Tribunal's Article 805 analysis moot.88 Fourth, if Eco Oro was right that the Challenged Measures breached Article 805 and Eco Oro's existing evidence that relies on a purported fair market value valuation of the Concession as at the date of VSC 829 was appropriate, the Tribunal would not have asked the Parties further questions.89 Fifth, it would be nonsensical for the Tribunal to find that the same measures are diametrically opposed in nature in different sections of the Decision.90\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 17-22.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 23.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 24.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 25.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 26, citing to *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and InterAgua Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17) Decision on Liability (30 July 2010) (**Exhibit RL-189**), para. 148; *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19) Decision on Liability (30 July 2010) (**Exhibit CL-65**), paras. 44-57, 140, 235, 237-246; *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy de Levi v The Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/17) Award (26 February 2014) (**Exhibit RL-95**), paras. 333, 339, 349-359, 373, 382, 453; *Philip Morris Brand S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v Oriental Republic of Uruguay* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7) Award (8 July 2016) (**Exhibit RL-102**), paras. 306-307, 419-420; *Saluka Investments B.V. v The Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL) Partial Award (17 March 2006) (**Exhibit RL-71**), paras. 271-275, 498-499; *Chemtura Corporation v Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award (2 August 2010) (**Exhibit RL-84**), para. 266; *Marfin Investment Group Holdings S.A., Alexandros Bakatselos and others v Republic of Cyprus* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/27) Award (26 July 2018) (**Exhibit RL-193**), paras. 830, 983, 985, 987, 1218-1219, 1226-1228, 1233.\n\n104.\n\nColombia notes the Tribunal found that Eco Oro's chances of obtaining an environmental licence for a project were \"*minimal*\" even assuming that no mining ban were to apply to the Concession. Accordingly, but for any of Colombia's measures, Eco Oro would, in all probability, have failed to secure an environmental licence. This means that Eco Oro would ultimately have relinquished the Concession without any financial return. Accordingly, no compensation is due under the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* principle because the difference between Eco Oro's position as a result of Colombia's breaches and the position it would have occupied, in all probability, but for such breaches is zero.91\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 28-29, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 168, 175-176; *Infinito Gold Ltd. v Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5) Award (3 June 2021) (**Exhibit RL-197**), para. 585; *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13) Award (27 September 2017) (**Exhibit RL-192**), para. 1165; *Perenco Ecuador Limited v The Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6) Award (27 September 2019) (**Exhibit CL-228**), paras. 317-325; *Burlington Resources Inc. v Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5) Decision on Reconsideration and Award (7 February 2017) (**Exhibit CL-90**), paras. 279-283.\n\n105.\n\nColombia submits that Eco Oro's continued attempt to sidestep its burden of proving a loss that is consistent with the Tribunal's findings further reinforces the conclusion that the opportunity to apply for such a licence lost by Eco Oro as a result of Colombia's Article 805 breaches is too speculative to have any tangible value. Colombia further takes issue with Eco Oro's construction of the decision in *Infinito Gold*.92 The Tribunal did not conclude that causation between the treaty breach and the loss of a licensable project was established. The only loss that the Tribunal considered to be established was the loss of an opportunity to apply for an environmental licence which had \"*minimal*\" prospects of succeeding.93 Colombia further submits that the authorities invoked by Eco Oro do not support its attempt to sidestep its burden of proof or to shift it onto Colombia.94\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 31-33, citing to *Infinito Gold Ltd. v Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5) Award (3 June 2021) (**Exhibit RL-197**), paras. 370, 520, 572, 584-585.

The fact that the Parties agree on the principles of fair market value does not mean that Colombia agrees that fair market value is the appropriate measure of any loss Eco Oro may have suffered as a result of the standalone breach of Article 805 found by the Tribunal.95\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 41-45.\n\n**B. Question B**\n-----------------\n\n107.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(b) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*Should the expert evidence adduced by the Parties be revised, given the majority Tribunal's findings that Colombia is not in breach of Article 811 but is in breach of Article 805? If so, how?*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows96:\n\n\"*58. No, the Tribunal need not seek from the Parties nor turn to any revised expert evidence in order to compute Article 805 (MST) Damages. Both Parties agree that the appropriate measure of computing Article 805 (MST) Damages is to observe the diminution in the fair market value of the affected investment.*[97] *Both Parties have instructed their valuation experts to compute damages on that basis.*[98] *Therefore, the Tribunal already has before it expert evidence that, by design and in accordance with the Parties' instructions, has been prepared to compute Article 805 (MST) Damages.*\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 58. In paragraphs 117-124 of Claimant's First Submission, Eco Oro expands on these arguments.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 118-119, referring to Decision, paras. 894, 896; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v The Republic of Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8) Award (12 May 2005) (**Exhibit CL-31**), para. 410; *Azurix Corp. v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12) Award (14 July 2006) (**Exhibit CL-35**), para. 424; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3) Award (22 May 2007) (**Exhibit CL-42**), paras. 359-363; *Sempra Energy International v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16) Award (28 September 2007) (**Exhibit CL-44**), paras. 403-406; *El Paso Energy International Company v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15) Award (31 October 2011) (**Exhibit CL-73**), paras. 703-705; Claimant's Memorial, paras. 375-377; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 441-443.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 120-123, referring to Instruction Letter (15 January 2018) (**Exhibit CLEX- 1**), p. 2; First CRA Report, paras. 16, 19; First Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 2-3, 8; First CRA Report, paras. 8-9. Eco Oro notes that, by instructing CRA to deduct \"residual value\" from the fair market value of the Angostura Project, Colombia's instructions necessarily implied a computation of Article 805 (MST) Damages as opposed to Article 811 (Expropriation) Damages, as the computation for an expropriation would plainly require no identification of or deduction for residual value (Claimant's First Submission, para. 123). Nonetheless, Eco Oro reiterates that Colombia's valuations are flawed and do not properly reflect the actual diminution in the fair market value of Eco Oro's investment (Claimant's First Submission, para. 123, referring to Claimant's Reply Memorial, paras. 623-626; Claimant's Opening Statement (**Exhibit CH-1(A)**), pp. 179-182; Claimant's PHB, paras. 80-84).\n\n**(2) Respondent's Response**\n-----------------------------\n\n109.\n\nAccording to Colombia, any damages resulting from Colombia's Article 805 breach cannot exceed the amount necessary to place Eco Oro in the financial position it would have occupied but for the specific measures identified by the Tribunal as an Article 805 breach. But for such measures, Eco Oro would have held a right to apply for an environmental licence in respect of the portion of the Concession that had not already lawfully been removed by the Challenged Measures. On Eco Oro's own case, the opportunity to apply for a licence for a project over the Remaining Area was valueless. Eco Oro's claim for damages should end here, and there is no need, therefore, for the expert evidence adduced by the Parties to be revised.99\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 52-55.\n\n110.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal were to accept Eco Oro's interpretation of the Decision being that the measures that breached Article 805 caused Eco Oro to lose the opportunity to apply for a licence over the entirety of the Concession (and not just the Remaining Area), Colombia submits that *(i)* as Eco Oro has not offered any evidence that would allow the Tribunal to reasonably compute the value, if any, of the lost opportunity to apply for a licence, the Tribunal cannot award any damages to Eco Oro;100 and *(ii)* because Eco Oro has failed to revise its expert evidence to factor in the specific risk that a lawful delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo would result in a project being unfeasible within the Concession Area, the Tribunal cannot rely on Compass Lexecon's valuation as a measure of Eco Oro's lost opportunity.101\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 56-67, citing to *William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2009-04) Award of Jurisdiction and Liability (17 March 2015) (**Exhibit RL-18**), paras. 18, 552; *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 87, 168, 276-279, 303; *Infinito Gold Ltd. v Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5) Decision on Jurisdiction (4 December 2017) (Exhibit RL-24), para. 252; *Infinito Gold Ltd. v Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5) Award (3 June 2021) (**Exhibit RL-197**), para. 585; *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13) Award (27 September 2017) (**Exhibit RL-192**), paras. 1159, 1165.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 68-81.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n111.\n\nEco Oro reiterates that there was no need to submit new expert evidence in light of the Tribunal's conclusions regarding Colombia's breaches of Article 805 of the Treaty. Eco Oro notes that Compass Lexecon's valuation, on which Eco Oro relies, properly reflects licensing risks associated with the Angostura Project and that none of Colombia's arguments in its Response undermines that conclusion.102\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 93.\n\n112.\n\nIn any event, Eco Oro contends that *(i)* it has met its burden of proof and there was no need for expert evidence on licensability risks;103 *(ii)* Eco Oro was insulated from the risk of a mining ban;104 and *(iii)* Colombia's contention that the p\u00e1ramo delimitation risk renders the Angostura Project essentially valueless is demonstrably false given transactions involving the adjacent projects.105\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 62-85.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 86-89, referring to Decision, paras. 435, 439, 467, 470, 473, 476, 641, 687, 768, 804.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 90-92, referring to Aris Gold Press Release, \"Aris Gold To Become Operator Of The Soto Norte Gold Project In Colombia\" (21 March 2022) (**Exhibit C-479**).\n\n113.\n\nEco Oro submits that there is evidence that the Comparable Transactions are sufficiently comparable to the Angostura Project, contrary to Colombia's submission.106 Eco Oro notes that Colombia's new argument suggesting material differences between the Angostura Project and the Comparable Transactions is opportunistic and reflects the fact that Colombia now has a fourth opportunity to make written submissions on Eco Oro's approach to valuation.107 Eco Oro asserts that Colombia's valuation experts at CRA used the Comparable Transactions for valuation purposes, without making *any* adjustments to them. Eco Oro submits that, if there were any meaningful distinctions in respect of licensing risks between the Angostura Project and the Comparable Transactions, Colombia would have adduced evidence on that point.108\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 64-72, referring to Samuel Engineering, \"Preliminary Assessment: La Bodega Project Prepared for Ventana Gold Corp\" (8 November 2010) (**Exhibit C-134**); Scott Wilson Mining, *Technical Report on the California Project for Calvista Gold Corporation* (17 January 2011) (**Exhibit C-143**); SRK Consulting (US), Inc, NI 43- 101 Technical Report on Resources: California Gold-Silver Project Report Prepared for Galway Resources (25 October 2012) (**Exhibit C-168**); Ventana Gold Corp., Director's Circular Recommending Rejection of the Offer by AUX Canada Acquisition Inc. of Ventana Gold Corp.

Eco Oro further notes that Colombia does not disagree with Eco Oro's submission that, if the Tribunal is to award damages based on the fair market value standard, then the Tribunal already has expert evidence upon which to make that computation. Instead, Colombia now contends for the first time in its Response that \"fair market value\" is not the correct standard of compensation (Claimant's Reply, para. 60).\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 65.\n\n114.\n\nEco Oro submits that Colombia's attempt to compare the availability of evidence before the present Tribunal on Angostura's licensing prospects with the evidence available in other, unrelated cases is inapposite.109 Eco Oro submits that in all the cases that Colombia cites, the claimants were seeking damages computed by reference to a DCF methodology, which is premised on accepting the future profitability of the project at issue. That same assumption is not at the heart of Eco Oro's valuation, which is based on actual observed sums paid in the market for adjacent unlicensed projects for which future licensing and profitability was also not guaranteed. None of the cases that Colombia relies on in its Response had comparable transactions like the ones available in the present case, and so the different evidentiary findings made in the cases relied on by Colombia are meaningless.110\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 73-85, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 276-303; *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Jurisdiction and Liability (17 March 2015) (**Exhibit RL-18**), paras. 589-604; *Infinito Gold Ltd. v Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5) Award (3 June 2021) (**Exhibit RL-197**), paras. 584-585; *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13) Award (27 September 2017) (**Exhibit RL-192**), paras. 1131, 1147, 1151, 1162-1199; *Burlington Resources Inc. v Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5) Decision on Reconsideration and Award (7 February 2017) (**Exhibit CL-90**), paras. 287-288.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 84.\n\n**(4) Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nColombia notes Eco Oro accepts that if the Majority Tribunal's finding that Colombia's breach of Article 805 arose from distinct measures adopted after the Challenged Measures is correct, the loss of opportunity to pursue a project over the remainder of the Concession was valueless. In that scenario, there is no need for the expert evidence adduced by the Parties to be revised.111 Conversely, if, as Eco Oro contends, the Article 805 breach included the Challenged Measures and deprived Eco Oro of an opportunity to apply for an environmental licence over the entirety of the Concession, then it was incumbent upon Eco Oro to revise its expert evidence in order to prove that its lost opportunity had a value.112\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 46.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 47.\n\n116.\n\nColombia argues that Eco Oro's expert evidence remains premised on assumptions that are inconsistent with the Majority Tribunal's findings. Eco Oro's \"fair market value\" damages claim fails to factor in the environmental licensing risk and the risk of mining being banned over part of the Angostura Deposit. Colombia accuses Eco Oro of mischaracterising the decisions cited by Colombia.113\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 48-53, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 231, 276 (the *Bilcon* claimants requested damages on the basis of the profits they would have made had their project obtained an environmental permit); para. 168 (causal link not proven to the international law standard with regard to future profits, but a realistic possibility of success of the environmental permit application was proven on the basis of extensive and specific evidence, reason why the Tribunal awarded loss of chance damages \u2013 see also, with regard to \"realistic possibility\", paras. 137-142); paras. 175-176 (the only injury that had been proven was the loss of the opportunity to have the environmental impact of the project assessed fairly); paras. 134-144, 552 (environmental licensability).\n\n117.\n\nColombia contends that fair market value, whether assessed through DCF or a comparables approach, reflects a project's forward-looking value or expected profitability.114 A project that is expected to generate no profit is worthless. Colombia therefore considers that Eco Oro's contention that the Comparable Transactions methodology does not require proving future profitability is a fallacious distinction between a comparables analysis and a DCF.115\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 54-55, referring to First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 54; CIMVAL, \"Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties\" (February 2003) (**Exhibit CRA-43**), G2.1; South African Mineral Asset Valuation Committee of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, South African Code for the Reporting of Mineral Asset Valuation (**Exhibit BD-11**), para. 18; VALMIN, \"The Australian Code for Public Reporting of Technical Assessments and Valuations of Mineral Assets\" (2015) (**Exhibit R-288**), para. 8.1; R.

Day 4, 1110:13-1111:4, 1129:8-13 (Mr Jorgensen and Mr Guarnera); Tr.

Colombia notes that a potential purchaser of the Angostura Project, at either Party's valuation date, or a transacting party of any of the Comparable Transactions, would have been acutely aware that the most recent and detailed p\u00e1ramo delimitation showed a value-destroying overlap with the Angostura Deposit, but none with the deposits of the Comparable Transactions.118\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 73-80, referring, *inter alia*, to SRK Consulting, NI 43-101 Technical Report Feasibility Study of the Soto Norte Gold Project, Santander, Colombia (1 January 2021) (**Exhibit R-301**), Sections 1.12.6, 20.2; \"El proyecto Soto Norte no est\u00e1 dentro del P\u00e1ramo de Santurb\u00e1n\", *El Tiempo* (12 February 2020) (**Exhibit R-298**).\n\n**C. Question C**\n-----------------\n\n120.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(c) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*Given the Tribunal's findings on the merits and given its analysis above with respect to the inapplicability both of an income-based valuation methodology and Colombia's chosen comparable transactions, is Eco Oro's proposed Comparable Transactions methodology the one to be applied, or is there an alternative methodology which should be considered given the nature of Eco Oro's losses?*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows119:\n\n\"59. *Eco Oro's valuation using the three Comparable Transactions is the most appropriate way to calculate Eco Oro's damages, and more than exceeds Eco Oro's standard of proof.*[120] *Both Parties' experts agree that, in accordance with the leading industry-specific guidance supplied by CIMVAL, the appropriate valuation methodology for the Angostura Project, based on its stage of development, is a market-based valuation.*[121] *Both Parties' experts have dismissed an income-based*[122] *or cost-based valuation.*[123] *The Parties' experts have submitted two types of market-based valuations: valuations based on comparable transactions (both Parties' experts have computed damages using this methodology), and a valuation based on Eco Oro's market capitalization (only Colombia's experts have used this methodology).

Eco Oro alludes to a possible application of a costs-based valuation: one that yields a value equal to a multiple of sunk costs to adequately reflect the fact that historical costs are incurred to derive a greater, future economic benefit. Based on the Angostura Project's stage of development, Eco Oro submits that a multiplication factor of 3 would be appropriate to Eco Oro's sunk costs of approximately USD250 million. This would bring its value to USD750 million, before interest, which is 7.7% higher than Compass Lexecon's comparable transactions valuation based on the Comparable Transactions (Claimant's First Submission, para. 151, referring to CIMVAL, Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties (February 2003) (**Exhibit C-85**), p. 23 (PDF, p. 25); Rudenno, Victor, *The Mining Valuation Handbook*, 4th ed.

and *(ii)* the *Bilcon* tribunal did not suggest that the comparable transactions methodology entitled a claimant to sidestep its burden of proving that it would have suffered the losses claimed but for the breaches139 and did not suggest that a valuation on the basis of comparable transactions would have been appropriate notwithstanding a failure to prove causation to the international law standard.140\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 86-87, referring to Claimant's First Submission, paras. 45-52.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 87, referring to CIMVAL, \"Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties\" (February 2003) (**Exhibit CRA-43**), S3.1, p. 13;

and citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 168, 281-282, 299.\n\n127.\n\nFinally, Colombia submits that, because Eco Oro has neither revised its expert evidence to account for the Tribunal's Decision, nor offered any alternative methodology to value its loss of opportunity that does properly account for the relevant risks, Eco Oro has failed to begin to meet its burden of proving its loss or offering any reasonable methodology for valuing its amount.141\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 89.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n128.\n\nEco Oro asserts that Colombia's contentions *(i)* are premised on a mischaracterisation of the nature of Eco Oro's loss, *(ii)* are erroneous so far as the Comparable Transactions are concerned, and *(iii)* misconstrue the *Bilcon* decision.142\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 96.\n\n129.\n\nEco Oro notes that, despite all protestations, Colombia's only valuation that it submits with its Response is one that uses, exclusively, the same three Comparable Transactions used in Eco Oro's valuation.143\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 97, referring to Respondent's Response, para. 98; Adjusted Compass Lexecon Comparable Transactions Model (**Exhibit R-267**).\n\n**(4) Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nColombia asserts that Eco Oro's Comparable Transactions methodology should not be applied, because, on Eco Oro's own evidence, the opportunity that Eco Oro lost as a result of Colombia's Article 805 breach was valueless. Therefore, the Tribunal should value such opportunity as zero.144\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 81.\n\n131.\n\nIn the alternative, Colombia considers that Eco Oro would still not be entitled to damages because it has not formulated a loss of opportunity claim nor provided any evidence to assess the value of that opportunity.145\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 84-87, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and* *Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), para. 175 (as the claimants had not proven a causal link between their claimed losses and Canada's NAFTA breach, they were at most entitled to compensation for loss of opportunity).\n\n132.\n\nIn the further alternative, even if the Tribunal were to accept Eco Oro's Comparable Transactions methodology as capable, in principle, of valuing Eco Oro's lost opportunity, the Tribunal should reject Compass Lexecon's valuation because it fails to account for differences in environmental permitting risk and risks associated with a lawful final delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo.146\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 87.\n\n133.\n\nIn the further, further alternative, if the Tribunal were minded to rely on Compass Lexecon's valuation notwithstanding its failure to account for such differences, Colombia submits that the Tribunal should make the adjustments set out in Exhibit R-267.147\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 98-99 and Rejoinder, para. 87, referring to the Adjusted Compass Lexecon Comparable Transactions Model (**Exhibit R-267**).\n\n**D. Question D**\n-----------------\n\n134.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(d) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*How can Eco Oro's loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence to allow exploitation be valued? On what basis is the quantum of that loss, if any, to be assessed?*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows148:\n\n\"*60. Eco Oro's loss must be computed in accordance with the international law standard of full reparation.*[149] *The Parties agree that, to implement that standard, the Tribunal must observe the diminution in the fair market value of the investment: that is, the value of the investment with and without the effects of the measures. For the reasons given in response to Question C, the best way to compute the fair market value of the Angostura Project is using the three Comparable Transactions that both Parties have endorsed for valuation purposes.*\n\n*61. The value of Eco Oro having been deprived of the opportunity to apply for an environmental license is equal to the value of Eco Oro's acquired rights under Concession 3452 in relation to the Angostura Project.*[150] *As the Decision states, by removing Eco Oro's ability to apply for an environmental license, Colombia removed Eco Oro's ability to pursue exploitation: 'there was no possibility of exploiting the Angostura Deposit such that the Concession became valueless'.*[151] *Calculating the Angostura Project's fair market value by reference to the Comparable Transactions naturally accounts for the value consequences that the market ascribes for permitting risks that both Parties' experts accept are comparable to those applicable to the Angostura Project.*[152]\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 60-61.

According to Eco Oro, damages cannot be based on the loss of an opportunity to apply for an environmental license, which is not a free-standing right that can be bought, sold or valued independently of Eco Oro's concession rights.154 Finally, Eco Oro notes that computing the \"loss of chance\" or \"loss of opportunity\" in this case would result in an *increase* to Eco Oro's damages, as Eco Oro, beyond the diminution in the fair market value of the Angostura Project, also lost the \"opportunity\" to increase the value of the project in the future through the successful application for an environmental license.

According to Colombia, Compass Lexecon's Comparable Transactions analysis suffers from multiple defects which render its results unreliable and grossly inflated.158\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 96-97, referring to Respondent's Counter-Memorial, Section VII.B.2(i) and VII.B.3; Respondent's Rejoinder, Section V.B.2.; First Rossi Report, Section VII.A; Second Rossi Report, para. 13; First CRA Report, Section IX.B and IX.C; Second CRA Report, Section II.2; Johnson Report, para. 98, Section VII; Second Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 45-48, 107-115; First Rossi Report, V.C.4, VI.D.1; First Rossi Report, Sections III and IV, para. 92; First Rossi Report, VI.D.2; Second Rossi Report, Section V; First CRA Report, paras. 78-79; First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 59; Second CRA Report, Section II.1.2; First Rossi Report, para. 212; Second CRA Report, Section II.2.1.1; First Rossi Report, Section VII.A; Second Rossi Report, Section VII; Johnson Report, Section V.F-H; Second Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 45-48, 113-115; Second CRA Report, paras. 96-100; \"Capital Cost Adjustment\" tab (**Exhibit CLEX-73**); Samuel Engineering, \"Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report, Preliminary Assessment, La Bodega Project, Department of Santander, Colombia\" (Effective Date 8 November 2010) (**Exhibit CRA-62**), p. 118, Table 20.6; First CRA Report, para. 67; Updated Valuation of the Angostura Project Based on the Value of Comparable Assets, Tab 9 (**Exhibit CRA-97.9**); Second CRA Report, paras. 91-92, 94; Johnson Report, paras. 60, 96; Johnson Report, paras. 98-115, 117-121; Golder PEA (**Exhibit CRA-40**), pp. 6, 257; Updated Valuation of the Angostura Project Based on the Value of Comparable Assets (**Exhibit CRA-97.9**).\n\n140.\n\nColombia notes that the dynamic spreadsheet presented by Eco Oro159 fails to allow the Tribunal to make adjustments for the majority of the flaws in Compass Lexecon's valuation identified by Colombia and its experts. Colombia therefore provides a calculation spreadsheet,160 which mirrors the calculation spreadsheet prepared by Compass Lexecon, where the impact of such adjustments is set out. Colombia asserts that, applying the adjustments which Colombia's experts have proven to be required would imply a valuation of the Angostura Project at USD93.84 million, as of the correct valuation date, 21 December 2018.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 98, referring to Claimant's First Submission, para. 55; Updated Compass Lexecon Transactions Method Model (**Exhibit CLEX- 73**).\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 98, referring to Adjusted Compass Lexecon Comparable Transactions Model (**Exhibit R-267**).\n\n141.\n\nFinally, Colombia underscores that such an adjusted valuation would still not be appropriate for all of the reasons addressed in Colombia's responses to the Tribunal's other Questions, including because *(i)* it does not account for differences in the environmental licensing risk between the Angostura Project and Compass Lexecon's chosen transactions; *(ii)* it fails to account for the risk of a lawful delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo rendering any project unfeasible; and *(iii)* it uses Compass Lexecon's methodology for adjusting the comparable transaction values to the valuation date that the Tribunal has already rejected as unreliable.161\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 99.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n142.\n\nEco Oro notes that Colombia has failed to address the vast majority of the points made by Eco Oro in its First Submission.162 Eco Oro further takes issue with Colombia's contention that the Tribunal can only award damages to Eco Oro insofar as it can prove that it would have established a feasible mining project and received an environmental permit.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 99, referring to Claimant's First Submission, paras. 102-104 157-159, 165, 168, 169-176; Decision, paras. 416-440, 633-634, 896; Concession Contract 3452 (8 February 2007) (**Exhibit C-16**), Clauses 5 and 6; 2001 Mining Code (Law 685) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Articles 45, 49, 58-59, 197; CIMVAL, \"Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties\" (February 2003) (**Exhibit C-85**), pp. 23-25; *Crystallex International Corporation v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2) Award (4 April 2016) (**Exhibit CL-85**), paras. 901-905; *Anatolie Stati and Others v The Republic of Kazakhstan* (SCC Arbitration V (116/2010)) Award (19 December 2013) (**Exhibit CL-80**), para. 1625; *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v The Russian Federation* (UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA 227) Award (18 July 2014) (**Exhibit CL-81**), paras. 1785-1787; *Joseph Charles Lemire v Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18) Award (28 March 2011) (**Exhibit CL-177**), paras. 250-252.\n\n143.\n\nEco Oro argues that Colombia's position must be rejected for the following reasons: *(i)* Eco Oro is not claiming the value of a licensed project nor has it carried out an income-based valuation of the Angostura Project based on a projection of the cash flows that the project would have generated had it received an environmental license (as the claimants did in the *Bilcon, Burlington, Infinito* and *Caratube* cases cited by Colombia). Moreover, Eco Oro asserts that it has not done so because Colombia's measures have prevented it from advancing its mine design to the point where it could prepare a PTO (and an EIA) upon which to base such an income-based valuation;163 *(ii)* Eco Oro is claiming the value of its right to develop the Angostura Project in its unlicensed state, based on objective market data, which is already discounted to reflect licensing risks perceived by the market; *(iii)* Eco Oro is not calling upon the Tribunal to make a finding that, *but for* Colombia's measures, its Angostura Project would have received an environmental license and proceeded to operate a mine at any specific levels of production, thus generating a certain level of cash flows; *(iv)* it is only necessary for the Tribunal to determine that there were prospects of obtaining an environmental license for the Angostura Project, such that the causal link between Colombia's unlawful measures and Eco Oro's losses has not been broken.164\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 100, referring to Decision, para. 896.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 100(d), referring to Decision, paras. 632, 848; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, para. 488 (licensability as a matter of causality).\n\n144.\n\nWith regard to the downward adjustments that Colombia submits should be made to Compass Lexecon's valuation, Eco Oro asserts that there is no basis for making the proposed adjustments.165 Eco Oro submits that it would be unsafe for the Tribunal to rely on attempts at valuation and estimates of capital and operating costs prepared by Mr Johnson, who, according to Eco Oro, is inexperienced in valuation, uses metrics way beyond industry norms, and did not visit the Angostura Project site or review key aspects of the studies and data which were relied on by the Qualified Persons from NCL and Golder Associates when preparing PEAs in 2011 and 2012.

The adjusted Compass Lexecon valuation submitted as Exhibit R-267 (resubmitted by Eco Oro as Exhibit C-464 with minor changes to account for rounding differences) is provided as a third alternative submission, should the Tribunal reject Colombia's first three submissions and should the Tribunal consider it appropriate to adopt Compass Lexecon's valuation notwithstanding its failure to adequately reflect the Angostura Project's \"minimal\" chances of securing an environmental licence and the risk of a lawful delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo over part or all of the Angostura Deposit.177\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 108-110.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 110, referring to Compass Lexecon's valuation model (**Exhibit CLEX-73**); Adjusted Compass Lexecon Comparable Transactions Model (**Exhibit R-267**); Colombia's Comparable Transactions Valuation Model of 23 May 2022, with Claimant's corrections (**Exhibit C-464**); and **Appendix A** to Respondent's Rejoinder, containing references to the record justifying the required adjustments to the Comparable Transactions.\n\n**E. Question E**\n-----------------\n\n148.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(e) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*What is the probability that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo overlaps with the Angostura Deposit and to what extent?*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows178:\n\n\"*62. There is an important distinction that has been drawn in these proceedings between the concept of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo from a regulatory perspective, as compared to an ecological (or scientific) perspective.*[179] *From an ecological and scientific perspective, p\u00e1ramo ecosystems can be identified based on the presence of a combination of specific factors \u2013 including atmospheric factors (eg high humidity, low temperature), geological factors (eg altitude, level terrain) and biological factors (eg soil composed of dense organic matter, vegetation dominated by grass and shrubs) \u2013 which result in certain functional characteristics that are specific to p\u00e1ramo ecosystems (eg the ability to capture water).*[180] *The location of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo ecosystem can therefore be objectively determined, from an ecological and scientific perspective, based on these factors and functional characteristics. By contrast, from a regulatory perspective, the delimitation of the mining exclusion zone known as the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo would be based on criteria dictated not only by science but by policy. This could result in a delimitation that deviates significantly from the boundaries of the ecological p\u00e1ramo.*\n\n*63. It is not possible to predict the location of the 'regulatory Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo' (ie the area over which the Government wishes to establish a mining ban) because its delimitation will not be based solely upon objective scientific criteria, but on policy considerations that are inherently subjective in nature. That regulatory delimitation exercise has yet to be completed by Colombia, more than four years after the Colombian Constitutional Court struck down the delimitation set out in Resolution 2090 and ordered that a new delimitation be published within one year.*[181]\n\n*64. The Tribunal's question regarding 'the probability that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo overlaps with the Angostura Deposit and to what extent' can be answered from an ecological perspective.*[182] *The most precise delimitation available to the Tribunal is the one prepared by Ecodes,*[183] *and commissioned by Eco Oro, which even Colombia's witness, Ms Baptiste endorsed as a 'qualified and informed opinion' that was prepared 'in greater detail' than the work carried out by the IAVH.*[184] *Based on the Ecodes Report, the probability that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, from an ecological perspective, overlaps with the Angostura Deposit is zero.*[185]\n\n*65. In any case, as addressed in Eco Oro's response to Question F, whether or not the 'regulatory' or the 'ecological' p\u00e1ramo overlaps with the Angostura Deposit, the issue is not relevant to determine the quantum of compensation owed to Eco Oro.*[186]\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 62-65.

Eco Oro adds that, in order to carry out the Angostura Project, Eco Oro would seek and environmental licence only in relation to the areas to be exploited, and not in relation to the whole Concession.

Colombia clarifies that, while the Constitutional Court had initially required that the delimitation exercise be completed within one year, the Ministry of Environment has lawfully extended the period for completion of the delimitation by obtaining extensions of this deadline in the domestic courts, as well as the dismissal of contempt proceedings initiated against it for alleged non-compliance with the Court's order (Administrative Tribunal of Santander, File No. 2015-00734-00, Order (25 September 2018) (**Exhibit R-229**), pp. 19, 23-24; Santander Administrative Tribunal, Order (9 October 2018) (**Exhibit C-414**); Administrative Tribunal of Santander, File No. 2015-00734-00, Order (2 December 2019) (**Exhibit R-236**), pp. 20, 23-25; Administrative Tribunal of Santander, File No. 2015-00734-00, Order (2 February 2021) (**Exhibit R-255**), pp. 6-7; Administrative Tribunal of Santander, File No. 2015-00734-00, Order (6 May 2021) (**Exhibit R-258**), pp. 5-6).\n\n152.\n\nFinally, Colombia notes that there is no indication that the Ministry of Environment intends to rely on the ECODES Report for the final delimitation.

According to Eco Oro, Colombia is double-counting (Claimant's Reply, fn. 256).\n\n155.\n\nEco Oro submits that Colombia cannot claim to know where the final boundaries of the regulatory p\u00e1ramo will be located, nor can it claim to determine its potential overlap with the Angostura Deposit (unless Colombia does not plan to undertake a genuine consultation process, but instead present stakeholders with a *fait accompli*, as it did with the original 2090 Atlas, which the Constitutional Court found to be in bad faith).194 Moreover, Eco Oro points to the example of the municipality of Vetas, which reached an agreement with the Ministry of Environment concerning the modification of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo delimitation.195\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 116, referring to Decision, paras. 676-677.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 117-123, referring to Agreement between the Ministry of Environment and the Municipality of Vetas concerning the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo (29 November 2021) (**Exhibit C-475**), p. 5; \"Vetas se convirti\u00f3 en el primer municipio en firmar pacto para delimitaci\u00f3n del p\u00e1ramo de Santurb\u00e1n\", *Vanguardia* (21 January 2022) (**Exhibit C-476**); \"Minambiente y municipio de Vetas acuerdan delimitaci\u00f3n del Santurb\u00e1n\", *Portafolio* (9 March 2022) (**Exhibit C-478**).\n\n156.\n\nAccording to Eco Oro, this development regarding the municipality of Vetas puts the lie to Colombia's assertion in its response that \"*the Ministry of Environment's methodology for the new delimitation* [pursuant to Constitutional Court Judgment T-361] *also recognized that mining activities cannot be allowed in any p\u00e1ramo areas*\u02ee, as the terms of the agreement with the municipality of Vetas demonstrate that the line has been modified so as to exclude existing mining projects.196 Eco Oro adds that it is possible that similar agreements may be reached with other communities, including California, where the Angostura Deposit is located.197\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 124, referring to Respondent's Response, para. 111.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 125, referring to Minutes of consultations meeting between the Ministry of Environment and the community of California (25 January 2022) (**Exhibit C-477**), p. 3.\n\n157.\n\nEco Oro submits it is clear that the regulatory delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo is still in flux, it is an iterative process198 and Colombia cannot claim to know where the final boundaries will lie. As such, Eco Oro stands by its conclusion that \"*from a regulatory perspective, it is impossible to determine the probability that the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo overlaps with the Angostura Deposit*\".199\n\nClaimant's Reply, fn. 264.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 127, referring to Claimant's First Submission, para. 195(a).\n\n158.\n\nFinally, Eco Oro notes that the Tribunal's question concerns the Angostura Deposit's location vis-\u00e0-vis the ecological p\u00e1ramo and that Colombia has not disputed that the ECODES Report is the most precise ecosystemic study of the Angostura area and is reliable.200 Therefore, the Tribunal can accept that, from an ecological perspective, the probability that the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem overlaps with the Angostura Deposit is zero.201 Eco Oro further notes that the Tribunal need not determine whether the p\u00e1ramo \u2013 either regulatory or ecological \u2013 overlaps with the Angostura Deposit, as the question is not relevant to the assessment of the quantum of compensation owed to Eco Oro.202\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 128.

See also Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 181 and fn. 320, where Colombia rejects Eco Oro's submission that the overlap is 60% and not 71%. Colombia submits that, in any event, a 60% overlap would still render the Angostura Project unviable.\n\n160.\n\nColombia argues that *(i)* there is nothing \"*inherently subjective and discretionary*\" in the delimitation of the \"*regulatory p\u00e1ramo*\" that would make it \"*impossible*\" to predict the outcome of the delimitation.205 Colombia adds that the requirement to conduct 'social' and 'economic' studies does not mean that social and economic inputs will dictate the actual drawing of the 'regulatory' p\u00e1ramo boundary, as this would effectively defeat the purpose of the mining ban;206 *(ii)* it is misleading for Eco Oro to state that, in the context of an environmental licensing process, there is a requirement to map the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem existing within the project area from an ecological perspective;207 and *(iii)* Eco Oro's assertions about the Tribunal's findings as to Eco Oro's inability to predict the boundaries of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo are misleading, as the Tribunal made clear that \"*Eco Oro could have reached certain assumptions as to the likely parameters of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo*\".208 Colombia concludes that there can be no question that the Tribunal's Question E refers to the probable overlap of the Angostura Deposit with the 'regulatory' p\u00e1ramo under Laws 1382, 1450, 1753 and 1930, as well as Constitutional Court Judgments C-35 and T-361.209\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 114.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 115.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 119.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 120, referring to Decision, para. 811.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 121-125.\n\n161.\n\nColombia further contends that the ECODES Report is not a reliable indicator of the overlap of the Angostura Deposit with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, because it adopts a minimalistic and self-serving definition of the 'scientific' and 'ecological' p\u00e1ramo.210 According to Colombia, the purpose of the ECODES Report was not to map the 'ecological' or 'scientific' p\u00e1ramo, but instead to assess the \"*state of conservation*\" of the biodiversity of the ecosystems present in the Angostura Deposit area in order to develop \"*conservation strategies*\".211 Colombia adds that the ECODES Report *(i)* very narrowly defined the areas worth conserving;212 *(ii)* was not an independent scientific study;213 *(iii)* did not map the 'ecological' or 'scientific' p\u00e1ramo in the Angostura Deposit area;214 and *(iv)* is not more appropriate or reliable to identify the overlap of the Angostura Deposit with the p\u00e1ramo just because it carried out field studies and adopted a more detailed scale.215\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 131, referring to Decision, paras. 655-656.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 127, referring to ECODES, \"Estado de Conservaci\u00f3n de la Biodiversidad de los ecosistemas asociados al Sector Angosturas California, Santander, Resumen Ejecutivo\" (1 May 2013) (**Exhibit C-180**), p. 1; ECODES Presentation, \"Biodiversity Conservation of the ecosystems within the Angosturas Sector, California, Santander\" (Undated) (**Exhibit C-272**), p. 2; First Gonz\u00e1lez Aldana Statement, paras. 44-46.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 127, referring to ECODES Presentation, \"Biodiversity Conservation of the ecosystems within the Angosturas Sector, California, Santander\" (Undated) (**Exhibit C-272**), pp. 2-13; IAvH, *Aportes a la conservaci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica de los p\u00e1ramos de Colombia: actualizaci\u00f3n de la cartograf\u00eda de los complejos de p\u00e1ramo a escala 1:100.000* (6 February 2014) (**Exhibit C-200**), pp. 27, 37-47.

Colombia contends that *(i)* Eco Oro misrepresents Mr Garc\u00eda's evidence from the hearing, as Mr Garc\u00eda simply stated that the boundaries could theoretically change pursuant to the order enshrined in Judgment T-361. In any event, Mr Garc\u00eda did not work for the authorities involved in the delimitation exercise;216 *(ii)* any changes between Resolution 2090 and the final delimitation will not be substantial, as evidenced by the 2019 P\u00e1ramo Delimitation Proposal;217 and *(iii)* it is not true that the consultations with the local communities in the context of the delimitation process will allow significant reductions in the p\u00e1ramo area on account of social and economic considerations, as Judgment T-361 established that the new delimitation could not be inferior in terms of environmental protection than that set out in Resolution 2090. Colombia notes, on the one hand, that the agreement reached with the Vetas community is preliminary and is subject to verification and confirmation in the final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. On the other hand, Colombia notes that Eco Oro's allegation that it is \"*possible that similar agreements may be reached in California, where the Angostura Deposit is located*\" is speculative and provides no valid basis for suggesting that the final delimitation will depart from the 2019 Delimitation Proposal, especially when the community of California has expressed its preference in maintaining the p\u00e1ramo boundary line set by Resolution 2090.218\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 135.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 136.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 137-140, referring to ANM, Resolution VPFF No. 058 (23 May 2022) (**Exhibit R-304**), p. 6; Minutes of consultations meeting between the Ministry of Environment and the community of California (25 January 2022) (**Exhibit C-477**), p. 2.\n\n**F. Question F**\n-----------------\n\n163.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(f) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*What is the probability that Eco Oro would have been awarded an environmental licence to allow exploitation in the following scenarios:*\n\n*i. The Angostura Deposit is not within the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo as determined by the final delimitation;*\n\n*ii. The Angostura Deposit is partially within the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo as determined by the final delimitation; or*\n\n*iii. The Angostura Deposit is wholly within the boundaries of the p\u00e1ramo as determined by the final delimitation.*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows219:\n\n\"*66. The Tribunal need not make any findings regarding the probability that the Angostura Project would have obtained a license because Eco Oro's valuation based on the three Comparable Transactions already builds in the value effects of the permitting risks associated with the Angostura Project. Before addressing why Eco Oro's approach to valuation captures permitting risks, some preliminary observations are warranted.*[220]\n\n*(a) Question F calls for the same distinction between regulatory p\u00e1ramo and ecological p\u00e1ramo, as noted in response to Question E.*\n\n*(b) If the Angostura Deposit overlaps with regulatory p\u00e1ramo in whole or in part, there would be no prospects of obtaining a license in relation to the overlapping areas in which mining is banned. The assessment of licensability, however, must be undertaken in the absence of Colombia's unlawful measures.*\n\n*(c) Eco Oro thus assumes that the Tribunal is questioning the likelihood that Eco Oro would have obtained an environmental license depending on the extent and degree of overlap between the Angostura Deposit and the ecological p\u00e1ramo. As noted in response to Question E, the best evidence on the record (the Ecodes Report) shows no such overlap. Ultimately, however, whether it is or is not within ecological p\u00e1ramo is not determinative from a licensability perspective. This is because the granting of an environmental license for mining activities in the p\u00e1ramo, or in other sensitive ecosystems (such as the Andean forest), is subject to the same stringent environmental licensing process set out under Colombian law.*\n\n*(d) As such, in the absence of a mining ban (ie regulatory p\u00e1ramo), there is no binary decision-making process whereby, if a mining project is located in the p\u00e1ramo, a license will not be granted, whereas if it is outside the p\u00e1ramo, it will be granted. What matters is the environmental impact of the specific mining activities to be carried out according to the concessionaire's mine plan, and the manner in which those impacts are to be mitigated, compensated and remediated, according to the concessionaire's EIA.*[221] *Indeed, Colombia even passed a specific decree \u2013 Decree 2820 of 2010 \u2013 which specifically provides for the issuance of environmental licenses for projects in p\u00e1ramo areas.*[222] *At least 67 environmental licenses have been issued to mining projects in p\u00e1ramo areas pursuant to this framework.*[223]\n\n*67. With this background (ie that, but for Colombia's measures, it had in place a specific framework for the granting of environmental licenses in p\u00e1ramos and Colombia in fact granted a number of such licenses), there are three important points that Claimant submits should inform the Tribunal's approach to considering permitting risks.*\n\n*68. First, although there is a track record for the issuance of licenses in p\u00e1ramos and sensitive ecosystems,*[224] *the probability of a license being granted cannot be accurately and objectively estimated. Environmental license applications require a detailed mine plan and an EIA, both of which are labor-intensive processes involving significant discussions with Colombia's regulatory bodies and which Eco Oro did not complete given Colombia's measures.*[225] *Moreover, identifying the probability that a license would be granted based on a hypothetical mine plan that has not been prepared and a hypothetical EIA that has not been prepared would then require divining the likely response from ANLA in respect of the hypothetical submissions, which is exceedingly speculative.*[226] *Drawing a conclusion on the likely outcome of such a process would involve the Tribunal acting as a substitute licensing authority, which is an inappropriate exercise.*[227]\n\n*69. Second, although no precise probability can be ascribed to the likelihood that Eco Oro would have obtained an environmental license, the Tribunal has the benefit of evidence that there were promising prospects of a license being issued for the Angostura Project. Aside from the fact that Colombia had issued licenses for other projects in p\u00e1ramo, the Decision observes that 'Eco Oro [\u2026] received significant encouragement from a number of different State bodies that it would be permitted to undertake exploitation activities throughout its concession area.'*[228] *Even after the 2090 Atlas had been issued, the Decision notes that Eco Oro received the support from the highest levels of Government: '[O]n 8 February 2016, Eco Oro received support for Concession 3452 from President Santos who explained Eco Oro should apply for its environmental licence as soon as possible to enable Colombia to 'showcase' the Angostura Project as a post-p\u00e1ramo delimitation success story.'*[229] *There are a number of other indicia that Colombia supported the Angostura Project. While the Tribunal need not make any finding regarding the probability that the Angostura Project would have received an environmental license, it can take comfort in Colombia's support of the Angostura Project, which it would not have provided if Eco Oro's Angostura Project had low chances of advancing to the exploitation phase.*[230]\n\n*70. Third, and most importantly, insofar as there were prospects of obtaining a license for the Angostura Project (as concluded in the Decision*[231]*), the Tribunal need not draw any conclusions regarding the probability that Eco Oro would have succeeded in obtaining an environmental license because Eco Oro's valuation based on the three Comparable Transactions already reflects the value consequences associated with the permitting risks facing the Angostura Project. The projects underlying the three Comparable Transactions were all at the same or an earlier stage of development as the Angostura Project, subject to the same regulatory requirements in Colombia and in Canada, would face the same need to satisfy the Colombian environmental authorities that their projects were environmentally feasible and should be granted an environmental license, and were subject to comparable market perception of social and political risk.*\n\n*71. Consequently, a valuation based on the three Comparable Transactions builds in the effect on value of any market perception of risk involved in permitting an underground gold mining project in the immediate vicinity of the Angostura Project. On that basis, the Tribunal need not make any other findings regarding the probability that the Angostura Project would have obtained a license.*[232]\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 66-71.

Eco Oro warns that \"*discounting a market-based valuation based on the probability of a licence being issued would involve 'double discounting' and thus under-compensation (contrary to the 'full reparation' standard)*\" (Claimant's First Submission, para. 198(a)). Finally, Eco Oro asserts that the Tribunal in the present case is in the \"*enviable position of having the three Comparable Transactions involving gold mining projects of the same nature and stage of development as the Angostura Project, located on mining tenements immediately adjacent to the Angostura Project and, in fact, land-locked within Concession 3452*\" (Claimant's First Submission, para. 249).\n\n165.\n\nEco Oro submits that, since it was Colombia who deprived Eco Oro of, *inter alia*, the right to pursue an environmental license and have that application fairly considered on its own merits, it would be incumbent on Colombia to prove its assertion that a license would not have been granted in any event.233\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 201, referring to Decision, paras. 632 and 848.\n\n166.\n\nEco Oro notes that the Parties agree that the issue of licensability is an issue relating to causation. The question to be determined, as articulated by Colombia, is whether it has been \"*establish*[ed] *that* [Eco Oro] *could ever have secured an EIA license for* [the Angostura Project]\".234 If there was no prospect of obtaining an environmental license for the Angostura Project, even in the absence of Colombia's unlawful measures, there would be no causal link between Colombia's measures and Eco Oro's losses. However, insofar as there were prospects of Eco Oro securing an environmental license for the Angostura Project in the absence of the measures, then Colombia's measures \u2013 which deprived Eco Oro of its mining rights and the opportunity to apply for an environmental license \u2013 did cause a loss. Therefore, Eco Oro submits that, insofar as causation exists, it is incumbent upon the Tribunal to assess compensation sufficient to wipe out the effects of Colombia's unlawful measures.235\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 199, referring to Colombia's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 488.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 199-200, 221, 229, referring to Colombia's Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 488; *Joseph Charles Lemire v Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18) Award (28 March 2011) (**Exhibit CL-177**), para. 246; *Crystallex International Corporation v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2) Award (4 April 2016) (**Exhibit CL-85**), paras. 868-869 (citing *Lemire* with approval). See also Claimant's First Submission, paras. 38, 45, 47, 51.\n\n**(2) Respondent's Response**\n-----------------------------\n\n167.\n\nColombia asserts that Eco Oro has failed to prove that it had any realistic prospects of being awarded an environmental licence to allow exploitation, whether the Angostura Deposit fell outside, partially within or wholly within the p\u00e1ramo as determined by the final delimitation. Colombia notes that Eco Oro seeks to shift the burden onto Colombia \"*to prove its assertion that a license would not have been granted in any event*\", but contends that it is incumbent upon Eco Oro to prove with a \"*sufficient degree of certainty*\" that, absent Colombia's Article 805 breach, the loss for which it claims would have been avoided.236\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 120-124.\n\n168.\n\nColombia further asserts that any application for an environmental licence in or around the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was exceedingly unlikely to succeed in light of the precautionary principle.237 According to Colombia, the environmental licensing process in Colombia is governed by two guiding principles: the prevention principle and the precautionary principle. The difference between the two is that the prevention principle operates on the basis of scientific certainty, while the precautionary principle applies when there is a lack of it.238 Colombia adds that the precautionary principle also provides a margin of discretion to the environmental authorities to decide whether or not to grant an environmental licence in instances where there is no scientific certainty about the environmental effects of the project at issue.239 Colombia notes that Eco Oro was required to establish with full scientific certainty that the project's prevention, compensation, mitigation and remediation measures were sufficient to protect the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.240 Colombia reiterates that there is a heightened standard under Colombian law for the issuance of environmental licences in the p\u00e1ramos, because Decree 2820 of 2010 set forth two additional requirements for projects in the p\u00e1ramos. Colombia argues that these additional requirements would have made it inherently more difficult for Eco Oro to secure an environmental licence.241 Colombia further asserts that the fact the ANM wrote a letter to the Constitutional Court in the wake of Judgment C-35 expressing its position that mining activities can be conducted in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems does not, *per se*, mean that the said position embodies the position of the Colombian Government. In fact, Colombia submits that the existence of conflicting views within the Colombian state on this subject is reflective of the lack of scientific certainty worldwide regarding the impact of mining in the p\u00e1ramos and, by extension, the need to apply the precautionary principle in all decision-making processes assessing the environmental feasibility of mining projects in the p\u00e1ramos.242\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 125, referring to Decision, para. 630.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 127, referring to Consejo de Estado, Judgment 00230 (11 April 2018) (**Exhibit R-227**), pp. 18-19; Constitutional Court, Judgment T-204/14 (1 April 2014) (**Exhibit R-216**), p. 22; Constitutional Court, Judgment C-293 (23 April 2002) (**Exhibit R-208**), p. 22.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 129, referring to Decision, para. 654.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 130.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 131-132.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 133-134.\n\n169.\n\nColombia asserts that the vast majority of applications for environmental licences for large-scale mining projects in Colombia fail. In the period between 2010 and 2022, ANLA received 24 environmental licence requests for large-scale mining projects, and granted only 8 of them, none of which affected protected areas, sensitive ecosystems or mining exclusion zones.243\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 137-138, referring to ANLA, Resolution No. 00077 (Environmental licence for the La Luna Underground Coal Exploitation) (24 January 2018) (**Exhibit R-224**), pp. 86-89, 162-165; ANLA, Resolution No. 1433 (Environmental licence for the Conconcreto Construction Materials Exploitation) (26 November 2014) (**Exhibit R-218**), p. 45; ANLA, Resolution No. 0041 (Environmental licence for the Agua Bonita Construction Materials Exploitation) (22 January 2014) (**Exhibit R-217**), pp. 19-20, 71-74; ANLA, Resolution No. 1514 (Environmental licence for the Gramalote Gold Project) (25 November 2015) (**Exhibit R-219**), pp. 40-41, 174-175; ANLA, Resolution No. 1540 (Environmental licence for the Cerro Matoso La Esmeralda Mine Expansion) (2 December 2015) (**Exhibit R-220**), pp. 43-47, 99; ANLA, Resolution No. 446 (Environmental Licence for Sator Mina Bijao Project) (16 March 2020) (**Exhibit R-240**), pp. 46-47, 100, 178; ANLA, Resolution No. 1878 (Environmental Licence for Cerro Matoso Ferroniquel exploitation) (23 November 2020) (**Exhibit R-254**), pp. 74, 232-235; ANLA, Resolution No. 1622 (Environmental Licence for the Cerro Matoso Queresas Licence) (1 October 2020) (**Exhibit R-250**), pp. 117-120, 123-125, 143-149; Summary table of ANLA's Environmental Licensing Procedures from 2010 to 2022 (**Exhibit R-273**).\n\n170.\n\nColombia adds that the only application for an environmental licence for a large-scale Mining Project near a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem failed. According to Colombia, Minesa requested an environmental licence for the Soto Norte underground gold mining project. ANLA archived the request and returned to Minesa the documentation it had submitted, because ANLA considered that Minesa had failed to provide the minimum information required to perform an adequate evaluation.244 Colombia submits that Minesa's example highlights *(i)* that the environmental licensing process for projects located in proximity to p\u00e1ramo ecosystems is extremely challenging and complex (requiring the input of several institutions and entities);245 *(ii)* the importance of hydrogeological studies to determine the interaction between the p\u00e1ramo and the planned mining activities;246 and *(iii)* that the licensing request of a large-scale project located near a p\u00e1ramo ecosystem is likely to generate significant public controversy and opposition.247\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 139-142, referring to ANLA, Order No. 09674 (2 October 2020) (**Exhibit R- 251**), pp. 5-9, 15-36, 39-79, 123, 127-128.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 142-143.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 144-145, referring to Decision, paras. 119, 121.

According to Colombia, the 2013 IAvH P\u00e1ramo Atlas in fact refers to 67 \"*autorizaciones ambientales*\" (environmental authorisations), not 67 \"*licencias ambientales*\" (environmental licences), which Colombia submits is an important distinction; the authorisations do not generally involve an in-depth analysis of the impacts of the proposed activity.248 Colombia notes that none of the 67 environmental authorisations authorised any activities that were remotely similar to the Angostura underground mining project, as they referred to artisanal, small-scale mining activities. By way of example, Colombia notes that Eco Oro anticipated that its underground project would process over 2 million tons of ore per year, or 600 tons of ore per day, being twice as much La Elsy processed in a whole month. As such, this artisanal mining project had very little in common with the industrialised, large-scale mine that Eco Oro intended to develop in the Angostura Deposit.249\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 149, referring to IAvH, *Aportes a la conservaci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica de los p\u00e1ramos de Colombia: actualizaci\u00f3n de la cartograf\u00eda de los complejos de p\u00e1ramo a escala 1:100.000* (6 February 2014) (**Exhibit C-200**), pp. 79-80.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 148-152, referring to Golder Associates, Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Angostura Gold-Silver Underground Project (**Exhibit CLEX-26**), Section 16.5.2, p. 144.\n\n172.\n\nFinally, Colombia submits that it never represented to Eco Oro that an underground project would be granted an environmental licence. According to Colombia, Eco Oro never provided Colombia's environmental authorities with sufficient technical information regarding the Angostura Project, such that no Colombian authority could have assured Eco Oro that the project would be able to secure an environmental licence. At best, Colombia's government officials simply invited Eco Oro to apply for an environmental licence, an application that would be treated fairly and seriously in accordance with applicable Colombian law.250\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 153-165. Colombia notes that Eco Oro *(i)* still has not provided any contemporaneous evidence of what President Santos said during the alleged February 2016 meeting; and *(ii)* did not challenge Mar\u00eda Isabel Ulloa's witness statement, where she explained that any expressions of support of the Ministry of Environment simply \"*consisted in raising awareness of the regulations, hearing concerns and seeking spaces for dialogue to ensure the proper completion of the projects, in accordance with the applicable legal framework*.\" (Ulloa Statement, para. 19). Finally, Colombia notes that the PIN and PINE designations simply sought to centralise and streamline the bureaucratic administration and monitoring of these projects, and did not signify the endorsement or pre-approval of the projects, nor the relaxation or reduction of the substantive requirements to obtain the permits and licences necessary to operate.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n173.\n\nEco Oro submits that the probability of an environmental license being granted for the Angostura Project cannot be objectively or accurately determined given its stage of development.251 This is because, under Colombian law, the granting of a license depends on whether the specific adverse impacts of a defined project can be adequately prevented, mitigated, corrected and/or compensated. Eco Oro maintains that Colombia's unlawful measures prevented Eco Oro from preparing a PTO and an EIA. Eco Oro further reiterates that it is not the role of a treaty tribunal to act as a substitute licensing authority.252 Eco Oro notes that Colombia agrees that the licensability of a project depends on its specific environmental impacts.253\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 133-135.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 133-134, referring to Decree 2820 (5 August 2010) (**Exhibit C-129**), Articles 22, 25, 28; Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales, Auto 917 (11 March 2019) (**Exhibit PMR-42**), p. 43; Decree 2041 (15 October 2014) (**Exhibit C-216**), Article 10; Decree 1076 (29 May 2015) (**Exhibit C-279**), Article 2.2.2.3.1.3; 2001 Mining Code (Law 685) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Article 84; Letter from Eco Oro (Ms Arenas Uribe) to the NMA (Ms Habib) (21 June 2018) (**Exhibit R-104**), p. 2; Letter from ANLA to Eco Oro attaching terms of reference (27 February 2012) (**Exhibit C-24**), Sections 2.1, 4.2.1; *William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2009-04) Award of Jurisdiction and Liability (17 March 2015) (**Exhibit RL-18**), para. 602; *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware v Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibi**t **RL-158**), paras. 130-131; *Joseph Charles Lemire v Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18) Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability (14 January 2010) (**Exhibit RL-82**), para. 283; *Glamis Gold, Ltd v The United States of America* (UNCITRAL) Award (8 June 2009) (**Exhibit CL-59**), para. 779.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 135, referring to Respondent's Response, paras. 128-129.\n\n174.\n\nEco Oro further submits that the precautionary principle cannot be invoked in this case given the absence of any scientific evidence that mining generally, or the Angostura Project in particular, poses a risk of serious damage.254 Eco Oro underscores that the mere existence of a potential risk is not sufficient to invoke the precautionary principle.255\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 136-138, referring to Decision, paras. 630-632, 848; IAvH Contributions Report (**Exhibit C-200**), p. 42; Tr.

Eco Oro adds that Colombia's arguments would lead to the conclusion that mining projects have no market value until it can be proven with sufficient certainty that they are environmentally feasible, which is disproved by the fact that unlicensed development projects are transacted for value all the time.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 155-164, referring to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware v Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 136, 276-303; P Pearsall and J Heath, \"Causation and Injury in Investor-State Arbitration\" in: C L Beharry (ed.), *Contemporary and Emerging Issues on the law of Damages and Valuation in International Investment Arbitration* (2018) (**Exhibit CL-232**); *Deutsche Telekom AG v The Republic of India* (PCA Case No. 2014-10) Final Award (27 May 2020) (**Exhibit CL-233**), paras. 119-125.\n\n177.\n\nFinally, Eco Oro notes that, in any case, Colombia has represented that the Angostura Project had promising prospects for licensing.262 Eco Oro asserts that it strains credulity that the Government would have made all of these representations, expressions of support, and efforts if, as Colombia now claims in this arbitration, it believed that the chances that the Angostura Project could be developed and licensed were minimal.263 Moreover, Eco Oro notes that Colombia's framework for the granting of environmental licenses is set out in Law 99 of 1993 which entered into force nearly three decades ago, yet Respondent inexplicably limits its analysis of licensing applications to the last 12 years.264 In any event, the approval rate of environmental license applications does not support Colombia's contention that Eco Oro's future license application would inevitably be denied.265 Eco Oro also asserts that there is no basis for distinguishing between environmental authorisations and licenses, given that the standard for granting both, i.e., the need to adequately mitigate, prevent and compensate environmental impacts of specified works, was the same.266 Eco Oro further submits that, while the production levels of the smaller-scale projects invoked by Colombia may have been lower, Colombia is unable to show that the environmental impacts that these licensed mining projects would have on the p\u00e1ramo would have been less than those of the Angostura Project.267 Eco Oro contends that *(i)* Minesa's example supports Eco Oro's position in this arbitration, as Minesa is entitled to resubmit its licensing application;268 *(ii)* the decision made by the ANLA was not based on the project's location *vis-\u00e0-vis* the p\u00e1ramo269; and, *(iii)* notwithstanding such location, it has received significant encouragement on the part of the Colombian Government.270\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 165-174.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 168.\n\nEco Oro asserts that \"[t]*he dates selected by Colombia are suspicious considering that (i) environmental licenses have been required since 1993 (as a result of Law 99), and (ii) environmental authorities in Colombia (including the Ministry of the Environment) have issued reports showing that environmental licenses were issued in p\u00e1ramo areas after 2009*.\" (Claimant's Reply, fn. 394).\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 170, referring to General Comptroller's Office, \"El proceso administrativo de licenciamiento ambiental en Colombia\" (2017) (**Exhibit C-469**), p. 44.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 171, referring to Constitutional Court Judgement T-462A (2014) (**Exhibit C-468**), Section 2.3.12.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 171, referring to First Moseley-Williams Statement, paras. 24, 30-39; First Gonz\u00e1lez Aldana Statement, para. 46; Micon International Limited, *Technical Report on the Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Angostura Gold-Silver Deposit, Santander Department, Colombia* (17 July 2015) (**Exhibit C-37**); ECODES, \"Estado de Conservaci\u00f3n de la Biodiversidad en los ecosistemas asociados al Sector Angosturas California, Santander, Resumen Ejecutivo\" (May 2013) (**Exhibit C-180**); ECODES Presentation, \"Biodiversity Conservation of the ecosystems within the Angosturas Sector, California, Santander\" (Undated) (**Exhibit C-272**); Golder Associates, Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Angostura Gold-Silver Underground Project (prepared for Eco Oro) (23 March 2012) (**Exhibit BD-21**); Micon International Limited, Technical Report on the Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Angostura Gold-Silver Deposit (prepared for Eco Oro) (17 July 2015) (**Exhibit BD-30**).

According to Colombia, there is no valid excuse why Eco Oro should be excused from answering the Tribunal's questions. Colombia submits that, having failed to conduct any due diligence into the environmental feasibility of an underground mining project after the rejection of its EIA for an open pit project, Eco Oro alone is responsible for not being in a position to offer any contemporaneous evidence as to the probability of an environmental licence for such a project being granted.271\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 141-143.\n\n179.\n\nColombia notes that the precautionary principle would almost certainly have compelled the rejection of any environmental licensing application on any scenario, as this principle is a fundamental tenet of Colombian environmental law.272 According to Colombia, the precautionary principle applies precisely in instances where, despite the lack of scientific certainty, it is believed that a particular activity carries a risk of serious or irreversible damage.273 Colombia adds that Eco Oro cannot dispute that mining, by its nature, adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, as well as the contamination of surface water, groundwater and soil.274\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 144-153.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 148.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 149, referring to Constitutional Court, Judgment C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), paras. 155-160; Constitutional Court Judgment C-339/02 (7 May 2002) (**Exhibit C-82**), para.

Malan, *How to Advance Sustainable Mining, IISD Earth Negotiations Bulletin* (October 2021) (**Exhibit R-302**). Colombia notes that those effects can be exacerbated in the p\u00e1ramos, given their fragile nature and extremely limited ability to recover (Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 149, referring to Constitutional Court, Judgment C-35 (8 February 2016) (**Exhibit C-42**), paras. 155-160).\n\n180.\n\nColombia further asserts that the location of the Angostura Deposit vis-\u00e0-vis the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo is a relevant factor in assessing the probability of an environmental licence being granted.275 According to Colombia, the Colombian government has not taken the view that large-scale mining is not incompatible with the environmental preservation of the p\u00e1ramos. In fact, the opposite is true, as reflected by Congress' decision to ban mining in these ecosystems. If anything, there is a conflict of views within Congress, the Constitutional Court and the IAvH on the subject. This conflict, and the absence of scientific certainty to this date to resolve it, is precisely what necessitates the application of the precautionary principle.276 Moreover, Colombia asserts that, under Colombian law, laws (*leyes*) \u2014which are normally only issued by Congress\u2014have a higher legal status than decrees or regulations (issued by the executive branch) and therefore can only be modified or repealed through another law. Therefore, Eco Oro's argument that Decree 2820 of 2010 and its successors somehow trump or otherwise prevail over the mining ban contained in Laws 1382, 1450, 1753 and 1930 is contrary to this basic tenet of Colombian law.277 Colombia contends that Eco Oro is wrong to suggest that the terms \"*grave harm*\", \"*great incompatibility*\" or \"*great uncertainty*\" impose a lower or less stringent standard of review. This is inconsistent with the precautionary principle, as it would effectively allow the authorities to greenlight projects with respect to which there is 'uncertainty' as to their environmental feasibility. Similarly, Eco Oro's interpretation would defeat the purpose of the environmental licensing process altogether because it would allow projects that cause environmental 'harm' to obtain an environmental licence.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 154-170.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 164.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 165, referring to Decree 2820 (5 August 2010) (**Exhibit C-129**), Article 10; Ministry of Environment Resolution No. 2090 (19 December 2014) (**Exhibit C-34**), Article 2; Concepto 100921, Departamento Administrativo de la Funci\u00f3n P\u00fablica (23 March 2021) (**Exhibit R-257**), p. 2; Political Constitution of Colombia (4 June 1991) (**Exhibit C-65**), Article 153; F.

Moreover, Minesa's Soto Norte Project demonstrates that a mining project can face significant p\u00e1ramo-related environmental challenges, even though it is located hundreds of meters away from p\u00e1ramo.287\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 179-205.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 180, referring to Claimant's Reply, para. 167.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 183.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 186.

Question G**\n-----------------\n\n183.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(g) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*What is the effect on the identification of the loss suffered, and its valuation, if any, if Eco Oro failed to establish that an exercise in due diligence had been carried out prior to the decision to move to the development of an underground mine?*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows288:\n\n\"*72. The record shows that Eco Oro did conduct extensive due diligence prior to announcing its intention in March 2011 to revert to earlier plans to develop the Angostura Project as an underground project. However, such due diligence (or even the lack of thereof) could not have affected the nature of the loss suffered or its valuation.*\n\n*At the outset, the Claimant has the following observations on the Tribunal's Question G.*\n\n*(a) In Colombia's pre-hearing written submissions, it wrote a single sentence regarding the issue of due diligence and its observation was that, had Eco Oro conducted proper due diligence, it would have concluded that a mining ban was in effect in the area of Concession 3452 from the time that it entered into Concession 3452 in 2007.*[289] *That submission has been discredited by the Tribunal.*[290] *It was only in the context of an exchange with the Tribunal at the hearing*[291] *that Colombia asserted for the first time in the arbitration that there was no evidence on the record of Claimant having performed any due diligence. The existence or not of Eco Oro's due diligence has thus not been a disputed issue of fact on which the Parties made any meaningful pre-hearing submissions.*\n\n*(b) The Decision confirms that Eco Oro could not have predicted Colombia's unlawful measures nor the final boundary of the p\u00e1ramo delimitation through due diligence.*[292] *Importantly, what the Decision also states is that, because Eco Oro had acquired rights in connection with Concession 3452, it would be entitled to compensation if those rights were interfered with.*[293] *Accordingly, due diligence in March 2011 aside, Eco Oro was entitled to compensation upon the imposition of a mining ban in the area of Concession 3452, in respect of which it had acquired the right to exploit (which it could exercise upon fulfilling the applicable permitting requirements).*\n\n*(c) Eco Oro did conduct extensive due diligence. Indeed, a pre-exploitation mining company's main function is to carry out economic, technical, legal and environmental due diligence in determining the best mining plan to pursue. That is its raison d'\u00eatre. The documents on the record establish that Eco Oro had conducted due diligence in the lead up to March 2011, pursuant to which it understood that it would be able to develop its underground mining project, apply for an environmental license for that project and have that application assessed on its merits pursuant to the applicable framework.*[294]\n\n*74. Leaving those preliminary matters aside, the existence or not of due diligence does not affect the identification of the loss that Eco Oro suffered. The Decision sets out the finding of fact that, as a result of Colombia's unlawful measures, 'there was no possibility of exploiting the Angostura Deposit such that the Concession became valueless'*[295] *In other words, the effect of Colombia's unlawful measures was a total deprivation of Eco Oro's rights in relation to the Angostura Project pursuant to Concession 3452. That deprivation is the loss that Eco Oro suffered. That loss is not affected by Eco Oro's due diligence which, as demonstrated above, was not inadequate, and which, as the Decision acknowledges, could not have resulted in Eco Oro predicting or assuming the risk that Colombia would deprive it of its acquired rights under Concession 3452 without compensation, contrary to Colombian law.*[296]\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 72-74.

Since the full reparation standard only requires the assessment of compensation sufficient to wipe out the effects of the unlawful measures, if a portion of the losses suffered by the investor did not result from the effects of (i.e., were not caused by) the unlawful measures, those losses need not be compensated. In the present case, the evidence and the Decision states that the loss of Eco Oro's rights to the Angostura Project was entirely attributable to Colombia's measures. Eco Oro concludes that there are no aspects of Eco Oro's due diligence as of March 2011 that suggest otherwise.297\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 277. In para. 275 of Claimant's First Submission, Eco Oro notes that, although not relevant to the time period relevant to the Tribunal's question, Eco Oro subsequently conducted precise due diligence regarding the extent to which the Angostura deposit in fact overlapped with p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, via the ECODES Report, which showed that it did not.\n\n**(2) Respondent's Response**\n-----------------------------\n\n186.\n\nColombia asserts that Eco Oro proceeded with an underground project without taking any steps to satisfy itself that there were any realistic prospects of securing an environmental licence for it. Colombia further submits that Eco Oro's lack of due diligence confirms that its project was speculative at best, hence the Tribunal cannot conclude that the opportunity lost by Eco Oro as a result of Colombia's Article 805 breach, even if it concerned the entirety of the Concession Area, had any tangible value.298\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 166-169.\n\n187.\n\nColombia notes that it specifically and repeatedly addressed this issue in its submissions and requested documents evidencing due diligence in the document production phase.299 Although the Tribunal granted each of these requests, Eco Oro produced only five documents,300 none of which addressed the environmental feasibility of the project. Colombia submits that Eco Oro recklessly gambled\u2014based on untested assumptions\u2014on the possibility that it might be able to secure an environmental licence and that the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo would spare the Angostura Project, despite the Ministry of Environment having already determined in its decision rejecting Eco Oro's open-pit environmental licence application that there was p\u00e1ramo in the area.301\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 170-173, referring to Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 399 and fn. 555; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 503; Tr.

Conversely, Eco Oro would not have had any equivalent analyses to satisfy itself that the Angostura Project had reasonable prospects of securing an environmental licence. Because Eco Oro failed to carry out any due diligence prior to moving its development to an underground project, Colombia argues that there is no basis for Compass Lexecon's assumption that the Angostura Project faced the same risks as those assessed by the purchaser of the adjoining properties.302\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 185-186, referring to Samuel Engineering, Preliminary Assessment La Bodega Project (**Exhibit CLEX-4**), p. 7.\n\n189.\n\nFinally, Colombia submits that the fact that Eco Oro recklessly decided to expend funds towards an underground project without having conducted any due diligence means that Eco Oro cannot turn to Colombia to seek to recover any such costs.303\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 187.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n190.\n\nEco Oro submits that Colombia's responses are fundamentally misconceived because, in addition to repeating the fundamental mistake regarding the nature of Eco Oro's loss, they:\n\na. fail to establish a causal link between the loss suffered and any actions other than those resulting from its own breaches: Eco Oro asserts that the only circumstance that might justify the Tribunal reducing the damages payable to Eco Oro would be if its losses were not solely attributable to Colombia's unlawful measures, which has not been established. Eco Oro further argues that Colombia conflates and confuses the (already settled) questions of liability and causation while failing to address the Tribunal's question about the potential effect, if any, of due diligence on the quantum of loss suffered by Eco Oro.304\n\nb. fail to address the extensive due diligence conducted by Eco Oro: the process of developing a mining project is one of constant due diligence.305 Eco Oro could rely on an accumulated body of due diligence going back 17 years in taking the decision to move forward with an underground project in March 2011, which was a rational and logical response to the need to reduce surface impacts at high altitude.306 Eco Oro takes issue with the fact that Colombia reduces Eco Oro's due diligence to the five documents produced during the document production phase following document requests where 'due diligence' was never mentioned.307 Eco Oro reiterates that the question of licensability could not have been objectively or accurately determined through a due diligence exercise in, or prior to, March 2011.308 Eco Oro further takes issue with the fact that Colombia purports to ignore the relevance of Decrees 1220 of 2005 and 2820 of 2010.309 Finally, Eco Oro submits that Colombia has provided no authority or expert evidence for its assertion that an underground mine would have faced \"*the same technical and environmental constraints*\" as the open pit project. Eco Oro deems this assertion to be illogical, as the very purpose of moving to an underground project was to address the Ministry of Environment's concerns and reduce the size and nature of the project's impact on the environment by redesigning infrastructure and processing facilities and by relocating these to locations at lower altitude or underground.310\n\nc. mislabel Eco Oro's rational decision to proceed with an underground project as \"*speculative*\": Eco Oro notes that it could not, in March 2011, have rehearsed and claimed to predict the results of a hypothetical licensing exercise based on a putative underground project that it had not yet fully designed, nor can this exercise be undertaken by the Tribunal today. Eco Oro emphasises that in March 2011, Eco Oro was not a new investor piling into a promising new market with its eyes closed. Its decision to proceed with an underground project was a rational decision based on *(i)* 17 years of due diligence; *(ii)* extensive knowledge of the legal rights and obligations applying to a concession holder; *(iii)* interactions with the government about the perceived impacts of the open pit project; and (iv) sound technical advice.311\n\nd. seek to draw a false distinction between the neighbouring comparable projects and Eco Oro's project: Eco Oro asserts that Ventana's project was at the same stage of development as the Angostura Project and would still need to prepare a PTO and an EIA analysing, in detail, the impacts of that project.312 Eco Oro submits that the licensability of the Angostura Project and its neighbouring comparable projects could not have been fully assessed until the impacts \u2013 and corresponding mitigation measures \u2013 of each project had been fully described and analysed in a PTO and related EIA. A potential purchaser of the Angostura Project would, in fact, have had far *more* information available because, unlike Ventana, Eco Oro had been investing in its project in that region for more than 10 years longer than Ventana and had been through the extensive process of preparing a PTO and an EIA for the open pit project.313 Eco Oro further notes that each of the neighbouring comparable projects that are the subject of the Comparable Transactions would have had to address \u2013 in their EIAs \u2013 similar issues relating not just to p\u00e1ramo but also to potential impacts on water resources, potential impacts affecting Andean forest and related mitigation measures.314\n\nand\n\ne. fail to explain why Eco Oro should bear the costs of its project and remediation costs given the Tribunal's findings on liability.315\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 177-183, referring to Decision, paras. 499, 632-634, 696, 718, 720, 768, 811, 837, 849, 894.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 185, referring to Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, Standing Committee on Reserves Definition, Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (\"CIM Definition Standards\") (**Exhibit BD-29**), p. 6; Second Behre Dolbear Report, p. 15.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 186-187, referring to NCL Ingenier\u00eda y Construcci\u00f3n Limitada, Mineral Resources Estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment for Underground Mining (25 April 2011) (**Exhibit CLEX-25**), p. 143.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 188.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 189.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 190-191.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 193-197, referring to Ministry of Environment, Resolution No. 1015 (31 May 2011) (**Exhibit R-71**), pp. 91-93; NCL Ingenier\u00eda y Construcci\u00f3n Limitada, Mineral Resources Estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment for Underground Mining (25 April 2011) (**Exhibit CLEX-25**), p. 143.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 200-201.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 204, referring to Dr Vadim Galkine, *Updated Technical Report on the California Gold Project for Calvista Gold Corporation* (11 October 2012) (**Exhibit C-166**), p. 23; SRK Consulting (US), Inc, NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources: California Gold-Silver Project Report Prepared for Galway Resources (25 October 2012) (**Exhibit C-168**), pp. 125, 129.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 205.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 206.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 207-208.\n\n**(4) Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nColombia reiterates that Eco Oro proceeded with an underground project without taking any steps to ascertain whether such a project had any realistic prospects of securing an environmental licence.

Colombia asserts that *(i)* Eco Oro's assertions in this context are not backed by any contemporaneous evidence or the opinion of an environmental licensing expert;317 *(ii)* the fact that no final delimitation had yet been issued did not prevent Ventana from conducting an environmental permitting study in conjunction with the PEA its consultants prepared for La Bodega;318 *(iii)* Eco Oro should have investigated whether the project was licensable in the absence of any mining ban;319 *(iv)* Eco Oro did not evaluate the licensability of the Angostura Project under any scenario at the time, and has refused to do so in these proceedings despite the Tribunal's specific request in its Decision;320 *(v)* Eco Oro has not explained how any confusion created by Colombia's measures could have prevented it from carrying out any due diligence into the environmental licensability or feasibility of an underground project;321 and *(vi)* it is not clear how the fact that compensation must be paid in the event of a retroactive application of the law leading to a loss of an acquired right could justify Eco Oro's failure to carry out due diligence.322\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 210.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 211, referring to Samuel Engineering, Preliminary Assessment La Bodega Project (**Exhibit CLEX-4**), p. 7; Aris Gold Press Release, \"Aris Gold To Become Operator Of The Soto Norte Gold Project In Colombia\" (21 March 2022) (**Exhibit C-479**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 212.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 213-215.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 216.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 217.\n\n193.\n\nColombia submits that Eco Oro has still failed to adduce any evidence of due diligence into the environmental licensability of an underground project.323 Colombia notes that the Ministry of the Environment rejected Eco Oro's open-pit EIA for many reasons not specific to an open-pit mine, notably ecological integrity, preservation of biodiversity, vulnerability of paramunean soils, and risk of cyanide solution spills.324 Colombia rejects Eco Oro's attempt to reverse the burden of proof, noting that the burden of proof falls on Eco Oro with respect to environmental matters, in particular that an underground project could have resolved the concerns raised by the open-pit project.325 Moreover, Colombia notes that in order to announce to the market that Eco Oro considered that its project contained mineralisation which could be economically extracted\u2014the definition of Reserves\u2014 Eco Oro would have had to consider environmental concerns: but Eco Oro never did declare Reserves for its underground project.326 Colombia further points to the fact that Eco Oro's failure to progress any environmental studies specific to an underground project was one of the main reasons the IFC divested from the Angostura Project.327 Colombia further asserts that NCL is not an environmental expert and published its report over a month before the EIA rejection.328\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 218-236.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 220-222, referring to Ministry of Environment, Resolution No. 1015 (31 May 2011) (**Exhibit R-71**), pp. 70-71, 79, 81, 83, 109, 112, 117, 119-121; Tr.

In paragraphs 278-305 of Claimant's First Submission, Eco Oro expands on these arguments.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 287, referring to Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 510. Eco Oro submits that the Tribunal can take the principles applicable to the selection of the valuation as agreed between the Parties, despite the fact that Colombia has misstated the effects of Resolution 2090 of December 2014 and Constitutional Court Decision C-35 of February 2016.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 281-286, noting that the Treaty does not provide the valuation date for computing Article 805 (MST) Damages, and citing to: *Azurix Corp v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12) Award (14 July 2006) (**Exhibit CL-35**), paras. 322, 373-377, 417-418, 442; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, LP v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3) Award (22 May 2007) (**Exhibit CL-42**), paras. 322, 373-377, 405, 442; *Crystallex International Corporation v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2) Award (4 April 2016) (**Exhibit CL-85**), paras. 623, 718, 854-856; *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief UA v Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1) Award (16 May 2018) (**Exhibit CL-196**), paras. 601-606; *Anatolie Stati and Others v The Republic of Kazakhstan* (SCC Arbitration V (116/2010)) Award (19 December 2013) (**Exhibit CL-80**), paras. 1496-1497.

Moreover, Eco Oro considers that such dates are illogical, because they did not result in Eco Oro losing the \"*right to conduct* [\u2026] *mining exploitation activities in the area of its Concession*\", the test that Colombia has previously advanced for justifying its valuation dates.338\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 295-300.\n\n199.\n\nFinally, Eco Oro submits that, if, *arguendo*, the Tribunal rejects Eco Oro's valuation date of 8 August 2016, then the appropriate date should be 1 April 2019, which is the date when Eco Oro's renunciation of its rights under Concession 3452 took effect.339\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 302-305, referring to: Letter from Eco Oro (Ms Arenas Uribe) to the National Mining Agency (Mr Garc\u00eda Granados) (7 March 2017) (**Exhibit C-241**) p. 4; National Mining Agency Resolution VSC 906 (received by Eco Oro on 15 September 2017) (22 August 2017) (**Exhibit C-249**), pp. 5-6, 9; [REDACTED] ; National Mining Agency Resolution VSC 41 (14 February 2019) (**Exhibit C-418**); Claimant's Reply Memorial, paras. 315-322; Letter from Eco Oro (Ms Arenas Uribe) to NMA (Mr Garc\u00eda Granados) (23 November 2018) (**Exhibit R-108**); National Mining Agency Resolution VSC 41 (14 February 2019) (**Exhibit C-418**); Letter from Eco Oro (Mr Ord\u00faz) to the National Mining Agency (Ms Daza) (29 March 2019) (**Exhibit C-425**); Letter from Eco Oro (Mr Ord\u00faz) to Ministry of Environment (Mr Lozano) (29 March 2019) (**Exhibit C-424**); Letter from Eco Oro (Mr Ord\u00faz) to the Ministry of Mining and Energy (Ms Su\u00e1rez) (29 March 2019) (**Exhibit C-423**). Eco Oro further points to Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 92 (providing alternative damages calculations using the Claimant's Alternative Valuation Date and the Respondent's two valuation dates) and to Updated Compass Lexecon Transactions Method Model (**Exhibit CLEX-73**) (containing a dynamic control panel that allows the Tribunal to compute damages on different dates).\n\n**(2) Respondent's Response**\n-----------------------------\n\n200.\n\nAccording to Colombia, the correct valuation date for Colombia's breach of Article 805 is 21 December 2018, the date on which the ANM refused Eco Oro's request for a further extension of the deadline to submit a PTO.340\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 188-191, referring to Decision, paras. 801, 820, 895; Letter from NMA (Mr Garc\u00eda Granados) to Eco Oro (Ms Arenas Uribe) (21 December 2018) (**Exhibit R-109**).\n\n201.\n\nColombia submits that Eco Oro's proposed valuation date is inconsistent with the findings of the Tribunal \u2013 notably, that Colombia's unlawful conduct here is the set of measures that the Tribunal found to have breached Article 805, not the Challenged Measures. Therefore, the date of Resolution VSC 829 cannot serve as the appropriate date for the valuation of the losses caused by the distinct measures that the Tribunal found to have breached Article 805, and which were only adopted after that date.341 Colombia also argues that the alternative valuation date submitted by Eco Oro \u2013 1 April 2019 \u2013 would not be apposite as it is not the date on which Eco Oro's losses resulting from Colombia's Article 805 breach occurred.342\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 194.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 195.\n\n202.\n\nFinally, Colombia contends that none of the cases cited by Eco Oro support its argument that the Tribunal should adopt a valuation date occurring before Colombia adopted any of the measures that the Tribunal found to have breached Article 805.343\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 196-197, citing to *Azurix Corp v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12) Award (14 July 2006) (**Exhibit CL-35**), paras. 321-322, 373-378, 417-418; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, LP v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3) Award (22 May 2007) (**Exhibit CL-42**), para. 405; *Crystallex International Corporation v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2) Award (4 April 2016) (**Exhibit CL-85**), paras. 623, 718, 854-855; *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief UA v Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1) Award (16 May 2018) (**Exhibit CL-196**), paras. 602-603, 605.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n203.\n\nEco Oro submits that the Parties agree on the legal principles for determining the correct valuation date but disagree on is application. According to Eco Oro, this is so given the fact that Colombia misconstrues the Majority Tribunal's Decision when it considers that the Challenged Measures were not part of the measures that breached the Treaty and, on that basis, advances a new theory and valuation date.344\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 209-211.\n\n204.\n\nEco Oro reiterates that the Decision can only be read as including the Challenged Measures within the measures that breached Article 805. Otherwise, there would have been no need for the Tribunal to make an observation as to the non-existence of a 'mining ban' prior to the Treaty's entry into force in making findings on causation if the imposition of the 'mining ban' via the Challenged Measures did not form part of Colombia's breaches. Nor would the Tribunal have asked fourteen damage-related questions.345\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 209-212.\n\n205.\n\nFinally, Eco Oro asserts that nothing took effect on 21 December 2018 and that Eco Oro's rights under Concession 3452 remained the same both the day before and after the ANM's decision on the PTO extension request. Therefore, Eco Oro submits that its valuation date (8 August 2016), or the alternative date put forward by Eco Oro (1 April 2019), should be adopted.346\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 213-215, referring to Updated Compass Lexecon Transactions Method Model (**Exhibit CLEX-73**); Colombia's Comparable Transactions Valuation Model of 23 May 2022, with Claimant's corrections (**Exhibit C-464**).\n\n**(4) Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nColombia confirms that the legal principles regarding the valuation date are not in dispute. The disagreement relates to the date on which irreversible compensable damage occurred.347\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 244, referring to Respondent's Response, para. 193; Claimant's Reply, para. 210.\n\n207.\n\nColombia submits that the Tribunal did not find that the implementation of the ban through VSC 829 breached the FTA or caused Eco Oro a compensable loss.348 Colombia further submits that the value of the Remaining Area of the Concession was destroyed by Colombia's refusal to extend the deadline for submitting the PTO until the re-delimitation was complete.349 Moreover, Colombia notes that the Tribunal specifically found that any losses caused by Colombia's Article 805 breach occurred prior to the renunciation.350\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 246.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 247.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 247.\n\n208.\n\nFinally, Colombia reiterates that the correct valuation date for any losses flowing from the Article 805 breach is 21 December 2018.351\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 248.\n\n**I. Question I**\n-----------------\n\n209.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(i) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*If there is a significant gap between the identified valuation date and the dates on which the Comparable Transactions took place, what adjustment, if any, should be made to the Comparable Transactions valuation?*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows352:\n\n\"*76. Any difference in dates between when a comparable transaction was consummated and the valuation date requires making an adjustment to the agreed purchase price paid in the comparable transaction to account for changes between the two dates observed in the stock market index for junior mining companies, which closely tracks prevailing gold prices and gold price forecasts. Such adjustments have already been made by both Parties' experts, who agree on the methodology to be used for such adjustments.*[353]\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 76.

Eco Oro provides the following chart, which depicts the evolution of the Junior Gold Miners Index in the relevant period.354\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 309-310, making reference to Figure 8: Evolution of Junior Gold Miners Index, in First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 79.\n\n**(2) Respondent's Response**\n-----------------------------\n\n212.\n\nColombia submits that there is a significant gap between both Parties' valuation dates (21 December 2018, as per Colombia, and 8 August 2016, as per Eco Oro) and the date of Eco Oro's Comparable Transactions (14 February 2011 and 19 October 2012355), and that Eco Oro has failed to put forward a methodology that would allow for Eco Oro's Comparable Transaction values to be adjusted reliably to take account of that gap.356\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 199.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 198.\n\n213.\n\nAccording to Colombia, the Comparable Transactions are not a reliable measure of the value of the Angostura Project as of the valuation date for Colombia's breach of Article 805 (on either Party's case), in light of the significant lapse of time and the developments that occurred within this period \u2013 notably, the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo through Resolution 2090 in 2014 and Judgment C-35 in February 2016 \u2013 that clearly would have impacted on the value of the Comparable Transactions.357\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 200-203.\n\n214.\n\nWith regard to the adjustment of the Comparable Transactions using the Junior Gold Mining Index, Colombia asserts that the Tribunal rejected this approach when it refused to apply CRA's proposed market capitalisation methodology.358 This is why it would be inconsistent for such a methodology to be used to adjust Eco Oro's Comparable Transactions.359\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 204, referring to Decision, para. 898.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 205.\n\n215.\n\nFinally, Colombia submits that Eco Oro ought to have offered a method for adjusting the Comparable Transaction values that properly takes account of relevant changes that had a bearing on the value of those transactions and the Angostura Project over the relevant period. In light of Eco Oro's failure to provide any such methodology, the Tribunal should find that Eco Oro's Comparable Transactions valuation is not reliable and reject Eco Oro's damages accordingly.360\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 206.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n216.\n\nEco Oro submits that Colombia changed its position in its Response, against its experts' previous endorsement of the Junior Gold Miners Index to update the Comparable Transactions and with no expert testimony to support such about-face.361\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 217.\n\n217.\n\nEco Oro notes that, notwithstanding Colombia's contentions, it still now continues to use that very methodology in the updated valuation model it submitted with the Response. Eco Oro submits that this confirms that the methodology is reliable and that there is no suitable alternative to update the Comparable Transactions to the valuation date.362\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 217-218, referring to Adjusted Compass Lexecon Comparable Transactions Model (**Exhibit R-267**) (\"MVGDXJ TR Index\" worksheet).\n\n218.\n\nFinally, Eco Oro submits that the Tribunal did not dismiss Colombia's market capitalisation methodology because of any inherent unreliability in using the Junior Gold Miners Index, but rather because *(i)* there was insufficient traded volume during the course of the measures at issue, and *(ii)* Colombia did not make adjustments to reflect \"*actual market news and press releases*\".363 Eco Oro further notes that neither side's expert considered that such adjustments were appropriate or necessary in updating the Comparable Transactions to the proposed valuation dates, as Eco Oro was publicly traded at all relevant times and the Comparable Transactions all involved companies that were taken private.364\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 219-220, referring to Decision, para. 898.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 221.\n\n**(4) Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nColombia takes issue with the fact that Eco Oro has not engaged with the contentions put forward by Colombia in its Response, namely *(i)* the amount of time that elapsed and *(ii)* the events relating to environmental permitting and the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo, which severely limited the prospects of any project in the area securing an environmental licence or being economically viable.365\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 250-251.\n\n220.\n\nColombia asserts that *(i)* it has not changed its position, but merely taken note of the Tribunal's rejection of the Juniors Gold Miners Index as a reliable tool for adjusting valuations over similar lapses of time;366 *(ii)* Eco Oro's contention that the Tribunal rejected Colombia's stock market valuation because CRA had not used \"*actual market news and press releases*\" instead of the index is wrong.367 It is the market news about the Angostura Project, and not the Comparable Transactions, which must be adduced, as the key question is how the Angostura Project's value evolved relative to the value implied by the Comparable Transactions as at their respective transaction dates;368 *(iii)* Colombia did not endorse the use of the Junior Gold Miners Index: it merely noted what adjustments would be required to be made to Eco Oro's Comparable Transactions analysis if the Tribunal decided to use it;369 *(iv)* the Comparable Transactions analysis would yield an even more inflated value unless an adjustment is made to account for the substantially increased country risk in Colombia;370 and *(v)* it was incumbent upon Eco Oro to adduce a suitable alternative method.371\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 252.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 253, referring to Decision, paras. 871, 898.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 254, referring to Decision, para. 898.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 256.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 257, referring to Colombian sovereign bond yield data submitted onto the record by Compass Lexecon at tab \"Colombia EMBI\" (Emerging Markets Bond Index) of **Exhibit CLEX-69**; Sovereign bond yield spreads at Parties' respective valuation dates (data drawn from CLEX-69) (**Exhibit R- 310**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 257-258, citing to *Amoco International Finance v The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, National Iranian Oil Company and others* (IUSCT Case No. 56 (1987 \u2013 Vol. 15), Iran-US CTR 189) Partial Award (14 July 1987) (**Exhibit RL-49**), para. 238; Claimant's First Submission, para. 18.\n\n221.\n\nColombia submits that the Tribunal's concern that the Junior Gold Miners Index is unreliable to adjust the value of the Angostura Project through time remains unaddressed and the Comparable Transactions analysis should accordingly be dismissed.372\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 254.\n\n**J. Question J**\n-----------------\n\n222.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(j) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*What evidence, if any, is there on the record, in addition to Mr. Moseley- William's testimony that the area of Concession 3452 that does not lie within the current delimitation cannot be ascribed a value, such that no deduction should be made in the event that a fair market valuation is adopted to value Eco Oro's loss?*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows373:\n\n\"*77. There is evidence on the record supporting the conclusion that no value should be ascribed to the area of Concession 3452 that lay outside of the preservation and restoration areas of Resolution 2090 (the **Remaining Concession Area**). Beyond Mr Moseley-Williams's testimony,*[374] *the Tribunal has Compass Lexecon's first report,*[375] *in which it explained that it could not ascribe any value to the Remaining Concession Area in light of the uncertainty as to where, if anywhere, mining activities could be pursued in that area given the uncertainty relating to the scope of the mining ban and the 2090 Atlas. As with Mr Moseley-Williams, Compass Lexecon was not cross-examined on this point. On the other hand, at the Hearing, Colombia's mining expert, Mr Rossi, conceded during cross-examination that \u2013 based on assumptions that he was asked to make reflecting the actual uncertainty prevailing in connection with the 2090 Atlas \u2013 he could not make any estimate of the Extractable Minerals associated with Concession 3452.*[376] *The estimate of a project's Extractable Minerals is the fundamental component that is needed to determine the value of a project at the Angostura Project's stage of development, as CRA has explained in its first expert report.*[377]\n\n*78. The Tribunal can also conclude that the Remaining Concession Area should be ascribed no value in computing Article 805 (MST) Damages based on the Majority Tribunal's own findings of fact that it made in considering the effects of Colombia's measures. In particular, amongst other things, the Decision states that 'the Concession became valueless' as a result of Colombia's measures.*[378]\n\n*79. Even if arguendo the value of the Remaining Concession Area was not destroyed when Resolution VSC 829 was issued on 8 August 2016, the residual value (if any) was destroyed by Colombia's subsequent measures. In particular, after the 2090 Atlas had been struck down, the Majority Tribunal found that Colombia's refusal to allow Eco Oro an extension of time to submit its PTO 'in circumstances where the p\u00e1ramo boundary had not been finally determined such that Eco Oro had no certainty as to where the p\u00e1ramo overlapped with the Angostura Deposit, if at all, and where Colombia itself was being given extensions of time to complete the delimitation, can only be viewed as grossly unfair. This comprises conduct that was arbitrary and disproportionate, and which has inflicted damage on Eco Oro without serving any apparent purpose, falling within Professor Schreuer's first indicium.'*[379] *Indeed, that is why the Majority Tribunal's conclusion that Eco Oro's renunciation of Concession 3452 did not result in any further loss to Eco Oro makes good sense: all of Eco Oro's losses, including in connection with the Remaining Concession Area, were already incurred beforehand because of Colombia's measures.*[380]\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 77-79. In paragraphs 311-322 of Claimant's First Submission, Eco Oro expands on these arguments, making reference to Decision, paras. 201, 633, 634, 782, 801, 799-805, 820-821, 849; First Moseley-Williams Statement, paras. 57-69; First Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 12-13; Tr.

Eco Oro adds that Mr Garc\u00eda conceded that a re-delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo could indeed affect a different portion of Concession 3452 than that affected by the delimitation of Resolution 2090 (Claimant's First Submission, para. 320, referring to Tr.

Colombia therefore contends that awarding damages with respect to the area falling within the current delimitation would be inconsistent with the Tribunal's Decision and would amount to awarding damages for a loss that was not caused by the breach.381\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 207, referring to the Answer to Question A; Decision, paras. 804-805, 820.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n225.\n\nEco Oro says that the Parties are in agreement that there is no value to be deducted in connection with the part of Concession 3452 that does not lie within the Resolution 2090 delimitation.382\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 223, referring to Claimant's First Submission, Section II.J; Respondent's Response, para. 207.\n\n**(4) Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nColombia reiterates its position and contends that Eco Oro should be awarded zero damages, as Eco Oro bears the burden of proving its losses and its own evidence and submission is that the area falling outside of the current delimitation is valueless.383\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 260.\n\n**K.

Eco Oro has incurred US$258 million in connection with the Angostura Project.

Colombia submits that Eco Oro should not be allowed to take advantage of its failure to share the information required to allow a reasonable assessment of the costs incurred towards the underground project and to disentangle underground costs from open-pit costs before 2011.405\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 217, referring to paras. 130-133 of the Decision; and Ministry of Environment, Resolution No. 1015 (31 May 2011) (**Exhibit R-71**).\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 218, referring to Second Rossi Report, para. 169; and First Behre Dolbear Report, para. 47.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 219, referring to Golder Associates, Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Angostura Gold-Silver Underground Project (**Exhibit CLEX-26**), pp. 28-29; and GRD Minproc, Angostura Gold Project, Preliminary Feasibility Study (May 2009) (**Exhibit BD-42**), p. 4, para. 1.3, and p. 208, para. 18.1.1.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 220, referring to Claimant's First Submission, para. 68.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 221-222, referring to Second CRA Report, Appendix 5.A, paras. 5 and 7.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 222, referring to Second CRA Report, Appendix 5.A, paras. 10-11.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 223-224, referring to the Respondent's Requests for Documents Nos. 27, 28; and the Respondent's Redfern Schedule, pp. 57-60.\n\n234.\n\nFinally, Colombia takes issue with Eco Oro's new valuation approach, which proposes that the total amount expended by Eco Oro be multiplied by a factor of three. Colombia considers that this method is baseless and unreasonable, as *(i)* it does not follow any set methodology; *(ii)* it is not based on any expert testimony and directly conflicts with the opinions of both Parties' experts; and *(iii)* the factor of 3 is arbitrary and unjustified.406\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 225-229, referring to Rudenno, Victor, *The Mining Valuation Handbook* (4th ed.

After 2003, Eco Oro focused exclusively on the Angostura Project.408\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 225-227, referring to *Bear Creek Mining Corporation v Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/21) Award (30 November 2017) (**Exhibit CL-225**), paras. 658, 661; *Copper Mesa Mining Corporation v The Republic of Ecuador* (UNCITRAL) Award (15 March 2016) (**Exhibit CL-221**), paras. 7.27-7.28.\n\nClaimant's Reply, fn. 558 and Second Compass Lexecon Report, fn. 213.\n\n236.\n\nEco Oro recalls that the *Bilcon* tribunal adopted a valuation based on a mid-point between the claimants' historical costs, which is treated as a floor to compensation, and the value discernible from prior transactions relating to the property.409\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 227, referring to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware v Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 287-303.\n\n237.\n\nWith regard to Colombia's criticisms vis-\u00e0-vis the valuation method applying a multiplying factor to historical costs, Eco Oro explains that its argument is not new, it had been made previously.410 Moreover, this method is not only advanced on the basis of the view of a leading authority on mining valuation but also on the CIMVAL, which provides that a costs-based valuation methodology should yield a value equal to a multiple of historical costs.411 Finally, Eco Oro submits that, considering that Eco Oro was an advanced stage exploration property, a multiplication factor of 3 is appropriate and consistent with the guidance in Dr Rudenno's textbook.412\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 229, referring to Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 54.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 229, referring to Victor Rudenno, *The Mining Valuation Handbook* (4th ed. Milton, Australia: John Wiley & Sons, 1 January 2012) (**Exhibit CLEX-74**), pp. 291-293; and CIMVAL, Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties (February 2003) (**Exhibit C-85**), p. 23.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 229, referring to Victor Rudenno, *The Mining Valuation Handbook* (4th ed.

Eco Oro considers that there is no basis for Colombia's position that any award based on Eco Oro's historical costs must somehow reflect a *pro rata* reduction to reflect only damages associated with the 'Remaining Area.'413\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 231.\n\n239.\n\nEco Oro further asserts that Colombia mischaracterizes the *Bilcon* tribunal's approach to awarding damages, as the latter did not endorse some extra-selective standard beyond the usual causation test in identifying historical costs for purposes of computing damages, rather awarding damages on the basis of a mid-point between the historical costs incurred in furtherance of the project and a value based on prior transactions.414 Accordingly, Eco Oro asserts that an assessment of Eco Oro's historical costs incurred for damages purposes should reflect all of the costs that it incurred in connection with the Angostura Project. That is because Colombia's unlawful measures caused Eco Oro to lose the ability to pursue the Angostura Project and rendered Concession 3452 valueless.415\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 232, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware v Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 281-282, 287-303.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 233.\n\n240.\n\nEco Oro further rejects Colombia's attempt to exclude costs incurred before 2011, as those costs were incurred in furtherance of Eco Oro's endeavours to develop a licensable project pursuant to its rights under Concession 3452. Eco Oro characterizes Colombia's approach with respect to the computation of costs connected with satellite properties as an attempt to \"*nickel and dime*\" Eco Oro's historical costs assessment. Finally, Eco Oro reiterates that, since 2003, it has focused exclusively on the development of the Angostura Project, thus explaining why the overhead costs incurred in that respect should not be discarded.416\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 234-235, referring to Tr. Day 5, 1303:12-1310:22 (Mr Rossi) (Eng) (Mr Rossi conceded that, from 1996 to 2007, Eco Oro was jointly pursuing open-pit and underground mining concepts); First Behre Dolbear Report, paras. 44, 47-51; Second Behre Dolbear Report, para. 35; 2012 Golder PEA (**Exhibit BD-21**), pp. 268-269; 2015 Micon Resource Estimate (**Exhibit C-37**), pp. 82-83; First Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 68; Second Compass Lexecon Report, fn. 213; Compass Lexecon Historical Cost Summary (**Exhibit CLEX-96**).\n\n**(4) Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nColombia asserts that, in stark contrast with the *Bilcon* claimants, Eco Oro did not conduct its business operations in a reasonable manner. Eco Oro spent years pursuing a hopeless and environmentally destructive open-pit project, only to then shift to an underground mining project without conducting any due diligence. None of the costs it purportedly incurred pursuing an underground project were reasonable. Colombia argues that, in any event, even if Eco Oro had incurred some costs reasonably, it still has not discharged its burden of proving that the USD258 million it claims to have spent on the Angostura Project as a whole are relevant to its loss of opportunity to pursue an underground project. Colombia argues that Eco Oro has not discharged its burden of proving how much of the pre-2011 work was useful to an underground project and that, in the absence of such evidence, it cannot be assumed that all of Eco Oro's expenses bore a causal relationship or were exclusively attributable to the underground Angostura Project.417\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 263-265, 267, citing to *South American Silver Limited v The Plurinational State of Bolivia* (PCA Case No. 2013-15) Award (22 November 2018) (**Exhibit RL-194**), para. 870; and *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 168, 281, 286.\n\n242.\n\nAccording to Colombia, so far as the expenses connected with satellite properties in Colombia are concerned, Eco Oro's justification is inadequate, as, in his Witness Statement, Mr Moseley-Williams was not referring to the same properties as CRA and Eco Oro has not proven that such costs were reasonably incurred or causally connected to the lost opportunity to pursue an underground project.418 Colombia further argues that the \"*variety of overhead costs*\" remain equally unproven. As Eco Oro invested in a number of different properties and projects, it would have needed to provide more than its audited financial statements to discharge its burden of proof.419\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 270.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 271-272.\n\n243.\n\nColombia notes that some of Eco Oro's claimed sunk costs were incurred once Eco Oro had ceased to pursue the Angostura Project and was instead focused on seeking compensation through this arbitration. Colombia submits that legal costs in this arbitration have no relationship with the opportunity to pursue the Angostura Project and cannot thus form the basis of an award on damages.420\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 273-274, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), para. 284.\n\n244.\n\nColombia takes issue with Eco Oro's contention that its claim to a threefold uplift to its purported expenses was not new, as it had been made in Eco Oro's Post-Hearing Brief. According to Colombia, that is exactly Colombia's point: this is a technical valuation argument made after the hearing and without apparent support from Compass Lexecon or even Behre Dolbear.421 Colombia further notes that Eco Oro continues not to engage with the only two analyses where Dr Rudenno's treatise on mining valuation discusses multiplication factors. Eco Oro simply insists that its stage of development justifies the multiplication factor, which Colombia finds unsatisfactory.422 Colombia finally highlights that the CIMVAL's Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral Properties do not support Eco Oro's position. According to Colombia, these guidelines do not explain how to determine the multiplication factor. Colombia adds that Dr Ruddeno's treatise makes clear that a multiplier of less than 1 can be warranted, which would yield a valuation lower than historical exploration costs.423\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 275.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 276.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 277.\n\n245.\n\nFinally, Colombia submits that, if the Tribunal were to decide \u2013 *quod non* \u2013 that the lost opportunity concerned the entire Concession Area, and had some value, it should find that no more than the USD40 million which can reliably be considered to have been incurred in pursuit of the underground Angostura Project can be of any relevance to assessing that loss.424 For completeness, Colombia asserts that Eco Oro's suggestion that its sunk costs should be considered a floor to any damages it is awarded is misplaced. In that context, it considers that Eco Oro has not behaved as a reasonable investor, unlike the investors in *Bilcon*. Moreover, according to Colombia, the *Caratube* tribunal considered sunk costs as a ceiling, not a floor, awarding the claimant damages no higher than its sunk costs.425\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 278, referring to Second CRA Report, Appendix 5.A, para. 11.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 51, 263, 279, citing to *William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Damages (10 January 2019) (**Exhibit RL-158**), paras. 134, 137-144, 168, 280-303; and *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13) Award (27 September 2017) (**Exhibit RL-192**) paras. 989, 1196, 1268.\n\n**L. Question L**\n-----------------\n\n246.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(l) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*What is a commercially reasonable interest rate?*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows426:\n\n\"*81. A commercially reasonable interest rate is 6.6%, with interest compounded annually. As Compass Lexecon explains, that is the rate that was available for prime corporate borrowers as of the valuation date of 8 August 2016, as published by the Central Bank of Colombia. It reflects the rate at which private corporations can obtain financing.*[427] *Colombia has to date proposed an interest rate based on short term US treasury bills, which is a short-term risk-free rate of 1.1%, and does not reflect any of Eco Oro's commercial realities.*[428] *In fact, that rate is below the inflation level that has been observed since the valuation date, and so would not even adequately compensate Eco Oro for the passing of time.*[429] *The Majority Tribunal has rightly rejected Colombia's proposed interest rate.*[430]\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 81. In paragraphs 332-340 of Claimant's First Submission, Eco Oro expands on these arguments. Eco Oro's summary is not entirely consistent with the remainder of its submissions on interest, so far as the frequency of the compounding is concerned. In its summary, Eco Oro posits that interest shall be compounded annually, whereas in paras. 332 and 340 of its First Submission it posits that interest shall be compounded semi-annually. The request for relief in paras. 340 and 351(c) of Eco Oro's First Submission is equally for interest to be compounded semi-annually.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 332-335, referring to Claimant's Reply Memorial, paras. 641-647; Second Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 11, 96-98; Tr. Day 5, 1401:17-1403:4 (Compass Lexecon) (Eng). According to Compass Lexecon, the average cost of bank debt for private corporations in Colombia from the date of valuation, 8 August 2016, to the date of their last expert report, 31 May 2019, is 6.6%.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 337, referring to CRA: Interest (**Exhibit CRA-11**); First CRA Report, para. 127; Second CRA Report, paras. 213-214; Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 94(a)-(b); Compass Lexecon Updated Interest Calculation (**Exhibit CLEX-69**).\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 337(d), referring to Tr.

Colombia makes reference to the data collected by the central bank of Canada (https://www.bankofcanada.ca/valet/observations/group/A4\\_RATES\\_EXTENDED/csv?start\\_date= 2013-01-01) and to an Updated Interest Calculation Spreadsheet (**Exhibit R-269**).\n\n251.\n\nAccording to Colombia, Eco Oro was at all times a Canadian corporation, is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Canadian Stock Exchange, and carried out its \"corporate and commercial activities\", including raising finance, in Canada, not Colombia. Colombia adds that there is no evidence on the record that Eco Oro ever borrowed funds in Colombia, and indeed none of Eco Oro's financial statements record any such borrowings.434\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 232.\n\n252.\n\nColombia asserts that awarding interest at any higher rate would not be commercially reasonable and would overcompensate Eco Oro for any hypothetical costs of borrowing during the period between Colombia's breach and payment of any damages award.435\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 233.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n253.\n\nEco Oro takes issue with Colombia's contention, for the first time and without the support of any valuation expert, that a commercially reasonable interest rate would be 3.5%. Eco Oro asserts that, although Eco Oro is a company located in Canada, its principal asset \u2013 Concession 3452 \u2013 was subject to commercial risks and market forces in Colombia, and not in Canada. Eco Oro adds that the reasonable rate must reflect the country-specific commercial risks affecting the \"target asset\", which was Concession 3452.436\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 240-242, citing, with regard to country-specific commercial risks, to: *Abengoa, SA and COFIDES, SA v United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/2) Award (18 April 2013) (**Exhibit CL-231**), para. 786; *Bernardus Henricus Funnekotter and Others v Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/6) Award (22 April 2009) (**Exhibit CL-57**), paras. 143-144; *Alpha Projektholding GmbH v Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16) Award (8 November 2010) (**Exhibit CL-66**), para. 514; *Tenaris S.A. and Talta -Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal LDA v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/26) Award (29 January 2016) (**Exhibit CL-189**), para. 587.\n\n254.\n\nEco Oro notes that Colombia's new position, which is not accompanied by the support of any valuation expert, appears to self-servingly reflect the opinion of Colombia's legal counsel. According to Eco Oro, the rate that Colombia now proposes would substantially limit its financial exposure for having withheld compensation for the damages that it caused nearly six years ago, on 8 August 2016. In Eco Oro's opinion, this rate introduces a substantial moral hazard by incentivizing Colombia to withhold compensation for its breaches of international law, as it would be provided with a significant economic benefit if it had to pay pre-award interest at a rate lower than its own cost of borrowing (approximately 4.3% at the relevant time).437\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 242-243, referring to Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 94(d); Colombia's Updated Interest Calculation Spreadsheet (**Exhibit R-269**) (\"Summary\" worksheet, column E).\n\n**(4) Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nColombia asserts that the relevant rate is determined by reference to the country where the claimant raises finance, reflecting the rate at which Eco Oro could have borrowed and not the risk of the target asset in the host State. Colombia adds that this view accords with the full reparation principle: in order to compensate the claimant for the unavailability of the principal amount of damages from the date of the injury until the date of payment, interest is to be awarded at the rate the claimant could reasonably have borrowed the funds.438\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 281, citing to *Air Canada v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/17/1) Award (13 September 2021) (**Exhibit RL-200**), para. 699; and *Stans Energy and Kutisay Mining v Kyrgyzstan (II)* (PCA Case No. 2015-32) Award (20 August 2019) (**Exhibit RL-198**), para. 850.\n\n256.\n\nWith regard to Eco Oro's argument that awarding interest at the rate available in Canada would create moral hazard, Colombia points to the full reparation principle, which entails that the applicable rate stands to be assessed by reference to the circumstances and risks faced by Eco Oro, not by reference to Colombia's position.439\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 282.\n\n257.\n\nFinally, Colombia submits that, if any interest is awarded, Eco Oro should not be entitled to compound interest, much less compounded semi-annually, but to simple interest.440\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 283, referring to the Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits (9 October 2019), paras. 537-539.\n\n**M. Question M**\n-----------------\n\n258.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(m) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*What is the anticipated timetable for Eco Oro to undertake remediation work?*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows441:\n\n\"*82. Eco Oro has submitted a plan to the CDMB showing a three-year timetable for the completion of the relevant remediation work. Pursuant to the applicable regulations, Eco Oro submitted its plan to the CDMB on 5 July 2019.*[442] *Under the applicable regulations, the CDMB was required to verify the state of the project, the proposed remediation works, and to formally approve the closure plan within one month of its submittal.*[443] *However, more than 30 months have elapsed and the CDMB has not completed its review. Meanwhile, an influx of illegal miners continues to cause damage in the area of Concession 3452 and, although Eco Oro bears no responsibility for them, their activities are likely to make Eco Oro's compliance with its remediation obligations more challenging and costly.*[444]\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 82. In paragraphs 341-346 of Claimant's First Submission, Eco Oro expands on these arguments.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 341, referring to Letter from Eco Oro to the CDMB (5 July 2019) (**Exhibit C-459**); Eco Oro Closure Plan (5 July 2019) (**Exhibit C-458**).\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 342, referring to Republic of Colombia, Decree No. 1076 (26 May 2015) (**Exhibit R-60**), Article 2.2.2.3.9.2.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 343, referring to Decision, paras. 816-817, 819; Minutes of the Bilateral Liquidation of Concession Contract 3452 (30 December 2020) (**Exhibit C-460**), pp. 9-10; Email from Eco Oro (Ms Arenas) to the ANM (Mr Garc\u00eda) (2 June 2021) (**Exhibit C-461**).\n\n260.\n\nEco Oro notes that the delays in the approval of its Closure Plan445 have left Eco Oro in limbo and have required it to incur additional costs. In that context, Eco Oro makes reference to costs connected with *(i)* the hiring of private security personnel to monitor the site so as to avoid damage to infrastructure, vandalism and damage to the environment resulting from illegal mining (which Eco Oro suspended recently)446; *(ii)* the extension of Eco Oro's environmental performance bond447; and *(iii)* the operation and maintenance of the water treatment plant built by Eco Oro within Concession 3452.448\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Respondent's comments with regard to the labelling of the plan adopted by Eco Oro (cfr.

This is why it has not arisen as a result of Colombia's breach of Article 805 and there is no basis for the Tribunal to order Colombia to pay for such costs.451\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 234-235, referring to Republic of Colombia, Decree No. 1076 (26 May 2015) (**Exhibit R-60**), p. 214, Article 2.2.2.3.9.2.\n\n264.\n\nColombia notes that the anticipated timetable for Eco Oro to undertake remediation work is presently unknown because the Closure Plan it submitted to the CDMB was deficient and Eco Oro has not yet rectified it. Colombia explains that the process has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as Eco Oro's failure to submit a revised plan to address the deficiencies identified by the CDMB. Colombia notes, in particular, that, following the receipt of Eco Oro's Closure Plan, a number of site visits and meetings took place. In that context, a technical report was issued on 16 May 2021 (\"**Technical Report**\"), which provided a preliminary assessment of Eco Oro's proposed Closure Plan and identified a number of issues that required significant adjustments.452 According to Colombia, the Technical Report was later forwarded by the CDMB to Eco Oro to allow the latter to make the required changes.453 Colombia adds that Eco Oro has provided no evidence on following up on its request to the CDMB, or using the remedies available under Colombian law to compel the CDMB to decide on Eco Oro's Closure Plan.454\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 237, referring to CDMB, Technical Report on Site Visit to Concession 3452 (16 May 2021) (**Exhibit R-259**).\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 237, referring to Letter from the CDMB to Eco Oro (1 March 2022) (**Exhibit R-264**), p. 1.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 235-237, referring to the following correspondence between Eco Oro and the authorities: Letter from the ANM to the CDMB (22 January 2020) (**Exhibit R-237**); Letter from the ANM to Eco Oro (2 March 2020) (**Exhibit R-239**); CDMB, Resolution No. 200 (16 March 2020) (**Exhibit R-241**), Articles 2.4, 2.5; CDMB, Resolution No. 213 (31 March 2020) (**Exhibit R-242**), Articles 1, 2; CDMB, Resolution No. 221 (13 April 2020) (**Exhibit R-243**), Article 1; CDMB, Resolution No. 230 (27 April 2020) (**Exhibit R-244**), Article 1; CDMB, Resolution No. 238 (8 May 2020) (**Exhibit R-245**), Article 1; CDMB, Resolution No. 243 (26 May 2020) (**Exhibit R-246**), Article 1; CDMB, Resolution No. 254 (1 June 2020) (**Exhibit R-247**), Article 2; CDMB, Resolution No. 363 (30 June 2020) (**Exhibit R-249**), Articles 1, 2; Letter from the ANM to Eco Oro (13 October 2020) (**Exhibit R-253**), p. 1; Letter from the CDMB to Eco Oro (1 March 2022) (**Exhibit R-264**), p. 1; CDMB, Technical Report on Site Visit to Concession 3452 (16 May 2021) (**Exhibit R-259**). So far as the remedies available under Colombian law are concerned, Colombia asserts that Eco Oro could have challenged the failure to decide Eco Oro's Closure Plan before the administrative courts (Respondent's Response, para. 236, referring to Colombian Code of Administrative Procedure and of Administrative Disputes (**Exhibit R-268**), Article 83).\n\n265.\n\nSo far as Eco Oro's environmental performance bond is concerned, Colombia notes that Eco Oro was, in any event, required to have such instrument in place for three years after the termination of its Concession.455\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 238.\n\n266.\n\nFinally, Colombia submits that Eco Oro alone is responsible for the costs it claims under this section, which were not incurred by reason of Colombia's Article 805 breach.456\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 238.\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n267.\n\nEco Oro takes issue with Colombia's refusal to accept that the remediation costs should be borne by the latter. Eco Oro recalls that it was forced to renounce Concession 3452 as a result of Colombia's measures, which, in turn, triggered Eco Oro's obligation to undertake remediation works.457\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 245, referring to Decision, para. 849.\n\n268.\n\nEco Oro reiterates that, under the full reparation standard, compensation must be sufficient to wipe out the effect of Colombia's breaches of the Treaty. Eco Oro further notes that, given that the fair market value of the rights to the Angostura Project assessed by Eco Oro has already been discounted on account of remediation costs, if Eco Oro is not compensated or indemnified for these costs, then, in effect, it will have to face these remediation costs twice. This would lead to Eco Oro being undercompensated, a result that would be inconsistent with the full reparation principle.458\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 246-248.\n\n269.\n\nEco Oro notes that Colombia does not deny that the requisite one-month period for the CDMB to complete its review of the Closure Plan elapsed nearly three years ago without it taking the requisite actions. Eco Oro considers that the grounds invoked by Colombia in this regard are unavailing excuses, because *(i)* the pandemic cannot justify the CDMB's failure to decide on the Closure Plan459; *(ii)* even if Eco Oro is under no obligation to follow up with the CDMB or take any other action to compel it to comply with its legal obligations, it did in fact follow up with the CDMB on 30 June 2022460; and *(iii)* the Technical Report does not set out CDMB's review of, or a formal decision regarding, the Closure Plan.461\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 251-252, noting that several authorities were holding meetings during this period (Ministry of Environment, Eighth Implementation Report of Judgment T-361 (26 June 2020) (**Exhibit R-248**), pp. 21, 38-39.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 251, 253, referring to Letter from Eco Oro to the CDMB (30 June 2022) (**Exhibit C- 482**), Annex 1, pp. 28-30 (Emails from Eco Oro (Ms Arenas) to CDMB, May 2021).\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 251, 254, referring to CDMB, Technical Report on Site Visit to Concession 3452 (16 May 2021) (**Exhibit R-259**), p. 1. Eco Oro posits that neither the Technical Report (Exhibit R-259) nor the two-page CDMB letter notifying it (Exhibit R-264) constitute an administrative act as required by Decree 1076 of 2015. Eco Oro notes that the Technical Report references a memorandum from the CDMB's legal department which has not been disclosed to Eco Oro (Letter from the CDMB to Eco Oro (1 March 2022) (**Exhibit R-264**), p. 1.\n\n270.\n\nSo far as the Technical Report is concerned, Eco Oro stresses that it is difficult to comprehend why, nearly three years after it received Eco Oro's Closure Plan without having sent any communications to Eco Oro on the substance of its plan, the CDMB would forward to Eco Oro a ten-month-old Technical Report, which was clearly intended as an internal working paper.462 Eco Oro further alleges that the CDMB appears to be acting in concert with the ANDJE and Latham & Watkins, as the CDMB has copied Colombia's counsel in communications with Eco Oro.463 In light of this, Eco Oro has requested that the CDMB issue a formal decision clarifying its position on the Closure Plan.464\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 255.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 255, referring to E-mail from the CDMB to Eco Oro (5 April 2022) (**Exhibit C-481**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 256, referring to Letter from Eco Oro to the CDMB (30 June 2022) (**Exhibit C-482**), p. 8, para. 8.\n\n271.\n\nEco Oro continues to estimate that the completion of the remediation works will take three years. However, it notes that this timeline is counted from the date on which the CDMB approves the Closure Plan and may change once the CDMB issues a formal decision in relation to the aforementioned plan.465\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 257.\n\n**(4) Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nColombia reiterates that remediation costs would have existed regardless of Colombia's breach of the FTA. Moreover, noting that Eco Oro took the decision to undertake the development of the underground version of the Angostura Project without conducting any kind of due diligence, Colombia submits that Eco Oro cannot obtain compensation for a loss that stems from an investment that lacked any reasonable basis.466\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 285.\n\n273.\n\nColombia further notes that if, as Eco Oro claims, the Comparable Transactions 'bake in' the costs and liabilities associated with the development of the project, including remediation costs, then such transactions reflect the value that would be sufficient to make Eco Oro whole. Therefore, by claiming additional compensation for remediation costs, Eco Oro is effectively asking the Tribunal to order Colombia to provide compensation for a cost that the market would not have covered separately. Providing additional compensation for the remediation costs would put Eco Oro in a better position than it would have been in the absence of Colombia's breach of Article 805, which is inconsistent with the full reparation standard.467\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 286.\n\n274.\n\nSo far as the continued delays in the completion of the remediation works are concerned, Colombia considers Eco Oro's allegations to be incorrect and inapposite. With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, Colombia notes that it has caused a significant disruption and backlog in the CDMB's processes. It was in this context that the CDMB circulated the Technical Report, as an effort to resolve this delay and disruption.468 With regard to the lack of follow up by Eco Oro on its request for a decision on its Closure Plan, Colombia considers that it is contrary to Eco Oro's duty to mitigate its losses.469 With regard to the fact that CDMB's observations regarding Eco Oro's Closure Plan were not set out in an administrative act, Colombia points to the provision of Article 17 of the Colombian Code of Administrative Procedure and Administrative Disputes, which provides that administrative bodies, for reasons of efficiency, may ask petitioners to cure deficient or incomplete requests.470\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 287-288.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 289-290.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 291, referring to Colombian Code of Administrative Procedure and of Administrative Disputes (**Exhibit R-268**), Article 17.\n\n275.\n\nFinally, with regard to Eco Oro's contention that the CDMB was acting in concert with Colombia's counsel in this arbitration, Colombia notes that Mr Ignacio Stratta was copied in a piece of correspondence to allow Colombia's counsel to keep a record of the communications exchanged in the context of the approval of the Remediation and Closure Plan.471\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 292.\n\n**N. Question N**\n-----------------\n\n276.\n\nIn paragraph 920(4)(n) of its Decision, the Tribunal sought an answer to the following question:\n\n\"*What is the likely nature of that remediation work?*\"\n\n**(1) Claimant's First Submission**\n-----------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nEco Oro summarises its answer to this question as follows472:\n\n\"*83. According to Colombian law, Eco Oro has an obligation to correct, remediate and/or compensate the environmental impacts caused by the works that it undertook over the course of the 22 years in which it developed the Angostura Project.*[473] *In particular, Eco Oro's remediation plan that was submitted to the CDMB includes work for the restoration of drilling platforms, the restoration of a waste dump, the dismantling of support infrastructure and water treatment.*[474]\"\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 83. In paragraphs 347-350 of Claimant's First Submission, Eco Oro expands on these arguments.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 347, referring to Eco Oro Closure Plan (5 July 2019) (**Exhibit C-458**), p. 70; Republic of Colombia, Decree No. 1076 (26 May 2015) (**Exhibit R-60**), Article 2.2.2.3.1.1; 2001 Mining Code (Law 685) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Articles 84(11), 95, 204.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 348, referring to Eco Oro Closure Plan (5 July 2019) (**Exhibit C-458**), Sections 3.1.2 and 6.1.1, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, and pp. 78, 79. According to Eco Oro, the Closure Plan contemplates the following four principal categories of works: *(a)* drilling platforms: restoring 308 exploration platforms by ensuring that they have been fully covered by native vegetation; *(b)* waste dump: restoring the waste dump known as La Perezosa which covers over 5,500 m2 and which was used to store and collect mining exploration waste and debris. The planned works entail the management of runoff water and geotechnical stabilization of certain mountain slopes in the vicinity of the waste dump; *(c)* support infrastructure: the dismantling and replacement of certain roads and buildings associated with the exploration activities undertaken by Eco Oro. The planned works entail the replacement of the surface for some of the roads built by Eco Oro as well as the dismantling of certain infrastructure; and *(d)* water treatment: continue with the treatment and control of water drainage flowing from the areas of mining development.\n\n278.\n\nEco Oro anticipates that the remediation works will take three years to complete from the date of approval of the Closure Plan and will cost COP$6,986,933,852 (USD2,178,705.37).475\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 349, referring to the official exchange rate of 5 July 2019 as reported by Colombia's Central Bank: USD1/COP$3,206.92 (available at: https://www.banrep.gov.co/es/estadisticas/trm).\n\n279.\n\nFinally, Eco Oro submits that the principle of full reparation requires that Eco Oro be made whole in respect of any remediation costs it eventually incurs, as these form part of the losses flowing from Colombia's breaches of the Treaty.476\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 350.\n\n**(2) Respondent's Response**\n-----------------------------\n\n280.\n\nColombia alludes to a technical report issued by the CDMB in which, *inter alia*, it identified a series of issues with Eco Oro's Closure Plan.477 This technical report noted that478:\n\na. The Closure Plan did not provide sufficient detail in relation to the proposed environmental management of the exploration tunnels, geological excavations, and tunnel entrances, nor specified whether the water treatment plant would be removed;\n\nb. Eco Oro's proposal did not include detailed information in connection with the activities required to ensure the restoration of the La Perezosa waste dump site;\n\nc. the Closure Plan did not include plans for the reforestation of the areas formerly occupied with support infrastructure;\n\nd. Eco Oro ought to close and ensure the restoration of all the drilling and exploration platforms, as well as remove all infrastructure\u2014aside from that relating to environmental management\u2014from the areas overlapping with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo; and\n\ne. Eco Oro ought to include a detailed breakdown of the \"post-closure\" activities planned to mitigate and prevent environmental impacts caused by tunnel drainage and sewage water, cautioning that simply dismantling the water treatment plant without the adoption of any additional measures would likely result in the contamination of the P\u00e1ez creek.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 240, referring to CDMB, Technical Report on Site Visit to Concession 3452 (16 May 2021) (**Exhibit R-259**).\n\nCDMB, Technical Report on Site Visit to Concession 3452 (16 May 2021) (**Exhibit R-259**), pp. 7-41.\n\n281.\n\nAccording to Colombia, given the multiple deficiencies identified by the CDMB, the final cost of its Remediation Plan \u2013 currently set at USD2,178,705.37 \u2013 is likely to change.479\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 243.\n\n282.\n\nFinally, Colombia takes issue with Eco Oro's contentions with regard to additional costs associated with the alleged incursion of illegal miners. According to Colombia, there is no basis for Eco Oro to suggest that Colombia is somehow responsible for any of these costs, as *(i)* Eco Oro has not proven that the incursion of illegal miners, and any additional costs incurred by Eco Oro associated with it, has resulted from Colombia's breach of Article 805; *(ii)* Eco Oro is responsible for the ongoing delays in the process for approving a remediation plan; *(iii)* Eco Oro has always been required to manage all exploration tunnels and tunnel entrances within Concession 3452, which include the El Indio mine: hiring private security is simply a basic measure to protect the Concession Area, over which Eco Oro continues to hold surface rights for the purposes of carrying out its environmental remediation obligations; *(iv)* Eco Oro has provided no evidence that the alleged illegal mining activities would result in higher remediation costs; and *(v)* Colombia has taken measures to combat illegal mining within Concession 3452, which were contemporaneously welcomed by Eco Oro.480\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 244, referring to Letter from Eco Oro to the Commander of the California Police Department (31 March 2017) (**Exhibit R-223**), p. 5; ANM, Resolution No. VSC 545 (3 June 2016) (**Exhibit R-221**).\n\n**(3) Claimant's Reply**\n------------------------\n\n283.\n\nEco Oro submits that the Technical Report does not represent CMDB's final views regarding the Closure Plan, rather consisting of a \"preliminary assessment\". In any event, Eco Oro notes that it addressed, by letter dated 30 June 2022, the alleged \"deficiencies\" invoked by Colombia, either by indicating that they *(i)* had already been addressed in the Closure Plan; or *(ii)* involved impacts that had not been caused by Eco Oro; or *(iii)* were too vague or unclear to be addressed.481\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 260, referring to Letter from Eco Oro to the CDMB (30 June 2022) (**Exhibit C-482**), Annex A.\n\n284.\n\nSo far as the incursions by illegal miners are concerned, Eco Oro stresses that it has sent numerous communications to the relevant authorities detailing the ongoing illegal mining activities in the area of Concession 3452.482 In particular, Eco Oro highlights that, in its numerous reports to the CDMB, it has noted that illegal miners were using mercury, nitrogen and gunpowder to carry out their activities, and that they had stolen machinery and other property that Eco Oro would have used to carry out its remediation activities.483\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 263, referring to Letter from Eco Oro to the Commander of the California Police Department (31 March 2017) (**Exhibit R-223**); Letter from Eco Oro to the CDMB (30 June 2022) (**Exhibit C- 482**), Annex 2.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 264, referring to Letter from Eco Oro to the CDMB (30 June 2022) (**Exhibit C-482**), Annex 2, pp. 2-61, 68-114, 118, 125-135, 141, 147-150, 155-156, 161-167.\n\n285.\n\nEco Oro asserts that, given Colombia's failure to issue a decision on Eco Oro's Closure Plan, the nature of the remediation works to be carried out can only be assessed on the basis of that Closure Plan. Eco Oro reiterates that the principle of full reparation requires that Eco Oro be made whole in respect of any remediation costs it eventually incurs, as these form part of the losses flowing from Colombia's breaches of the Treaty.484\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 266.\n\n**(4) Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nColombia notes that the CDMB has yet to render a final decision on Eco Oro's Closure Plan, such that Eco Oro's allegations are unfounded and premature. In any event, Colombia submits that there is nothing arbitrary, abusive or irregular in the CDMB's rejection of Eco Oro's Closure Plan, not only because Eco Oro's Closure Plan is plainly insufficient for the CDMB to determine the scope, effectiveness and costs of the proposed activities, but also because Colombian law does not bar Eco Oro from carrying out the closure and restoration activities in the Restoration Area of the p\u00e1ramo.485\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 294-295, referring to Ministry of Environment Resolution No. 2090 (19 December 2014) (**Exhibit C-34**), Article 9.\n\n287.\n\nSo far as the alleged influx of illegal miners is concerned, Colombia reiterates that Eco Oro has still not provided any evidence of such alleged added costs. Colombia further notes that it was incumbent upon Eco Oro, in its capacity as holder of surface rights and responsible for environmental remediation activities, to adopt basic security measures. Colombia submits that Eco Oro has instead abandoned its properties in the Angostura Deposit area, thereby contributing to the escalation of the problem, as illegal miners could exacerbate the area's environmental situation.486 Moreover, Colombia argues that Eco Oro's conduct is contrary to its duty of mitigation, as it has not filed any complaint to the competent authority, i.e., the mayor, pursuant to Article 306 of the Mining Code. Colombia therefore contends that Eco Oro should not be entitled to recover any damages from the supposed additional costs of its Closure Plan.487\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 296, underscoring that Eco Oro had admitted that it had stopped paying for private security in the area, and referring to Claimant's First Submission, para. 343; Letter from the CDMB to Eco Oro (22 July 2022) (**Exhibit R-306**), p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 297, referring to Law No. 685 (as amended) (8 September 2001) (**Exhibit C-8**), Article 306; Letter from Eco Oro to the CDMB (30 June 2022) (**Exhibit C-482**), Annex 2.\n\n288.\n\nFinally, Colombia makes reference to a military operation conducted by the Colombian army on 22 July 2022 with a view to evicting illegal miners invading the former area of Concession 3452 and acknowledges that illegal mining is a challenge of large magnitude and that the use of force has limited effectiveness in solving this long-standing and highly complex social and economic situation.488\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 298, referring to \"La extra\u00f1a muerte de un minero en medio de un operativo del Ej\u00e9rcito en Santander\", *El Colombiano* (22 July 2022) (**Exhibit R-307**); and \"'Ay, hijue... lo mat\u00f3, lo mat\u00f3': investigan confusa muerte de minero en Santander\", *Semana* (22 July 2022) (**Exhibit R-308**).\n\n**VI. CLARIFICATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE DECISION**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nIn their submissions, the Parties have identified the following aspects in the Decision, which could be clarified:\n\na. definition of the \"Angostura Project\": according to Eco Oro, this definition should also include the M\u00f3ngora deposit.489\n\nb. paragraph 766, with regard to Article 16 of Law 373 of 1997. According to Eco Oro, \"*Colombia did take the requisite actions to protect the p\u00e1ramo. In this regard, Claimant notes that Law 373 of 1997 [\u2026] concerns an intended national plan for the efficient use of water, to be implemented by the regional and local environmental authorities. In an effort to protect water sources in the country, and thus effectively prepare and implement the plan for the efficient use of water, Article 16 of Law 373 required the acquisition of, inter alia, the p\u00e1ramo areas. However, Article 16 of Law 373 was amended in 2003 so as to require that Colombia 'acquire or protect', inter alia, p\u00e1ramo areas. Ultimately, Article 16 of Law 373 was repealed in 2007. [\u2026] As such, Colombia was not required to actively purchase all land in p\u00e1ramo areas in the country (which would be a daunting and arguably unfeasible objective given that p\u00e1ramo areas are estimated to account for 2.55% of Colombia's continental territory (ie almost 3 million hectares)*\".490\n\nc. paragraph 796(b)(i): while this paragraph refers twice to Resolution 839 dated 2 August 2016, the correct reference is to Resolution 829 dated 2 August 2016.491\n\nand\n\nd. paragraph 898: Eco Oro notes that it conducted two PEAs in relation to the underground mining project at Angostura.492\n\nClaimant's First Submission, fn. 1, referring to Golder Associates, Resource Estimation of the M\u00f3ngora Gold-Silver Deposit (prepared for Eco Oro) (18 April 2012) (**Exhibit BD-22**), p. 12.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, fn. 376, referring to Law 812 (26 June 2003), Article 89 (not in the record); Law 1151 (24 July 2007), Article 160 (not in the record); IAvH, *Aportes a la conservaci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica de los p\u00e1ramos de Colombia: actualizaci\u00f3n de la cartograf\u00eda de los complejos de paramo a escala 1:100.000* (6 February 2014) (**Exhibit C-200**), pp. 36-37.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, fns. 134, 141, 249, 256, referring to National Mining Agency Resolution No. VSC 829 (notified to Eco Oro on 8 August 2016) (2 August 2016) (**Exhibit C-53**).\n\nClaimant's First Submission, fn. 401, referring to NCL Ingenier\u00eda y Construcci\u00f3n Limitada, Mineral Resources Estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment for Underground Mining (25 April 2011) (**Exhibit CLEX- 25**); Golder Associates, Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Angostura Gold-Silver Underground Project (23 March 2012) (**Exhibit CLEX-26**).\n\n**VII. TRIBUNAL ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nArticle 834 (*Interim Measures of Protection and Final Award*) of the FTA provides, *inter alia*, as follows:\n\n\"*2. Where a Tribunal makes a final award against the disputing Party, the Tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:*\n\n(a) *monetary damages and any applicable interest;*\n\n(b) *restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the disputing Party may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.*\n\n*The Tribunal may also award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*4. A Tribunal may not order a disputing Party to pay punitive damages.*\"493\n\nFree Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia (signed on 21 November 2008 and entered into force on 15 August 2011) (**Exhibit C-22**; see also **Exhibit R-137**), Article 834.\n\n291.\n\nIn the absence of any provision in the Treaty as to the appropriate standard of compensation, the Tribunal looks to customary international law as set out in the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility. The applicable standard of compensation, as routinely applied by investment tribunals, is the international law standard of full reparation for the damage actually suffered, as established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, namely that \"[r]*eparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed*\".494 This principle is also reflected in Article 36 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany/Poland) (PCIJ), Merits (1928) (**Exhibit CL-1**), p. 47.\n\n292.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that this is the standard to be applied, and agree that the burden is on Eco Oro, as Claimant, to establish its loss on the balance of probabilities. The burden is thus on Eco Oro to prove, with a sufficient degree of certainty, that Colombia's breaches of Article 805 of the Treaty has caused Eco Oro loss. Eco Oro must further prove, again on a balance of probabilities, the quantum of that loss. Where the Parties disagree is on the application of this standard to the majority of the Tribunal's conclusions on liability. Eco Oro submits that the loss of its acquired right to exploit is equivalent to the destruction of the value associated with the Project. Eco Oro values this as the total value of the Project as calculated pursuant to the Comparable Transactions methodology. For its part, Colombia submits that Eco Oro's loss is limited to the lost opportunity to apply for an environmental license solely over the Remaining Area of Concession 3452 which, it argues, has a zero value.\n\n293.\n\nBefore it can consider the quantum of loss suffered, the Tribunal must first identify the measures that are in breach of Article 805. Eco Oro asserts that the measures in breach of Article 805 commence with Resolution 2090, whereas Colombia says that, given the majority of the Tribunal found the Challenged Measures were a legitimate exercise of Colombia's police powers, it was only the measures taken by Colombia after Resolution VSC 829 that comprised the breach of Article 805.\n\n294.\n\nAs explained in paragraph 821 of the Decision, the majority of the Tribunal found from a review of Colombia's actions \"[\u2026] *viewed as a whole, that Colombia's approach to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was one of arbitrary vacillation and inaction which inflicted damage on Eco Oro without serving any apparent legitimate purpose*.\" These actions include \"[\u2026] *Colombia's actions in refusing to allow mining exploitation activities to take place in the entire area of Concession 3452 without payment of compensation, its inconsistent approach to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo and its ultimate (and continuing) failure to delimit the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo frustrated Eco Oro's legitimate expectations.* [\u2026].\"495 The actions further include Colombia's \"[\u2026] *failure finally to delimit the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo in circumstances where Eco Oro was advised that no environmental licenses could be issued for mining projects in the vicinity of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo until the new delineation had been completed and the failure to give Eco Oro an extension to submit its PTO, comprise conduct that failed to provide Eco Oro with a stable and predictable regulatory environment*. [\u2026].\"496 Indeed, the majority of the Tribunal state in paragraph 820 of the Decision, that \"[\u2026] *Colombia's actions with respect to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo have been grossly inconsistent and given rise to considerable confusion and uncertainty as to (i) what activities may and may not be undertaken within the p\u00e1ramo as currently delimited; (ii) what the final boundaries will comprise; and (iii) when the final delimitation will be announced.* [\u2026].\" The majority of the Tribunal therefore held that these actions of Colombia amounted to gross unfairness or manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable standards and further held that Colombia's failure at any stage to lawfully and finally delimit the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo is a wilful neglect of Colombia's statutory duty.\n\nDecision, para. 804, finding of the Majority Tribunal.\n\nDecision, para. 805, finding of the Majority Tribunal.\n\n295.\n\nIt can be seen from the above that the breach of Article 805 is not to be found in any single act of Colombia but in the totality of its actions, culminating in its failure even now to issue a final and lawful delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. This has resulted in a continuing suspension of mining activities leaving Concession 3452 in limbo: there is no mining ban, but equally the Concession title holder has no right or ability to continue exploration activities.\n\n296.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal then determined that, as a result of the breach of Article 805, Eco Oro has been deprived of \"[\u2026] *its acquired right to exploit, pursuant to which right it has been deprived of the opportunity to obtain approval of a PTO and apply for an environmental licence with respect to the totality of the concession area* [\u2026]*. Without a right to exploit, albeit a right which was dependent upon an approved PTO and environmental licence, there was no possibility of exploiting the Angostura Deposit such that the Concession became valueless*.\"497\n\nDecision, paras. 633-634.\n\n297.\n\nParagraphs 847-849 of the Decision are noteworthy with regard to causation and the nature of Eco Oro's losses:\n\n\"*847. By a majority, the Tribunal finds that Colombia's breach of Article 805 entitles it to make a claim for damages in respect to any loss that it can show to have been caused as a result of that breach.*\n\n*848. The Tribunal has found that there was no mining ban in existence at the time the FTA came into force. The Tribunal has further found, by a majority, that Eco Oro had an acquired right to exploit, albeit such right could only be exercised upon its PTO being approved and upon obtaining an environmental licence to allow it to engage in exploitation. It is common ground that in absence of such a license Eco Oro could not engage in any exploitation. The Tribunal further does not find, by a majority, that Eco Oro's claim is necessarily speculative; Colombia has not shown that no environmental licences were issued for mining activities in p\u00e1ramo areas since the General Environmental Law came into force such that the precautionary principle cannot be said to apply, or that Eco Oro had no prospect whatsoever of obtaining an environmental licence.*\n\n*849. Finally, the Tribunal does not accept, to the extent it is pleaded by Colombia, that it was Eco Oro's intervening acts and omissions that caused its loss, that the casual link has been broken by Eco Oro's renunciation. To the extent that Eco Oro is able to establish that it has suffered losses as a result of the breach of Article 805, such losses will have been incurred before the renunciation of the Concession and the renunciation was effected by Eco Oro in order to mitigate its continuing losses as detailed in its letters to MinMinas and MinAmbiente.*[498]\"\n\nLetter from Eco Oro (Mr Orduz) to the Ministry of Mining and Energy (Ms Su\u00e1rez) (29 March 2019) (**Exhibit C-423**); Letter from Eco Oro (Mr Orduz) to the Ministry of Environment (Mr Lozano) (29 March 2019) (**Exhibit C-424**).\n\n298.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal found that Colombia's breach of Article 805 entitles Eco Oro to make a claim for damages in respect to any loss that Eco Oro could show to have been caused as a result of that breach, namely the breach of Article 805.499 The Tribunal must therefore determine, to the best possible extent, what losses were caused by those measures which were in breach of Article 805, and what is the value of such losses.\n\nDecision, para. 847.\n\n299.\n\nIn ascertaining the quantum of loss suffered by Eco Oro, it is unarguable that inherent in the reparation standard is the principle that a claimant can only recover for losses which it has established to have been caused by an internationally wrongful act. A loss caused by other factors, including any act which has been found to be lawful, is not recoverable. To this end, in identifying the losses which are caused by the acts found by the majority of the Tribunal to amount to a breach of Article 805, it is necessary to exclude those losses which would have been suffered in any event as a result of measures found by the majority of the Tribunal to be lawful. This requires the Tribunal to distinguish between the measures that have been found to be a breach of Article 805, on the one hand, and the loss that has been suffered by Eco Oro as a result of such measures, on the other. The question for the Tribunal is therefore: what losses were caused as a result of the breach of Article 805?\n\n300.\n\nAccording to both the majority of the Tribunal's findings on liability and Eco Oro's own submissions, Concession 3452 became valueless as a result of the Challenged Measures, commencing with the Resolution 2090 delimitation and concluding with the deprivation created by Resolution VSC 829.500 This can be seen from Eco Oro's assertion that it was specifically Resolution VSC 829 which deprived Eco Oro of over 50% of the area of Concession 3452 and a third of the area of the Angostura Deposit and, of critical significance, that it was this loss of resources which destroyed the economic viability of the Project.501 Indeed, in its first submission in response to the Tribunal questions, Eco Oro explains that Resolution VSC 829 was \"*the critical measure causing Eco Oro to suffer a loss*\".502\n\nDecision, para. 634; Claimant's Memorial on the Merits (19 March 2018), paras. 175-176.\n\nFirst Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 59.\n\nClaimant's First Submission, para. 11.\n\n301.\n\nThe difficulty at the present stage is that the majority of the Tribunal has held that the Challenged Measures were a lawful exercise of Colombia's police powers.503 As the majority of the Tribunal found, the breach of Article 805 was not the issuance of Resolution 2090 or Resolution VSC 829 in themselves, but a series of measures continuing to the present day, being the totality of the inconsistent, arbitrary and unfair actions of Colombia with respect to the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo. The majority of the Tribunal concluded that Resolution 2090 and Resolution VSC 829 themselves were measures that were undertaken lawfully pursuant to its police powers.\n\nDecision, para. 699.\n\n302.\n\nGiven the loss of the economic viability of the Project was caused by the Resolution 2090 delimitation and the issuance of Resolution VSC 829, and given the majority of the Tribunal has found this was a lawful exercise of Colombia's police powers, it must follow that, regardless of any view taken on Article 805, the entirety of the value of Concession 3452 was lost as a result of the Respondent's legitimate and lawful exercise of its police powers. A majority of the Tribunal therefore cannot accept that Colombia's breaches of Article 805 caused the total loss in value of the Project. A majority of the Tribunal therefore finds Eco Oro's argument that it is entitled to recover the full value of Concession 3452 to be unarguable: the loss of value was caused by acts found to be lawful and not by the breach of Article 805 identified by the majority of the Tribunal.\n\n303.\n\nIn light of this, a majority of the Tribunal concludes that the only identifiable loss which does flow from the finding of the breach of Article 805 is the inability of Eco Oro to apply for an environmental licence, in respect of that part of the original Concession that remained. In its Question (d), the Tribunal specifically asked the Parties to present argument on the value of this lost opportunity at the end of its Decision on liability.504 In response to this question, Eco Oro elected to provide no evidence or arguments in relation to the value of this loss. Instead, it provided expert evidence with regard to the market value of Concession 3452, based on the Comparable Transactions methodology.505 Notably, the Claimant went further, arguing that to value the loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental licence would not be appropriate in this case.506 In the view of the majority of the Tribunal, however, reliance on the Comparable Transactions methodology favoured by the Claimant is not an appropriate means to value a loss of opportunity. The Comparable Transactions methodology is useful when seeking to assess the full market value of an investment. It is perhaps for this reason that Eco Oro has favoured the use of this methodology in connection with its argument that the breach of Article 805 identified by the majority of the Tribunal had the effect of depriving the Claimant of the whole of the value of its investment. Once it is recognised, however, that the identified breach of Article 805 did not deprive the Claimant of the full value of the investment, but only the opportunity to apply for an environmental licence, it is not apparent that the Comparable Transactions methodology can have any real utility. Put simply, the methodology is premised on a state of affairs (the total loss of the investment's value) which the majority of the Tribunal has accepted does not exist in this case.\n\nTribunal Question D.\n\nSee Claimant's First Submission on the Tribunal's Questions, paras. 306-310; and Claimant's Reply Submission on the Tribunal's Questions, paras. 217-221.\n\nSee Claimant's First Submission on the Tribunal's Questions, paras. 169-177.\n\n304.\n\nEco Oro bears the burden of establishing its actual loss caused by Colombia's breach of Article 805, namely the loss of opportunity to apply for an environmental license. It has not done so. This failure means that Eco Oro has offered the Tribunal no basis on which to value the loss it has suffered, and as a consequence the majority of the Tribunal has concluded that it has no basis on which to justify awarding damages to the Claimant. In reaching this conclusion, the majority of the Tribunal notes that this approach has been adopted by the tribunal in *Infinito Gold Ltd. v Republic of Costa Rica*, and by tribunals in a number of other cases.507\n\n*Infinito Gold Ltd. v Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5) Award (3 June 2021) (**Exhibit RL- 197**), para. 585. See also *Pawlowski AG and Projekt Sever S.R.O. v Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/11) Award (1 November 2021) (not in the record), paras. 728-737; *The AES Corporation and TAU Power BV v Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/16) Award (1 November 2013) (**Exhibit CL-79**), paras. 467-468; *Rompetrol Group N.V. v Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3) Award (6 May 2013) (not in the record), paras. 281-288; *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22) Award (24 July 2008) (**Exhibit CL-50**), paras. 788-806.\n\n305.\n\nYet, even if this aspect is put to one side, it is not clear to the majority of the Tribunal that Eco Oro's inability to apply for an environmental licence has resulted in any actual quantifiable financial losses. Under the applicable domestic law, the grant of an environmental licence is subject to the discretion of the Respondent. It cannot be excluded that, absent the acts found to amount to a breach of Article 805, the Respondent could have decided, on an entirely lawful basis, to refuse to grant any environmental licence. Assuming, *arguendo*, that Colombia had issued its final delimitation in compliance with Judgment T- 361, such a delimitation could conceivably comprise the same boundaries as Resolution 2090, or indeed overlap a greater proportion of the Angostura Deposit, but this would not have been in breach of Article 805. Of course, the Tribunal also accepts the possibility that any final delimitation may not have overlapped the Angostura Deposit. However, on the basis of the evidentiary record before it, the majority of the Tribunal considers that it is not in a position to ascertain the probability of whether or not any final delimitation would overlap the Angostura Deposit. Without a crystal ball, there is simply no evidence or other basis on which the majority of the Tribunal feels it is in a position to determine the likelihood of an environmental licence being granted, or the value of the opportunity to apply for a licence which may or may not be granted. The Claimant has simply failed to provide the evidence or argument to allow the Majority to conclude otherwise. Despite the questions asked by the Tribunal (in particular, Tribunal questions D, E and F), Eco Oro has not provided the Tribunal with any guidance as to how to calculate this percentage risk. Indeed, Eco Oro accepts that \"[i]*t is not possible to predict the location of the 'regulatory Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo' (ie the area over which the Government wishes to establish a mining ban) because its delimitation will not be based solely upon objective scientific criteria, but on policy considerations that are inherently subjective in nature.*\"508\n\nClaimant's First Submission, paras. 181-183.\n\n306.\n\nIt is not in dispute that the 2090 Atlas has some inaccuracies. It was a pilot delimitation by IAvH, using the same field data as had been used to prepare the older 2007 and 2011 Atlases, relying upon \"*very long-standing studies or older studies. There is material from collections. There is generic information which, moreover, is in and reported in the reports of the Institute for each p\u00e1ramo. We have a biodiversity information system, there you can find all the references*.\"509 The unchallenged testimony of Mr Moseley-Williams was that Resolution 2090 included almost the entirety of the town of Vetas510 and also certain densely populated areas of the municipality of Berlin. MinAmbiente acknowledged that certain such areas should be removed from the Resolution 2090 delimitation511 albeit that this has not been done to date. Whilst there has been an agreement reached with the Vetas community as to revising the boundary to exclude the community from the delimited area, which shows that there can be adjustments to the p\u00e1ramo boundary, Colombia describes this agreement as preliminary. The Tribunal further notes that the CDMB also recommended changes should be made to the 2090 Atlas. Indeed, the Constitutional Court itself noted that MinAmbiente may modify the delimitation given the errors in the delimitation.\n\nTr. Day 3 (Ms Baptiste), 736:2-8.\n\nFirst Moseley-Williams Statement, para. 27.\n\nMinistry of Environment Presentation, \"Delimitaci\u00f3n del P\u00e1ramo de Santurb\u00e1n\" (December 2014) (**Exhibit C- 217**), p. 43.\n\n307.\n\nIt is also of note that the IAvH itself accepted that there could have been a margin of error of 100 metres of altitude in the delimitation and MinAmbiente estimated that the margin of error could have been even greater, potentially as much as 150 metres in altitude in certain areas because \"[\u2026] *the quality of information has limitations* [\u2026]\", stating that further field studies should have been undertaken to verify the information.512 The Angostura Deposit is located in a mountainous location, such that this margin of error may be significant in that a 150 metre change in altitude in the area where the Angostura Deposit is located could result in a shift of up to 250 metres in the Resolution 2090 delimitation. If this is so, the Angostura Deposit would be outside the Preservation Zone of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.\n\nMinistry of Environment Presentation, \"Delimitaci\u00f3n del P\u00e1ramo de Santurb\u00e1n\" (December 2014) (**Exhibit C- 217**), p. 43.\n\n308.\n\nThe difficulty seen by the majority of the Tribunal is that it has not been provided with the necessary evidence \u2013 or indeed any evidence \u2013 to allow it to calculate the probability chances that the Angostura Deposit would fall outside the p\u00e1ramo such that an environmental licence would be granted. Whilst Eco Oro refers to the conclusion of the ECODES Report that there is no p\u00e1ramo in that part of Concession 3452 where the Angostura Deposit is located, the 2090 Atlas and the ECODES Report were prepared for different purposes and the Tribunal therefore does not find it possible to apply the findings of either of the reports in considering probability chances. One of the major differences in the approaches followed by the IAvH and ECODES is whether a Transition Zone should be included and, if so, how. Eco Oro says no Transition Zone should be included whereas Colombia has included such a strip. Had the IAvH used the upper limit of the Transition Zone, almost the entirety of the Angostura Deposit would have remained outside the delimited zone; by including the Transition Zone as part of the delimited area, the overlap with the Angostura Deposit increased from 6% to 60%.\n\n309.\n\nMs Baptiste, who was put forward by Colombia, explains that:\n\n\"[t]*he transitional strip from any ecosystem to another one is the area where you have the most ecological exchanges, where you have the most flows because it is a border. So, that's where the water may go in deeper or the flora now or the flora may change, and you have different ecosystems and changes and the forest is trying to crop up to the p\u00e1ramo, and the p\u00e1ramo is trying to conquer the natural areas left by the forest.*\n\n*So the strip is key for the operation of the ecosystem, and the strip is considered a key protection area for the p\u00e1ramo because this is the ecosystem that is above, and also the flow of ecosystem and, in particular, water. It goes over the bridges, and it also connects to the forest area, so this is one of the areas that requires the most care. And that's the reason why we devote a good deal of time to work thoroughly on this scale that we were requested to submit, and that is one of the important issues.*\n\n*Since the strip may vary widely, as you just mentioned, it would be a good idea to carry out \u2013 well we conducted the study of the breadth of the strip on the field that required sampling and also financial resources. Studies had been conducted to try to determine the variability, and plants and soil samples need to be collected, a large amount material, to be able to determine in that area what the behaviour is.*\"513\n\nTr. Day 3 (Ms Baptiste), 741:7-742:12.\n\n310.\n\nAgainst this, Mr Aldana explains that the Transition Zone has specific features which makes it a separate ecosystem from the p\u00e1ramo, opining that there is no scientific evidence that says the Transition Zone is not an independent ecosystem from the p\u00e1ramo.514 Mr Aldana further says that the high-Andean forest is a further separate ecosystem.515 Mr Aldana says that the IAvH's approach to delimitation missed \"*one of the most important principles of ecology which is spatial heterogeneity* [\u2026] [which is] *a principle that makes it such that evolution works, that ecosystems work or operate in tandem. Otherwise, it would be easy to delimit everything with a single line. But that is not the case. Actually, there are social and economic factors that also condition ecosystems.*\"516\n\nTr. Day 2 (Mr Aldana), 520:14-16.\n\nTr. Day 2 (Mr Aldana), 521:1-8.\n\nTr. Day 2 (Mr Aldana), 523:12-21.\n\n311.\n\nColombia's position is therefore that the regulatory p\u00e1ramo must include a Transition Zone, whereas Eco Oro explains that no p\u00e1ramo overlaps the Angostura Project. The difficulty for the Tribunal is that ECODES and IAvH are undertaking different analyses. The IAvH is assisting Colombia in preparing a regulatory delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo, whereas ECODES is assessing whether there is any evidence of ecological p\u00e1ramo overlapping the Angostura Deposit. Colombia does not criticise the technical content of the ECODES Report. Ms Baptiste considers it a \"*qualified and informed opinion*[] *on the subject*\",517 but she notes that \"[d]*espite the value in analysing the p\u00e1ramo vegetation in greater detail, the ECODES' study is therefore incompatible with the IAVH's mission to determine the reference area, because (i) it does not follow the same methodology, (ii) it was not conducted at the same scale, and (iii) it only covers a minimal fraction of the total area of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, as it is limited to the area of the Angostura project's deposit*\".518\n\nFirst Baptiste Statement, para. 51.\n\nFirst Baptiste Statement, para. 52; Second Baptiste Statement, para. 29.\n\n312.\n\nColombia also explained that to safeguard the scientific consistency of the delimitation, the IAvH needed to follow its selected methodology homogenously. The IAvH could not simply have adopted information prepared by a private party with a direct interest in the outcome of the delimitation. Therefore, the ECODES Report was not compatible with the delimitation exercise undertaken by the IAvH as it did not analyse the transition between the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and the forest. It provided an assessment of the \"*State of preservation of biodiversity in the ecosystems associated with the Angosturas California sector, Santander*\". Whereas, as explained by Mr Sarmiento, the IAvH's mission was not simply to assess the current conservation state of the p\u00e1ramo, but to delimitate the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem in its integrity, regardless of variations as to its current state in certain specific areas.519\n\nSarmiento Pinz\u00f3n Statement, para. 12.\n\n313.\n\nIn its Rejoinder submission on the Tribunal's questions, Colombia said as follows:\n\n\"*In conclusion, the ECODES Report is not a reliable source to identify the overlap of the Angostura Deposit with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, because it adopts a minimalistic and self-serving definition of the 'scientific' or 'ecological' p\u00e1ramo. This definition is clearly at odds with the equally reasonable and valid precautionary definition adopted by the IAVH, as recognised by the Tribunal in its Decision. This definition was used for the preparation of the delimitation of the 'regulatory' p\u00e1ramo in Resolution 2090, and is also used in the 2019 P\u00e1ramo Delimitation Proposal. Further, the ECODES Report is not an objective study, as it was commissioned by the mining industry as a lobbying document for the specific purpose of influencing the 'regulatory' delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo.*\"520\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 131.\n\n314.\n\nTo calculate the probability chances that Eco Oro would be awarded an environmental licence, it would be necessary to determine the probability chances that a Transition Zone would be included in the delimitation. However, as described above, the IAvH and ECODES disagree on this issue such that it is not possible for the Tribunal to make this determination. The Tribunal finds that both experts acted with integrity in performing the work they were engaged to undertake, but they were instructed to undertake different exercises. It is possible, given the conclusions of the ECODES Report, that none of the Angostura Deposit is actually overlapped by p\u00e1ramo. However, in delimiting the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, Colombia is not only considering the parameters of the ecological p\u00e1ramo, it is seeking to determine the regulatory p\u00e1ramo after undertaking the required consultations and ensuring consistency of approach in the delimitation of all Colombia's p\u00e1ramos. In application of the precautionary principle, the Tribunal concludes that it was not unreasonable for the Transition Zone to have been included when delimiting the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo.521 Further, the Tribunal does not find it can rely on the ECODES Report's conclusion that no p\u00e1ramo overlaps the Angostura Deposit in seeking to assess the value of Eco Oro's loss of opportunity.\n\nDecision, para. 655.\n\n315.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that, whilst it is clear Colombia's breaches of Article 805 caused funding difficulties for Eco Oro and, in the absence of an extension to its Licence, it was forced to give up Concession 3452, by this stage the value of the Project had already been destroyed. Accordingly, the majority of the Tribunal finds that Eco Oro has not met its burden of proof to show that Colombia's actions caused Eco Oro a quantifiable harm. The harm had already been caused by the Challenged Measures.\n\n316.\n\nWhilst Eco Oro may question the need for a damages assessment to have been undertaken given the majority of the Tribunal's conclusion, this exercise was necessary as the Tribunal sought to understand what loss was caused by the breach of Article 805 given its finding as to Article 811 and how to value that loss. The Tribunal accepts that in its Decision it stated that it did not believe it was reasonable to expect Eco Oro to prejudge the boundaries of the final delimitation in circumstances where Colombia has itself failed to determine the boundaries. However, to quantify the damages caused by Colombia's breach, it was necessary for Eco Oro to provide some guidance to the Tribunal as to the value of Eco Oro's lost opportunity in circumstances where the value of the Project was destroyed by a lawful measure carried out by Colombia. In the absence of such guidance, the Tribunal cannot assess the likelihood that a revised delimitation would or would not permit economic exploitation of the Angostura Deposit. In the absence of any evidence or other basis on which the Tribunal can assess either the likelihood of an environmental licence being granted, or the value of the opportunity to apply for a licence which may or may not be granted, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the only proper approach is to award no damages to Eco Oro.\n\n317.\n\nIn this regard, the majority of the Tribunal accepts that Colombia may be benefitting from its failure to issue a final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo given it is the absence of the final delimitation that prevents the Tribunal from assessing the percentage likelihood that economic exploitation could have been possible. However, Eco Oro accepts that the destruction to the value of the Concession was caused by the Challenged Measures, which the majority of the Tribunal found to be a lawful exercise of Colombia's police powers. Given that the Claimant has not been able to provide any evidence relating to the loss of opportunity which the majority of the Tribunal identified, despite being specifically asked to do so,522 the Tribunal concludes that it cannot award damages for the breach of Article 805.\n\nTribunal Question D.\n\n**VIII. REMEDIATION COSTS**\n---------------------------\n\n318.\n\nThe principle that a Tribunal can only award damages in respect of losses which flow from an internationally wrongful act applies equally to remediation costs incurred by a claimant. In identifying such losses, the Tribunal must exclude costs that would have been incurred by the Claimant in any event.\n\n319.\n\nIn paragraph 919 of the Decision, the Tribunal requested the Parties to address two additional questions so as to assist the Tribunal in determining whether Eco Oro was entitled to an indemnity in respect of remediation costs.523\n\nTribunal Questions M and N.\n\n320.\n\nIn response to those questions, the Claimant did not dispute the Respondent's argument that it would have been liable to pay remediation costs even if the internationally wrongful act identified by the majority of the Tribunal had not occurred, or if the project had gone ahead. Nor did the Claimant provide any evidence that the remediation costs it now faces are greater than the costs it would have faced in either scenario. The Claimant has argued only that the domestic law obligation to pay remediation costs was effectively triggered by the breach of Article 805.524\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 254; Respondent's Response, para. 234, referring to Republic of Colombia, Decree No. 1076 (26 May 2015) (**Exhibit R-60**), p. 214, Article 2.2.2.3.9.2.\n\n321.\n\nIn such circumstances, a majority of the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant cannot recover its remediation costs. Whilst the breach of Article 805 may have brought the Claimant's remediation obligation forward in time, the existence of the obligation is plainly not the consequence of the breach of Article 805 identified by the majority of the Tribunal. Nor is there any evidence on the record to suggest that the breach of Article 805 identified by the majority of the Tribunal caused any increase in the Claimant's remediation costs. Indeed, given the early stage of the Project and the lack of any exploitation activity, it seems likely that the Claimant's remediation costs are lower than they would have been had the project been allowed to proceed.\n\n322.\n\nThe arguments advanced by the Claimant in relation to the activity of illegal miners takes the matter no further.525 Whilst it is no doubt true that illegal mining is a significant issue in Colombia, it does not follow from this that the Respondent is somehow responsible for costs which the Claimant faces in relation to such activity as a result of the breach of Article 805. Whilst the majority of the Tribunal referred to the existence of illegal mining in its findings that there was a breach of Article 805, this was only to substantiate the view that the Colombian government had failed to reach a coherent policy on the management of the p\u00e1ramo.526 As pointed out by the Respondent, the existence of illegal mining did not itself form any part of the majority of the Tribunal's conclusions on Article 805.527 The majority of the Tribunal therefore concludes that there is no evidence that the remediation costs incurred as a result of the existence of illegal mining were the consequence of the breach of Article 805 identified.\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 263-264.\n\nDecision, paras. 815-819.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 244.\n\n**IX. INTEREST AND COLOMBIAN TAXES**\n------------------------------------\n\n**A. Interest**\n---------------\n\n323.\n\nIn paragraphs 912-913 of the Decision, the Tribunal noted the following:\n\n\"*912. The Tribunal accepts that, to the extent that Eco Oro has suffered loss as a result of Colombia's breach of Article 805 of the FTA, Eco Oro should receive full reparation and such reparation should include interest. The Tribunal further accepts that the appropriate interest rate should be a commercially reasonable rate.*\n\n*913. The Tribunal accepts Eco Oro's submissions that the US Treasury Bill rate is not a commercially reasonable rate. The Parties are invited to make any final submissions on what is a commercially reasonable rate.*\"\n\n324.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's determination that there is no award of damages, this issue is moot.\n\n**B. The Award Shall Be Net of All Applicable Colombian Taxes**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nIn paragraph 916 of the Decision, the Tribunal determined as follows:\n\n\"*In the absence of any submissions from Colombia, the Tribunal in principle accepts Eco Oro's submissions and holds that any award of damages will be expressly ordered to be net of all applicable Colombian taxes.*\"\n\n326.\n\nThat decision was then incorporated in the dispositif set out in paragraph 920 of the Decision as follows:\n\n\"*(6)* [\u2026] *Any award of damages will be expressly ordered to be net of all applicable Colombian taxes. Colombia will be ordered not to tax or attempt to tax the award and to indemnify Eco Oro in respect of any adverse consequences that may result from the imposition of a double taxation liability by the Colombian tax authorities if the declaration in the award recognising that the award is net of Colombian taxes is not accepted as the equivalent of evidence of payment.*\"\n\n327.\n\nAs no damages are awarded, again this issue is moot.\n\n**X. ECO ORO'S REQUESTS FOR CLARIFICATIONS**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered those parts of the Decision that Eco Oro has identified could be clarified.\n\n329.\n\nThe first clarification relates to the definition of the \"Angostura Project\". Eco Oro notes in footnote 1 of its First Submission that \"*For the definition of the 'Angostura Project', Eco Oro adopts the Tribunal's definition, and supplements it to also include the M\u00f3ngora deposit (in addition to the Angostura deposit) in respect of which Eco Oro had also issued a NI 43-101 compliant estimate of Extractable Minerals.*\" Eco Oro refers to Exhibit BD-22, p 12.\n\n330.\n\nParagraph 81 of the Decision states as follows:\n\n\"*Eco Oro owns 100% of the mining project located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Andean system, within the Vetas-California gold district, approximately 70 kilometres northeast of the city of Bucaramanga, Municipality of California, Department of Santander, and 400 kilometres North of Bogot\u00e1, comprising the Angostura gold-silver deposit (the \"**Angostura Project**\" or \"**Project**\").*\"27\n\n331.\n\nFootnote 27 to this paragraph details as follows:\n\n\"*The Angostura Project also includes five satellite projects: M\u00f3ngora, La Plata, Armenia, Agualimpia and Violetal. See Notice of Intent to submit the claim to arbitration (7 March 2016) (**Exhibit C-48**), fn. 1. See also Ministry of Mines, Mining and Energy Planning Unit, Mining, an excellent choice for investing in Colombia: The Investor's Guide (2005) (**Exhibit C-94**), Figures 1 and 2.*\"\n\n332.\n\nIt is clear from the content of footnote 27 of the Decision (as cited above) that the Angostura Project includes the M\u00f3ngora satellite project but for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal clarifies that the definition of the \"Angostura Project\" includes the M\u00f3ngora deposit.\n\n333.\n\nThe second clarification arises with regard to paragraph 766 of the Decision. This paragraph provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n\"*Colombia had the power to delimit the p\u00e1ramo and, pursuant to section 16 of Law 373 of 1997, it was obliged to acquire p\u00e1ramo areas such as the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo 'as a priority' as well as to initiate a recovery, protection and conservation process to ensure protection of the p\u00e1ramo. However, Colombia did not take the necessary action it was legally required to take to protect the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo; instead, it granted a mining concession over the area in question.*\"\n\n334.\n\nEco Oro notes in footnote 376 of its First Submission that Colombia did take the necessary action as Colombia was not required by section 16 of Law 373 of 1997 to actively purchase all land in p\u00e1ramo areas. This is because the section in question was amended in 2003 to require Colombia to \"*acquire or protect*\", *inter alia*, p\u00e1ramo areas. Eco Oro says that Colombia was accordingly not required actively to acquire all land in p\u00e1ramo areas and Colombia did take the requisite actions to protect the p\u00e1ramo. Colombia has not objected to this. Accordingly, the Tribunal clarifies paragraph 766 of the Decision such that Colombia did take the requisite action under section 16 of Law 373 of 1997 to protect the p\u00e1ramo.\n\n335.\n\nThe third clarification relates to paragraph 796(b)(i) of the Decision. In footnotes 134, 141, 249 and 256 of the First Submission, Eco Oro notes that this paragraph refers twice to Resolution 839 dated 2 August 2016 whereas the correct reference is to Resolution 829 dated 2 August 2016. Colombia does not make any contrary submission and the Tribunal confirms that the references in paragraph 796(b)(i) of the Decision to Resolution 839 dated 2 August 2016 should instead be references to Resolution 829 dated 2 August 2016.\n\n336.\n\nThe final clarification relates to Paragraph 898 of the Decision which provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n\"*No Feasibility or pre-Feasibility study was undertaken for Eco Oro's underground mining project for the Angostura Deposit, the PEA it submitted to the Colombian authorities related to the open-pit mine (which it abandoned of its own volition) and there is no equivalent document in relation to the underground tunnel or underground mining.*\"\n\n337.\n\nIn footnote 401 of its First Submission, Eco Oro says that it \"[\u2026] *conducted two PEAs in relation to the underground mining project at Angostura.*\" Eco Oro refers to the two relevant PEAs which are exhibited at CLEX-25 and CLEX-26. Again, Colombia does not dispute this and the Tribunal accordingly clarifies that paragraph 898 of the Decision should refer to two PEAs and not to the \"the\" PEA.\n\n**XI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n338.\n\nRule 28 (*Cost of Proceeding*) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that:\n\n\"*(1) Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:*\n\n*(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre;*\n\n*(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties.*\n\n*(2) Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding. The Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, request the parties and the Secretary-General to provide additional information concerning the cost of the proceeding.*\"\n\n339.\n\nDuring the Hearing,528 the Parties agreed that no submissions on costs would be necessary. The Parties further agreed that the submission of a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by each of them in the proceeding would suffice.\n\nTr. Day 5, 1573:16-1574:15.\n\n340.\n\nBy e-mail dated 2 July 2020, the Tribunal noted the following:\n\n\"*In accordance with paragraph 23.2 of Procedural Order No. 1 and paragraph 42 of Procedural Order No. 10, the parties shall submit their respective costs statements after the closure of the proceeding.*\n\n*In view of the above provisions and that the proceeding has not yet been declared closed, please note that the issue of cost statements will be addressed with the parties promptly after the closure of the proceeding.*\"\n\n341.\n\nOn 23 February 2024, the Tribunal invited the Parties to agree on a template for their Statements of Costs (which were not to include legal arguments) and to submit their respective Statements of Costs by 8 March 2024. The Tribunal further informed that, following receipt of the Parties' Statements of Costs, the Tribunal would proceed to close the proceedings in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n342.\n\nOn 1 March 2024, the Claimant filed an application requesting the Tribunal's directions as to *(i)* the inclusion of a line item for the costs that the Claimant has incurred to obtain financing to pursue this arbitration; and *(ii)* the submission of short argumentation of up to two pages in their cost submissions to address exclusively the recoverability of arbitration finance costs.\n\n343.\n\nOn 5 March 2024, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to *(i)* allow the Claimant's application of 1 March 2024 to include details of its financing costs as a line item in its Statement of Costs; and *(ii)* allow the Parties to file short argumentation of up to two pages in their cost submissions to address exclusively the recoverability of arbitration financing costs.\n\n344.\n\nOn 8 March 2024, the Parties filed their respective Statements of Costs.\n\n**A. The Claimant's Cost Submissions**\n--------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nIn its submissions, the Claimant argues that the Respondent should bear the total arbitration costs incurred by the Claimant, including legal fees and expenses.529\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Reply, para. 267(h).\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted the following claims for legal and other costs (excluding advances made to ICSID):530\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | **FEES AND EXPENSES ACCRUED** | **FEES AND EXPENSES PAID** |\n| 1 | Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP | $22,787,788.05 | $22,739,448.80 |\n| 2 | Holland & Knight LLP | $482,658.90 | $482,658.90 |\n| ***A*** | ***SUBTOTAL COUNSEL*** | ***$23,270,446.95*** | ***$23,222,107.70*** |\n| 3 | Mark Moseley-Williams | $25,550.11 | $25,550.11 |\n| 4 | Wilmer Gonz\u00e1lez Aldana | $8,186.00 | $8,186.00 |\n| ***B*** | ***SUBTOTAL FACT WITNESSES*** | ***$33,736.10*** | ***$33,736.10*** |\n| 5 | Compass Lexecon | $2,885,733.87 | $2,885,733.87 |\n| 6 | Behre Dolbear | $1,417,862.01 | $1,417,862.01 |\n| 7 | Prof. Margarita Ricaurte | $39,869.00 | $39,869.00 |\n| 8 | FTI Consulting | $30,900.71 | $30,900.71 |\n| 9 | Immersion Legal | $65,435.21 | $65,435.21 |\n| ***C*** | ***SUBTOTAL EXPERTS AND CONSULTANTS FEES AND COSTS*** | ***$4,439,800.80*** | ***$4,439,800.80*** |\n| 10 | Party representatives' travel expenses | $66,804.01 | $66,804.01 |\n| ***D*** | ***SUBTOTAL PARTY REPRESENTATIVES' TRAVEL EXPENSES*** | ***$66,804.01*** | ***$66,804.01*** |\n| **SUBTOTAL \u2013 COST CATEGORIES A TO D** | **$27,810,787.87** | **$27,762,448.62** |\n| 11 | Arbitration finance costs | $4,589,794.66 | $4,492,899.48 |\n| ***E*** | ***SUBTOTAL ARBITRATION FINANCE COSTS*** | ***$4,589,794.66*** | ***$4,492,899.48*** |\n| **GRAND TOTAL** | **$32,400,582.53** | **$32,255,348.10** |\n\nSee Claimant's Statement of Costs, para. 6.\n\n347.\n\nWith respect to category E (row 11), the Claimant indicates that it reflects \"*a portion of the costs that Eco Oro had no option but to incur to obtain financing to enable it to pursue the arbitration.*\"531 It argues that such costs should be recovered, *inter alia*, because financing from third parties was the only means for the Claimant to bring this arbitration and maintain the company's business affairs during the pendency of the present case, and because said recovery would be consistent with the principle of full reparation which requires an award of costs.532 Accordingly, insofar as the Claimant prevails in the arbitration, it should recover the totality of its costs, including those which were required to finance the arbitration.533 The Claimant highlights that such financing costs are \"*a direct and immediate consequence of Colombia's unlawful measures*\" as well as \"*a reasonable and essential part of the company's costs in pursuing this arbitration*\".534\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs, para. 13.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs, paras. 16-21.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs, para. 20.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs, paras. 20-21.\n\n**B.

According to the Respondent, such costs are not recoverable under the ICSID Convention because they were not incurred \"in connection with\" the arbitration as required by Article 61(2) of the Convention and are outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Moreover, the Respondent argues that there is no precedent of an ICSID tribunal awarding arbitration finance costs to a successful claimant and, in any event, the Claimant's arbitration finance costs are not reasonable and hence not recoverable.537\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 1-7.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\"\n\n352.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n353.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tribunal's fees and expenses |  |\n| Juliet Blanch | 401,987.18 |\n| Horacio Grigera Na\u00f3n | 312,570.28 |\n| Philippe Sands | 177,499.78 |\n| Tribunal assistant's fees and | expenses |\n| Jo\u00e3o Vilhena Val\u00e9rio | 173,472.20 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 336,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 197,598.32 |\n| **Total** | **1,599,127.76** |\n\n354.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.538 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 799,563.88.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n355.\n\nIn general, two approaches have been followed by ICSID tribunals in allocating costs: that costs 'lie where they fall', and that 'costs follow the event'.\n\n356.\n\nIn exercising its discretion, the Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties' submissions as well as the circumstances of the case, including not only the Parties' conduct in these proceedings but also their wider conduct towards each other. The Tribunal accepts that whilst Eco Oro has prevailed on jurisdiction and has been partly successful in the liability phase of these proceedings, it has been unsuccessful in its prosecution of large parts of its substantive claim, and has failed entirely in its claim for damages. Relatedly, however, the Tribunal is bound to note that Eco Oro's failure is in no insignificant part due to Colombia's failure to delimit the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo, notwithstanding the ruling of the Constitutional Court. Had the delimitation been undertaken in accordance with Judgment T-361, the Tribunal may have been able properly and accurately to assess Eco Oro's claim for damages.\n\n357.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the Parties and their counsel have undertaken these proceedings in a professional, efficient and courteous manner. Having regard to the totality of the elements the Tribunal is bound to take into account, the Tribunal exercises its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention to conclude that the costs of the proceedings should be shared equally by the Parties, and that each Party shall bear its own fees and other costs. The Tribunal so orders.\n\n**XII. AWARD**\n--------------\n\n358.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal by majority decides as follows:\n\n(1) The decisions made in the Decision are hereby reinstated as follows:\n\na. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Eco Oro's claims (Tribunal's Decision, paragraph 920(1));\n\nb. Colombia breached Article 805 of the Treaty (Majority Decision, paragraph 920(2));\n\nc. Colombia shall not tax or attempt to tax the award (Tribunal's Decision, paragraph 920(6)); and\n\nd. Colombia shall indemnify Eco Oro in respect of any adverse consequences that may result from the imposition of a double taxation liability by the Colombian tax authorities if the declaration in the award recognising that the award is net of Colombian taxes is not accepted as the equivalent of evidence of payment (Tribunal's Decision, para. 920(6));\n\n(2) The Tribunal determines that it can award no damages from Colombia's breach of Article 805, or for any remediation costs;\n\n(3) The Tribunal orders that each Party is to bear 50% of the costs of the proceedings, and its own legal fees and other costs; and\n\n(4) All other claims are dismissed.\n\nDate: 8 July 2024"}]}
