The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is Hungary (the \"***Respondent***\"), a sovereign State represented in these proceedings by:\n\n\u2022 Camilo Cardozo, DLA Piper LLP (US)2 \u2022 Kiera Gans, DLA Piper LLP (US)  \n\u2022 Natasha Kanerva, DLA Piper LLP (US)  \n\u2022 Andr\u00e1s Nemescs\u00f3i, HORV\u00c1TH & PARTNERS DLA PIPER  \n\u2022 David Kohegyi, HORV\u00c1TH & PARTNERS DLA PIPER  \n\u2022 Dr. Beatrix B\u00e1rtfai, SARHEGYI & PARTNERS LAW FIRM  \n\u2022 Dr. J\u00f3zsef Gyori, Ministry of National Development, Hungary\n\nUntil 2 February 2016.\n\n**C. Background to the dispute**\n--------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"***ICSID***\" or the \"***Centre***\") pursuant to the bilateral investment treaty between France and Hungary (the \"***Treaty***\"), which entered into force on 30 September 1987, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"***ICSID Convention***\"). Pursuant to the legal arguments described below, Claimants also rely on the bilateral investment treaty between Hungary and Croatia, which entered into force on 1 March 2002, and the bilateral investment treaty between Hungary and Lithuania, which entered into force on 20 May 2003.3\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Brief, however, the Claimants assert that they now rely solely on the Hungary-Lithuania BIT (Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 7).\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute relates to certain legal and tax reforms that impacted the Claimants' fringe voucher business in Hungary.\n\n6.\n\nLe Cheque D\u00e9jeuner Kft *(\"**CD Hungary**\")* is the Claimants' wholly-owned subsidiary in Hungary. It was created in November 1996 and began operations in 1997. CD Hungary is a fringe voucher issuer. According to the description provided by the Parties, the fringe voucher business essentially consists in the following sequence: (i) an issuer sells vouchers to employers at a face value plus a commission; (ii) the employer grants vouchers to employees as part of a broader compensation package; (iii) employees use their vouchers to pay for various goods and services at affiliates that have themselves entered into an agreement with the issuer in order to accept such vouchers as payment methods; and (iv) the affiliates claim payment from the issuer for the face value of the collected vouchers minus a commission. Voucher issuers consequently derive revenues from: (i) the commissions charged to employers and affiliates; (ii) investments made during the period between voucher issuance to employers and reimbursement to affiliates; and (iii) unclaimed vouchers (such as lost or expired vouchers) the face value of which is retained by the issuer.4\n\nMemorial, paras. 87-95; Hungary's Counter-Memorial dated 17 July 2015 (the \"***Counter-Memorial***\"), paras. 26-32.\n\n7.\n\nThe employers' incentive to buy vouchers, and the employees' incentives to use them, hinges on a preferential tax treatment. Unlike standard cash compensation, vouchers are either tax exempt (both from payroll tax for employers and income tax for employees) or taxed at a lower rate, within a determined limit.5\n\nMemorial, para. 92; Counter-Memorial, para 29.\n\n8.\n\nCD Hungary was primarily active in the food voucher business, including both \"cold food\" vouchers for use at supermarkets and grocery stores and \"hot food\" vouchers for use at restaurants. It marginally issued gift vouchers as well as school supplies vouchers.\n\n9.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, two tax reforms were passed. First, the tax rate applicable to cold food vouchers and gift vouchers was substantially increased, prompting CD Hungary to focus on hot food vouchers only. Later, the tax rates applicable to hot and cold food vouchers were re-aligned, prompting CD Hungary to create a new type of vouchers that could be redeemed for both kinds of food.\n\n10.\n\nIn 2011, a reform was passed that amended the regulations applicable to fringe vouchers. First, the government created SZEP cards, a dematerialized alternative to paper vouchers. SZEP card issuers would open accounts that employers could credit as part of their employees' compensation plans. Employees would in turn be issued a SZEP card and use it to pay for various goods, including hot meals. Claimants did not meet the legal conditions required to issue SZEP cards. Second, the government created Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers, which could be used to pay for cold food (and eventually also hot food). Only the *Magyar Nemzeti \u00dcd\u00fcl\u00e9si Alapitvany* (\"***MNUA***\"), a public entity, was authorized to issue such vouchers. Because only the SZEP cards and the Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers - contrary to the vouchers issued by CD Hungary - benefited from lower tax rates, CD Hungary's services grew increasingly unappealing to employers.6\n\nMemorial, paras. 163-168; Counter-Memorial, paras. 60-84.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants initiated discussions with the government of Hungary and sought political and diplomatic assistance from their home government. They also initiated legal actions at the EU level. However, they were unsuccessful in convincing the Respondent to amend the voucher regulations. CD Hungary's market share and revenues plummeted, leading to the layoff of all but one employee and the cessation of operations in 2013.7\n\nMemorial, paras. 169-213.\n\n12.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent's aforementioned reforms resulted in the expropriation of their investment in Hungary and breached the Respondent's obligation to treat their investment fairly and equitably, thus beaching both Article 5(2) and Article 3 of the Treaty.8\n\nMemorial, paras. 240 *et seq*.\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the reforms were a response to the global financial crisis and, more generally, that they had to address various shortcomings with the voucher system.9 In addition, as stated in section IV below, the Respondent contends that Hungary's consent to ICSID jurisdiction under Article 9(2) of the Treaty is limited to dispossession measures, and rejects the Claimants' theory according to which the dispute resolution clauses under the Hungary-Croatia BIT and the Hungary-Lithuanian BIT - which allow the submission of any dispute to ICSID jurisdiction and are therefore broader than Article 9(2) of the Treaty - could apply to this dispute by virtue of the most-favoured-nation clause contained in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 48-59.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 3 December 2013, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from Le Cheque D\u00e9jeuner and C.D Holding Internationale against Hungary (the \"***Request***\" or \"***RfA***\").\n\n15.\n\nOn 23 December 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of 29 January 2014, the Claimants noted that in paragraph 120 of the Request, the Respondent was given 10 days from the date of registration to agree with the Claimants' proposed method of constitution. In the absence of a response from the Respondent, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, with one arbitrator appointed by each Party, and a President appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of 18 February 2014, the Respondent noted that it was in the process of engaging counsel and would revert on its proposed method of constitution within the 60-day period following registration.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of 24 February 2014, the Claimants noted that the 60-day period had expired, and requested that constitution proceed under Article 37(2)(b).\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of 26 February 2014, the Claimants appointed The Honourable L. Yves Fortier, PC CC OQ QC (Canadian) as arbitrator, and proposed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 6 March 2014, ICSID notified the Parties of The Honourable L. Yves Fortier's acceptance of his appointment.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter of 28 March 2014, the Respondent appointed Sir Daniel Bethlehem, KCMG QC (British) as arbitrator.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter of 1 April 2014, ICSID notified the Parties of Sir Daniel Bethlehem's acceptance of his appointment.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of 8 April 2014, the Parties informed ICSID that they had agreed to appoint the President within 30 days of the date of the letter.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 8 May 2014, the Parties conveyed their agreement to postpone the deadline for appointment of the President to 16 May 2014.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter of 22 May 2014 from the Respondent, and by email of the same date from the Claimants, the Parties informed ICSID of their agreement to appoint Professor Kaufmann-Kohler as President.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of 6 June 2014, ICSID informed the Parties that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was unable to accept her appointment.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter of 16 June 2014, the Parties informed ICSID of their agreement to appoint Professor Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel (German), but requested that prior to seeking his acceptance, ICSID provide a shortlist of potential candidates for the role of President.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter of 20 June 2014, ICSID proposed a list of five candidates for President, and informed the Parties that if they were unable to reach an agreement within five days of the date of the letter, ICSID would proceed to seek Professor Bockstiegel's acceptance under ICSID Arbitration Rule 5(2).\n\n29.\n\nBy email of 25 June 2014, the Parties informed ICSID of their agreement to proceed with the appointment of Professor Bockstiegel. ICSID sought Professor Bockstiegel's acceptance by letter of the same date.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of 30 June 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"***Arbitration Rules***\") notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Benjamin Garel, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n31.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with representatives of the Parties was held in Washington, D.C. on 12 September 2014. During that conference, the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that they had no objection to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal.\n\n32.\n\nAlso at the first session, it was agreed that this arbitration would be conducted in English and that it would proceed in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006. The Tribunal discussed with the Parties a previously circulated provisional agenda and draft procedural order, and established by agreement a timetable for this proceeding that formed Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n33.\n\nOn 8 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n34.\n\nPursuant to the timetable established at the first session and included as Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1, on 19 January 2015, the Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits accompanied by the witness statements of Benedek D\u00e9r, M\u00e1rta Nagy and Yvon Legrand, and the expert report of FTI authored by Anthony Charlton.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter of 2 June 2015, the Respondent informed ICSID of the Parties agreement to modify the procedural calendar, subject to the Tribunal's approval. By email of 10 June 2015, the Claimants confirmed their acceptance of the proposed modifications.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter of 12 June 2015, ICSID transmitted the amended timetable, as reviewed and revised by the Tribunal, to the Parties.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter of 1 July 2015, the Respondent requested a one-week extension to file its Counter-Memorial and accompanying documents.\n\n38.\n\nBy letter of 3 July 2015, the Claimants objected to the Respondent's requested extension.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter of 7 July 2015, ICSID informed the Parties that the Tribunal granted an extension to the Respondent to file its submission, and similarly granted an equivalent extension to the Claimants to file their next submission.\n\n40.\n\nOn 17 July 2015, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and objections to jurisdiction, along with witness statements of Krist\u00f3f Szatm\u00e1ry and Zult\u00e1n Guller, and the expert report of Navigant Consulting authored by Brent Kaczmarek and Kiran Sequiera. On the same date, the Respondent requested that the proceedings be bifurcated and that Hungary's jurisdictional objections be decided before the Tribunal considered the merits of the Claimants' allegations.\n\n41.\n\nOn 23 October 2015, the Claimants filed a Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction and Response to Request for Bifurcation. On the same date, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Francisco Abriani, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Benjamin Garel as Secretary of the Tribunal in this proceeding.\n\n42.\n\nOn 12 November 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, by which it decided that the proceedings would be bifurcated and the Tribunal's jurisdiction would be determined as a preliminary issue. A hearing in London was therefore scheduled for 13 January and the morning of 14 January 2016.\n\n43.\n\nOn 2 December 2015, the Claimants submitted an email recording their agreement with the Respondent as to the procedure to be followed in the event that either Party wished to submit any additional documents prior to the hearing on jurisdiction, and attaching a draft hearing timetable also agreed with the Respondent. On the same date, the Respondent confirmed the Parties' agreement as recorded in the Claimants' email.\n\n44.\n\nBy email of 4 December 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it agreed with their proposal regarding the hearing timetable and the procedure for the submission of new documents.\n\n45.\n\nBy letter of 7 December 2015, the Respondent submitted an application for leave to produce additional documents in relation to its argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimants' non-expropriation claims.\n\n46.\n\nBy letter of 9 December 2015, the Claimants requested that the Respondent's application for leave to produce new documents be denied.\n\n47.\n\nBy letter of 13 December 2015, the Tribunal decided to give permission for the documents proposed by the Respondent to be introduced at this stage of the proceedings, and invited the Claimants to submit comments regarding those documents either in writing within one week or orally at the hearing. In the same letter, the Tribunal also granted permission to the Claimants, on application, to introduce any fresh documents of their own that may be responsive to the issues of interpretation raised by the new documents introduced by the Respondent.\n\n48.\n\nOn 15 December 2015, the Respondent submitted, by email, four new documents labelled RL-0129, RL-0130, RL-0131 and RL-0132, pursuant to the Tribunal's decision of 13 December 2015.\n\n49.\n\nBy letters of 23 December 2015, the Claimants and the Respondent submitted their respective Requests for Production of Documents pursuant to section 15.6 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n50.\n\nOn 13 and 14 January 2015, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction with the Parties at the International Dispute Resolution Centre (IDRC) in London, United Kingdom. Present at the hearing were:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal* :\n\n\u2022 Professor Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, President of the Tribunal  \n\u2022 The Honourable Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC, Arbitrator  \n\u2022 Sir Daniel Bethlehem KCMG QC, Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat* :\n\n\u2022 Mr. Francisco Abriani, Legal Counsel, ICSID\n\n*For the Claimants* :\n\n\u2022 Ms. Isabelle Michou, Herbert Smith Freehills LLP  \n\u2022 Mr. Laurence Shore, Herbert Smith Freehills LLP  \n\u2022 Mr. Peter Archer, Herbert Smith Freehills LLP  \n\u2022 Ms. Lisa Stefani, Herbert Smith Freehills LLP  \n\u2022 Ms. Dora Tamas, Herbert Smith Freehills LLP  \n\u2022 Ms. Elizaveta Tukhsanova, Senior Legal Counsel\n\n*For the Respondent* :\n\n\u2022 Ms. Kiera Gans, DLA Piper LLP (US)  \n\u2022 Mr. Stanley McDermott, DLA Piper LLP (US)  \n\u2022 Ms. Natasha Kanerva, DLA Piper LLP (US)  \n\u2022 Mr. Andr\u00e1s Nemescs\u00f3i, HORV\u00c1TH & PARTNERS DLA PIPER  \n\u2022 Mr. David Kohegyi, HORV\u00c1TH & PARTNERS DLA PIPER  \n\u2022 Ms. Zsofia Deli, HORV\u00c1TH & PARTNERS DLA PIPER  \n\u2022 Ms. Viktoria Perenyi, Sarhegyi and Partners Law Firm  \n\u2022 Mr. Gergely Riszter, Baker and McKenzie Budapest\n\n*Court Reporter*\n\n\u2022 Mr. Trevor McGowan\n\n51.\n\nOn 19 January 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, requesting the Parties to submit their corrections to the hearing transcript by 22 January 2016, and submit their Post-Hearing Briefs, together with a bundle containing the full text of all Hungary's BITs and a table listing those BITs,10 by 5 February 2016. In the same Order, the Tribunal requested that the Parties' Post-Hearing Briefs contain the following:\n\n\"2.1.1 Any comments they have regarding issues raised at the Hearing;\n\n2.1.2. In separate sections of the brief, any comments the Parties have regarding the following questions, which are without prejudice to any issues that the Tribunal considers relevant for its final decision:\n\nFor the Claimants:\n\na) Claimants indicated that there were reasons why they were relying on the Hungary-Lithuania and Croatia-Hungary BITs, implying that their provisions were most favorable for Claimants. Why, specifically, are Claimants relying on these two BITs? Are there any other specific Hungary BITs that Claimants rely upon? If so, for what reasons?\n\nFor both Parties:\n\nb) Is the right to pursue dispute settlement proceedings in the France-Hungary BIT / in any BIT a self-standing right, independent of any of the other provisions of the treaty, or is it a right that is ancillary to a substantive right set out elsewhere in the treaty?\n\nc) If it is an ancillary right, does this have any implication for Claimants' reliance on the Hungary-Lithuania and Croatia-Hungary BITs to found the right to pursue arbitration in respect of its FET claims?\n\nd) On the assumption, *arguendo*, that an MFN clause in a BIT could operate to import into the treaty a dispute settlement clause from another BIT, are there any limitations on what elements of the dispute settlement modalities can be imported?\n\n2.1.3 Any further comments the Parties have regarding the allocation of costs.\"11\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, paragraph 2.2, which provided the guidelines for preparing the requested table.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, paragraphs 2.1.2 and 2.1.3.\n\n52.\n\nOn 22 January 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, containing the Tribunal's decisions on the Parties' document production requests, and ordering the Parties to produce the relevant documents by 12 February 2016.\n\n53.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Parties submitted their respective Post-Hearing Briefs.\n\n54.\n\nOn 8 February 2016, the Claimants submitted a link allowing access to the electronic copies of Hungary's BITs, and informed the Tribunal that the Parties were still working on the table requested at paragraph 2.2 of Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n55.\n\nOn 11 February 2016, the Parties submitted emails recording their agreement to postpone the deadline for the production of documents until 19 February 2016. On the same date, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were still in the process of finalizing the table referred to at paragraph 2.2 of Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n56.\n\nOn 16 February 2016, the Parties were informed that the Members of the Tribunal had no objections to the Parties' agreement to postpone the deadline for the production of documents until 19 February 2016.\n\n57.\n\nOn the same date, the Parties submitted a table listing all Hungary's BITs pursuant to Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' requests on the merits**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nIn their Memorial on the Merits, the Claimants requested the Tribunal as follows:\n\n\u2022 To find that Hungary expropriated LCD and CD Internationale of their investment in Hungary within the meaning of Article 5(2) of the Treaty;\n\n\u2022 To find that the statutory and regulatory reforms of fringe benefit vouchers launched in April 2011 are contrary to the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment given by Hungary, and thereby breach Article 3 of the Treaty;\n\n\u2022 To award compensation to LCD and CD Internationale for their entire loss in the amount of \u20ac31,163,000 plus compound interest subject to adjustment until the date of payment; and\n\n\u2022 To order Hungary to pay all costs, expenditures and fees in respect of the arbitration proceedings including legal fees incurred by LCD and CD Internationale.12\n\nMemorial, para. 419.\n\n**B. The Respondent's requests on preliminary issues and the merits**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent requested the Tribunal as follows:\n\n\u2022 To decline jurisdiction over this dispute with respect to Claimants' claims under Article 3 of the Treaty due to the absence of Respondent's consent to ICSID jurisdiction over such claims;\n\n\u2022 To dismiss all Claimants' claims under Article 5(2) of the Treaty;\n\n\u2022 In the event that the Tribunal determined that it has jurisdiction over the claim under Article 3, to dismiss those claims in their entirety; and\n\n\u2022 To award Hungary all of the costs and expenses incurred in these proceedings, including attorney's fees.13\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 307.\n\n**C. The Claimants' requests regarding preliminary issues**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nIn its Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction and Response to Request for Bifurcation, the Claimants requested the Tribunal as follows:\n\n\u2022 To reject the Respondent's jurisdictional objections in their entirety;\n\n\u2022 To decide that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute including all the Claimants' claims under the Treaty;\n\n\u2022 To order the Respondent to pay the Claimants' costs, including legal fees, incurred as a result of any eventual bifurcation of these proceedings;\n\n\u2022 To take all necessary steps for the continuation of the arbitration towards the liability and quantum phases; and\n\n\u2022 To grant the relief sought by the Claimants on the merits of their claims.14\n\nClaimants' Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction and Response to Request for Bifurcation (the \"***Reply***\"), para. 162.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION IN PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 2**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal decided that the proceedings should be bifurcated and that the Tribunal's jurisdiction over claims of the Claimants relating to Article 3 of the BIT should be determined as a preliminary issue. The Tribunal also determined that a hearing on the preliminary issue should be held in London starting in the morning of 13 January and ending by 12:30 hours on 14 January 2016.15\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, dated 12 November 2015.\n\n62.\n\nAs explained at paragraph 44 above, on 4 December 2015 the Tribunal informed the Parties that it agreed with the hearing timetable proposed by the Parties on 2 December 2015.\n\n**V. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE PRELIMINARY ISSUES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Hungary did not consent to the arbitration of any claims other than those for alleged breaches of Article 5(2) of the Treaty, which concerns dispossession measures.16 Furthermore, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants' \"reliance on the MFN clause is hopeless because MFN clauses cannot extend a tribunal's jurisdiction to hear claims that have been expressly excluded by the applicable treaty, as is the case here.\"17\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 105.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 106.\n\n**1. The plain wording of Article 9(2) of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Respondent notes that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention limits this Tribunal's jurisdiction to only those disputes that the Parties have consented in writing to submit to ICSID.18 According to the Respondent, it is also well-accepted that consent must be explicit and unambiguous, and cannot be inferred or presumed.19 The Respondent stresses that \"host States are free to restrict their consent as they wish, including or excluding certain types of disputes, or creating any necessary conditions precedents thereto, and it is for arbitral tribunals to respect rather than flout such limitations to their jurisdiction.\"20\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 108.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 109; and Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 3 and 6.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 109.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that where consent is provided in the form of a treaty, any expression of consent must be interpreted in a manner consistent with traditional canons of interpretation, specifically those established in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"***Vienna Convention***\" or \"***VCLT***\").21\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 110.\n\n65.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Hungary's consent to arbitration in the Treaty is expressly limited to a specific sub-category of disputes.22 The Respondent asserts that the plain wording of Article 9(2) leads to the conclusion that the Contracting Parties' consent to ICSID jurisdiction is limited exclusively to disputes related to dispossession measures allegedly in violation of Article 5(2) of the Treaty.23 In the Respondent's view, the Contracting Parties' derogation of sovereignty for cases involving purported expropriations is an exception to the rule that all other disputes between foreign investors and a Contracting State be resolved by domestic remedies.24\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 111.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 112-113; and Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 5. Article 9(2) of the Treaty provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"However, disputes concerning dispossession measures as provided for in article 5, paragraph 2, particularly those relating to compensation, its amount, conditions of payment and interests to be paid in the case of delayed payment, shall be settled under the following conditions:\n\nIf any such dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months... it shall... be submitted for arbitration...\n\nWhen each Contracting Party shall have become party to the [ICSID Convention], it... shall be submitted for arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\" (RL-0079)\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 112.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that similarly worded clauses have been interpreted in the same way by other arbitral tribunals.25 In support of its proposition, the Respondent cites several arbitral decisions and awards, including those rendered in *Emmis International Holding B.V. and others v. Hungary* (which involved the interpretation of the Hungary-Netherlands and the Hungary-Switzerland BITs),26*Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v. The Republic of Hungary* (which involved the Hungary-Norway BIT),27*Accession Mezzanine v. Hungary* (concerning the UK-Hungary BIT),28 and *Les Laboratoires Servier and others v. Poland* (which involved the France-Poland BIT).29\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 113-118.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 114.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 115.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 116.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 117.\n\n**2. Supplementary means of interpretation**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, supplementary sources of interpretation confirm that the parties intended that their consent be limited to disputes involving claims of dispossession.30\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 119.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the following statement made in 1987 by Mr. Pierre Raynal, France's former rapporteur of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, before the French National Assembly regarding the scope of the arbitration clause in the BIT:\n\n\"Generally, arbitration is applicable to all clauses of investment treaties. Here, this is limited to disputes related to dispossession measures, the other disputes fall within the scope of internal jurisdiction. This special feature is limited in the practice, as only disputes related to a dispossession justify the cost of an international arbitration proceeding.\"31\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 120. See also Preparatory work of the General Assembly of the Government of France (full protocol dated June 15, 1987) and Act No. 87-552 of 10 July 1987, Official Journal of the Government of France, at 2379 (RL-0103). The original French version reads as follows:\n\n\"Habituellement, l'arbitrage porte sur toutes les clauses des accords d'investissements. Ici, il est limit\u00e9 aux diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux mesures de d\u00e9possession, les autres litiges relevant des voies de recours internes. Cette particularit\u00e9 est d'une port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e en pratique, car seuls les diff\u00e9rends ayant trait \u00e0 une d\u00e9possession justifient le cout d'une proc\u00e9dure d'arbitrage international.\"\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on the following statement made in 1987 by France's Secretary of State before the National Assembly:\n\n\"Furthermore, only those lawsuits may be submitted to international arbitration, which concern dispossession measures, not all of the lawsuits that may arise between the investor and the hosting country. This phrase is the consequence of the reluctance of the Hungarian People's Republic to accept recourse to international arbitration.\"32\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 121. See also Preparatory work of the General Assembly of the Government of France (full protocol dated June 15, 1987) and Act No. 87-552 of 10 July 1987 Official Journal of the Government of France, at 2379 (RL-0103). The original French version reads as follows:\n\n\"En outre, peuvent seuls etre soumis \u00e0 l'arbitrage international les litiges relatifs aux mesures de d\u00e9possession et non pas l'ensemble des litiges pouvant surgir entre un investisseur et l'Etat d'accueil. Cette formule est li\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9ticence de la R\u00e9publique populaire de Hongrie \u00e0 accepter le recours \u00e0 l'arbitrage international.\"\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent refers also to the following extract from a report by the Hungarian Ministry of Finance from 1986:\n\n\"The disputes between the investor and the host country relating to expropriation or nationalization of investment, in the absence of an amicable settlement, are subject to arbitration....\n\nThus, the Hungarians were successful in convincing the French that the investor may only seek the competence of the arbitration court against the Hungarian State in cases of expropriation or nationalization.\"33\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 122. See also Report on the negotiations relating to the Hungarian-French investment protection agreement, prepared by the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of Hungary on 7 July 1986 (RL-0092). The original Hungarian version reads as follows:\n\n\"A beruh\u00e1z\u00f3 \u00e9s a fogad\u00f3 \u00e1llam kozott a beruh\u00e1z\u00e1s kisaj\u00e1tit\u00e1s\u00e1val vagy \u00e1llamosit\u00e1s\u00e1val kapcsolatos vit\u00e1k, a felek kozotti b\u00e9k\u00e9s rendez\u00e9s hi\u00e1ny\u00e1ban, v\u00e1lasztottbir\u00f3s\u00e1gi utra tartoznak....

In the Respondent's view, this proves that the arbitration agreement is found only in Article 9(2) and not also in Article 4(1).36 The Respondent highlights the absence of \"any affirmative evidence that Hungary and France agreed to submit (or intended to submit in the future) non-expropriation claims to arbitration, or... that the Contracting Parties intended Article 4(1) to convey their intent to arbitrate any dispute arising by operation of the MFN clause.\"37 In the Respondent's view, the following passage of the Memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides the opposite:\n\n\"arbitration procedures are generally applicable to all clauses of the agreement. In this case, it is limited to disputes regarding dispossession measures.\"38\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 12.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 13.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 13; Memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding the Agreement with Hungary on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, Negotiations of July 1-2, Paris, dated 8 July 1986, RL-0130.\n\n**3. The scope of Article 4(1) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants \"cannot use the MFN clause to subvert the will of the contracting parties to the BIT and expand the jurisdictional threshold of this Tribunal.\"39\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 129.\n\n75.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, \"there is ample authority holding that the MFN clause cannot be used to expand the mandate of the tribunal to decide claims expressly excluded by the BIT\".40 The Respondent relies on the decision on jurisdiction rendered in *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, and on the award rendered in *Telenor v. Hungary*.41 The Respondent further argues that \"[t]ribunals in *Vladimir Berschader and Moise Berschader v. The Russian Federation, Salini Construttori S.p.A. v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan*, *Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru*, *Renta 4 SVSA et al. v. The Russian Federation*, and *Austrian Airlines v. The Slovak Republic*, all declined to utilize the MFN clause to extend the dispute resolution provision as the Claimant seeks to do here\".42\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 130.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 131-132.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 135.\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent draws a distinction \"between application of the MFN clause to 'substantive' obligations versus those provisions relating to 'jurisdiction'.\"43 In this regard, it relies on the following commentary by Zachary Douglas:\n\n\"Substantive obligations of investment protection are addressed to the contracting state parties.... The provisions conferring adjudicative power upon an international tribunal are addressed to that judicial organ once constituted and to the parties to the dispute that has been submitted to that judicial organ. Those disputing parties are not the contracting state parties to the investment treaty but the investor and the host state, which enter into a relationship of procedural equality before the international tribunal once a dispute has been submitted to it. In the context of adjudicating a dispute between an investor and the host state, how can it make sense for one disputing party to receive 'MFN' treatment from the other disputing party in respect of the rules for adjudicating the dispute? The whole purpose of the equality of arms principle in international litigation is to ensure that the parties are treated the same. The equality of arms principle is not respected if one of the parties has the ability to adjust the rules relating to the jurisdiction of the tribunal or some other aspect of the procedure after a dispute has arisen.\n\nOne might also ask how a respondent state is expected to accord MFN treatment in relation to the jurisdictional mandate of the tribunal? Once a dispute with the investor has arisen, the only way for a respondent state to provide an investor that 'treatment' would be to waive any jurisdictional objections it may have upon receipt of the investor's request for arbitration. Hence the *Maffezini* doctrine requires the respondent state to capitulate in respect of the investor's demands concerning the adjudication of a specific dispute. That is hardly consistent with the principle of procedural equality.\"44\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 133.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 133. See also Zachary Douglas, *The MFN Clause in Investment Arbitration: Treaty Interpretation Off the Rails*, 2 J. Int'l. Disp. Settlement, No. 1, 2011, 97, 104 (RL-0095).\n\n77.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, to ignore this distinction is to \"impermissibly privilege the rights of investors over those of host States.\"45\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 133.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on *Sanum v. Laos*. It asserts that the tribunal in that case \"explained that to read into the treaty a dispute settlement provision to cover all protections under the treaty by virtue of the MFN clause when a treaty itself provides for very limited access to international arbitration would result in a substantial re-write of the treaty and an extension of the State parties' consent to arbitration beyond what may be assumed to have been their intention.\"46\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 134; *Sanum Investments Limited v. The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic*, PCA Case No. 2013-13, Award on Jurisdiction (December 13, 2013) (\"***Sanum***\") (RL-0060).\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent further refers to the award on jurisdiction rendered in *RosInvest v. Russia*. It notes that the relevance of that decision in the instant case is \"highly doubtful in light of the *RosInvest* tribunal's explicit caution against any general application of its reasoning.\"47 It also notes that \"the tribunal's ruling that extended the application of the MFN clause to arbitration was only based on the reading of the specific MFN clause found in Article 3(2) of the UK-Soviet bilateral investment treaty\", which \"explicitly extended MFN protection not only to investments but also to investors.\"48 The Respondent asserts that the treaty language at issue in *RosInvest* \"markedly differs\" from the treaty language at issue in this case, \"which only affords most favored nation 'treatment' to investors 'in respect of their investments'.\"49 The Respondent finally asserts that \"it is informative that, when interpreting Article 3(1) of the UK-Soviet bilateral investment treaty, which unlike Article 3(2), only afforded MFN protection to investments and not investors, the tribunal refused to permit the investor to import a clause regarding arbitration of a claim.\"50\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 136.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 136.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 136.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 136.\n\n80.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' assertion that the MFN clause applies to extend access to arbitration must fail. In its view, \"[a]s Hungary did not consent to arbitration of claims other than expropriation, Non-Expropriation Claims must be dismissed.\"51\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 137.\n\n81.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent contends that the arbitration agreement \"must only be found in the Hungary-France BIT, not in the Hungary-Lithuania and Hungary-Croatia BITs\". It asserts that the only arbitration agreement concerning investor claims is that in Article 9(2) of the Treaty, and that Article 4 says nothing about arbitration. In its view, \"[i]t is not sufficient that exceedingly broad terms such as 'activities' and 'treatment' in Article 4(1) might possibly be read to include dispute resolution.\"52 According to the Respondent, \"if the MFN clause in the Hungary-France BIT is to be the channel by which the Claimants can take advantage of the dispute settlement provisions in the Hungary-Lithuania and Hungary-Croatia BITs, then the MFN clause must explicitly convey Hungary's and France's consent to arbitrate claims that would be cognizable on account of the MFN clause\".53 The Respondent argues that this is not the case.54\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 6.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 4.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 5.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts that its interpretation \"in no way deprives the MFN clause of force and effect\", as \"[a]n MFN clause (like that in Article 4) will still operate to extend and expand the substantive rights afforded by those provisions of the treaty like fair and equitable treatment and dispossession clauses that grant substantive rights.\"55\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 8.\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimants \"will simply have to pursue nonexpropriation claims in national courts and dispossession claims in arbitration (if it chooses to do so). There is nothing untoward or unfair about this dichotomy.\"56\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 8.\n\n**B. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Article 4(1) of the Treaty forms part of the agreement between the contracting States and, like the other terms of the Treaty, must be interpreted in accordance with its \"ordinary meaning\", in \"context\" and in light of the Treaty's \"object and purpose\".57\n\nReply, para. 7.\n\n85.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the Respondent's consent to international arbitration of \"any dispute\" with Lithuanian or Croatian investors constituted (and constitutes) more favourable treatment, and this treatment was automatically accorded to the Claimants by virtue of the MFN provisions contained in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.58 On this basis, the Claimants assert that the Tribunal's jurisdiction includes disputes concerning the Respondent's breach of its obligation to accord the Claimants' investments fair and equitable treatment under Article 3 of the Treaty, and is not limited to the Respondent's breach of its obligations concerning expropriation under Article 5(2).59\n\nReply, paras. 9, 92 and 146-152.\n\nReply, paras. 9 and 153-156.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's submission ignores the text of the Treaty (particularly Article 4(1)). They also asserts that the Respondent's reliance on \"authority\" is flawed because such \"authority\" is not supportive of its position, is not binding on the Tribunal, is not relevant to the analysis required by the Vienna Convention, and cannot be determinative here given the primacy of the text under the Vienna Convention.60 Moreover, the Respondent's reliance on \"authority\" seeks to alter the bargain struck by the two States, which includes \"a mechanism, located in the promise of MFN treatment... that ensures that the BIT continues to reflect each State's policy towards foreign investors.\"61\n\nReply, para. 10.\n\nReply, para. 11.\n\n**1. The meaning of Article 9(2) of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimants agree that Article 9(2) of the Treaty constitutes the Parties' consent to submit disputes over expropriation claims to the Centre.62 The Claimants reject, however, that the effect of Article 9(2) is to limit the Respondent's consent to arbitration to \"cases involving purported expropriations\".63 The Claimants note that Article 9(2) is not the only relevant provision of the Treaty, and assert that the Respondent ignores the promise to grant the Claimants MFN treatment contained in Article 4(1).64 In the Claimants' view, this provision has the effect of importing the more favourable dispute resolution provisions contained in the Respondent's bilateral investment treaties with Lithuania or Croatia into the Treaty.65\n\nReply, para. 29.\n\nReply, para. 30.\n\nReply, para. 30.\n\nReply, para. 31.\n\n**2. The scope of Article 4(1) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Hungary's obligation to provide MFN treatment**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Treaty is intended to \"create favorable conditions for French investments in Hungary and Hungarian investments in France\". They argue that the Treaty does this by granting investors a range of protections such as the right to fair and equitable treatment, the prohibition of unlawful expropriations and the possibility of settling investor-state disputes through ICSID arbitration.66 The Claimants note that under Article 4(1) of the Treaty Hungary has also undertaken to grant French investors MFN treatment.67\n\nReply, para. 36.\n\nReply, paras 37-39\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the MFN treatment is a means of providing for nondiscrimination between one State and other States or their respective investors. The result is that the beneficiary State or its investors will always be entitled to any more favourable treatment granted to a third State or its investors.68\n\nReply, paras. 40-42. The Claimants rely on the following commentary of the most favored nation standard by Georg Schwarzenberger:\n\n\"[T]he functions of the m.f.n. standard may be described as the elimination of discrimination, the correction of oversights and the adaptation of treaties to changing circumstances. The indefiniteness and elasticity of the standard and the automatic nature of its operation are characteristics of the standard which have made possible the continuity and universality of its application.\" (CLA-0116)\n\nThe Claimants also rely on the following extract from the 1978 Draft Articles on most-favored-nation clauses:\n\n\"Most-favoured-nation treatment is treatment accorded by the granting State to the beneficiary State, or to persons or things in a determined relationship with that State, not less favourable than treatment extended by the granting State to a third State or to persons or things in the same relationship with that third State.\" (CLA-0117)\n\n90.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Article 4(1) of the Treaty thus promises French investors treatment which is no less favourable than that guaranteed by Hungary to investors of any third State.69 The Claimants affirm that the scope of the MFN clause is subject to only one limitation, namely that treatment granted under the comparator treaty concern the same matter (*ejusdem generis*) as that covered by the MFN clauses.70\n\nReply, para. 43.\n\nReply, paras. 44 and 46. The Claimants rely on the following commentary by the International Law Commission to the 1978 \"Draft Articles on Most-Favoured Nation Clauses\":\n\n\"[A] clause conferring most-favoured-nation rights in respect of a certain matter, or class of matter, can attract the rights conferred by other treaties (or unilateral acts) only in regard to the same matter or class of matter. (...) For instance, if the most-favourednation clause promises most-favoured-nation treatment solely for fish, such treatment cannot be claimed under the same clause for meat.\" (CLA-0117)\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the beneficiary's entitlement to MFN treatment is immediate,71 and that it applies to both substantive and procedural rights, including the resolution of disputes.72 In relation to the effect of MFN clauses on consent to international arbitration, the Claimants rely on the following commentary by Stephan Schill:\n\n\"The underlying mechanism is thus one of automatic extension of the substance of the more favourable treatment (...). This means that the beneficiary under the basic treaty can rely on the more favourable treatment *ipso iure* without any additional act of transformation. (...) An investor covered by a BIT with an MFN clause therefore can immediately invoke the benefits granted to third-party nationals by another BIT of the host State; henceforth they govern as the relevant treatment imported by the MFN clause its relations with the host State. The technical effect of an MFN clauses [sic], provided that its scope applies to more favourable consent to arbitration, then is that the investor covered by the basic treaty can accept a more favorable offer to arbitrate made by the host State vis-a-vis investors covered under a different BIT.\"73\n\nReply, para. 47.\n\nReply, paras. 46 and 48.\n\nReply, para. 48; Stephan W. Schill, \"Allocating Adjudicatory Authority: Most-Favoured-Nation Clauses as a Basis of Jurisdiction - A Reply to Zachary Douglas\", Journal of International Dispute Management, Vol. 2, No. 2 (2011).\n\n92.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, MFN provisions ensure that the BIT continues to reflect each State's policy towards foreign investors. In this respect, the Claimants argue that Hungary's policy with respect to international arbitration has evolved, explaining that in the early 1990s Hungary began to accept wider dispute resolution clauses than those accepted in the Treaty and in other bilateral investment treaties concluded earlier.74 The Claimants invoke Hungary's bilateral investment treaties with the Czech Republic, Croatia and Lithuania as examples of such evolution.75\n\nReply, para. 49. *Szerz\u00f3d\u00e9s a Magyar N\u00e9pkozt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g \u00e9s a N\u00e9met Szovets\u00e9gi Kozt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g kozott a beruh\u00e1z\u00e1sok el\u00f3seg\u00edt\u00e9s\u00e9r\u00f3l \u00e9s kolcsonos v\u00e9delm\u00e9r\u00f3l* (Treaty Between the Hungarian People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments), signed 30 April 1986, in force as of 7 November 1987, CLA-0123; *Accord entre l'Union \u00e9conomique belgo-luxembourgeoise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Populaire Hongroise concernant l'encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements* (Agreement between the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union and the Government of the People's Republic of Hungary on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 14 May 1986, in force as of 23 September 1988, CLA-0124; *Agreement between the Czech Republic and the Republic of Hungary for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments*, signed 14 January 1993, in force as of 25 May 1995, CLA-0125; *Agreement between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Hungary for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments*, signed 15 May 1996, in force as of 1 March 2002, CLA-0005; and *Agreement between the Republic of Lithuania and the Republic of Hungary for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments*, signed 25 May 1999, in force as of 20 May 2003, CLA-0006.\n\nReply, para. 50.\n\n**b. MFN treatment and dispute settlement**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Canons of interpretation**\n--------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the scope of the MFN clause \"is not a matter of 'authority'\" but rather one that \"depends upon the wording of the relevant instrument(s)\".76 According to the Claimants, \"in principle MFN provisions are capable of applying to the dispute settlement provisions of BITs,\"77 and there is no general answer to the question as to whether the MFN clause applies to dispute settlement provisions. In the Claimants' view, the relevant consideration is the text of the provisions under consideration.78 The Claimants rely on the International Law Commission's statement that \"the 'question... is truly one of treaty interpretation that can be answered only in respect of each particular case.'\"79\n\nReply, para. 53.\n\nReply, para. 54.

More precisely, the Claimants argue that \"the crucial elements of the interpretative exercise in this instance are Articles 31(1) and 31(2)\", as there has been no suggestion that any of the specific considerations under Article 31(3) are relevant to the interpretation of Article 4(1) of the BIT and the Respondent has not submitted that the contracting States intended to give a \"special meaning\" to any of its terms.80 In the Claimants' view, \"Articles 31(3) and 31(4) of the VCLT, therefore, are relevant only to the extent that Article 4(1) uses the terms defined in the BIT (such as 'investor' or 'investment').\"81\n\nReply, para. 59.\n\nReply, para. 59.\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the focus on the text \"underpins the VCLT's general rule\".82 The Claimants also contend that \"a States' consent to arbitration is not to be construed narrowly\".83 According to the Claimants, contrary to the decisions in *Plama v. Bulgaria*, *Telenor v. Hungary*, and *Berschader v.

See also \"Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with commentaries,\" Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Volume II (1966), commentary on Articles 27 and 28, para. 18:\n\n\"The Commission's approach to treaty interpretation was on the basis that the text of the treaty must be presumed to be the authentic expression of the intentions of the parties, and that the elucidation of the meaning of the text rather than an investigation ab initio of the supposed intentions of the parties constitutes the object of interpretation.\"\n\nReply, para. 62.\n\nReply, para. 63. See *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 May 2006, (\"***Suez***\") CLA-0119, para. 64. In support of this assertion, the Claimants rely on the following passage of the decision in *Amco Asia Corp. (U.S.) and others v. Republic of Indonesia, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983 (\"***Amco***\"):\n\n\"Like any other conventions (\u2026), a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties: such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle *pacta sunt servanda*, a principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law.\" (CLA-0133, para. 14)\n\nThe Claimants also seek support for their proposition in the Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in the *Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America)* case, which reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"It is clear from the jurisprudence of the Permanent Court and of the International Court that there is no rule that requires a restrictive interpretation of compromissory clauses. But equally, there is no evidence that the various exercises of jurisdiction by the two Courts really indicate a jurisdictional presumption in favour of the plaintiff. (\u2026) The Court has no judicial policy of being either liberal or strict in deciding the scope of compromissory clauses: they are judicial decisions like any other.\" (CLA-0134, para. 35)\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimants affirm that the primacy of the text \"explains the '[s]upplementary' role accorded to Article 32\" of the Vienna Convention.85 In their view, in the present case the text of the Treaty suffices because Article 4(1) of the Treaty is clear and unambiguous, and the application of Article 31 leads to a result which is not manifestly absurd or unreasonable.86\n\nReply, paras. 65-67.\n\nReply, para. 69. In the same vein, the Claimants assert that \"even if 'supplementary means' of interpretation were available (which they are not), there would be no justification for resorting to them.\" (Reply, para. 69)\n\n97.\n\nThe Claimants further assert that the primacy of the text means that previous awards are of limited relevance and that the Tribunal is not bound by decisions of previous tribunals.87 The Claimants note that those past awards concern differently-worded treaties, concluded in different circumstances and between different States, and that therefore they cannot be determinative for a tribunal's decision in a particular case.88 For the Claimants, it is Article 4(1) of the Treaty that should guide the Tribunal, not the \"authority\" invoked by the Respondent.89\n\nReply, paras. 70-71.\n\nReply, para. 71.\n\nReply, para. 72.\n\n**(ii) The text of Article 4(1) of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent's argument that the application of Article 4(1) of the Treaty to the settlement of investment disputes would \"subvert the will of the contracting parties\" ignores the general rule of interpretation established by the Vienna Convention and overlooks that Article 4(1) is an integral part of the \"will of the contracting parties\" embodied in the Treaty.90\n\nReply, para. 73.\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimants note that Article 4(1) of the Treaty provides that \"[t]he MFN obligation is owed to 'investors (...) in respect of their investments and activities in connection with such investments'.\"91 The Claimants assert that international arbitration is clearly an activity in connection with investments, and \"treatment\" is wide enough to cover dispute settlement.92 In the Claimants' view, the MFN provision is formulated in extremely broad terms, and it is wide enough to cover the settlement of investment disputes.93\n\nReply, para. 78.\n\nReply, paras. 78-80. The Claimants rely on a number of decisions rendered by international tribunals, including *Renta 4 S.V.S.A. v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award, 21 June 2011, CLA-0136.\n\nReply, paras. 79-82.\n\n**(iii) The context of Article 4(1) of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants note that Article 4(3) and 4(4) of the Treaty imposes two limitations on the application of the MFN provisions in Article 4(1), and dispute resolution is not among them.94\n\nReply, paras. 84-85 and 94.\n\n101.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the contracting States considered which issues should be excluded from the MFN protection and they chose not to exclude dispute resolution from the scope of Article 4(1). The Claimants argue that there is no reason to assume that the contracting States forgot, or to imply a further restriction on the application of this clause.95\n\nReply, paras. 86 and 124.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that \"[t]he presence of 'specifically negotiated and deliberately narrowly tailored' dispute resolution provisions does not preclude their circumvention by 'means of a general MFN clause'.\"96 According to the Claimants, all the provisions in a treaty are specifically negotiated, including the MFN provision itself.97 Moreover, the Claimants argue that \"[b]y its very nature, the application of an MFN provision conflicts with, and overrides, the specifically-negotiated terms of the basic treaty in which it is found\".98\n\nReply, para. 88.\n\nReply, para. 88.\n\nReply, paras. 88-89 and 93. The Claimants seek support for their proposition in a number of authorities, including the following passage from the award on jurisdiction rendered in *RosInvest UK Ltd. v. Russian Federation*, Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce Case No. V 079 / 2005, Award on Jurisdiction, October 2007 (\"***RosInvest***\"):\n\n\"[T]his is a normal result of the application of MFN clauses, the very character and intention of which is that protection not accepted in one treaty is widened by transferring the protection accorded in another treaty.\" (CLA-0128, para. 131)\n\nThe Claimants also rely on the following passage of the Decision on the Objection to Jurisdiction in *Garanti Koza LLP v. Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/20, Decision on the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent, 3 July 2013:\n\n\"The MFN clause itself would be deprived of *effet utile* if it could never be used to override another provision of the treaty. Certainly, the principle of *ejusdem generis* restricts the application of an MFN clause to the displacement of clauses dealing with the same subject matter in other treaties of the same nature. But that principle is not offended by the use of an MFN clause to displace a provision from the dispute resolution article of one bilateral investment treaty with a corresponding provision from the dispute resolution article of another bilateral investment treaty signed by the same State.\" (CLA-0110, paras. 51 and 54)\n\n103.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent's position is erroneous because it overlooks that the interpreter's task is to ascertain the parties' agreement as embodied in the treaty, which in the instant case means a broad MFN clause that does not exclude dispute settlement.99 The Claimants also affirm that the Respondent's position is erroneous because it misunderstands the nature of the MFN mechanism.100\n\nReply, paras. 88-89.\n\nReply, para. 91. In making this statement, the Claimants' rely on the following passage of the award on preliminary objections rendered in the *Renta 4* case:\n\n\"It is not convincing for a State to argue in general terms that it accepted a particular 'system of arbitration' with respect to nationals of one country but did not so consent with respect to nationals of another. The extension of commitments is in the very nature of MFN clauses. Drafters wishing to do so would have little difficulty in defining restrictions that would go further than the general *esjudem* [sic] *generis* constraint. Some BITs exhaustively enumerate acceptable MFN extensions. Others explicitly exclude dispute resolution from the reach of MFN provisions. Absent such stipulations it is the task of international arbitral tribunals to determine whether arbitration clauses in comparator treaties in fact comport more favoured treatment.\" (RL-0055, para. 92)\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants further rely on the title and the preamble of the Treaty. They argue that the emphasis on the \"encouragement and protection\" of investments does not equate to \"a presumption that the investor is right\".101 In their view, while the preamble does not dictate the meaning of Article 4(1), the object and purpose of the Treaty should \"inform the determination of the 'ordinary meaning' of Article 4(1)\".102 They argue that in the instant case the preamble does confirm \"the breadth of the 'ordinary meaning' to be given to the terms of Article 4(1).\"103 The Claimants argue that international arbitration is an integral element of the encouragement and protection of investments.104\n\nReply, para. 99.\n\nReply, paras. 99-100.\n\nReply, paras. 99.\n\nReply, para. 99. In support of their proposition, the Claimants rely on the following decisions and awards: *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v.

The legal authorities invoked by the Respondent**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's refusal to engage with the language of the BIT's MFN provisions fatally undermines its case. Moreover, the Claimants contend that the Respondent compounds this error by misunderstanding and misrepresenting the nature and the relevance of the \"authority\" on which it relies.107\n\nReply, paras. 104-105.\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent's suggestion that there is a \"well-established line of authority\" establishing that Article 4(1) cannot apply to dispute settlement is incorrect, as the application of MFN provisions to dispute settlement is an unsettled area of investment law.108 The Claimants also explain that the Respondent's basic premise is flawed because the arbitration of claims under Article 3 is not \"expressly excluded\" by Article 9(2) of the Treaty.109 In their view, the arbitration of FET claims is not expressly provided for in Article 9(2), but the mechanism contained in Article 4(1) of the Treaty permits their arbitration if Hungary has agreed to arbitrate such claims with the investors of a third State. The Claimants argue that this condition has now been met.110\n\nReply, paras. 106-107.\n\nReply, paras 108-109; Counter-Memorial, para. 130.\n\nReply, para. 109.\n\n109.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that the awards in *Plama*, *Telenor*, *Berschader*, *Salini*, *Austrian Airlines* and *Tza Yap Shum*, on which the Respondent relies, are founded on a fundamental error of law.111 According to the Claimants, the decisions in *Plama*, *Telenor* and *Berschader* are founded on the presumption \"that a State's consent to arbitration is to be construed restrictively\" and that therefore an MFN provision does not incorporate settlement provisions in another treaty unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the contracting parties intended to incorporate them.112 The Claimants also explain that the decisions in *Austrian Airlines*, *Tza Yap Shum* and *Salini*, misunderstand the nature of the MFN mechanism and overlook the fact that all articles of a treaty are to be considered specifically-negotiated.113 In the Claimants' view, \"absent express wording to that effect, there is no justification for privileging a particular term of a treaty over an MFN provision on the basis that the former is specifically-negotiated.\"114 The Claimants assert that the approach followed by these tribunals is not consistent with the general rule of interpretation under the Vienna Convention, as \"it is the text of the MFN provisions contained in the relevant treaty, and not the contracting States' 'intention as expressed in [the dispute resolution clause]', that is relevant.\"115\n\nReply, para. 110.\n\nReply, para. 111. The Claimants rely on the following passage of the decision in *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005 (\"***Plama***\"):\n\n\"An MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty, unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them.\" (RL-0052, para. 223)\n\nReply, paras. 113-116. In support of their proposition, the Claimants rely on the following passage of Judge Brower's separate opinion in *Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, October 9, 2009 (\"***Austrian Airlines***\"):\n\n\"It is not appropriate to consider provisions as 'context' for interpreting an MFN clause that are less favorable than provisions in third-State treaties to which Claimant claims access. If every time an MFN clause were invoked it were to be read together with the treaty provision which the MFN clause is alleged to circumvent, such a clause might never be given any effect; it would be largely vitiated by that which it seeks to void, modify or expand by importing more favorable treatment from Respondent's third-State treaties. The treatment under a BIT that is possibly less favorable than that provided in third-State treaties is simply not the relevant 'context' for interpreting the subject matter of the MFN clause. In consequence, the scope of the jurisdictional provisions in the Treaty is irrelevant for interpreting the subject matter of Article 3(1) [i.e. the MFN clause], in particular the meaning of the word 'treatment.'\" (RL-0011, para. 136)\n\nReply, para. 114.\n\nReply, paras. 117-118.\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that Professor Douglas's argument regarding the application of MFN clauses to dispute resolution is flawed.116 According to the Claimants, \"the application of MFN treatment to dispute resolution does not 'adjust the rules relating to the jurisdiction of the tribunal or some other aspect of the procedure after a dispute has arisen'.\" In their view, the operation of an MFN provision is immediate: once the Respondent has granted more favourable treatment to Croatian and Lithuanian investors in respect of dispute settlement, the Claimants are entitled to the same treatment. The Claimants assert that there is nothing inherently unfair or unreasonable about this, and this does not involve an adjustment of the rules relating to jurisdiction or procedure.117 The Claimants also affirm that according an investor MFN treatment does not require a State to waive any jurisdictional objections it might have upon receipt of the investor's request for arbitration, because the investor must be entitled to rely on the MFN provision and must comply with any limitations imposed by the dispute resolution provisions in the comparator treaty.118\n\nReply, paras. 119-120.\n\nReply, para. 120.\n\nReply, para. 121.\n\n111.\n\nWith respect to Professor Douglas's analysis, the Claimants also explain that \"[t]he suggestion that the 2000 decision in *Maffezini* appeared in a vacuum is misleading\", as the 1991 UK model bilateral investment treaty already provided expressly that MFN treatment should apply to dispute resolution.119 They further argue that \"the introduction of Professor Douglas' rigid distinction between 'substantive' and 'procedural' rights would infringe upon the agreement embodied in the BIT.\"120\n\nReply, paras. 122-124.\n\nReply, paras. 125-127.\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that the Respondent misrepresents the awards in *Sanum* and *Renta 4*. With respect to the decision in *Sanum*, the Claimants explain that the MFN clause was expressly limited to FET and the provision of \"protection\". In the Claimants' view, the decision in that case was \"the product of the contradiction in the claimant's submission and the restricted nature of the MFN and 'protection' clauses in the relevant treaty.\"121 With respect to the decision in *Renta 4*, the Claimants explain that the MFN obligation in that case was limited to fair and equitable treatment.122 Indeed, the Claimants explain that the majority of the tribunal agreed that an MFN provision may apply to dispute settlement, and stated that whether this is in fact the case will depend upon the exact terms of the MFN clause.123\n\nReply, paras. 130-132.\n\nReply, paras. 133-134.\n\nReply, paras. 135-136. See also *Renta 4*, which reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"They agree that 'more favourable' may in principle include accessibility to international fora. Ultimately however their view is that the terms of the Spanish BIT restrict MFN treatment to the realm of FET as understood in international law.\" (RL-0055, para. 119)\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that the Respondent misunderstands the significance of the decision in *RosInvest*. The Claimants explain that the Respondent's quotation of Article 4(1) of the Treaty at para. 136 of its Counter-Memorial \"ignores the fact that 'investors' enjoy MFN treatment in respect of their 'investments' and 'activities in connection with such investments'\", which in the Claimants' view includes dispute settlement.124 The Claimants also assert that the Respondent ignores that \"Article 4(1) of the BIT refers to any activities in connection with investments\", while Article 3(2) of the UK-Soviet BIT considered in *RosInvest* was not unqualified and was in fact narrower than Article 4(1) of the BIT, as it granted investors MFN treatment \"as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments\".125 The Claimants argue that the decision in *RosInvest* relates to a different treaty and is not determinative here.126 However, they note that the *RosInvest* decision \"is authority for the proposition that, in certain circumstances, a tribunal's jurisdiction may be extended through the application of an MFN clause, and that this is unaffected by the presence of express limitations to the jurisdiction of the tribunal under the arbitration agreement in the basic treaty\".127\n\nReply, paras. 139-141.\n\nReply, para. 142.\n\nReply, para. 143.\n\nReply, para. 143. The passage from the *RosInvest* decision relied upon by the Claimants reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"While indeed the application of the MFN clause of Article 3 widens the scope of Article 8 and thus is in conflict with its limitation, this is a normal result of the application of MFN clauses, the very character and intention of which is that protection not accepted in one treaty is widened by transferring the protection accorded in another treaty.\" (CLA-0128, para. 131)\n\n**C. The Parties' position regarding the Tribunal's questions**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nAs explained above, in Procedural Order No. 3 the Tribunal asked the Parties to address a number of questions in their Post-Hearing Briefs. The Parties' position on these questions, as expressed in their respective Post-Hearing Briefs submitted on 5 February 2016, are summarized in turn below.\n\n**1. Claimants indicated that there were reasons why they were relying on the Hungary-Lithuania and Croatia-Hungary BITs, implying that their provisions were most favorable for Claimants. Why, specifically, are Claimants relying on these two BITs? Are there any other specific Hungary BITs that Claimants rely upon? If so, for what reasons?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimants explain that they now rely solely on the more-favorable dispute settlement provisions contained in the Lithuania-Hungary BIT. According to the Claimants, they rely on this BIT because: (a) it \"contains consent to the submission of ' *[a]ny dispute* ' to arbitration\"; (b) it \"does not impose a requirement to exhaust local remedies\"; and (c) it \"does not contain a 'fork-in-the-road' provision.\"128\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 7.\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimants clarify that they do not rely on the FET provisions in the Hungary-Lithuania BIT, and that they rely solely on the more favorable treatment granted to Lithuanian investors under Article 8 of the Lithuania-Hungary BIT, which refers to dispute resolution.129\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 8.\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent also submitted comments regarding this question. In its view, the \"Claimants contend that the MFN serves as a drafting tool that automatically amends the standing offer in the Treaty so that, when it comes time, Claimants may simply accept the amended standing offer, which necessarily includes the more favored treatment\".130 This \"presupposes that what constitutes 'more' is an objective and singular standard\" capable of being known at a point in time.131 The Respondent argues that this is not the case. In its view, it would be \"an uncertain, ambiguous and versatile consent depending on the subjective views of the investor.\"132 The Respondent notes that the table produced pursuant to paragraph 2.2 of Procedural Order No. 3 shows that there are numerous formulations as to what might be the \"most favored treatment\" let alone the \"more favored treatment\", and each would be assessed from the particular perspective of the individual claimant.133\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 31.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 31.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 32.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 32.\n\n**2. Is the right to pursue dispute settlement proceedings in the France-Hungary BIT / in any BIT a self-standing right, independent of any of the other provisions of the treaty, or is it a right that is ancillary to a substantive right set out elsewhere in the treaty?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Article 9(2) of the Treaty \"is a stand-alone right that is governed only by its terms and not by other provisions of the France-Hungary BIT.\"134 This conclusion is, in the Respondent's view, consistent with the principle that arbitration agreements are severable from the contracts or treaties in which they are found.135\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15.\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the arbitration right in Article 9(2) is not \"subordinate to those provisions of the... BIT that confer substantive rights\".136 In its view, \"the right to pursue dispute settlement proceedings is not something 'which could be inferred from obligations assumed' elsewhere in the BIT or which otherwise arises therefrom.\"137 The Respondent contends that the Claimants \"are incorrect to ground the purported right to arbitrate the non-expropriation claims in the assertion that the ability to enforce a right is 'an integral part' of the protection afforded by any substantive right (here MFN treatment)\".138\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 17 and 20. See also Justice Winston Anderson, JCCJ, *The Role of the Caribbean Court of justice in the human rights Adjudication: International Treaty Law Dimensions*, 21 J. Transnat'l Law & Policy 8 (2011-2012), RL-0133. The Respondent also relies on the following passage of Professor Stern's opinion of 21 June 2011 in *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17:\n\n\"[There is a] profound difference between the national legal orders and the international legal order. On the national level, when there exists a substantive right, there is always automatically a means to protect such a right through the jurisdictional system. In other words, on the national level, jurisdictional treatment is inherent in substantive treatment. In contrast, on the international level, most rights cannot be enforced through a jurisdictional process, it is only when, exceptionally, the State has given its consent -consent to other States for accepting the jurisdiction of the ICJ or consent to foreign investors for accepting international arbitration - that such a 'jurisdictional treatment' complements the substantive treatment granted by the international rules. Contrary to the situation existing in the national legal orders, the jurisdictional treatment is never inherent in the substantive treatment in on the international level.\" (RL-0137, para. 45)\n\nThe Respondent further relies on the following passage in the decision made by the International Court of Justice in *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Dem. Rep. Congo v. Rwanda)*, 2006 ICJ 6, 65 (February 6):\n\n\"The Court observes... \"the *erga omnes* character of a norm and the rule of consent to jurisdiction are two different things\" (East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgement I.C.J. report, 1995, p. 102, para. 29) and that the mere fact that rights and obligations *erga omnes* may be at issue in a dispute would not give the Court jurisdiction to entertain that dispute. That same applies to the relationship between peremptory norms of general international law (*jus cogens*) and the establishment of the Court's jurisdiction: the fact that a dispute relates to compliance with a norm having such a character... cannot of itself provide a basis for the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain that dispute. Under the Court's Statute that jurisdiction is always based on the consent of the parties.\" (RL-0135, p. 32)\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20.\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimants give a different and contradictory meaning to the word \"treatment\" in Article 3 and in Article 4(1) of the Treaty, as they are not seeking a more favorable right to fair and equitable treatment but, rather, \"a 'more' favorable right to arbitrate.\"139 The Respondent asserts that there is a fundamental disconnect between how the Claimants rely on the MFN clause (arguing that they are entitled to legal protection of a right) and what they are actually claiming through the MFN clause (i.e., a right).140\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 22-23.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 23.\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent thus contends that Article 4(1) of the Treaty is unavailing to the Claimants because: (a) it does not convey explicit consent to arbitrate claims that are not dispossession claims; and (b) it cannot be transformed into a *de facto* arbitration agreement because \"a promise to extend the same treatment accorded to investors in the most favored nation is *not* an implicit promise to arbitrate\".141 The Respondent adds that, in the MFN clause, Hungary promised \"only to enhance the investors' substantive rights-such as the right to fair and equitable treatment. But Hungary did not thereby also promise to arbitrate claims that it expressly said in Article 9(2) it would not arbitrate.\"142\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 24.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 24.\n\n122.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the distinction between \"self-standing\" and \"ancillary\" rights143 is not normative. In their view, this is important for three reasons: (a) a rigid distinction does not exist, as a right may be self-standing in one context and ancillary in another, or self-standing and at the same time ancillary to another right;144 (b) the distinction does not necessarily have legal implications, as independently of how the right to pursue dispute settlement is classified, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims under Article 3 of the Treaty;145 and (c) it cannot be assumed that a particular provision of a BIT relates solely to \"self-standing\" or \"ancillary\" rights, and absent wording to that effect such distinction cannot (and should not) be read into the terms of a treaty.146\n\nThe Claimants understand \"self-standing\" rights as the rights capable of existing independently of other rights, and \"ancillary\" rights as those necessary to, or dependent upon, the existence or exercise of a separate right (Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 10).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 11.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 13.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 14 and 21.\n\n123.\n\nThe Claimants contend that this is particularly relevant to the interpretation of Article 4(1) of the Treaty, as it covers \"treatment\" in respect of \"investments and activities in connection with such investments\" without distinguishing between \"self-standing\" and \"ancillary\" rights. In their view, the promise of MFN treatment applies to all rights, including in respect of dispute settlement.147\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the right to pursue dispute settlement proceedings is capable of being \"self-standing\" and that there is nothing \"ancillary\" about this right.148 In their view, this does not mean that dispute settlement rights cannot also form part of a bundle of rights but, rather, that the right to pursue dispute settlement is not intrinsically ancillary to a substantive right set out elsewhere in the treaty.149\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17-19. The Claimants also assert that the possibility for an investor to invoke the right to pursue dispute settlement can be exercised separately from the other provisions of the treaty, something which they say was recognized by the Tribunal in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, CLA-0021, para. 55.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20. The Claimants also rely on the following passage of the decision in *RosInvest*, to assert that the right to pursue dispute resolution is a protection like any other:\n\n\"[i]f this effect [the expansion of rights through an MFN clause] is generally accepted in the context of substantive protection, the Tribunal sees no reason not to accept it in the context of procedural clauses such as arbitration clauses. Quite the contrary, it could be argued that, if it applies to substantive protection, then it should apply even more to \"only\" procedural protection. However, the Tribunal feels that this latter argument cannot be considered as decisive, but that rather, as argued further above, an arbitration clause, at least in the context of expropriation, is of the same protective value as any substantive protection afforded by applicable provisions (\u2026).\" (*RosInvest*, para. 132, CLA-0128)\n\n**3. If it is an ancillary right, does this have any implication for Claimants' reliance on the Hungary-Lithuania and Croatia-Hungary BITs to found the right to pursue arbitration in respect of its FET claims?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the right to pursue dispute settlement proceedings is not an ancillary right, but rather an independent right that must be explicitly agreed between the contracting parties.150 Further, the Respondent contends that whether the right to pursue dispute settlement proceedings is characterized as \"independent\" or \"ancillary\", the right must be in the basic treaty, whereas here the BIT affords no right to arbitrate non-dispossession claims. In the Respondent's view, the \"Claimants cannot rely on the Hungary-Lithuania and/or the Croatia-Hungary BITs to 'create a right to go to arbitration where none otherwise exists under the [basic BIT].'\"151\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 25.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26. The Respondent relies on *Hochtief*, CLA-0127, para. 79.\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimants argue that an MFN clause may apply to \"treatment\" in respect of dispute resolution, irrespective of how the relevant rights are classified.152 What matters, according to the Claimants, is the terms of the treaty. They assert that whether the MFN clause applies to dispute settlement in this instance turns on the correct interpretation of Article 4(1) of the Treaty, which is not affected by the characterization of the rights under consideration.153\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 23-25. In making this argument, the Claimants rely on the following passage of the Final Report of the ILC's Study Group on the Most-Favored Nation clause:\n\n\"... in principle MFN provisions are capable of applying to the dispute settlement provisions of BITs. (\u2026) The point is essentially one of party autonomy; the parties to a BIT can, if they wish, include the conditions for access to dispute settlement within the scope of coverage of an MFN provision. The question in each case is whether they have done so.\n\n163. In this sense, the question is truly one of treaty interpretation that can be answered only in respect of each particular case.\" (United Nations General Assembly, International Law Commission, Final Report, Study Group on the Most-Favoured-Nation clause, Sixty-seventh session, A/CN.4/L.852 (29 May 2015), paras. 162-163, CLA-0114)\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 25.\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that the MFN provision found in Article 4(1) of the Treaty must be interpreted in accordance with the VCLT's \"general rule of interpretation\". In the Claimants' view, \"this rule applies to all provisions of a treaty, without distinction, and the approach does not vary according to the characterization of the provisions (or rights) under consideration.\"154 The Claimants assert that the promise to accord them MFN treatment is formulated in broad and far-reaching terms, that the terms \"treatment\" and \"activities\" are unqualified, and that there is no distinction between \"treatment\" or \"activities\" in respect of \"self-standing\" rights, and \"treatment\" or \"activities\" in respect of \"ancillary\" rights. According to the Claimants, \"[j]ust as there is no justification for artificially excluding consent to arbitration from the scope of Article 4(1), there is no justification for limiting its application to 'self-standing' (or 'ancillary') rights.\"155\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 27-28 and 32.\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that the reference to \"[i]n its territory\" in Article 4(1) of the Treaty refers to the territory where the Respondent has control, and in which the investment was made. It does not, in their view, automatically preclude MFN treatment in respect of international arbitration.156\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 29-30. The Claimants support their argument on the Model Agreement of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 1991, Article 3(3), CLA-0141, which contains an MFN clause which is expressly stated to apply to the resolution of disputes through international arbitration. The Claimants also rely on the exceptions established in Article 13 of the Jordan-Hungary and Azerbaijan-Hungary BITs.\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that \"even if one assumes that a right to pursue dispute settlement can only be considered alongside the 'substantive right' to which it is 'ancillary', the outcome would be the same. The Tribunal would still have jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims under Article 3 of the France-Hungary BIT.\"157 In their view, the Respondent has still granted Lithuanian investors more favorable treatment. They affirm that the only difference is that the treatment \"would be articulated in terms of FET (and the rights ancillary to it) rather than dispute resolution\", but the outcome is the same.158\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 39-40.\n\n**4. On the assumption,** ***arguendo*****, that an MFN clause in a BIT could operate to import into the treaty a dispute settlement clause from another BIT, are there any limitations on what elements of the dispute settlement modalities can be imported?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, in the event that an MFN clause were used to import a dispute settlement clause, \"it could not incorporate those elements of the dispute settlement modalities that would 'create' arbitral jurisdiction.\"159 The Respondent relies on the decision rendered in *Hochtief* to assert that \"the MFN clause 'can only operate in regard to the subject-matter which the two States had in mind when they inserted the clause in their treaty.'\"160 The Respondent further argues that a similar limitation was recognized by the Tribunal in *Teinver*,161 and that this limitation is also consistent with the reasoning in *RosInvest*, \"where the Tribunal expressly limited its consideration of the application of the MFN clause to arbitration regarding expropriation, i.e., it limited its consideration of the proper application of the MFN clause to that area for which it had admitted jurisdiction.\"162\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 27.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 28. The Respondent also relies on the following passage of the decision in *Hochtief* :\n\n\"[I]t cannot be assumed that [the parties to the BIT] intended that the MFN clause should create wholly new rights where none otherwise existed... The MFN clause stipulates a standard of treatment and defines it according to the treatment of third parties. The reference is to a standard of treatment accorded to third parties, not to the extent of the legal rights of third parties.\" (CLA-0127, para. 81)\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 29. *Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012 (\"***Teinver***\"), RL-0143, paras. 181-82.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 29.\n\n131.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the operation of an MFN clause is subject to two limitations. First, the *ejusdem generis* rule, which requires that the treatment in the basic treaty and the comparator treaty concern the same matter.163 Second, the terms of the relevant provisions limit what elements of the dispute settlement modalities could be imported.164 The Claimants explain that they \"do not rely upon 'elements of the dispute settlement modalities' found in the Lithuania-Hungary BIT\". They assert that, in accordance with Article 4(1) of the Treaty, they rely upon the more favorable treatment accorded to Lithuanian investors under Article 8 of the Lithuania-Hungary BIT in its entirety.165 In their view, \"[b]y consenting to the arbitration of FET disputes with Lithuanian investors, the Respondent also consented to the arbitration of FET disputes with the Claimants.\"166\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 43.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 44.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 46.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 46.\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimants also explain that, in order to rely on the MFN provision of a BIT, an investor must demonstrate that the treatment accorded to third State investors is objectively more favorable.167 In their view, the existence of the choice to submit a dispute to an international forum is objectively more favorable than its absence.168\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 48.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 49.\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimants explain that the MFN standard is intended to ensure the elimination of discrimination, the correction of oversights and the adaptation of treaties to changing circumstances.169 They further argue that the application of the MFN standard is automatic and immediate, and does not permit the imposition of artificial limits on its operation.170 The Claimants rely on the decision in *RosInvest* to assert that \"[t]he interpreter is not permitted to second-guess the contracting-States' policy decisions.\"171 In the Claimants' view, this means that there is no principle that provisions that embody a state's consent to arbitration must be strictly interpreted, and that contrary to the Respondent's submission, the wording of the text is not just relevant but dispositive.172\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 53.

The Claimants rely on the following passage:\n\n\"the main focus of [the tribunal's] attention has to be not the policies which either one or the other Contracting Party brought to the negotiating table (and which might of course have been widely different from one another) but what they agreed on, as embodied in the terms of their treaty.\"\n\nThe Claimants also rely on *Renta 4*, para. 93, RL-0055.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 56, 59 and 61-62.\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimants also reject the Respondent's submission that \"an MFN provision cannot be used to create a new right or to attract from the comparator treaty a right that does not exist in the basic treaty.\"173 They argue as follows: (a) the only authority cited by the Respondent in support of this submission expressly avoided ruling on the issue currently before the Tribunal;174 (b) the only inherent limitation to the operation of an MFN provision is the *ejusdem generis* rule;175 and (c) it is well established that an MFN clause may attract a right that does not exist in the basic treaty.176\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 63.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 64. *Hochtief*, para. 91.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 64.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 64.

THE TRIBUNAL'S CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introductory note**\n------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Tribunal has given consideration to the extensive factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their written and oral submissions, all of which the Tribunal has found helpful. In this Decision, the Tribunal discusses the arguments of the Parties it considers most relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal's reasons, without repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties, address what the Tribunal itself considers to be the determinative factors required to decide on the disputed Preliminary Issues.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal has to consider whether the jurisdictional requirements established in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and in the France-Hungary BIT are met.\n\n137.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, as mentioned by the Claimants,177 that the Respondent does not challenge the existence of \"a legal dispute\"178 between \"a Contracting State\" (Hungary, which is a Contracting State179) and \"a national of another Contracting State\" (LCD and CD Internationale, two companies constituted in France,180 which is also a Contracting State181). The Tribunal is further satisfied that the Claimants' shareholding in CD Hungary constitutes an \"investment\" for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.182\n\nReply, para. 18.\n\nMemorial, para. 63; Reply, para. 18.\n\nMemorial, para. 66; Reply, para. 16. See also icsid.worldbank.org.\n\nExtrait Kbis de Le Cheque D\u00e9jeuner, 16 October 2013, C-0001; Extrait Kbis de C.D Holding Internationale, 12 September 2013, C-0002.\n\nSee icsid.worldbank.org.\n\nRequest, para. 110; Memorial, para. 65; and Reply, para. 15.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, pursuant to Article 1 of the Treaty, the Claimants' shareholding in CD Hungary constitutes an \"investment\" and the Claimants fall within the definition of \"investor\".183\n\nTreaty, Article 1, CL-0001, which provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"1. The term 'investment' shall apply to assets such as property, rights and interests of any category, related to economic activity in any sector whatever, established after 31 December 1972, in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory or maritime zones the investment was made, and particularly but not exclusively, to:... (b) Shares and other forms of participation, albeit minority or indirect, in companies constituted in the territory of either Party;\n\n...\n\n2. The term 'investor' shall apply to:... (b) Any body corporate constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation and having its registered office there...\"\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Respondent's objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is solely based on the alleged lack of consent to ICSID jurisdiction over claims brought under Article 3 of the Treaty.184\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 16, 105-108 and 307(a); Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 2 and 37.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the Respondent's argument to the effect that \"there could be no expropriation because the Claimants had no property right capable of being taken.\"185 The Tribunal notes, however, that the Respondent advances this argument as a defense on the merits, in relation to the applicable legal standard for expropriation under the Treaty, and that this argument is not advanced as a basis to challenge the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 162. See also paras. 163-177.\n\n142.\n\nThe following sections thus address the only issue in dispute between the Parties with respect to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, namely the scope of the Respondent's consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n**B. Treaty interpretation and jurisprudence of other tribunals**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nIn the legal arguments made in their written and oral submissions, the Parties rely on the VCLT and numerous decisions of other courts and tribunals. Accordingly, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to make certain general preliminary observations in this regard.\n\n144.\n\nFirst of all, the Tribunal considers it useful to make clear from the outset that it regards its task in these proceedings as the very specific one of applying the relevant provisions of the Treaty as far as necessary in order to decide on the relief sought by the Parties. No less, but also no more.\n\n145.\n\nIn order to do so, the Tribunal must, as required by the \"General rule of interpretation\" of Article 31 VCLT, interpret the Treaty's provisions in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to them in their context and in light of the Treaty's object and purpose. The \"context\" referred to in the first paragraph of Article 31 is given a specific definition in the second paragraph of Article 31 and comprises three elements: (i) the Treaty's text, including its preamble; (ii) any agreement between the parties to the Treaty in connection with its conclusion; and (iii) any instrument which was made by one of the parties to the Treaty in connection with its conclusion and accepted by the other party to the Treaty. The \"ordinary meaning\" as defined above applies unless a special meaning is to be given to a term if it is established that the parties to the Treaty so intended, as it is stated in the fourth paragraph of Article 31.\n\n146.\n\nAs provided in the \"Supplementary means of interpretation\" of Article 32 VCLT, the Tribunal may have recourse to supplementary means of interpretation (i) in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 VCLT, or (ii) when the interpretation according to Article 31 VCLT either leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. Those supplementary means of interpretation include, but are not limited to, the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.\n\n147.\n\nThe Parties have extensively referred to decisions of other tribunals. However, there is no dispute that in any event the decisions of other tribunals are not binding on this Tribunal. The many references by the Parties to certain arbitral decisions in their pleadings do not contradict this conclusion.\n\n148.\n\nHowever, this does not preclude the Tribunal from considering arbitral decisions and the arguments of the Parties based upon them, to the extent that it may find that they shed any useful light on the issues that arise for the decision in the present case.\n\n149.\n\nSuch an examination is conducted by the Tribunal later in this Decision, after the Tribunal has considered the Parties' contentions and arguments regarding the various issues argued and relevant for the interpretation of the applicable Treaty provisions, while taking into account the above-mentioned specificity of the Treaty to be applied in the present case.\n\n**C. Respondent's procedural objection**\n----------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants failed to assert, in their Request for Arbitration, jurisdiction in respect of their FET claims by operation of the MFN clause incorporating an arbitration clause from another BIT. The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument given that the Respondent appears to have been aware from the outset that the Claimants would be asserting MFN-based jurisdiction in respect of their FET claims - this being understood by the Parties from the time of the first procedural meeting as likely to attract an objection to jurisdiction from the Respondent.\n\n**D. Wording of Article 9(1) and (2) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Treaty provides as follows in Article 9(1) and the first subparagraph of Article 9(2):\n\n\"1. Any dispute relating to investments between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the two Parties concerned or, failing that, by recourse to domestic means.\n\n2. However, disputes concerning dispossession measures as provided for in article 5, paragraph 2, particularly those relating to compensation, its amount, conditions of payment and interest to be paid in the case of delayed payment, shall be settled under the following conditions...\"\n\n152.\n\nFrom this wording, and particularly the words \"any dispute\", it is clear that subsection 1 provides the general principle to the effect that disputes are to be decided by \"recourse to domestic means\".\n\n153.\n\nSubsection 2 starts with \"However\" and thereby provides an exception to the above principle to the effect that dispossession measures as provided for in Article 5(2) \"shall be settled\" by arbitration.\n\n154.\n\nThe Respondent rests its argument on two pillars: first, that Article 9(1) excludes arbitration in respect of FET claims by providing for recourse in respect of such claims to domestic settlement means, viz., \"shall... be settled... by recourse to domestic means\". On this reading, Article 9(1) is an express, forward-looking limitation in respect of FET claims that excludes arbitration in favor of domestic settlement. The second pillar of argument is that, insofar as Article 9(2) provides that \"disputes concerning dispossession measures... shall be settled [inter alia through arbitration]\", this must be construed as an implied exclusion of arbitration in respect of all claims other than dispossession claims.\n\n155.\n\nAs a matter of textual interpretation, Article 9(2) cannot be construed as excluding arbitration in respect of FET claims. It makes no mention of FET claims, whether directly or indirectly. It only addresses dispossession claims. While Article 9(2), read together with Article 9(1), addresses dispute settlement modalities in respect of all claims arising under the Treaty, Article 9(2) cannot by itself carry the weight of an implied exclusion of arbitration in respect of FET claims. It does not exclude anything.\n\n156.\n\nThe question, then, is whether Article 9(1) is to be construed as excluding arbitration in respect of FET claims.\n\n157.\n\nHaving regard only to the France - Hungary BIT, including the documents put before the Tribunal providing contemporary evidence of the understanding of the parties at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty, the clear and unavoidable conclusion is that the parties to the Treaty intended to exclude arbitration in respect of FET claims.\n\n158.\n\nThe common interpretation of both subsections of Article 9 leaves no doubt that the express intent of the parties to the Treaty was that only Article 5(2) measures are to and can be brought before an arbitral tribunal. This is confirmed by the documents submitted showing that the Hungarian as well as the French negotiators informed during the ratification procedure that Hungary had insisted on the above limitation of arbitration and that France had accepted that in view of other aspects of \"the deal\" it found more relevant.186\n\nReport on the negotiations relating to the Hungarian-French investment protection agreement, prepared for the Ministry of Finance of the Government of the People's Republic of Hungary on July 7, 1986, RL-0092; Memorandum dated 3 June 1986, RL-0129; Memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Agreement with Hungary on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, Negotiations of July 12, Paris, dated July 8, 1986, RL-0130; Outgoing Telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding Negotiations on the French-Hungarian Agreement on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, dated July 11, 1986, RL-0131; and Memorandum from the Directorate for European Affairs regarding the French-Hungarian Agreement on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, dated December 19, 1986, RL-0132.\n\n159.\n\nArticle 9(1) cannot, however, be construed as a limitation on the scope of operation of the MFN clause. Had the parties intended the MFN clause to be so limited, it would have been straightforward to set out a restriction to this effect in express terms either in the MFN clause itself or elsewhere in the Treaty. They did not do so. To be capable of overturning the fundamental, non-discriminatory object and purpose of an MFN clause, the language of any limitation must have clearly and unambiguously in contemplation a restriction on the operation of the MFN clause itself. It is not sufficient that a clause elsewhere in the Treaty provides for a limitation in respect of some matter while leaving the MFN clause entirely intact. Any different approach would effectively denude the MFN clause of its essential purpose, namely, to ensure that investors afforded the benefit of the Treaty are not discriminated against by comparison to investors afforded the benefit of some other BIT.\n\n160.\n\nThe question that follows is whether the Article 9(2) exclusion, at the point at which the Treaty was concluded, is controlling going forward in the face of an MFN clause that contains no limitation or exclusion of its own in respect of its scope of application.\n\n**E. Construing an MFN clause**\n-------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nA useful starting point of analysis is the object and purpose of an MFN clause in a BIT.\n\n162.\n\nThe self-evident purpose of an MFN clause is to ensure that treatment accorded to investors under one BIT will be no less advantageous than treatment accorded to investors under another BIT. The purpose of such a clause is to ensure that there will be no discrimination between foreign investors.\n\n163.\n\nThere is no reason of principle, or of construction, that would restrict the operation of an MFN clause to treatment of a particular kind or form. So, for example, a provision in a later BIT that affords an investor the right to invest in a given sector without first obtaining the written consent of the host State to do so would in principle be subject to the operation of an MFN clause.\n\n**F. Application of the MFN clause to import provisions of future BITs**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal has to examine whether the MFN clause in Article 4(1) of the Treaty might have to be interpreted as only allowing the import of provisions of other BITs which were concluded before the present Treaty or whether also provisions of future BITs of Hungary can be imported.\n\n165.\n\nThis question has been discussed by other tribunals under the principle of contemporaneity. The most recent summary of that discussion with regard to MFN clauses is provided by the ILC-Report of 2015:\n\n\"176. The principle of contemporaneity, relied on explicitly by the tribunals in ICS and Daimler, and implicitly in the decisions of some other tribunals, is not found specifically in the VCLT rules. Yet, it has been adverted to directly and indirectly by the International Court of Justice and by international tribunals. In *Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia*, the Court referred to the 'primary necessity of interpreting an instrument in accordance with the intentions of the parties at the time of its conclusion.' The Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission also endorsed what it referred to as 'the doctrine of 'contemporaneity'.'\n\n177. Another view is that interpretation should be evolutionary, taking into account the development in the meaning of generic terms used in the treaty over time, particularly in the light of changes in the relevant law. However, as has been pointed out, while an evolutionary approach can be applied to generic \"terms in a treaty which are by their very nature expressed in such general terms as to lend themselves to an evolutionary interpretation,\" this cannot be done to 'conflict with the intentions and expectations of the parties as they may have been expressed during the negotiations preceding the conclusion of the treaty.'\n\n178. In the view of the Study Group, whether an evolutionary interpretation is appropriate in any given case will depend on a number of factors, including the intention of the parties that the term in question was to be interpreted in an evolutionary way, the subsequent practice of the parties, and the way they themselves have interpreted and applied their agreement. The approach of the *ICS* tribunal in seeking to ascertain the meaning of 'treatment' to which the MFN provision applied, by looking at how the term would have been understood at the time the UK-Argentina BIT was entered into, provides important guidance for interpretation but it cannot be regarded as necessarily definitive.\"187\n\nCLA-0114, p. 39.\n\n166.\n\nThe present Tribunal accepts this summary of the discussion. Applying the \"factors\" suggested by the ILC Study Group, for the case at hand, the Tribunal considers the following.\n\n167.\n\nRegarding the first factor, neither the wording of Article 4(1) of the Treaty nor the file provide any information whether or not the two parties to the Treaty had *the intention... that the term in question* [the MFN clause] *was to be interpreted in an evolutionary way*.\n\n168.\n\nAlso regarding the third factor, i.e. *the way they themselves have interpreted and applied their agreement*, no relevant information is available from the file in the present case. While there is information regarding the Parties' interpretation of Article 9 as seen above, none is available regarding the interpretation of the MFN clause in Article 4(1). Further, to the Tribunal's knowledge, the present case is the first one in which the application of the MFN clause in the BIT to dispute settlement is at stake.\n\n169.\n\nHowever, regarding the second factor, i.e. *the subsequent practice of the parties*, there is information available in the present case. The list of all Hungarian BITs provided by the Parties in this arbitration shows the following:\n\n\u2022 Hungary's early BITs starting in 1986 (of which the one with France was the third in the same year) till 1989 all included limited arbitration clauses;\n\n\u2022 The first unlimited arbitration clauses were included in its BITs in 1988 with Finland and in 1989 with Kuwait;\n\n\u2022 Then unlimited arbitration clauses were included more often in its BITs starting in 1991;\n\n\u2022 And starting in 1992, almost all of its BITs thereafter had unlimited arbitration clauses.\n\n170.\n\nThe Parties have also informed the Tribunal, as the list provided by them confirms, that from the very beginning, all of Hungary's BITs include MFN clauses.188\n\nThe Parties informed that the text of the Estonia-Hungary BIT, which was signed on 1 January 2002 and has not yet been ratified, is not available.\n\n171.\n\nFurther, the Parties have informed the Tribunal, as again is confirmed by their list, that all of Hungary's BITs included FET clauses.189\n\nThe Parties informed that the text of the Estonia-Hungary BIT, which was signed on 1 January 2002 and has not yet been ratified, is not available.\n\n172.\n\nFrom the above information, the Tribunal concludes that, while two of the three factors identified by the ILC Report do not provide any guidance in the present case, the second factor, i.e. *the subsequent practice of the parties*, does provide guidance.190\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that \"subsequent practice\" is used here to describe the practice of the parties, whether separately or together, following the conclusion of the BIT in question, i.e., it is a broader category of conduct than the \"subsequent practice\" in contemplation in Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (namely, \"subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\"). This understanding is evident, and follows from, the third of the factors identified by the ILC requiring consideration.\n\n173.\n\nIn agreement with the ILC Report, this Tribunal considers that, unless expressly so provided in the BIT, MFN clauses are not retrospective clauses, included in the BITs for purposes of ensuring that the parties incorporate thereby treatment afforded in BITs previously concluded. Not only would such an interpretation not be warranted by reference to the language of such clauses but such a reading would be contrary to the object and purpose of such a clause as it would necessarily result in differential treatment in any case in which there was a later-in-time comparator treaty. MFN clauses thus have an inherently prospective dimension, ensuring non-discriminatory treatment by reference to treatment that will be afforded in the future.\n\n174.\n\nSince the MFN clause, by its nature, has a moving target and scope with the evolution of past and future BITs, Hungary's BIT practice since 1992 shows that an open arbitration clause including FET and MFN clauses is by now its normal standard. Achieving the same result in the present case via the MFN clause in the Hungary-France BIT thus would in no way lead to a situation unusual for Hungary today.\n\n175.\n\nNeither the wording of Article 4(1) nor the file provide any evidence that it was understood to refer only to past BITs. It follows that, in the Tribunal's view, the MFN clause in the France - Hungary BIT had in general contemplation treatment that may be afforded to others in the future that is not afforded to the beneficiaries of the BIT then being concluded.\n\n**G. Limits on the scope of application of an MFN clause**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nIt would be open to parties to a BIT to restrict the scope of an MFN clause included in a treaty. For example, an MFN clause may provide, in express terms, that it does not apply in respect of certain kinds of treatment or that it only applies in the case of BITs with certain other States (e.g., European States). In principle, an express limitation in an MFN clause itself, or elsewhere in the BIT but with respect to the MFN clause, would have the effect of limiting the scope of application of the clause.\n\n177.\n\nMore difficult is the question of whether an MFN clause may contain an implied limitation, either by reference to the words in the clause itself or implied by reference to some other term in the BIT. While this would ultimately turn on the language in question, unrestricted language in an MFN clause should, as a matter of treaty interpretation, give rise to a presumption against limitation.\n\n178.\n\nA further question that arises is whether the scope of application of an MFN clause may be limited to certain types of rights. For example, does an MFN clause in a treaty have the effect of reading into the treaty rights accorded only in another treaty of the same character, addressing the same subject matter, or does it incorporate rights writ large.\n\n179.\n\nThe answer to this question is likely to depend on the specific formulation of the particular MFN clause and particular treaty. So, for example, an MFN clause in a treaty that addresses trade in agricultural goods may be limited in its scope of application to treatment accorded in the agricultural sector, rather than applying more generally. This is the *ejusdem generis* principle.\n\n180.\n\nIn the case of BITs, language along the lines of \"treatment accorded to investors of the most-favoured nation\" will have a self-limiting effect on the scope of application of the clause. An MFN clause along these lines will not, as a matter of construction, apply in the case, for example, of treatment of persons who are not investors. Equally, an investor could not rely on an MFN clause in a BIT to afford him/her/it rights that are derived from a non-investment treaty, for example, a visa waiver treaty in respect of tourist travel.\n\n181.\n\nThe question that follows is whether there are any inherent or otherwise proper limitations on the scope of application of an MFN clause in a BIT to dispute settlement provisions in another BIT.\n\n182.\n\nThe dispute settlement provisions of a BIT do not give rise to a self-standing right to pursue arbitration independently of an alleged breach of the rights protected in the BIT. In other words, an investor who might otherwise be in a position to avail him or herself of a right under a BIT could not rely on a right to bring arbitral proceedings against the host State in respect of a matter that is not addressed in the BIT. The investor could not, for example, rely on a BIT arbitration clause to bring arbitral proceedings in respect of a refusal of a tourist visa that had nothing to do with an investment.\n\n183.\n\nThis being the case, a right to bring arbitration proceedings pursuant to a clause in a BIT is a right that is contingent on the alleged violation of a right protected in that BIT.\n\n184.\n\nIt follows, further, that, for purposes of assessing the limits on the scope of application of an MFN clause in a BIT in respect of the dispute settlement provisions in another BIT, it is necessary to have regard to the scope of the rights protected in that other BIT. A claimant could not, for example, rely on an MFN clause in a BIT to incorporate a dispute settlement right from another BIT if that other BIT did not contemplate dispute settlement in respect of the right asserted by a claimant under the BIT pursuant to which the claimant was entitled.\n\n**H. Wording of Article 4(1) of the Hungary - France BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall accord in its territory and maritime zones, to investors of the other Party, in respect of their investments and activities in connection with such investments, the same treatment accorded to its own investors or the treatment accorded to investors of the most-favoured-nation, if the latter is more advantageous.\"\n\n186.\n\nThe wording of the MFN clause in Article 4(1) of the Hungary - France BIT is rather wide. Obviously it does not contain any express exclusion to the effect that it does not apply to dispute settlement.\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent advances four points of textual interpretation of the MFN clause in support of its position: (i) ICSID arbitration is not accorded in the \"territory\" of a Contracting Party;191 (ii) the term \"activities in connection with... investments\" cannot be construed to include resort to arbitration;192 (iii) the term \"treatment\" cannot be construed to include the right to resort to arbitration;193 and (iv) the right to resort to arbitration cannot be said to be \"more advantageous\" treatment than the right to resort to dispute settlement under domestic law.194\n\nTranscript Day 2, p. 19:15 to p. 20:24.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 6.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 6 and 22-23.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 23, and Transcript Day 2 p. 8:22 to p. 9:11.\n\n188.\n\nIt is clearly important to have careful regard to the words used in the MFN clause. The clause must, however, be interpreted in a holistic manner, with regard to its context and its object and purpose. Individual words cannot be given a meaning, however merited this might be when viewed in isolation, that would be at odds with the object and purpose of the clause as a whole.\n\n189.\n\nThe evident purpose of the MFN clause was to ensure that the conditions of investment of investors under the Treaty corresponded to those accorded to MFN investors. The preamble of the Treaty makes it clear that this is what the parties were concerned with, viz.: \"Desiring to strengthen their economic cooperation by creating favorable conditions for French investments in Hungary and Hungarian investments in France.\"\n\n190.\n\nThe ability of an investor to take steps to protect his/her/its investment, including by resort to dispute settlement proceedings, is an integral component of the conditions of investment and will often be material to the decision to invest in the first place. The importance of this element is illustrated by the fact of investor - State dispute settlement provisions in BITs, as well as by the *raison d\u2019etre* of ICSID itself.\n\n**1. \"Territory\"**\n------------------\n\n191.\n\nHaving this in mind, the term \"territory\" in the MFN clause cannot be construed as imposing a limitation on the operation of the MFN clause to exclude reference to arbitration that takes place internationally. The issue is the treatment accorded by a Contracting State to investments and connected activities by qualifying investors. If the object and purpose of the clause is not to be defeated by devices that impose extraterritorial conduct requirements, the term \"territory\" must be construed as a reference to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party, including as regards such rights as may be afforded the investor, as part of the conditions of investment, to safeguard his/her/its investment through arbitration proceedings which are independent of the Contracting Party in question. Delocalised dispute settlement is at the heart of the Treaty edifice concerning conditions of investment. To construe the word \"territory\" as imposing a limitation on the scope of an MFN clause would risk eroding such a clause in a fundamental way.\n\n192.\n\nIt is also the case that an investor wishing to pursue an international arbitration claim will have a locus in the territory in which the investment is located. If the meaning of the word \"territory\" is not to become a matter of sterile debate caught up in the formalism of where a decision to resort to arbitration is taken, the seat of a tribunal and where its hearings are held, the term must be construed in the context of the provision as a whole and its object and purpose.\n\n**2. \"Activities\" and \"treatment\"**\n-----------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nThe same analysis applies to the construction of the terms \"activities\" and \"treatment\" in the MFN clause. It is material that the term \"treatment\" refers to what is to be accorded to the investor, not the investment. An investor's entitlement to resort to arbitration under a BIT must be construed as an integral part of the treatment accorded to him/her/it. This applies, too, to the meaning of the term \"activities\" in connection with an investment. If the effect of an MFN clause is not to be put at significant risk, activities in connection with an investment must be construed as activities associated with the protection of that investment. A different interpretation would mean that restrictions in respect of domestic proceedings that imposed a differential and discriminatory standard on a qualifying investor would be excluded from the operation of the MFN clause.\n\n**3. \"More advantageous\"**\n--------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe final question is whether the right to resort to arbitration is \"more advantageous\" treatment than the right to resort to dispute settlement under domestic law. Delocalised dispute settlement is at the very heart of the Treaty edifice concerning conditions of investment. Excluding the right to resort to arbitration for investors under one BIT while allowing it for investors under another BIT is self-evidently differential treatment. Differential treatment is discriminatory when it treats comparable circumstances and/or persons differently. Whether or not arbitration is in fact more advantageous than domestic processes in any particular case is beside the point. The MFN clause is engaged by the fact that qualifying investors are denied treatment afforded to comparable investors under another BIT.\n\n**4. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe remaining question is whether \"consent in writing\" to submit a dispute to ICSID settlement, under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, can properly be established by reading written consent into the BIT by operation of an MFN clause from another BIT where such written consent is manifest.\n\n196.\n\nThe requirement of written consent is invariably derived from more than one text. A respondent's written consent usually takes the form of a treaty commitment. A claimant's written consent usually takes the form of an undertaking made on the submission of a request for arbitration. There is no reason of principle why a respondent's written consent cannot be based, in a given case, by written consent evident in one treaty being read into another, provided that there is a proper basis for reading such consent across.\n\n197.\n\nIn the present circumstances, there is no impropriety in resort to the MFN clause to find the Respondent's written consent as conveyed in an analogue BIT. The Respondent's written consent is manifest in that other BIT. It is properly read into the France - Hungary BIT by operation of the MFN clause.\n\n**I. Context of other provisions in this Treaty**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nArticles 4(3), 4(4) and 5(3) provide as follows:\n\n\"3. Such treatment shall not, however, include privileges which may be extended by a Contracting Party to investors of a third State by virtue of its participation in or association with a free trade area, customs union, common market or any other form of regional economic organization.\n\n4. This Agreement shall not extend to privileges accorded by one of the Contracting Parties to any third State, by virtue of a convention for the avoidance of double taxation or any other convention on taxation.\n\n\u2026\n\n3. Investors of either Contracting Party, whose investments have suffered losses as a result of a war or any other armed conflict, state of national emergency or uprising in the territory or maritime zones of the other Contracting Party, shall be accorded by the latter Party treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of the most favoured nation. They shall, in any event, receive adequate compensation.\"\n\n199.\n\nThe exceptions in Article 4(3) and 4(4) of the Treaty make exceptions to the MFN for specific scenarios as they are also found often in MFN clauses of other BITs: regional economic organizations and conventions on taxation. In such circumstances the application of an MFN clause would result in extending these economic organizations and tax conventions to non-participating states which the participating other states want to avoid.\n\n200.\n\nThese two express exceptions to the MFN clause are of a kind that they cannot be used to say that any other exceptions were not possible if they are not mentioned here. Therefore they cannot provide an *argumentum e contrario* to be used to argue that no further exceptions are possible to the application of the MFN clause.\n\n201.\n\nOn the other hand, the additional MFN-scope provided by Article 5(3) also cannot be used for the contrary conclusion to say that 4(1) cannot be used to import arbitration from other BITs, because such an import would have to be mentioned by an additional clause in the same way as in 5(3). The scenarios addressed in Article 5(3) such as war and national emergency are so specific that, on the basis of general public international law, it would be doubtful whether and in which way the MFN clause might be applicable. Article 5(3) clarifies that.\n\n202.\n\nThese three other provisions deal with very specific scenarios which make their express inclusion in the Treaty plausible. Thus, from these provisions in our Treaty, no conclusions can be drawn for our question either in favor or against an import of arbitration via the MFN clause. This interpretation for the Treaty at hand is confirmed in general by the ILC Report's conclusion (IV.3.d.ii) that the *expressio unius* principle may be helpful but not decisive.195\n\nCLA-0114.\n\n**J. Application of the MFN clause to import arbitration provisions**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nIt seems to be undisputed that MFN provisions cannot be interpreted as completely open ended. This is confirmed by the 2015 ILC Report196 referring to draft Article 14 of the 1978 ILC Draft Articles.\n\nCLA-0114, para. 165.\n\n204.\n\nHowever, in the present case, the question is more limited: whether MFN clauses are capable of importing arbitration clauses from other BITs. In this regard, the present Tribunal agrees with the 2015 ILC Report:\n\n\"Although controversial in some of the earlier decisions of tribunals, there is little doubt that in principle MFN provisions are capable of applying to the dispute settlement provisions of BITs.\"197\n\nCLA-0114, para. 162.\n\n205.\n\nFor the present case, it is not necessary to decide whether this conclusion is also correct if the BIT includes no arbitration clause at all. The Treaty at hand does include an arbitration clause in Article 9(2). The only question is whether the scope of that clause can be extended to provide jurisdiction not only to expropriation measures, but also to FET. For this more limited question, indeed, there can be no doubt that, in principle, the MFN clause in the Treaty is capable of importing such an extension from another BIT.\n\n**K. No renegotiation after 10 years under Article 12**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nAccording to Article 12, the Treaty could have been re-negotiated 10 years after it entered into force. This would have been an opportunity for both parties to suggest to change Article 9 and turn it into an unlimited arbitration clause. The parties to the Treaty did not do so. At the relevant time, they do not seem to have been aware of any initiation of an arbitration, and even less of the MFN issue in this context. And even if they were aware, they might not have considered any need to renegotiate Article 9, because they understood the MFN clause to be applicable. Therefore, the automatic continuation of the Treaty according to Article 12 cannot be seen as a reason for or against the application of the MFN clause for the import of a settlement provision from another BIT.\n\n**L. Relevant jurisprudence of other tribunals**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nIn view of the large body of jurisprudence of other tribunals on the issue at hand, i.e. the application of MFN clauses to dispute settlement, and as the Parties have extensively argued on that jurisprudence, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to examine the relevance of that jurisprudence for its present case, in particular whether it gives cause to reconsider any of the above conclusions.\n\n208.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal recalls from its considerations above that in any event it is undisputed that the decisions of other tribunals are not binding on this Tribunal. The many references by the Parties to certain arbitral decisions in their pleadings do not contradict this conclusion.\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no need to comment on all decisions dealing with the disputed issue. The most recent and well researched summary of the relevant jurisprudence is again provided by the 2015 ILC Report. From this Report, the Tribunal, taking into account the wording of Article 4(1) of the Treaty at hand, considers the following conclusions on the practice of the various tribunal decisions as relevant:\n\n\"195. Aside from the different interpretative approaches already identified, there appears to be a certain commonality in the interpretation of certain types of wording in MFN clauses.\n\n196. First, where the MFN clause provides simply for \"treatment no less favourable\" without any qualification that arguably expands the scope of the treatment to be accorded, tribunals have invariably refused to interpret such a provision as including dispute settlement.\n\n197. Second, where the MFN clause contains clauses that refer to 'all treatment' or 'all matters' governed by the treaty, tribunals have tended to accord a broad interpretation to these clauses, and to find that they apply to dispute resolution provisions. In only one case has a broadly worded clause not been treated as applying to dispute settlement.\n\n198. Third, where the MFN clause qualifies the treatment to be received by reference to 'use', 'management', 'maintenance', 'enjoyment', 'disposal', and 'utilization', a majority of tribunals have found that such clauses are broad enough to include dispute resolution provisions.\n\n199. Fourth, in the two cases which link MFN directly to fair and equitable treatment, neither concluded that the clause covers dispute settlement provisions.\n\n200. Fifth, in the cases where a territorial limitation has been placed on an MFN clause, the result has been mixed. Some cases have concluded that the territorial limitation is irrelevant to deciding whether dispute resolution provisions are concerned, while others have held that a territorial limitation clause prevents the inclusion of international dispute settlement provisions within an MFN clause.\n\n201. Sixth, in no case where MFN clauses limit their application to investors or investments \"in like circumstances\" or \"in similar situations\" has a tribunal treated as relevant the question of whether the clause applies to dispute settlement provisions.\n\n202. Such an analysis indicates past practice, and does not constitute a statement about how cases will be decided in the future. Since investment tribunals are ad hoc bodies and since the exact provisions and context of MFN clauses vary, it is impossible to tell in advance how the members will decide, even if some or all of the individuals have already decided cases involving MFN provisions. However, where MFN clauses are capable of a broader interpretation, it appears that tribunals are more inclined to treat them as applying to dispute settlement provisions. In the Study Group's view, this provides preliminary guidance to States on how particular wording might be treated by tribunals.\"198\n\nCLA-0114, paras. 195 *et seq*.\n\n210.\n\nFrom these summaries, the second, third, and fifth scenarios seem to be of particular interest in view of the specific wording of Article 4(1) of the Treaty at hand. They confirm the ILC Study Group's conclusion that *where MFN clauses are capable of a broader interpretation, it appears that tribunals are more inclined to treat them as applying to dispute settlement provisions*.\n\n211.\n\nIn the view of the present Tribunal, the broad wording of Article 4(1) of the Treaty is covered by this conclusion. It shows that the interpretation the present Tribunal has given to Article 4(1) above is confirmed, but certainly not discredited, by the earlier jurisprudence of other tribunals on this issue.\n\n212.\n\nFor plausible reasons, the Parties in the present dispute have particularly commented on the Decision in the *Rosinvest* case,199 because the presiding member of the present Tribunal also chaired the Tribunal in *Rosinvest*. In view of the extensive representations of the Parties, the Tribunal feels it should comment briefly on these arguments of the Parties.\n\nCLA-0128.\n\n213.\n\nAt the outset again, it should be emphasized that no member of a tribunal is bound by the views it took in an earlier case, particularly if dealing with another BIT and involving different states. And it is also noted that the Award in *Rosinvest* expressly limits its conclusions to the specific circumstances of that case and the two BITs relevant in that dispute (section 137). Further, the Tribunal notes that the Hungary-France BIT in the present dispute and the Russia-UK BIT in *Rosinvest* are different in many ways. On the other hand, there are some common features with regard to the dispute resolution and MFN clauses: In both BITs, the States included arbitration clauses, but limited them in their scope. And for both BITs it is clear that the limitation resulted from one State insisting on it (Hungary and Russia) and the other (France and the UK) accepting it, resulting in a clear consent of both States on the limitations of the scope of the respective arbitration clauses. And in both cases we have no evidence that the two States, when negotiating the BIT, discussed or at least considered whether the MFN clause could extend the limits of the scope of arbitration. The MFN issue therefore was and is in both cases whether the MFN clause can go beyond this consent by importing arbitration clauses from later BITs to the effect that arbitration jurisdiction has to be accepted beyond the originally agreed limited scopes of the express arbitration clauses. Further, the nature of the limitations is not very different in both cases: In *Rosinvest* it excludes whether an expropriation occurred and in the present case whether the FET standard has been breached. The different wording of the MFN clauses in Article 4(1) of the Hungary-France BIT and Article 3 of the UK-Russia BIT in *Rosinvest* also do not seem to require different results. Therefore, while not all other details are identical or similar, the above common features would speak in favor of a similar result in both cases.\n\n214.\n\nWith regard to the other decisions of tribunals referred to by the Parties, while the issue of MFN application is a common feature, just as in *Rosinvest*, they had to deal with other BITs, between other states, and with no identical wording and context as found in Articles 9, 4 and 5 of the BIT in the present case. This also applies to the most recent decision of the Appeal Court Stockholm in the *Quasar de Valores* case (reported in GAR 23.1.2016) which the present Tribunal only refers to for completeness without relying on it as the Parties in the present case have not had an opportunity to comment on it. The Tribunal agrees with the final conclusion of the ILC Report:\n\n\"Whether MFN clauses are to encompass dispute settlement provisions is ultimately up to the States that negotiate such clauses. Explicit language can ensure that an MFN provision does or does not apply to dispute settlement provisions. Otherwise the matter will be left to dispute settlement tribunals to interpret MFN clauses on a case-by-case basis.\"200\n\nCLA-0114, para. 216.\n\n215.\n\nFor its case at hand, in view of the above considerations, the Tribunal comes to the result that, while its conclusions are not in full agreement with those of all other tribunals which have addressed the disputed issue, its conclusions in the present case not only represent its own best judgement of the matter, but also are consistent with the modern development of the jurisprudence as so well summarized by the ILC Report of 2015.\n\n**M. The Tribunal's jurisdiction regarding Article 3 of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nAfter its above conclusion that the MFN clause in Article 4(1) may indeed serve to import the extension of the Tribunal's jurisdiction beyond the limit provided in Article 9(1) and (2), the Tribunal now turns to the implementation of that conclusion.\n\n217.\n\nThe Respondent, in its Counter-Memorial, requests the Tribunal as follows:\n\n\"To decline jurisdiction over this dispute with respect to Claimants' claims under Article 3 of the BIT due to the absence of Respondent's consent to ICSID jurisdiction over such claims.\"201\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 307(a). See also Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 37.\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimants, in their Post-Hearing Brief, request the Tribunal to:\n\n\u2022 \"Reject the Respondent's jurisdictional objections in their entirety;\"202 and\n\n\u2022 \"Decide that it has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims relating to Article 3 of the France-Hungary BIT\".203\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 66.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 66.\n\n219.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's question in Procedural Order No. 3, in their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants explained that they now rely solely on the more favorable dispute settlement provisions contained in the Lithuania-Hungary BIT. For this selection, the Claimants provided the following considerations:\n\n\u2022 \"First, unlike the consent to arbitration found in Article 9(2) (alone) of the France-Hungary BIT, the Lithuania-Hungary BIT contains consent to the submission of '[a]ny dispute' to arbitration. This consent took effect immediately. The Claimants would therefore have the option to pursue their FET claims through international arbitration.\n\n\u2022 Second, unlike certain other BITs concluded by the Respondent, the Lithuania-Hungary BIT does not impose a requirement to exhaust local remedies. It requires 'negotiations' to have continued for 'a period of six months', but it does not oblige an investor to submit disputes to the domestic courts prior to commencing arbitration.\n\n\u2022 Third, unlike the Respondent's BITs with certain other countries, the dispute settlement clause in the Lithuania-Hungary BIT does not contain a 'fork-in-the-road' provision.\n\n\u2022 For the avoidance of doubt, and subject to the caveat set out in section 2.3.3 below, the Claimants do not rely upon the FET provisions in the Hungary-Lithuania BIT (or any other third State treaty). The Claimants rely solely on the more favourable treatment granted to Lithuanian investors under Article 8 (dispute resolution) of the Lithuania-Hungary BIT.\"204\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 7.\n\n220.\n\nArticle 8 of Hungary's BIT with Lithuania provides as follows:\n\n\"Article 8\n\nSettlement of Investment Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of the other Contracting Party\n\nAny dispute which may arise between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment in the territory of that other Contracting Party shall be subject to negotiations between the parties in dispute.\n\nIf any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party cannot be thus settled within a period of six months, the investor shall be entitled to submit the case either to:\n\n/a/ the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) having regard to the applicable provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington D.C. on 18 March 1965, in the event both Contracting Parties shall have become a party to this Convention; or\n\n/b/ an arbitrator or international ad hoc arbitral tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The parties to the dispute may agree in writing to modify these Rules. The arbitral awards shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute.\"\n\n221.\n\nTaking into account its considerations above in this Decision, and that the BIT with Lithuania also includes an FET provision, the Tribunal agrees that the Respondent's consent to international arbitration of \"any dispute\" with Lithuanian investors constituted (and constitutes) more favorable treatment, and this treatment was automatically accorded to the Claimants by virtue of the MFN provisions contained in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n222.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal's jurisdiction includes disputes concerning the Respondent's breach of its obligation to accord the Claimants' investments fair and equitable treatment under Article 3 of the Treaty, and is not limited to the Respondent's breach of its obligations concerning expropriation under Article 5(2).\n\n**N. Costs**\n------------\n\n223.\n\nIn their Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction and Response to Request for Bifurcation, the Claimants request the Tribunal to:\n\n\"Order the Respondent to pay the Claimants' costs, including legal fees, incurred as a result of any eventual bifurcation of these proceedings\".205\n\nReply, para. 162.\n\n224.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\n\"Award Hungary all of the costs and expenses incurred in these proceedings, including attorney's fees\".206\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 307.\n\n225.\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to:\n\n\"Order the Respondent to pay the Claimants' costs, including legal fees, incurred as a result of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections and the bifurcation of these proceedings.\"207\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 66.\n\n226.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent submits that \"if [Hungary] is successful, the Claimants should be required to bear the full costs associated with the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings.\"208 The Respondent also asserts that, \"in the event that Hungary is not successful in these proceedings... it would be most appropriate for the Tribunal to reserve its decision on costs until the Final Award.\"209\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35.\n\n227.\n\nUsing the option provided in Article 28 of the ICSID Rules, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to decide on the costs related to the bifurcation and procedure regarding the Preliminary Issues at a later stage of the procedure.\n\n**O. Decisions**\n----------------\n\n228.\n\n**For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides and declares as follows:**\n\n**i. The Respondent's objections against the Tribunal's jurisdiction regarding the claims for alleged breach of Article 3 of the Treaty between Hungary and France are dismissed.**\n\n**ii. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over all the claims raised.**\n\n**iii. The decision on costs is reserved for a later stage of the procedure.**"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2018-10-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **FREQUENTLY USED ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS** | |\n| **Short Form** | **Long Title** |\n| \u00a7 / \u00a7\u00a7 | paragraph / paragraphs; section / sections |\n| AETR / EUFE | Association des Emetteurs de Titres de Restauration / \u00c9tkez\u00e9si Utal\u00e1vany Forgalmaz\u00f3l Egyes\u00fcl\u00e9s |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of 10 April 2006 |\n| BIT | Bilateral Investment Treaty |\n| C-# | Claimants' Exhibit |\n| C-I | Claimants' Memorial on the Merits (19 January 2015) |\n| C-II | Claimants' Reply on the Merits (11 April 2016) |\n| CEX-# | Claimants' Expert Report |\n| CJEU | Court of Justice of the European Union |\n| CLA-# | Claimants' Legal Exhibit |\n| CPHB-I | Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief (22 September 2017) |\n| CWS-# | Claimants' Witness Statement |\n| EC | European Commission |\n| EU | European Union |\n| ICSID | The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (18 March 1965) |\n| KIM | Ministry of Public Administration and Justice |\n| MNUA | Hungarian National Recreation Fund *(Magyar Nemzeti \u00dcd\u00fcl\u00e9si Alapitvany)* |\n| PIT | Personal Income Tax |\n| PIT Law | Hungarian Act CXVII of 1995 on Personal Income Tax |\n| PO-# | Procedural Order No. # |\n| POS | Point of Sale |\n| PSZAF | Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority |\n| R-# | Respondent's Exhibit |\n| R-I | Respondent's Counter Memorial (17 July 2015) |\n| R-II | Hungary's Rejoinder (21 July 2016) |\n| REX-# | Respondent's Expert Report |\n| RfA | Claimants' Request for Arbitration (3 December 2013) |\n| RLA-# | Respondent's Legal Exhibit |\n| RPHB-I | Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief (22 September 2017) |\n| RWS-# | Respondent's Witness Statement |\n| SZ\u00c9P Card | Szechenyi Recreational Card |\n| UNCLOS | United National Convention on the Law of the Sea (10 December 1982) |\n| TEC | Treaty on the Establishing the European Community |\n| TEEC | Treaty Establishing the European Economic Community |\n| TFEU | Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union |\n| VCLT | Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (23 May 1969) |\n| Vyroba | Le Cheque D\u00e9jeuner Vyroba - Vyroba, s.r.o. |\n| WACC | Weighted Average of the Cost of Equity and the Cost of Debt |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **DRAMATIS PERSONAE** | |\n| **Name** | **Position** |\n| Mr. Gordon Bajnai | Leader of Socialist Government (2008) |\n| Dr. \u00c1d\u00e1m Balog | Deputy Under-Secretary of Economic Development |\n| Mr. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balogh | Vice President, the PSZAF |\n| Commissioner Michael Barnier | EC Commissioner |\n| Mr. B\u00e1lint Bessenyey | Sodexo representative |\n| Ms. Anne Boddaert | Claimants' representative |\n| Mr. Anthony Charlton | FTI Expert (First FTI Report, CEX-1) |\n| Mr. Benedek D\u00e9r | Managing Director of Le Cheque D\u00e9jeuner Deutschland GmbH (author of CWS-1) Commercial and Sales Director of CD Hungary, 2002 - 2012 |\n| Mr. Pierre Gagnoud | Edenred representative |\n| Dr. Zolt\u00e1n Guller | President of the Board of Trustees of MNUA (author of RWS-1, RWS-3) Became the KIM Commissioner responsible for Erzs\u00e9bet programme on 31 August 2012 |\n| Mr. Endre Horv\u00e1th | Deputy Minister of State (economic development) (Hungary) |\n| Mr. Zolt\u00e1n Horv\u00e1th | Deputy President of the Hungarian Competition Authority |\n| Mr. Brent C.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. THE DISPUTE**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") pursuant to the bilateral investment treaty between France and Hungary (the \"BIT\"), which entered into force on 30 September 1987, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\"). Claimants also rely on the bilateral investment treaty between Hungary and Croatia, which entered into force on 1 March 2002, and the bilateral investment treaty between Hungary and Lithuania, which entered into force on 20 May 2003.1\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Brief filed after the Hearing on Jurisdiction, however, Claimants assert that they rely solely on the Hungary-Lithuania BIT. *See* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 7.\n\n2.\n\nClaimants in these proceedings are UP, formerly known as Le Cheque D\u00e9jeuner (\"LCD\"), a cooperative company *(soci\u00e9t\u00e9 cooperative de production \u00e1 forme anonyme et capital variable)* incorporated under the laws of France, and C.D Holding Internationale (\"CD Internationale\"), a simplified joint stock company (*soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions simplifi\u00e9e*) wholly owned by UP and organized under the laws of France (collectively the \"Claimants\").2\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 9 - 12; Kbis excerpt (certificate of incorporation), LCD (16 October 2013); Kbis excerpt (certificate of incorporation), LCD (13 January 2015) **[C-0002]** ; Constitutive instrument, CD Hungary (13 November 1996) **[C-0003]** ; Kbis excerpt (certificate of incorporation), CD Internationale (12 September 2013) ; Kbis excerpt (certificate of incorporation), CD Internationale (13 January 2015) **[C-0004]**.\n\n3.\n\nRespondent is Hungary (the \"Respondent\"), a sovereign state.\n\n4.\n\nThe Parties' dispute concerns Respondent's 2011 reforms of its tax and other laws (\"2011 Reform\") and Claimants' unwillingness or inability to continue business in Respondent State as a result. Claimants allege that the 2011 Reform was in violation of the BIT. Respondent argues that Claimants' claims are unfounded on the merits.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S TERMINOLOGY AND REASONING**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully examined all the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties throughout these proceedings. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to reiterate in this Award all such arguments or evidence, which are well-known to the Parties. Further, insofar as any matter has not been specifically identified or recorded in the body of this Award, this does not mean that it has not been taken into full consideration. The Tribunal discusses only those submissions which it considers most relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal's reasons, without repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties, address what the Tribunal considers to be the determinative factors required to decide on the Requests of the Parties.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal's use of one Party's terminology is without prejudice and in no way reflects the Tribunal's understanding of a particular issue. Rather, effort has been made to use consistent terminology throughout this Award to facilitate understanding. Likewise, the order in which the references are presented is not a reflection of a particular source's value in the eyes of the Tribunal. Instead, effort has been made to format the footnotes consistently.\n\n**II. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 26 February 2014, Claimants proposed the appointment of The Honourable L. Yves Fortier, PC CC OQ QC (Canadian) as arbitrator. He accepted the appointment on 6 March 2014. His contact details are as follows:\n\nMr. L. Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC  \nCabinet Yves Fortier  \n1 Place Ville Marie - Suite 2822  \nMontr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec) H3B 1R4  \nCanada  \nTel.: +1 514 286 2013  \nFax: +1 514 286 2019  \nEmail: vves.fortier@,vfortier.ca\n\n8.\n\nOn 28 March 2014, Respondent proposed the appointment of Sir Daniel Bethlehem, KCMG QC (British) as arbitrator. ICSID notified the Parties of his acceptance of this appointment on 1 April 2014. Sir Daniel's details are as follows:\n\nSir Daniel Bethlehem QC  \n20 Essex Street  \nLondon WC2R 3AL, UK  \nTel.: +44 20 7842 1200  \nFax: +44 20 7842 1268  \nEmail: DBethlehem@20essexst.com\n\n9.\n\nOn 25 June 2014, the Parties informed ICSID of their agreement to appoint Prof. Dr. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel (German) as the President of the Tribunal. On 30 June 2014, ICSID informed the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments. Prof. B\u00f6ckstiegel\u2019s contact details are as follows:\n\nProf. Dr. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel  \nParkstr. 38  \nD-51427 Bergisch Gladbach, Germany  \nTel.: +49 (0)2204 66268  \nFax: +49 (0)2204 21812  \nEmail: kh@khboeckstiegel.com\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Procedural History contained in the Tribunal's Decision on Preliminary Issues of Jurisdiction of 3 March 2016 is incorporated herein. For ease of reference, however, some major procedural events are noted, below.\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 December 2013, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from LCD and CD Internationale against Hungary (\"RfA\"). ICSID registered the RfA in accordance with Art. 36(3) of the ICSID Convention on 23 December 2013.\n\n12.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with representatives of the Parties was held on 12 September 2014. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that they had no objection to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nOn 8 October 2014, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO-1\")**.\n\n14.\n\nOn 19 January 2015, Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits (\"C-I\") and accompanying documents.\n\n15.\n\nOn 17 July 2015, Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Objections to Jurisdiction (\"R-I\") and requested bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n16.\n\nOn 23 October 2015, Claimants filed a Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction and Response to Request for Bifurcation.\n\n17.\n\nOn 12 November 2015, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2 (\"PO-2\")**, by which it decided that the proceedings would be bifurcated and the Tribunal's jurisdiction would be determined as a preliminary issue.\n\n18.\n\nOn 13 and 14 January 2016, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction with the Parties at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London, United Kingdom.\n\n19.\n\nOn 19 January 2016, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 3 (\"PO-3\")**, requesting that the Parties submit their corrections to the hearing transcript by 22 January 2016 and submit their post-hearing briefs by 5 February 2016.\n\n20.\n\nOn 22 January 2016, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 4 (\"PO-4\")**, containing the Tribunal's decisions on the Parties' document production requests and ordering the Parties to produce the relevant documents by 12 February 2016.\n\n21.\n\nOn 3 March 2016, the Tribunal issued its **Decision on Preliminary Issues of Jurisdiction**. Claimants consented to the publication of the decision by email on 9 March 2016 but, on 11 March 2016, Respondent refused consent to publish the decision.\n\n22.\n\nOn 1 April 2016, the Tribunal accepted the Parties' revised timetable, based on PO-1 Annex A.\n\n23.\n\nOn 7 April 2016, the Tribunal requested the Parties' permission to appoint Dr. Katherine Simpson as Assistant to the Tribunal, pursuant to Section 3.6 of PO-1. The Tribunal submitted Dr. Simpson's CV and Declaration to the Parties for their review and comment.\n\n24.\n\nOn 11 April 2016, Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits (\"C-II\"), together with supporting documentation, to the Tribunal.\n\n25.\n\nOn 18 April 2016, ICSID informed the Parties that Dr. Simpson's appointment was effective.\n\n26.\n\nOn 21 July 2016, Respondent submitted \"Hungary's Rejoinder\" (\"R-II\"), together with supporting documentation, to the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal in response to C-II and to Claimants' claims concerning the adequacy of Respondent's document production in connection with Claimants' Requests No. 5-7. Respondent stated that it undertook a \"*reasonable search*\" and was unable to locate any documents responsive to the requests, as modified. Respondent argued that Claimants' request for the Tribunal to draw an adverse presumption was not justified.\n\n28.\n\nOn 4 August 2016, Claimants submitted \"Claimants' Second Request for the Production of Documents\" to the Tribunal.\n\n29.\n\nOn 5 August 2016, the Tribunal responded to Respondent's 29 July 2016 letter stating that it did not see any need for action.\n\n30.\n\nOn 8 August 2016, Respondent wrote in opposition to Claimants' document request.\n\n31.\n\nOn 11 August 2016, the Tribunal wrote in reference to the Parties' communications regarding document requests. The Tribunal clarified that, with its letter of 5 August 2016, it had neither accepted nor rejected Respondent's explanations regarding Requests No. 5-7. The Tribunal indicated that it would address Claimants' submission of 4 August 2016 and Respondent's letters of 29 July and 8 August 2016 in its 22 September 2016 decision on the Parties' second requests for production of documents, as planned in PO-1.\n\n32.\n\nOn 1 September 2016, Claimants sent their revised \"Second Request for the Production of Documents\" to the Tribunal.\n\n33.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 5 Regarding the Parties' Second Requests for Document Production (\"PO-5\")**.\n\n34.\n\nOn 5 October 2016, the Tribunal sent its draft of **Procedural Order No. 6 Regarding the Hearing on the Merits (\"PO-6\")** to the Parties, for their review and comment by 12 October 2016. On 12 and 13 October 2016, the Parties sent their comments to the draft of PO-6 to the Tribunal.\n\n35.\n\nOn 16 October 2016, the Tribunal issued PO-6 and Annex A and informed the Parties that the pre-hearing telephone conference that had been provisionally agreed upon would be unnecessary, due to the absence of outstanding procedural, administrative, or logistical matters.\n\n36.\n\nOn 17 October 2016, the Parties confirmed the witnesses and experts that each intended to call at the Hearing.\n\n37.\n\nOn 19 October 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to request clarification regarding Exhibit R-0013.\n\n38.\n\nOn 20 October 2016, the Parties requested that the deadline for the submission of \"*Requests to introduce produced documents into the record for use at the hearing*\" be postponed until 28 October 2016. The Tribunal granted the extension on the same day.\n\n39.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, Respondent clarified that its inclusion of Exhibit R-0013 was in error.\n\n40.\n\nOn 26 October 2016, the Tribunal requested confirmation of the order in which the witnesses would be examined at the Hearing, by 7 November 2016.\n\n41.\n\nOn 28 October 2016, Claimants submitted a \"Request to Introduce New Documents\" to the Tribunal. On 31 October 2016, the Tribunal invited Respondent to respond. Respondent responded on 2 November 2016. Taking note of Respondent's comments, the Tribunal admitted the documents on 3 November 2016.\n\n42.\n\nOn 7 and 8 November 2016, the Parties submitted their respective Hearing Proposals to the Tribunal. After considering the Parties' comments, the Tribunal decided on 9 November 2016 to adopt the first Hearing proposal submitted by Claimants.\n\n43.\n\nOn 11 November 2016, ICSID informed the Tribunal and the Parties of the logistical arrangements for the Hearing.\n\n44.\n\nOn 11 November 2016, Respondent informed the Tribunal that Mr. Szatm\u00e1ry would be available to testify on 6 and 7 December 2016, as needed, and requested that the Tribunal amend the Hearing time.\n\n45.\n\nOn 13 November 2016, the Tribunal invited Claimants to comment on Respondent's submission on the Hearing schedule.\n\n46.\n\nOn 14 November 2016, Claimants wrote in reference to Mr. Szatm\u00e1ry's availability and submitted an amended Hearing schedule to the Tribunal. Claimants also notified the Tribunal of a change in representation and provided the Tribunal an updated list of exhibits including its new submissions Exhibits C-0171 to C-0188.\n\n47.\n\nOn 15 November 2016, the Tribunal adopted an amended Hearing schedule.\n\n48.\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Respondent submitted a redlined version of Dr. Guller's witness statement, seeking only to correct footnote numbering, and an application to submit Exhibit R-0013 to the Tribunal.\n\n49.\n\nAfter considering Claimants' 24 November 2016 response to Respondent's motion, the Tribunal admitted Exhibit R-0013 on 26 November 2016.\n\n50.\n\nOn 28 November 2016, Claimants added three people to their list of participants. On the same day, Respondent raised concerns regarding Mr. David Pusztai's attendance at the Hearing. The Tribunal invited the Parties' responses the following day.\n\n51.\n\nOn 30 November 2016, Respondent submitted a letter-memorial clarifying its objection to Mr. Pusztai's involvement in the case. Claimants wrote in response, mentioning that counsel had terminated Mr. Pusztai's internship contract. As a result, the Tribunal determined, on the same date, that no further action would be required from it.\n\n52.\n\nOn 3 December 2016, the Chairman informed counsel that, due to illness, he would be unable to be physically present at the Hearing. To preserve the Hearing Dates, the Chairman proposed that, in his absence, the Hearing could continue if the Parties were to consent. While Claimants consented to the proposal, Respondent objected to the Hearing being conducted in the absence of the Chairman. As a result, the Hearing was cancelled and the Parties and the Tribunal immediately began discussing available alternate Hearing dates.\n\n53.\n\nOn 7 December 2016, the Tribunal - having found no other available 4-day periods - invited the Parties to block 22 - 25 May 2017 for a Hearing in London. The following day, Claimants objected to the later Hearing date and urged the Tribunal to again try to find a more suitable date. Respondent accepted the 22 - 25 May 2017 period.\n\n54.\n\nOn 9 December 2016, the Tribunal asked Claimants to confirm whether - despite Claimants' objection to the lateness of the Hearing - those dates would nonetheless be a possibility for Claimants. Claimants confirmed their availability to hold the Hearing on the proposed dates in May 2017.\n\n55.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 7 Regarding the New Dates for the Hearing on the Merits (\"PO-7\")**.\n\n56.\n\nOn 18 January 2017, the Tribunal - considering that the Parties have relied on numerous arbitration awards, none of which are binding on the present proceedings - wrote to the Parties to request that Respondent submit a copy of the *Edenred* Award under cover of a confidentiality order for use in the present proceedings. The Tribunal considered that the Parties should be given the opportunity to comment on that Award before the Hearing in May.\n\n57.\n\nOn 30 January 2017, Respondent requested that the Tribunal reconsider its request that Respondent submit the *Edenred* Award to the Tribunal. On the following day, the Tribunal requested Claimants' comments on Respondent's request.\n\n58.\n\nOn 6 February 2017, Claimants responded that they opposed Respondent's objection and agreed with the Tribunal's request for production of the *Edenred* Award.\n\n59.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, and after taking the Parties' views into consideration, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 8 on confidentiality (\"PO-8\")** and **Procedural Order No. 9 (\"PO-9\") on document production**, ordering Respondent to produce the *Edenred* Award and granting the Parties until 24 March 2017 to simultaneously submit their respective comments on that Award.\n\n60.\n\nOn 24 February 2017, Respondent produced the *Edenred* Award to the Tribunal and to Claimants.\n\n61.\n\nOn 24 March 2017, Claimants requested an extension - until 27 March 2017 - to submit their comments on the *Edenred* Award. The Tribunal granted this extension on the same day.\n\n62.\n\nOn 27 March 2017, the Parties simultaneously submitted their respective comments on the *Edenred* Award to the Tribunal. While the Parties agreed that the *Edenred* case has striking similarities with the present matter, they differed on the role that the *Edenred* Award should have in the present matter.\n\n63.\n\nOn 14 April 2017, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to notify it that the CJEU was seized of the case *Slovak Republic v. Achmea*. Respondent argued that, while the decision in *Achmea* would not bind this Tribunal, it would become part of EU law and would, thus, become part of the applicable law which the Tribunal would need to consider in determining its jurisdiction. Respondent requested that the Tribunal review its jurisdiction in light of the decision in *Achmea*, once the outcome of that case became known.\n\n64.\n\nOn 21 April 2017, Claimants wrote in response to Respondent's letter of 14 April 2017, arguing that the Tribunal should consider Respondent's letter to be an untimely objection to jurisdiction. In the alternative, Claimants requested that the Tribunal order Respondent to file its full submission on the objection to jurisdiction by 28 April 2017.\n\n65.\n\nOn 22 April 2017, Respondent wrote in response to Claimants' letter of 21 April 2017 and proposed that, should the Tribunal require additional written submissions on the matter, that those be provided in the form of limited post-hearing submissions.\n\n66.\n\nOn 23 April 2017, Claimants urged the Tribunal to reject Respondent's letter of 22 April 2017 and reiterated their request of 21 April 2017.\n\n67.\n\nOn 24 April 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it required no further submissions regarding the matters presented in Respondent's letters of 14 and 22 April 2017, and Claimants' letters of 21 and 23 April 2017.\n\n68.\n\nOn 4 May 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement that the experts give presentations *in lieu* of direct examination.

RESPONDENT'S REQUESTS**\n----------------------------\n\n102.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial (\"R-I\"), Respondent made the following requests:\n\n*307. Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth above, Hungary respectfully requests that the Tribunal:*\n\n*a. Decline jurisdiction over this dispute with respect to Claimants' claims under Article 3 of the BIT due to the absence of Respondent's consent to ICSID jurisdiction over such claims;*\n\n*b. Dismiss all of Claimants' claims under Article 5(2) of the BIT;*\n\n*c. In the event the Tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction over the claim under Article 3, to dismiss those claims in their entirety; and*\n\n*d. Award Hungary all of the costs and expenses incurred in these proceedings, including attorneys' fees.*7\n\nR-I \u00a7 307.\n\n103.\n\nIn its Rejoinder (\"R-II\"), Respondent requested the Tribunal to:\n\n*(1) Dismiss all of the Claimants' claims under Article 5(2) and Article 3 of the BIT;*\n\n*(2) Award Hungary all of the costs and expenses incurred in these proceedings, including attorneys' fees.*8\n\nR-II \u00a7 356.\n\n104.\n\nRespondent's 2 May 2018 letter regarding the *Achmea* Decision contained the following request for relief:\n\n*94. For the foregoing reasons, Hungary requests the Tribunal to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate this dispute owing to the preclusion of Article 9(2) of the BIT. In the alternative Hungary requests the Tribunal to find that it is barred from exercising any jurisdiction it may have and from rendering an award on the merits of this case.9*\n\nRespondent's Letter (2 May 2018).\n\n**V. STATEMENT OF FACTS**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. SUMMARY OF THE FACTS**\n---------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe following summary is based on the submissions from the Parties, and is without prejudice as to their relevance for the decisions of the Tribunal.\n\n106.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"*fringe benefits*\" refer to remuneration other than wages that are paid to employees as part of their compensation packages. Historically, Respondent has used vouchers - \"*a subsidy that grants limited purchasing power to an individual to choose among a restricted set of goods and services*\" - to facilitate the provision of fringe benefits.10 The employers' incentive to buy vouchers, and the employees' incentive to use them, hinges on preferential tax treatment. Unlike standard cash compensation, vouchers are either tax exempt (both from payroll tax for employers and income tax for employees) or are taxed at a lower rate, within a determined limit.11 Through the use of vouchers, the government can achieve specific social goals by encouraging employees to consume particular goods and services, and employers can incentivize employees through a means other than wages.12\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 22 - 23; G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Fajth and Judit Lakatos, *Fringe Benefits in Transition in Hungary*, *in* Enterprise and Social Benefits After Communism 167 (Martin Rein et al. eds., 1997) 167 **[RLA-0221]** ; Martin Rein, Barry L.

Eugene Steuerle, *Common Issues for Voucher Programs*, in Vouchers and the Provision of Public Services 3, 4 (C. Eugene Steuerle et al. eds., 2000) **[RLA-0235]**.\n\n107.\n\nIn 1989, meal vouchers were introduced in Hungary as an alternative for companies that could not provide employees a canteen.13 Respondent states that \"*the meal voucher originated in pursuit of a social good in recognition of the fact that a healthy and well-fed workforce is more productive*.\"14\n\nKPMG report, Meal Voucher Reform in Hungary (2012) **[R-0024]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 24.\n\n108.\n\nThe fringe voucher business consists of the following sequence: (1) an issuer (like CD Hungary) sells vouchers to employers at face value, plus a commission; (2) the employer gives vouchers to employees as part of a broader compensation package; (3) employees use their vouchers to pay for goods and services at affiliates that have entered into an agreement with the issuer to accept such vouchers as payment; and (4) the affiliates claim payment from the issuer for the face value of the collected vouchers, minus a commission. Issuers derive revenues from: (1) the commissions charged to employers and affiliates; (2) investments made during the period between voucher issuance to employers and reimbursement to affiliates; and (3) unclaimed vouchers (such as lost or expired vouchers), the face value of which is retained by the issuer.15 According to Respondent, this carries the risk that issuers operate as banks and could be unable to meet payment obligations on demand.16 Claimants contest this and argue that although capital requirements were not mandated, Claimants would have complied with such had they existed.17\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 87 - 95; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 26 - 32; Sample CD Hungary vouchers **[C-0041]** ; Contract between CD Hungary and Tesco-Global ZRT (as amended) (14 February 2011) **[C-0042]** ; Extract from Internal CD Hungary presentation (31 October 2006) [ **C-0043]** ; Extract from Mazars Summary Notes on CD Hungary, \"Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner Kft., Hungary\", dated 31 December 2009, 31 December 2010, and 31 December 2011 - 31 December 2013 **[C-0044]** ; Witness Statement of Mr. Benedek D\u00e9r (19 January 2015) [hereinafter \"D\u00e9r Statement\"], \u00a7\u00a7 10 - 15 **[CWS-1]** ; Witness Statement of Ms. M\u00e1rta Nagy (19 January 2015) [hereinafter \"First Nagy Statement\"], \u00a7\u00a7 8 - 17, 22 **[CWS-2]** ; Witness Statement of Mr. Yvon Legrand (19 January 2015) [hereinafter \"Legrand Statement\"], \u00a7 11 **[CWS-3]** ; FTI Report (Mr. Anthony Charlton) (19 January 2015) [hereinafter \"First FTI Report\"], \u00a7\u00a7 4.45, 4.61, 4.65 **[CEX-1]** ; KPMG report, Meal Voucher Reform in Hungary (2012) **[R-0024]** ; HM Revenue & Customs, Luncheon Vouchers: Repeal of Relief **[RLA-0110]**.\n\nC-II \u00a7 44; R-I \u00a7 54; Janos Kun, On Cash Substitutes (A study), \u00a7 3.2.8 Meal voucher, holiday voucher **[R-0003]** ; Witness Statement of Dr. Zolt\u00e1n Guller (10 July 2015) Revised (re-submitted 23 November 2016) [hereinafter \"First Guller Statement\"], \u00a7\u00a7 15, 20 **[RWS-1]** ; Witness Statement of Mr. Krist\u00f3f Szatm\u00e1ry (15 July 2015) [hereinafter \"Szatm\u00e1ry Statement\"], \u00a7 13 **[RWS-2]**.\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 45 - 49; J.

Respondent states that it was also believed that issuers would be able to make a profit in approximately three years.73 Claimants have stated that there is no evidence of any review or structural problems and, regardless, that the measures undertaken by Respondent were not necessary to fix the alleged problems.74\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 67, 231; R-II \u00a7 63; SZ\u00c9P Card Proposal, 12 - 13, 17, 29 **[R-0008]** ; Szatm\u00e1ry Statement, \u00a7\u00a7 29 - 43 **[RWS-2]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 63; SZ\u00c9P Card Proposal, 12 - 13, 17, 29 **[R-0008]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 56; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 25 - 69.\n\n141.\n\nIn May 2011, MNUA was reorganized into a non-profit corporation wholly owned by Respondent.75\n\nC-I \u00a7 157; Respondent press release, \"Agreement on National Holiday Fund\" (25 May 2011) **[C-0082]**.\n\n142.\n\nOn 4 May 2011, Claimants and Tesco modified their contract on vouchers, retroactive to 14 February 2011.76\n\nSample CD Hungary vouchers **[C-0041]**.\n\n143.\n\nOn 2 July 2011, Dr. Bence R\u00e9tv\u00e1ri (Member of Parliament) made Speech No. 211/324 at a Plenary Session of Parliament about the duty to provide meals and free time activities to needy children in Hungary using the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher, which was then under consideration in Parliament.77\n\nSpeech No. 211/324 by Dr. Bence R\u00e9tv\u00e1ri (Plenary Session of Parliament) (2 July 2011) **[R-0052]**.\n\n144.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Claimants received the \"*First Data, Prepaid Card Issuing and POS acquiring Services indicative proposal for Le Cheque D\u00e9jeuner Hungary.*\"78\n\nFirst Data, \"Prepaid Card Issuingand [sic] POS Acquiring Services - Indicative Proposal for Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner Hungary\" (4 July 2011) **[C-0135]** ; First Data, *Prepaid Card Issuing and POS Acquiring Services Indicative* Proposal (4 July 2011) **[R-0011]**.\n\n145.\n\nOn 18 July 2011, the \"*Proposal on the Modification of Government Decree 55/2011 (IV.12) on the rules of issuance and usage of the SZ\u00c9P Card*\" was issued.79\n\nProposal on the modification of government decree 55/2011 (IV.12) on the rules of issuance and usage of Sz\u00e9chenyi Recreational Card (18 July 2011) **[R-0012]**.\n\n146.\n\nIn September 2011, a proposal re-conceptualized the SZ\u00c9P Card as an electronic wallet with different pockets - each subject to different tax-exemption caps: hotel and accommodation services (HUF 225,000 per year), restaurant services (HUF 150,000 per year); and other leisure and recreational services (HUF 75,000 per year).80 According to Claimants, the SZ\u00c9P Card's ability to be used for hot meals made it a direct competitor with CD Hungary's meal vouchers.81\n\nR-I \u00a7 72; Proposal for the Government on the reform of the system of fringe benefits (September 2011) **[R-0015]**.\n\nC-I \u00a7 144; 2011 PIT Law **[C-0074]** / **[RLA-0088]**.\n\n147.\n\nIn September 2011, CD Hungary, through AETR, attempted to participate in the preparation of the draft of the 2011 Reform.82 During the last two weeks of September 2011, AETR met on four occasions to discuss the proposed 2011 Reform.83\n\nRfA \u00a7 54.\n\nC-I \u00a7 170; AETR meeting minutes (15 September 2011) **[C-0092]** ; AETR meeting minutes (22 September 2011) **[C-0094]** ; AETR meeting minutes (26 September 2011) **[C-0095]** ; AETR meeting minutes (29 September 2011) **[C-0096]**.\n\n148.\n\nOn 22 September 2011, CD Hungary expressed concerns about the proposed 2011 Reform to the Hungarian Embassy in France.84 The French government intervened on 22 September 2011.85\n\nRfA \u00a7 54; Letter from French ambassador to Hungary, Mr. Roudaut, to Mr. Szatm\u00e1ry, Secretary of State for the Domestic Economy, dated 22 September 2011 **[RfA Exhibit C-18] / [C-0101].**\n\n*Id*.\n\n149.\n\nOn 30 September 2011, Claimants, Sodexo, and Edenred filed a complaint with the EC alleging that the proposed 2011 Reform violated the TFEU and the European Services Directive.86\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 176, 191; R-I \u00a7 88, R-II \u00a7 89, Note to the EC regarding possible changes affecting the regime of meal vouchers in Hungary (30 September 2011) **[R-0014]** ; EC memo, \"November infringements package: main decisions\" (21 November 2012) **[C-0116]**.\n\n150.\n\nOn 7 October 2011, Respondent replied to the French Government's intervention of 22 September 2011, stating that the criteria for issuing the SZ\u00c9P Card would not be changed.87\n\nLetter from Mr. Krist\u00f3f Szatm\u00e1ry (Secretary of State for the National Economy, Hungary), to Mr. Ren\u00e9 Roudaut (French ambassador to Hungary) (7 October 2011) **[Exhibit C-0102]**.\n\n151.\n\nOn 11 October 2011, Respondent received a 100+ page proposal related to the 2011 Reform.

FACTUAL ASSERTIONS IN RESPONSE TO TRIBUNAL QUESTIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe following summaries are based on the Parties' responses, in their post-hearing briefs, to the Tribunal's questions contained in PO-10.\n\n**1. Tribunal Question (f) Regarding the Applicable Tax Rates**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*f) Having regard to paragraphs 82 and 83 of the Respondent's Rejoinder, the Parties are asked to elaborate on the tax rate applicable to Claimants' meal vouchers before and after the 2011 changes.*\n\n**(a) Claimants' Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n187.\n\nPrior to the 2011 Reform, Claimants' hot and cold meal vouchers were subject to a tax rate of 19.04%, and this rate applied to benefits valued up to an exemption ceiling of HUF 18,000 per employee. Following the 2011 Reform, Claimants' cold and hot meal vouchers were subject to a tax rate of 51.17%, and there was no exemption ceiling.151\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 19; Claimants' Opening, slide 3.\n\n188.\n\nAfter the 2011 Reform, the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher were given a more advantageous rate than the one applicable to Claimants' vouchers, with the 30.94% rate applying to the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher and the 51.17% rate applying to Claimants' vouchers.152 This difference was confirmed in the *Edenred* Award.153\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 20 - 23; Respondent's Appendix to Closing, 26; Tr. Day 4 at 8:20 - 11:4 (Claimants' Closing).\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 23; *Edenred* Award, \u00a7 364.\n\n189.\n\nClaimants argue that it is irrelevant that CD Hungary could theoretically compete with the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher on equal terms above the exemption limit, as no company would purchase vouchers above the exemption ceiling.154\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 24; Tr. Day 2 at 21:14 - 22:3 (Nagy).\n\n**(b) Respondent's Arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nIn 2011, hot and cold meal fringe benefits were available below HUF 18,000 at an effective tax rate of 19.04%. Above HUF 18,000, these benefits were taxed at an effective tax rate of 51.57%. In 2012, hot and cold meal fringe benefits were taxed at an effective rate of 51.17%.155 Although the tax exemption granted to the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher is 20% less that that applied to the hot and cold meal vouchers, that did not make Claimants' vouchers 20% more expensive. Indeed, in 2013 when Claimants left the market, Claimants' hot meal voucher was USD 8.76 more expensive than an SZ\u00c9P Card of the same value (11.4%) and its cold meal voucher was only USD 5.60 more expensive (also, 11.4%). This difference was only relevant up to the exemption cap.156\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 60; R-II Table 1: Overview of the Fringe Benefit System as of 1 January 2012.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 61 - 62; Table 3; Table 4; Tr. Day 2 at 17:23, 66:23 - 24; 67:4 - 7 (Nagy).\n\n191.\n\nThe comparison of tax treatment of hot and cold meal fringe benefits in 2011 versus 2012 offers little relevant information to the Tribunal. The tax treatment of all fringe benefits changed yearly, and the tax treatment of a particular fringe benefit in one year had no bearing on the tax treatment in another year.157 Ms. Nagy's testimony, which suggested that the 2011 Reforms exhausted an internal budget held by CD Hungary's customers, was unsound and ignored the fact that CD Hungary's customers were companies to whom CD Hungary had no right and with whom they had no long-term commitment. If Claimants' theory is accurate, CD Hungary would have had to convince clients (pre-existing clients who renewed and clients taken from competitors) every year to spend up to the new yearly tax code, regardless of the amount spent in the prior year, as part of their expected business activity.158 Claimants' assumption that conditions would remain unchanged from 2011 onwards is arbitrary and serves to stabilize the legal framework - and that is a condition that neither Claimants nor Hungary contracted for.159\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 63.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 64; Table 6 in response to Question (i); Tr.

The Parties also agree that, after the 2011 Reform and beginning in 2012, vouchers to provide hot and cold meal fringe benefits were taxed at an effective rate of 51.17%. The SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher could be used for the purchase of hot and cold meal fringe benefits, up to the exemption limit of HUF 12,500 and HUF 5,000 per month, respectively.160 The SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher had a tax rate of 30.94%, up to the exemption limit of HUF 12,500 and 5,000 per month, respectively.161\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 19 (Table); RPHB-I n. 118.\n\n*Compare* CPHB-I \u00a7 19 (Table) and R-II \u00a7 81 (Table 1).\n\n**2. Tribunal Question (h) Regarding Evidence Anticipating Changes to the Meal Fringe Benefit System in 2011**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*h) The Parties are requested to bring together, and supplement as appropriate, their respective submissions addressing the evidence, or lack thereof, anticipating the changes to the meal fringe benefit system in 2011.*\n\n**(a) Claimants' Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n193.\n\nWhen Claimants made their decision to invest in Hungary, there was no way that Claimants could have anticipated that Respondent would make discriminatory and unreasonable regulatory changes in the future. Thus, there can be no evidence that the 2011 Reform could have been anticipated.162\n\nCPHB-I Annex No. 4 \u00a7 1.\n\n194.\n\nWhile it is undisputed that the market was moving toward dematerialization, the meal voucher market was not ready for dematerialization prior to the 2011 Reform.163 Indeed, Edenred's electronic voucher failed in 2009, confirming that the market was not ready for dematerialization.164 Further, the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher was launched as a paper voucher rather than as a card because the market was not ready for dematerialization in 2011.165 This paper-based Erzs\u00e9bet voucher gained a larger share of the market than did the SZ\u00c9P Card, in spite of that card's advantages, thereby confirming that the market simply was not ready for electronic cards.166\n\nCPHB-I Annex No. 4 n.1; Tr.

Claimants were aware that the PIT was amended annually and that there was always a possibility of the abolishment or elimination of all fringe benefits.179 All participants in the system anticipated these annual changes and governed themselves in accordance with the constantly evolving legislative framework. For Claimants, their success depended on clients re-signing contracts depending on the mix of products that would be available that year. Every year, Claimants waited until November to design and determine what their business activity was likely to look like the following year.180\n\n*See e.g*., Letter from Ms. M\u00e1rta Nagy to Mr. Philippe Baudry (Economic and Commercial Counsellor, French Embassy, Budapest) together with annexes (30 March 2000) **[C-0051]** (*noting* difficulties in the system in Hungary that fringe benefits are considered \"*as a matter of tax policy*\"); Extract from Mazars Summary Notes on CD Hungary, \"Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner Kft., Hungary\", dated 31 December 2009, 31 December 2010, and 31 December 2011 - 31 December 2013 **[C-0044]** (*discussing* the legislative changes from 2009 - 2013); Dr. P\u00e9ter Oszk\u00f3, T/9817 Draft Bill on the Amendment Amending the Transformation of Tax System (May 2009) **[R-0048]** (in 2009, the Government considered the abolishment of the Fringe Benefit System by \"*significantly reducing tax advantages, tax exemptions, and by eliminating certain taxes and contributions*\"); Proposal from the AETR concerning the universal regulation of the system for allocating benefits in kind (January 2010) **[C0145]** (AETR's proposition to reform to improve the Fringe Benefit System by introducing stronger regulation); D\u00e9r Statement, \u00a7 11 **[CWS-1]** and First Nagy Statement, \u00a7 11 **[CWS-2]** (Claimants' product mix changed and depended on the tax framework of the relevant year).\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 87; Tr.

The Reform 2009 and the Reform 2010, which imposed taxation on fringe benefits and eliminated certain fringe benefits - including cold meal and gift vouchers - caused, in Claimants' words, the ground to shift. Claimants were, thus, on notice that Respondent was facing difficult fiscal constraints and was concerned about the loss of tax revenues in the inefficient Fringe Benefit System.181 Claimants even anticipated the abolishment of cold meal vouchers,182 the impending shift to electronic cards, and the possibility that the Government might use legislation to accelerate that transition.183\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 88;

The French government intervened on 22 September 2011.188 In response, on 7 October 2011, Respondent State replied that the criteria for issuing the SZ\u00c9P Card would not be changed.189 On 23 November 2011, President Sarkozy wrote to Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n to again express his concern.190 On 6 January 2012, after the 2011 Reform entered into force, Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n responded to President Sarkozy's letter, without commenting on the 2011 Reform.191 Thereafter, on 24 January 2012, the French Government issued a press release regarding negotiation efforts.192 The French Government issued a second press release on 6 April 2012 announcing that the Hungarian ambassador had been summoned in regard to legislative amendments affecting French businesses, especially in the meal voucher sector.193\n\nTr.

Tribunal Question (i) Regarding Tax Rates on Wages / Salaries vs. Fringe Benefits**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*i) What was the tax rate on wage / salary payments, as opposed to fringe benefits, during the periods addressed in these proceedings?*\n\n**(a) Claimants' Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n202.\n\nClaimants argue that the comparison between meal vouchers and salaries is irrelevant because there is no market for meal vouchers above the exemption ceiling. Thus, even if CD Hungary's voucher still had a preferential tax over salaries, it does not change the fact that the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher had a preferential tax over CD Hungary's vouchers.194\n\nCPHB-I Annex No. 5.\n\n**(b) Respondent's Arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe entire market of fringe benefits is, and has always been, predicated on tax incentives - *i.e*., preferential tax rates are applied to fringe benefits as compared to those applicable to salary.195 The annual PIT contained a list of fringe benefits that could be enjoyed by Hungarian employees at a reduced rate.196 Considering the 2011 Reforms, it is important to note that (1) the fact that a particular fringe benefit enjoyed preferential tax treatment in one year was no guarantee that it would exist in the next year, (2) it could not be assumed that fringe benefits would enjoy the same or increasingly preferential tax rates and exemption limits as the year before because (3) Government priorities change.197 The 2011 Reform were not focused on Claimants or any other particular issuer. They impacted a variety of fringe benefits.198 The 2011 Reforms did not eliminate hot and cold meal fringe benefits, which continued to receive a significant tax advantage as compared to salary, and these benefits received the same tax rate as applied to the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher and the SZ\u00c9P Card above their respective exemption limits. The 2011 Reforms removed the exemption limits for hot and cold meal vouchers, thus enabling employers to purchase Claimants' vouchers in an unlimited amount, if they so desired.199\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 90; Legrand Statement, \u00a7 12 **[CWS-3]** ; Tr.

Rather, they are less expensive due in part to restricted commissions. They also offer better security.200\n\nTr. at 58:1-10 (R. Closing).\n\n**(c) The Tribunal's Considerations**\n-------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's question, the Parties provided detailed tables with their submissions. They show the requested tax rates as they applied to a wide variety of vouchers. The Parties appear to agree on the \"*effective tax up to the limit*\" for hot meal and cold meal vouchers from 2008 - 2011, but their numbers diverge from 2012 onwards. Insofar as considered necessary for its reasoning, the Tribunal will address the information provided in the Tables later in this Award.\n\n**VI. JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n------------------------------------\n\n**A.

The Respondent's objections against the Tribunal's jurisdiction regarding the claims for alleged breach of Article 3 of the Treaty between Hungary and France are dismissed.*\n\n*ii. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over all the claims raised.*\n\n*iii. The decision on costs is reserved for a later stage of the procedure.201*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 228.\n\n**B. T****HE** **P****ARTIES****' S****UBMISSIONS** **R****EGARDING THE** ***A****CHMEA*** **D****ECISION**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe following summaries are based on the Parties' responses to Question (a) regarding the relevance of the *Achmea* Case202, Respondent's letter of 6 March 2018, and the Tribunal's invitation for submissions following the 6 March 2018 *Achmea* Decision. The CJEU's *Achmea* Decision was as follows:\n\n*Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on Encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.203*\n\nFollowing the Hearing in PO-10, the Tribunal invited the Parties to explain \"*What relevance, if any, of the case* Slovak Republic v. Achmea *(Case-284-16) for the present case?*\" in their post-hearing submissions.\n\n*Achmea* Decision, CJEU (6 March 2018) [hereinafter \"*Achmea* Decision\"], at \u00a7 62.\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThe *Achmea* Decision has no relevance for the present proceedings. There is no focus on EU law in this case and the Tribunal is only required to resolve a dispute under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. While the Tribunal may ultimately consider the *Achmea* Decision as fact (as Claimants argue) or as law, the Tribunal is not bound to apply it or to conclude that it robs the Tribunal of jurisdiction. This Tribunal is an international tribunal constituted under the ICSID convention and is, therefore, outside of the scope of the *Achmea* Decision.204 Further, this arbitration is held outside the EU, is not seated within the EU, and is not governed by an EU of EU Member State *lex loci arbitri*. There is no local court within the EU that has jurisdiction over this arbitration, including in the case of a challenge to an award. This arbitration, therefore, does not and cannot infringe EU law, and there is no rule in EU law that provides an ICSID arbitration proceedings such as this would be inconsistent with EU law.\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 3.\n\n**(a) Procedural Objections and Due Process**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nClaimants object to the timing of Respondent's objection, and its new argument that the alleged incompatibility between the TFEU and Art. 9(2) of the BIT has effect from 1 May 2004, when Respondent acceded to the EU. This is an argument that Respondent could have raised earlier and does not result from an analysis of the *Achmea* Decision.205\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 4; CPHB-I \u00a7 285.\n\n210.\n\nRespondent first raised a jurisdictional objection based on EU law in April 2017, after losing its case in *Edenred*. Prior to that, although the issue of potential incompatibility between EU law and intra-EU BITs already existed, and although Respondent knew of this objection and had raised it in other matters, Respondent never challenged or reserved its position as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on that ground in these proceedings.206 Here, Respondent only raised an objection based on the scope of its consent.207 This belated challenge to ICSID Jurisdiction based on EU law is nothing more than an attempt to withdraw consent, which is prohibited under the ICSID Convention.208 Further, by its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction over all of the Claimants' claims. For the Tribunal to reconsider that Decision there would need to exist an exceptional circumstance involving some sort of fraud or egregious circumstance or manifest error of law.209 None are present here.\n\nClaimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 3, *citing* *Electrabel S.A. v.

Claimants' position is that the Tribunal can only consider this judgment as fact.210 Given the Parties' agreement that EU law is not relevant to the dispute, and Claimants' reliance on Respondent's position that EU law is not to be and cannot be applied by the Tribunal to resolve the issues in this case, Respondent cannot now change its position to Claimants' detriment. Claimants expressly request that the Tribunal not apply EU law to resolve the dispute submitted to it.211 For completeness, Claimants' position is that EU law does not form part of the rules and principles of international law that the Tribunal has to apply, pursuant to the BIT and the ICSID Convention. The EU legal order is based on a body of law that is distinct from international law. EU law binds its Member States but does not, at an international level, bind all subjects of international law, as does international public law.212 The CJEU confirmed the autonomy of EU law in the *Achmea* Decision,213 and reached its conclusion without reference to international law, rather than by reference to the national law of the two EU Member States and to the other treaties between them. The mere fact that EU law is rooted in international treaties does not make it part of the rules and principles of international law referred to in Art. 9 of the BIT.214 Further, as noted by the Tribunal, and as Respondent agrees, decisions of other tribunals - including decisions of the CJEU - are not binding on the Tribunal.215 Third, the Tribunal itself, and not the CJEU, must determine and exercise its own jurisdiction on the basis of Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Art. 9 of the BIT, which are fully valid and applicable instruments governed by international law.216 Article 9 of the BIT contained a valid offer to arbitrate that has been accepted by Claimants. For the purposes of this case, this consent has become irrevocable.217\n\n*Id*. at 7; Claimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 6.\n\nClaimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 8.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*. at 9; *Achmea* Decision, \u00a7 33.\n\nClaimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 9.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 287; Decision on Preliminary Issues of Jurisdiction \u00a7 208; Tr.

None of the ECT cases relied on by Respondent is relevant because the EU is a party to the ECT alongside the Member States and third-party States.218 Further, in those cases, at least one of the parties relied on EU law in the merits. The *Wirtgen* case is also irrelevant, as in that case the tribunal had to determine the applicable law and one party argued that EU law was part of the rules of law applicable to the dispute.219\n\nClaimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 9.\n\n*Id*., at 10.\n\n213.\n\nAs argued by Hungary in *Electrabel*, the operative part of a CJEU judgment, like the *Achmea* Decision, must be understood in light of the reasoning on which it was based.220 If the Tribunal considers the *Achmea* Decision as part of the applicable international law under the BIT, the Tribunal must conclude that, contrary to Respondent's allegations, the *Achmea* Decision does not apply to (1) all dispute settlement provisions in all intra-EU BITs, (2) Art. 9(2) of the BIT, or (3) ICSID arbitration.221\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 6; *Electrabel v. Hungary*, Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 6.84 and 6.85 **[CLA-0070]**.\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 6; CPHB-I \u00a7 289.\n\n214.\n\nHere, Respondent seeks to broaden the scope of the *Achmea* Decision by its analysis of the words \"*such as*\" and \"*may be called to interpret and apply EU law*.\"222 In the *Achmea* Decision, and consistent with the purpose of preliminary references as an opportunity to expound authoritatively on points of EU law to ensure its coherence, the CJEU deliberately used restrictive language, rather than terms like \"*any*.\"223*Achmea* cannot be extended to all and any dispute settlement provisions in intra-EU BITs.224 An important difference between the present matter and the *Achmea* case is that this matter engages ICSID proceedings, whereas *Achmea* concerned an UNCITRAL arbitration with a seat localized in an EU Member State. The *Achmea* Decision concerned Art. 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT (which does not contain an option for ICSID Arbitration) or to dispute settlement provisions of the same kind.225\n\n*Id*., at 7.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at 8.\n\nClaimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 4; *see also* CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 285 - 286.\n\n215.\n\nIn the *Achmea* Decision, the CJEU specifically made reference to the potential risk of interpretation or application of EU law by the arbitral tribunal and it specifically referred to the applicable law provisions of Art. 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT and to the internal law of Slovakia and the EU treaties. By contrast and contrary to what Respondent now suggests, there is no risk that the Tribunal may be called to interpret or apply any substantive rule of EU law. It is undisputed that (1) Claimants' claims are not based on EU law, but are based on the BIT, (2) Respondent does not attack EU law or the Commission Decision of 22 November 2012 or the CJEU Decision of 23 February 2016 that rules that Hungary had infringed EU law, and (3) the Tribunal is only called upon to resolve the specific dispute before it, under the BIT.226 Respondent has repeatedly stated that EU law has no relevance to the present dispute and that EU law must be distinguished from the BIT.227 There is no reason to distinguish between jurisdiction and the merits: Respondent's position on the lack of relevance of EU law must apply equally to whether the Tribunal is examining jurisdiction or the merits.228\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 8 - 9.\n\nClaimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 5; *citing* R-II \u00a7 91.\n\nClaimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 6.\n\n216.\n\nRespondent's analogy to the *Diallo* case is irrelevant for four reasons. First, Respondent has not demonstrated the broad scope of the *Achmea* Decision, and it can be expected that further preliminary requests by national courts will be necessary to understand the *Achmea* Decision. Second, the parties in *Diallo* were both States, not a private investor and a State. Third, Respondent cites *Diallo* for the position that \"*when decisions of interpretative bodies are binding upon the parties to a dispute, they should also bind the tribunal before which the two parties appear*\" and that this requires that application of the *Achmea* Decision in the present case, even if it is not binding on the Tribunal. Unlike the comparison in *Diallo*, where one party relied on a treaty, neither Party in this case has relied on the TFEU to support the merits of the case. Fourth, in *Diallo*, the ICJ insisted on the necessity to protect legal security. If anything, the requirement of legal security would be on Claimants' side in the present case.229\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 10.\n\n217.\n\nEven if the Tribunal considers that it is bound to apply the *Achmea* Decision, that it has broad scope, and that there is a fundamental conflict between Art. 9(2) of the BIT and the TFEU (all of which Claimants deny), the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction based on the principle of *lex specialis*.230 The BIT provided special procedural protection in the form of investment protection against the host State and constitutes an exception to the general rule of the relationship envisioned in the EU treaties and is, therefore, *lex specialis* in comparison with the EU treaties. Similarly, the ICSID Convention is *lex specialis* with respect to the procedural protection in comparison with the BIT which refers to it.231 Most general international law may be derogated in application of the *lex specialis* rule and it is only in exceptional circumstances that the application of this principle is precluded,232 such as in situations of conflicting *jus cogens* or human rights norms.233 EU law does not qualify as *jus cogens* or as human rights norms, and the ILC Report does not suggest so.234 In the hierarchy analysis between *lex superior* and *lex specialis*, the ILC Report concludes that *lex specialis* prevails.235 Noting in the present case prevents the application of the *lex specialis* rule and, by virtue of this rule, the BIT and the ICSID Convention - being *lex specialis* - must prevail over EU law.236\n\n*Id*., at 10 - 11; CPHB-I \u00a7 291; Patrick Daillier, Mathias Forteau and Alain Pellet, *Droit International Public*, L.G.D.J.-Lextenso, 2009, \u00a7 173 **[CLA-0246]** ; *Blusun S.A., Jean Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v.

Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, however, is substantially different from Art. 9 of the BIT, and such an analysis based on the former does not *ipso facto* apply to the latter.240 EU law does not provide investors with the important procedural right of access to independent international arbitration. Further, the BIT and the TFEU do not have the same subject matter.241 Thus, the Tribunal should reject Respondent's theory based on the *lex posterior* rule under Art. 30 of the VCLT, which is not applicable here.242\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 291; VCLT Art. 59(1)(b) and Art. 30(3) **[CLA-0240]** ; *Eureko B.V. v.

Day 4 at 86:11 - 15 (R. Closing).\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 14.\n\n219.\n\nThere is no *lex superior* primacy of EU law in international law. As Respondent argued in *Electrabel*, Art. 351 of the TFEU \"*is aimed solely at respecting pre-existing obligations to nonMember States and is inapplicable in an intra-EU dispute*.\"243 Claimants' procedural rights of access to ICSID arbitration and the obligations of Respondent under the ICSID Convention are not affected by provisions of the TFEU or the *Achmea* Decision.244 Article 351 of the TFEU recognizes the validity and applicability of earlier treaties with third parties, such as the ICSID Convention. Article 351 of the TFEU is not a *lex superior* rule under international law - it is merely a conflict of law rule. The ILC Report states that in relation to conflict of law clauses, those cannot affect the rights of third parties to the treaty containing the conflict of law rule. The European Court of Human Rights confirms that international courts will refuse to give effect to arguments based on the alleged supremacy of EU law.245 While Art. 351 of the TFEU may govern the rights and obligations of EU Member States *vis-\u00e1-vis* one another in their *inter se* agreements, the analysis is different from the perspective of international law where third parties are involved. Here, giving effect to Art. 351 of the TFEU (or a rule of EU law) to deny a third party's rights under a separate treaty would be contrary to the settled rule of international law that a State cannot evade its international obligations on grounds of its internal law. Thus, the Tribunal should find that rules of EU law cannot deprive the Claimants of their right to resort to arbitration under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Further, pursuant to Art. 27 of the VCLT, Respondent cannot invoke EU law to excuse its breaches of the BIT. EU law is part of the \"*internal law*\" of all Member States, for purposes of Art. 27 of the VCLT. Thus, Respondent's reliance on the *Achmea* Decision to escape its international responsibility under the ICSID Convention and the BIT is precluded by settled principles of international law concerning the application of treaties.\n\n*Electrabel v. Hungary*, Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 4.79 **[CLA-0070]** (\"Response: *In the Respondent's Response of 1 August 2011, as regards Article 307 EC, the Respondent re-states its previous case, according to which 'Article 307 is aimed solely at respecting pre-existing obligations to non-Member States and is inapplicable in an intra-EU dispute'* (...)\"; *see also* \u00a7 4.178: \"(...) *Both Parties submit that Article 307 EC is inapplicable to the present case; but the Tribunal does not consider that Article 307 can so easily be dismissed*.\").\n\nClaimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 15.\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 16.\n\n220.\n\nAlthough the EC has initiated infringement proceedings against some Member States with intra-EU BITs, and some are in the process of terminating theirs, Respondent has not terminated or sought to terminate its BITs pursuant to Art. 12 of the BIT.246 This confirms both that (1) the BIT remains valid, and (2) it is for the EC and the EU Member States to take the appropriate actions. It is not for the Tribunal to simply decline or refrain from exercising jurisdiction. It is Respondent's responsibility to denounce the BIT if it considers this necessary, and to date it has not done so.247\n\nClaimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 6.\n\n*Id*., at 7.\n\n221.\n\nThe BIT was not terminated in 2004 and, therefore, Respondent's consent to ICSID jurisdiction was not withdrawn.248 Even if the BIT was retroactively terminated as of 1 May 2004, the BIT -including Art. 9(2) - would remain in force for a period of 20 years as a result of the *\"survival clause*\" contained in Art. 12(2) of the BIT. Claimants, thus, would benefit from the protection offered under the BIT until 2024.249 Further, Respondent did not denounce the ICSID Convention in 2004 - or ever - and cannot claim to benefit from the effects of a denunciation of the ICSID Convention.250 Denunciation of the ICSID Convention is governed by Arts. 71 and 72 thereof, and leaves unaffected the consent previously perfected. It cannot have the effect of retroactively withdrawing consent.251 Finally, the *Achmea* Decision does not support Respondent's argument that its offer to arbitrate and, consequently, its consent, was withdrawn retroactively. The *Achmea* Decision said nothing about its effect on perfected consent to arbitration between an EU national and an EU Member State under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, and this silence serves as further evidence of the limited scope of the judgment, which does not apply to ICSID arbitration. Thus, Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention applies and Respondent's consent remains valid, which means that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the Convention.252\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 18.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at 18 - 19; CPHB-I \u00a7 290.

Pursuant to Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention, Claimants have lost the right to seek relief elsewhere.254 The present forum is the only one competent to hear the dispute under the BIT.255 Arbitration is the only mechanism provided in the BIT for the settlement of expropriation claims. Respondent has not shown that there is any other international and neutral forum in which an investor may bring a direct action against an EU Member State for damages suffered as a result of a breach of a BIT.256 The value of arbitration and the avoidance of the use of domestic courts is undeniable as a matter of principle.257 Respondent has not shown that Claimants would even have standing to bring their claims before Hungarian domestic courts. Even with standing, however, Claimants' claims would be time-barred. Even so, bringing an action in domestic courts would be fundamentally inconsistent with the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, which considers that \"*delocalized dispute settlement is at the very heart of the Treaty edifice concerning conditions of investment*.\"258 While Respondent argues that domestic courts must be presumed to be neutral based on the principle of mutual trust, that presumption is inapplicable as it only binds Member States and not tribunals. The recognized effects of this vague principle are limited to (1) preventing courts of one Member State from evaluating the practice of courts of other Member States, and (2) the recognition of judgments from one Member State in the jurisdiction of all Member States, without the need for a special procedure.259 In any event, the *Dan Cake* award, finding Hungary liable for denial of justice for the behavior of its courts, puts into question the neutrality and respect of fundamental rights in that country.260\n\n*Id*., at 20; Claimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 18 - 19.\n\nClaimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 19.\n\n*Id*., at 20; CPHB-I \u00a7 292; Tania Voon, Andrew Mitchell, James Munro, \"Parting Ways: The Impact of Mutual Termination of Investment Treaties on Investor Rights\", *ICSID Review*, Vol. 29, No. 2 (2014), 463 - 465 **[CLA-0249]** ; *Blusun v.

Even if *Germany v. Italy* were relevant by analogy, that case only states that judicial redress may be precluded for individuals by the effect of a norm of international law. Here, the norm on which Respondent relies has not been identified and such application cannot be \"*in accordance with international law*.\" Thus, the *obiter dictum* in the ICJ's decision does not apply to the present case.261\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 22.\n\n224.\n\nWhen confronted with two sets of functions which are both valued by the international community, a balance must be struck between those two sets of functions, and the ICJ was criticized for its failure to do so in *Germany v. Italy*. Here, in addition to balancing competing norms of international law, the Tribunal must also balance the Parties' rights and interests. The finality of the ICSID system indeed strikes that necessary balance.262 Here, what is at stake is Claimants' right to ICSID arbitration as the only effective means of obtaining judicial redress. Respondent's only stated interest is to avoid running afoul EU law through the enforcement of a future award. The balance weighs decisively in the Claimants' favor, as the consequences of the Tribunal's failure to exercise jurisdiction in this case would be dramatic and irreparable, and tantamount to a denial of justice.263\n\n*Id*., at 23; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

First, there is no risk of fragmentation especially since the Parties have expressly agreed not to apply EU law. Second, like the tribunal in the *Achmea* case, that found that \"*the argument that Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with EU law is [] unsustainable*\",264 other tribunals have consistently found no incompatibility between EU law and the relevant intra-EU BITs.265 Third, issues of policy of a particular Member State are beyond the Tribunal's mandate.266\n\n*Achmea B.V. v.

The request that the Tribunal consider post-award issues in effect asks the Tribunal to go beyond its mandate and must be rejected.

Here, Respondent has confirmed that the alleged inapplicability of Art. 9(2) of the BIT leaves all other provisions of the BIT intact and effective. Since Respondent, thus, agrees that Art. 4 remains effective, it could serve as a basis on which the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction is extended to apply to the Claimants' FET claims.275\n\nClaimants' Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (16 May 2018), at 29.\n\n229.\n\nThe principles of good faith, estoppel, and *venire contract factum proprium* all prevent Respondent from arguing that its consent to ICSID arbitration has been retroactively withdrawn.276\n\n*Id*., at 29 - 30, Claimants' First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (18 April 2018), at 21.\n\n**2. Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe issue before the CJEU in *Achmea* was the incompatibility of dispute resolution clauses contained in intra-EU BITs with EU law and their resultant inapplicability.277 The *Achmea* Decision is applicable to these proceedings, as commenced pursuant to the BIT. As a consequence of the *Achmea* Decision, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. In the alternative, the Tribunal should decline exercising any jurisdiction over this matter. There are no procedural grounds that would justify the Tribunal disregarding the *Achmea* Decision.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 24; German Federal Court of Justice Decision in the Procedure for the Annulment of a Domestic Arbitral Award, Case No. I ZB 2/15 (3 March 2016) **[RLA-0262]**.\n\n**(a) Procedural Objections and Due Process**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe *Achmea* Decision cannot be disregarded on procedural grounds. Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on this decision is not time-barred, and ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) is not coercive and does not negate each tribunal's obligation to determine any objection to its jurisdiction.278 Further, tribunals have a duty to determine their jurisdiction, and to examine jurisdictional requirements *sua sponte*, if there are compelling reasons to do so.279 The *Achmea* Decision serves as a compelling reason for this Tribunal to ascertain its jurisdiction *sua sponte*.280\n\nRespondent's First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (28 March 2018), at 11; Christoph Schreuer, Loretta Malintopi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, Art. 41, \u00a7 42 (2d ed. 2009).\n\nRespondent's First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (28 March 2018), at 12; *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, S.C.

Accordingly, even an arbitration in the so-called self-contained ICSID regime would run afoul of EU law.289\n\nRespondent's First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (28 March 2018), at 3 - 4.\n\n*Id*., at 4.\n\n234.\n\nClaimants' effort to impose an unduly restrictive interpretation of the terms \"*such as*\" is unavailing. This is reinforced by the CJEU's use of the words \"*an*\" international agreement \"*such as*\" the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, as being only exemplative of the total category of intra-EU BITs giving rise to the conflict. The phrase \"*such as Article 8 of the* [Netherlands-Slovakia BIT]\" is preceded and followed by commas and, therefore, must be understood as being non-restrictive. The phrase could even be left out of the sentence. This is consistent with the purpose of preliminary references, which is to permit the CJEU to expound authoritatively on points of EU law, thereby ensuring the coherence of the same.290\n\nRespondent's Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (2 May 2018), at \u00a7\u00a7 2 - 3.\n\n235.\n\nWhether there is an actual risk that a tribunal will be asked to consider or interpret matters of EU law is not relevant. The inquiry is not whether a particular tribunal addressed a point of EU law but whether the dispute resolution clause might give rise to disputes where an arbitral tribunal might be called to do so. This renders the dispute resolution clause, but not the dispute itself, incompatible with EU law. In the investment treaty context, the CJEU reasoned that such risk was always present,291 and it is acutely so in this case. Claimants sought to rely on Respondent's alleged infringement of EU law to bolster their legal arguments on the merits and even went so far as to tie their legitimate expectations under Art. 3 of the BIT to the fact that Respondent would \"*respect EU law and would not target European investors*.\"292 Further, the questions asked by the Tribunal in the post-hearing briefs reveals the focus on EU law matters.293 Thus, the risk that the Tribunal may be called upon to interpret issues of EU law cannot be dismissed.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 4.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 5 - 6.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 7.\n\n236.\n\nThe CJEU's interpretation of Arts. 267 and 344 of the TFEU is binding on a tribunal whose jurisdiction purports to be based on Art. 9(2) of the BIT.294 As stated by the ICJ in *Diallo*, it is not possible to ignore the interpretative decisions issued by a specific body in charge of the interpretation of the treaty in question. Where such decisions are binding upon the parties to a dispute, they should also bind the tribunal - even where the interpretive committee or similar body does not have any actual power to bind the tribunal or court to whom interpretation is offered.295 Although Art. 31 of the VCLT is silent as to the competent body or decision-maker to interpret treaties, the parties to a treaty designate such a body.296 Article 267 of the TFEU provides the CJEU with jurisdiction over the interpretation of the TFEU, and these interpretative decisions are binding upon the Member States.297 The CJEU's case law affirms the *erga omnes* effect of preliminary judgments and, in *K\u00fchne & Heitz*, the CJEU even suggested that bodies might have an obligation to reopen matters to ensure that the CJEU's interpretation is properly applied.298\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 47.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 47 - 51.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 48 - 49.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 53 - 54.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 55.\n\n237.\n\nPreliminary rulings are afforded *erga omnes* effect where certain conditions are satisfied: (1) the questions of interpretation at issue are the same in the preliminary ruling as in the present case, and (2) there are no additional factors that could change such interpretation. Here, there are no additional factors, and the question of interpretation in the *Achmea* Decision and in the case at bar is the same: \"*whether a provision in an international agreement concluded between EU Member States, under which an investor from one of those Member State may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept, is precluded by Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU*.\"299 Thus, there is strong support for the view that the Tribunal must also abide by the CJEU's interpretation.300 Otherwise, investors of the EU and the Member States would be deprived of the legal certainty to which they are entitled.301 Thus, the Tribunal is bound to rule that Arts. 267 and 344 of the TFEU preclude the dispute resolution clause contained in Art. 9(2) of the BIT.302\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 57.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 58.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 58 - 59.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 60.\n\n238.\n\nEven if the Tribunal finds that the *Achmea* Decision is not binding, it will nonetheless become so through the applicable law.303 Questions of jurisdiction and, indeed, of consent are not governed by the law applicable to the merits, but rather by reference to the instruments in which the Parties' consent is contained, *i.e.* Art. 9(3) of the BIT and Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. While both provide that international law applies to the Tribunal's determination of its jurisdiction, international law must be interpreted in accordance with the VCLT.304 Any relevant rules set out under EU law, including CJEU decisions, would be treated like any other international rules for the purpose of Art. 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.305 Thus, the CJEU's findings in *Achmea* will be part of the *acquis communautaire* and, thus, will have to be applied by the Tribunal as part of the law applicable to its jurisdiction.306 EU law forms part of international law and, thus, must be considered in determining the extent of consent - both in ECT and in BIT cases.307*Achmea* further held that EU law doctrines are part of the general principles on international law, and Claimants have acknowledged that EU law is part of public international law.308 Here, the issue is the interpretation of the TFEU and its impact on dispute resolution clauses contained in intra-EU BITs. The *Achmea* Decision touches on the same subject matter, within the meaning of Art. 31(3)(c) of the VCLT. Thus, in order to comply with the provisions of Art. 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, the Tribunal would need to apply the *Achmea* Decision when interpreting the TFEU. In so doing, the Tribunal would find that EU law applies directly to its jurisdiction in accordance with Art. 9(3) of the BIT, rendering Art. 9(2) of the BIT invalid at the time of the institution of these proceedings.309\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 61.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 9 - 10.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 65.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 23; *Amministrazione Delle Finanza dello Stato v.

These tools include the doctrine of primacy (*lex superior*), the *lex posterior* rule (also contained in Art. 30(3) of the VCLT), and the *lex specialis* rule. Here, the application of the *lex superior* rule is warranted, since the conflict between Art. 9(2) of the BIT and the TFEU concerns internal regime hierarchies in the relationship between Member States, thus rendering the other two conflict maxims inapplicable.310 Respondent's revocation of its offer of consent - resulting both from the principles of *lex posteriori* and the principle of primacy, took effect prior to any arguable acceptance by Claimants.311\n\nRespondent's First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (28 March 2018), at 11; Respondent's Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (2 May 2018), at \u00a7\u00a7 16 - 18.\n\nRespondent's Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (2 May 2018), at \u00a7 73.\n\n240.\n\nUnder Art. 351 of the TFEU, in cases of incompatibility between an *inter se* Member State agreement and EU treaties, the conflicting provisions of the former agreement are rendered inapplicable. The ILC has confirmed the absolute precedence of EU treaties over agreements concluded between Member States *inter se*,312 and this was endorsed by the tribunal in *Electrabel*.313 The principle of primacy of EU law within the relationship between Member States, thus, renders Art. 9(2) of the BIT inapplicable, due to its incompatibility with Arts. 267 and 344 of the TFEU.314\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 19 - 21.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 22.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 23.\n\n241.\n\nThe inapplicability of Art. 9(2) of the BIT also flows from Art. 30(3) of the VCLT, pursuant to which the provisions of an earlier treaty are applicable only so far as they are compatible with the provisions of the later treaty.315 The possible neutralization of the dispute resolution clause contained in a BIT in case of incompatibility with a later treaty was specifically contemplated by the tribunal in the *Achmea* arbitration,316 and was clarified by the CJEU in the *Achmea* Decision.317 As a result, the incompatibility of Art. 9(2) of the BIT and the EU Treaties arose with Hungary's accession to the EU on 1 May 2004, because, as of that date, Hungary entered into an international treaty with France that was incompatible with Art. 9(2) of the BIT.318 Alternatively, this incompatibility crystalized on 1 December 2009 when the TFEU came into effect. This incompatibility predates Claimants' effort to initiate proceedings pursuant to Art. 9 of the BIT in 2013.319\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 25 - 26.\n\n*Achmea B.V. v.

The *MOX Plant* tribunal never reached the issue because Ireland withdrew its claim. As in the case before this Tribunal, whether arbitration clauses contained in intra-EU BITs violate Arts. 344 and 267 of the TFEU was an issue to be determined solely by the CJEU -the body with exclusive authority to interpret EU law with finality.325 The Tribunal should defer to the *Achmea* Decision and conclude that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate this dispute owing to the preclusion of Art. 9(2) of the BIT.326\n\nRespondent's First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (28 March 2018), at 7.\n\n*Id*., at 8.\n\n*Id*., at 9.\n\n244.\n\nA State may revoke its consent to ICSID's jurisdiction through the conclusion of another treaty (such as the TFEU) that is incompatible with the BIT and which, by operation of the principles of international law, would lead to the termination or inapplicability of the BIT, either as a whole or with respect to specific provisions of the BIT.327 The revocation of consent does not run afoul of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention or any other applicable rules of international law. While both the ICSID Convention and the VCLT preclude a State from relying *ex post facto* on its own laws to avoid international liability, these limitations do not preclude the Tribunal from acknowledging the significance of the *Achmea* Decision in terms of clarifying the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction.328 Respondent is not seeking to rely on its own domestic law to escape international legal obligations, and the \"*internal law*\" referred to in Art. 27 of the VCLT cannot reasonable be read as encompassing law which directly derives from or incorporates international agreements.329 Rather, Respondent is invoking EU law to explain why a provision of the BIT is no longer applicable *.*330\n\nRespondent's Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (2 May 2018), at \u00a7\u00a7 16, 70 - 72.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 69.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 74.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 75.\n\n**(c) Whether Restraint from Jurisdiction Results in Denial of Justice**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nIn the alternative, the Tribunal should refrain from exercising its jurisdiction.331 Respondent explains that \"[o] *ne of the compelling reasons not to exercise jurisdiction a tribunal otherwise has is to prevent the fragmentation of international law resulting from the proliferation of international* [sic] *and/or the issuance of conflicting decisions and unenforceable awards*.\"332 Tribunals have relied on principles of judicial propriety or comity to refrain from exercising jurisdiction.333 Indeed, the tools for coordinating between proceedings and decisions of different *fora* - including comity, *lis alibi pendens*, *res judicata* - are available and tribunals should make efforts to utilize them to achieve the appropriate level of cohesion.334 The incompatibility of the BIT and EU law need not be resolved by recourse to Arts. 30(3) or 59(1) of the VCLT.335\n\n*Id*., at 9.\n\n*Id..*\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at 10.\n\n*Id*., at 11.\n\n246.\n\nThe enforcement of an award to be issued by the Tribunal will be impossible within the EU because, owing to the *erga omnes* effect of the *Achmea* Decision, Member States would be in breach of EU law if their judicial organs enforced an award that was rendered in breach of EU law.\n\n247.\n\nDisregarding the *Achmea* Decision and entertaining the merits of this dispute would lead to conflicting decisions by the Tribunal and the CJEU. The CJEU has decided that clauses such as Art. 9(2) of the BIT are precluded, with the resultant implication that disputes based on intra-EU BITs should be dealt with by Member State courts or arbitral *fora* that form part of the judicial system of the EU.336\n\n*Id*., at 10.\n\n248.\n\nIt is only Art. 9(2) of the BIT offering the possibility of referring disputes in connection with dispossession measures to ICSID arbitration that is in conflict with Art. 267 and 344 of the TFEU. The default mechanism in the BIT for the resolution of disputes in the domestic forum has been fully retained. Because the domestic courts of Hungary and France are \"*courts of a Member State*\" within the meaning of Art. 267 of the TFEU, recourse to those courts does not conflict and is not rendered inapplicable by virtue of the *Achmea* Decision.337 Claimants' argument that they have no standing before domestic courts is without merit. Based on the concept of sincere cooperation, the principle of mutual trust between Member States establishes a presumption of compliance by other Member States with EU law and fundamental rights. There is a strong presumption that Hungarian courts respect EU law and fundamental rights during their proceedings.338 The BIT is part of Hungary's and France's internal legal order, and the substantive rights contained therein are automatically protected in each. Thus, Claimants automatically have standing to pursue these rights.339\n\nRespondent's Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (2 May 2018), at \u00a7\u00a7 80 - 82.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 85 - 86.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 83 - 84.\n\n249.\n\nEven if Claimants had no other forum to bring their claims, that would not override the deficiencies in the Tribunal's jurisdiction. *Germany v. Italy* is illustrative, as there, the ICJ rejected Italy's argument expressly acknowledging that application of certain norms might result in a denial of justice. By analogy, in this case, there is nothing which would deprive international law of its force based on the Claimants' individual claims of denial of justice.340\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 87 - 92; *Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v.

In this case, there is no such possibility.342 In the present instance, the CJEU's issuance of the *Achmea* Decision conclusively established the conflict between the dispute resolution clauses allowing investor-state arbitration contained in intra-EU BITs with EU law.343 It would have been impossible for the Respondent to raise the issue of the lack of its valid offer to arbitrate prior to the issuance of that decision.\n\nRespondent's Second Comments on *Achmea* Decision (2 May 2018), at \u00a7 76.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at 77.\n\n251.\n\nRespondent's prior statements concerning its consent to arbitrate during the course of the Hearing on Jurisdiction and prior have no relevance.

The Tribunal's Considerations and Conclusions**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the many arguments which the Parties have submitted regarding the *Achmea* Decision and the relevance of European Law. Of these, it will address only those which in its view are determinative for its decision in this matter in the case at hand. The Tribunal is also aware of the wide discussion to which the *Achmea* Decision has lead both in later jurisprudence and in academic writing and conferences. However, in the present Award, the Tribunal does not consider that a detailed discussion of the substance of *Achmea* is required, because the present case differs in determinative aspects from the case in *Achmea*.\n\n253.\n\nFirst and most importantly, contrary to that in the *Achmea* case, this Tribunal's jurisdiction is based on the ICSID Convention. *i.e.* a multilateral public international law treaty for the specific purpose of resolving investment disputes between private parties and a State (here, Hungary). Thus, this Tribunal is placed in a public international law context and not in a national or regional context.\n\n254.\n\nWith regard to the relevance of the *Achmea* Decision for the present arbitration, the Tribunal notes that the *Achmea* Decision relies expressly on the following aspects:\n\n\u2022 The place of arbitration is Frankfurt, Germany, with the result that German law applies to the arbitration proceedings345\n\n\u2022 The judicial review of the validity of the award was within the competence of the German courts and was exercised by these courts346\n\n\u2022 That it was in this review process that the German Federal Court of Justice (*Bundesgerichtshof*) submitted the preliminary questions to the EU-Court.347\n\n*Achmea* Decision, \u00a7 10.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 53.\n\n*Id*., at 23.\n\n255.\n\nNone of these factors exist in the present case:\n\n\u2022 While the place of arbitration according to PO-1 \u00a7 10.1 is London, it is not English law, but exclusively the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules are applicable to the proceedings.\n\n\u2022 The judicial review of the validity of the award is not in the competence of the English courts or of any other national courts, but subject exclusively to the annulment procedure according to Art. 52 of the ICSID Convention,\n\n\u2022 This annulment review leads to a final decision by an international *ad hoc* committee, which is not subject to further review by any other court.\n\n256.\n\nFurther, Arts. 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention provide as follows:\n\n***Article 53***\n\n(1) *The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.*\n\n(2) *For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52.*\n\n***Article 54***\n\n(1) *Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state.*\n\n257.\n\nThereby, Hungary as a party to the ICSID Convention is expressly bound by the Tribunal's Award in the present case, has no option of appeal outside the ICSID system, and has to recognize the present Award as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by this Award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in Hungary.\n\n258.\n\nThe *Achmea* Decision contains no reference to the ICSID Convention or to ICSID Arbitration. Therefore, and in view of the above mentioned determinative differences between the *Achmea* case and the present one, the *Achmea* Decision cannot be understood or interpreted as creating or supporting an argument that, by its accession to the EU, Hungary was no longer bound by the ICSID Convention.\n\n259.\n\nThere is no rule in EU law that provides that these obligations under the ICSID Convention are inconsistent with EU law or that obligations under the ICSID Convention have been terminated or replaced by the accession to the EU. Regardless of what may be argued from the *Achmea* Decision regarding BITs between EU Member States, as regard jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention it is undisputed that Hungary did not expressly terminate its participation in and submission to arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Convention when it joined the EU in 2004.\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal also cannot find that the accession to the EU was an implied withdrawal from the ICSID Convention. There was no denunciation of the ICSID Convention, pursuant to Art. 71 thereof. The burden of establishing an implied withdrawal lies with Respondent. The Respondent has failed to establish its case.\n\n261.\n\nHowever, even if, *arguendo*, the Respondent were to be considered to have denounced the ICSID Convention, this denunciation would not have the effect of retroactively withdrawing the Respondent's acceptance of ICSID arbitration contained in the BIT. Article 72 of the ICSID Convention specifies that the denunciation of the ICSID Convention leaves unaffected the consent previously perfected:\n\n*Notice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them before such notice was received by the depositary.*\n\n262.\n\nDenunciation of the ICSID Convention, therefore, cannot have the effect of retroactively withdrawing consent. In this context, Claimants correctly quote Professor Schreuer:\n\n*Article 72 of the ICSID Convention constitutes a special application of the principle of irrevocability, expressed in more general terms in the last sentence of Article 25(1). When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally by direct or indirect means. This includes an attempted withdrawal of consent by way of a denunciation of the Convention.*348\n\nC. Schreuer, \"Chapter 15: Denunciation of the ICSID Convention and Consent to Arbitration\", *in* M. Waibel, A. Kaushal, K-H. L. Chung, C. Balchin, The Backlash against Investment Arbitration: Perceptions and Reality, 2010, 363, *available at:*http://www.univie.ac.at/intlaw/wordpress/pdf/denunciation icsid.pdf.\n\n263.\n\nThe *Achmea* Decision itself does not support any other conclusion. As mentioned above, the CJEU did not say anything in the *Achmea* Decision about the effect of its Decision on consent to arbitration under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n264.\n\nThe Respondent has not demonstrated in any way that EU law (as interpreted by the CJEU in the *Achmea* Decision) would have the effect of validly withdrawing the Respondent's consent to arbitration with retroactive effect. As a consequence, Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention applies and the Respondent's consent remains valid. Accordingly, the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the Convention.\n\n265.\n\nEven further assuming *arguendo* that the France-Hungary BIT was retroactively terminated as of 1 May 2004, the BIT - including the submission to ICSID arbitration in Art. 9(2) of the BIT -would still remain in force for a period of 20 years as a result of the \"*survival clause*\" contained in Art. 12(2) of the BIT as this provision does not contain any limitation or exception as to its application and applies to all investments made prior to the expiry of this Agreement. Thus, investments made prior to the expiration of this BIT remain submitted to it for a period of 20 years from the date of expiry. In the present case, the investments were made prior to 1 May 2004. Therefore, the Claimants would still benefit from the protection offered by the ICSID Convention until 2024. As is undisputed, neither Hungary nor France has made any attempt to renegotiate, modify, or shorten the relevant \"*survival*\" period. Accordingly, even on the Respondent's own analysis regarding the BIT, the Claimants would still benefit from Art. 9(2) of the BIT and the ICSID Convention, and the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction to hear this case.\n\n266.\n\nOn the basis of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the *Achmea* Decision does not change the conclusion reached by this Tribunal in its Decision of 3 March 2016 that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all the claims raised.\n\n267.\n\nIn view of this conclusion, the Tribunal does not need to address the awards that other tribunals have issued recently after and taking into account the *Achmea* Decision.\n\n**C. TRIBUNAL QUESTION (E) REGARDING OTHER RELEVANT ISSUES IN EU LAW**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*e) Any consequential or other issue of EU law that may be relevant to the Tribunal's consideration of the case, having regard, inter alia, to Order No. 3 of the Tribunal in* The MOX Plant Case (Ireland v. United Kingdom) *, PCA Case 2002-01, Order of 24 June 2003.*\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThere is no consequential or other issue of EU law, having regard in particular to the *MOX Plant* case, that may be relevant to the Tribunal.349 In that UNCLOS arbitration between Ireland and the UK, the tribunal suspended the arbitration pending a CJEU decision. This case has no relevance in Respondent's request for a delay or postponements, pending the outcome of the *Achmea* case.350 As indicated in response to the Tribunal's question (a), regardless of its outcome, the *Achmea* Decision will have no impact on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 308.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 309.\n\n269.\n\nFurther, the circumstances upon which the UNCLOS tribunal based its decision are different from the present case in two material respects.351 First, the UNCLOS tribunal's jurisdiction was based on the UNCLOS, to which Ireland and the UK, as well as the EU, were party. There, the UK alleged that, due to the EU's declaration that such provisions covered by the UNCLOS had been transferred to the EU, making the provisions EU law. The question was, therefore, whether the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU extended to the interpretation and application of the UNCLOS, as part of EU law.352 Here, (1) the EU is not party to the BIT, (2) matters covered by the BIT have not been transferred to the EU and do not relate to EU law, and (3) the CJEU has no exclusive jurisdiction upon the interpretation and application of the BIT.353\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at 310; *Ireland v. The United Kingdom*, MOX Plant Case, PCA, Procedural Order No. 3 (24 June 2003) [hereinafter \"*MOX Plant* Case\"] \u00a7 21 **[CLA-0251]** / **[RLA-0263]** ; Declaration or Statements upon UNCLOS ratification, United Nations, as of 29 October 2013 **[CLA-0252]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 310.\n\n270.\n\nSecond, the UNCLOS tribunal considered Art. 282 of the UNCLOS, which provides that UNCLOS tribunals have only a subsidiary jurisdiction if the parties have agreed to another procedure for the interpretation or application of the UNCLOS. Thus, in that case, there was a substantial doubt related to the jurisdiction of the UNCLOS tribunal, as well as the risk of future conflicting decisions. This case presents no such risk because the BIT is the only competent forum: (1) the BIT does not include a provision similar to Art. 282 and, therefore, the Tribunal does not have subsidiary jurisdiction, (2) the dispute is between a private investor and a State, while the CJEU can only hear disputes between Member States, and (3) the CJEU has no jurisdiction to hear a case under the BIT. There is, therefore, no risk of conflicting decisions.354\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 311; UNCLOS, Art. 282 **[CLA-0253]** ; *MOX Plant* Case, \u00a7\u00a7 22 - 25, 28 **[CLA-0251]** / **[RLA-0263]** ; Tr. Day 4 at 83:3-16 (Respondent does not dispute that this dispute is between a private investor and a state).\n\n**2. Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe *MOX Plant* case offers useful guidance as it concerned a tribunal that relied on the principle of comity to suspend arbitration proceedings pending the determination of an issue that had the potential to impact the tribunal's jurisdiction by the CJEU.355 In that case, the CJEU had to determine whether the provisions of the UNCLOS invoked by Ireland were matters over which competence had been transferred to the European Community and, thus, whether the CJEU's exclusive jurisdiction extended to the interpretation and application of UNCLOS.356\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 47; *MOX Plant* Case, \u00a7 1 **[CLA-0251]** / **[RLA-0263]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 48; *MOX Plant* Case, \u00a7 21 **[CLA-0251]** / **[RLA-0263]**.\n\n272.\n\nWhile there are key differences between the *MOX Plant* case and this case, the differences in the parties, the nature of the treaties, and the nature of the referral do not undermine the relevance of the *MOX Plant* case to the request for the suspension of these proceedings based on *Achmea*.357\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 49 - 50.\n\n273.\n\nIn *MOX Plant*, doubts were cast on the UNCLOS tribunal's jurisdiction, and the question of whether certain provisions of the underlying treaty could be relied upon before the tribunal arose. Although formulated differently, this is the same question being confronted in *Achmea* : *i.e.,* whether an investor can rely on a dispute resolution provision of an intra-EU BIT before an arbitral tribunal.358\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 51; *MOX Plant* Case, \u00a7\u00a7 20 - 21 **[CLA-0251]** / **[RLA-0263]**.\n\n274.\n\nWhile this Tribunal (like the one in *MOX Plant*) is satisfied that it has jurisdiction *prima facie*, it must also be able to satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in a definitive sense, before proceeding to any final decision on the merits.359 The UNCLOS tribunal, therefore, took account of the possible outcome of the CJEU's prospective decision and its import to the tribunal's jurisdiction.360 Importantly, in that case, the UNCLOS tribunal emphasized that the matters to be decided by the CJEU concerned the legal order of the European Communities, to which the parties to those proceedings were subject and which were \"*to be determined within the institutional framework of the European Communities*.\"361 Similarly, in this case, the issue of whether the dispute resolution clauses in the intra-EU BITs violate Art. 344, 267, and 18 of the TFEU is an issue to be determined solely by the CJEU - the body with exclusive authority to interpret EU law with finality.362\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 52 - 53; *MOX Plant* Case, \u00a7 14 **[CLA-0251]** / **[RLA-0263]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 53; *MOX Plant* Case, \u00a7 15 **[CLA-0251]** / **[RLA-0263]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 54; *MOX Plant* Case, \u00a7 24 **[CLA-0251]** / **[RLA-0263]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 54; *see e.g*., *Achmea v. Slovakia*, Award on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 282 **[RLA-0250]** ; *EAIB v. Slovakia*, \u00a7 248 **[CLA-0243]** / **[RLA-0259]**.\n\n275.\n\nThe UNCLOS tribunal recognized that the determination of its jurisdiction was dependent upon the resolution of the problems to be determined by the CJEU. Thus, mindful of the need to prevent the fragmentation of international law, the tribunal suspended the arbitration based on considerations of mutual respect and comity.363 That situation is similar to here, as, if the CJEU establishes that the dispute resolution clauses of certain intra-EU BITs, such as the one in the case at hand, conflict with a particular provision of the TFEU, it could contradict the decision of the Tribunal concerning its own jurisdiction.364 It would therefore be appropriate, based on the principle of comity, and reinforced by the *MOX Plant* case, for the Tribunal to delay or postpone its final deliberations and issuance of an award until after *Achmea* is decided. The Tribunal may stay proceedings pursuant to Art. 44 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 19 of the Arbitration Rules.365\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 55; *MOX Plant* Case, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 28 **[CLA-0251]** / **[RLA-0263]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 56.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 57; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

The Tribunal's Considerations and Conclusions**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the *MOX Plant* case provides no useful guidance in view of the considerable differences between that case and the present case.\n\n277.\n\nFirst, the UNCLOS tribunal's jurisdiction was based on the UNCLOS to which Ireland and the UK, as well as the EU, were party. In the present case, the EU is not a party to the BIT, matters covered by the BIT have not been transferred to the EU and do not relate to EU law, and the CJEU has no jurisdiction in respect of the interpretation and application of the BIT.\n\n278.\n\nSecond, in the *MOX Plant* case, there was significant doubt with respect to the jurisdiction of the UNCLOS tribunal as well as a risk of future conflicting decisions. The present case presents no such risk since the BIT is the only competent forum. Clearly, the CJEU has no jurisdiction to hear a case under the BIT.\n\n279.\n\nFinally, and as Respondent noted in its submissions on *Achmea*,366 the *MOX Plant* tribunal never dealt with the issue of jurisdiction as, after it suspended its proceedings, Ireland withdrew its claim.\n\nRespondent's First Comments on *Achmea* Decision (28 March 2018), at 8.\n\n**VII. APPLICABLE LAW**\n-----------------------\n\n**A. RELEVANT TERMS OF THE BIT**\n--------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nArticle 9(3) of the BIT provides that:\n\n*The arbitral tribunal shall rule in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law.*367\n\nFrance-Hungary BIT, Art. 9(3) **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]**.\n\n281.\n\nClaimants argue that this dispute is governed by the BIT and international law. Pursuant to Art. 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, the choice of law contained in Art. 9(3) of the BIT is binding.368\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 81 - 84; Christoph H. Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch & Anthony Sinclair, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2009, \u00a7\u00a7 42-80 **[CLA-0007]** ; *Burlington Resources Inc. v.

ARGUMENTS RELATED TO THE RELEVANCE OF OTHER DECISIONS AND PARTICULARLY THE** ***E****DENRED*** **AWARD**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nIn this context, though not an issue of the applicable law *per se*, the Tribunal has taken note of the submissions by the Parties regarding other decisions and particularly the Award in the *Edenred* case,371 which was issued during the course of the present proceedings.\n\n*Edenred v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/21 (Award) (13 December 2016) [submitted by Claimants on 24 February 2017].\n\n285.\n\nOn 27 March 2017, the Parties simultaneously submitted their respective comments on the *Edenred* Award to the Tribunal. While the Parties agree that the *Edenred* case has striking similarities with the present matter, they differ on the role that the *Edenred* Award should have in the present matter.\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n286.\n\nClaimants argue that, although the *Edenred* Award cannot be determinative of the Tribunal's decision, it may shed useful light on some issues. While there are differences in the factual record, four specific factual findings made in *Edenred* are relevant to this case: (1) the criteria established by Hungary for the issuance of the SZ\u00c9P Card were tailored to exclude Non-Hungarian Issuers, (2) the purpose underlying the creation of the Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers was to enable 100% of the profit to remain in Hungary and serve a public purpose and the exclusion of Non-Hungarian Issuers was intentional, (3) the allegations that Claimants were charging high commissions to their clients and affiliates are false and the 2011 Reform did not significantly reduce the fees and costs associated with the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher, and (4) despite amendments to the tax system that have occurred since 1 January 2017 in light of the CJEU decision against Hungary, those are an *ex post* amendment that should have no bearing on the merits of the case. *Edenred* confirmed that the 2011 Reform breached Art. 5(2) of the BIT and that Hungary must compensate the investor for that breach. Although there are factual distinctions between the *Edenred* case and this one, the *Edenred* tribunal's approach to the DCF valuation is consistent with Claimants' expert's approach in the present case. Claimants' damages case is different from that in *Edenred*, where the claimant created a counter-factual scenario in which Hungary could have introduced the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher without expropriatory effect. Here, Claimants demonstrate that that could not have happened, as the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher would have been ordinary competitors in the meal voucher market and would not have been able to acquire a significant market share from the already-established players in Hungary. The present case also involves different arguments and facts concerning the dematerialization of the vouchers.\n\n**2. Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n287.\n\nRespondent explained that the *Edenred* Award offers limited useful guidance to the Tribunal and, given its potential prejudicial impact and the absence of a *stare decisis* doctrine in investment arbitration, it should be deemed irrelevant to its deliberations. The only guidance that the Tribunal could draw from the *Edenred* Award relates to how that tribunal recited generally-held legal principles and points of law. The *Edenred* tribunal's application of these principles, however, was inconsistent with predominant and accepted (though non-binding) views of international law and investment law jurisprudence. Importantly, the Tribunal cannot consider the *Edenred* tribunal's determination(s) or characterization(s) of the factual evidence. It is precisely because of the factual and other similarities between the present case and the *Edenred* dispute that Respondent objects to any consideration of the *Edenred* Award in these proceedings. The *Edenred* tribunal faced a different record than the one before the Tribunal, but assessed some of the same factual and expert evidence as has been presented in this case. This places Respondent in the impossible position of needing to refute *Edenred* arguments in these proceedings, as the same claims could now be adopted by Claimants, who may seek to draw conclusions based on comparing the testimony of witnesses who appear in both cases. Notably, neither Claimants nor their witnesses are subject to the same degree of scrutiny. The *Edenred* tribunal's decision regarding indirect expropriation is predicated on an erroneous factual finding - one that is both incorrect and at odds with the *Edenred* tribunal's own description of the record. The *Edenred* tribunal's reliance on the CJEU adjudication - one that involved an entirely different legal system with no relevance under the BIT - was also improper. Finally, the *Edenred* tribunal's damages award disregards recent changes to the fringe benefit system undertaken in light of the CJEU Decision and thereby gave Edenred a double recovery. Although the facts here differ, the risk of granting Claimants a double recovery is no less significant.\n\n**3. Tribunal Considerations and Conclusions**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nIn addition to the *Edenred* Award, the Parties have extensively referred to decisions of other tribunals. However, there is no dispute that, in any event, the decisions of other tribunals are not binding on the Tribunal. The many references by the Parties to certain arbitral decisions in their pleadings do not contradict this conclusion.\n\n289.\n\nThis does not preclude the Tribunal from considering arbitral decisions and the arguments of the Parties based upon them, to the extent that it may find that they shed any useful light on the issues that arise for the decision in the present case.\n\n290.\n\nSuch an examination, including the *Edenred* Award, is conducted by the Tribunal later in this Award, after the Tribunal has considered the Parties' contentions and arguments regarding the various issues argued and relevant for the interpretation of the applicable BIT provisions, while taking into account the specificity of the BIT to be applied in the present case.\n\n**VIII. RESPONDENT'S LIABILITY PURSUANT TO THE TREATY**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. EXPROPRIATION / DISPOSSESSION (ART. 5(2) OF THE BIT)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether Art. 5(2) of the BIT has been breached.372 Article 5(2) provides that:\n\n*The Contracting Parties shall not take any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other measures which could cause the investors of the other Party to be dispossessed, directly or indirectly, of the investments belonging to them in its territory and maritime zones, except for reasons of public necessity and on condition that these measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking.*\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 242 - 243; R-I \u00a7 163.\n\n**1. The Existence of a Right Capable of Expropriation / A Vested Right**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimants' Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThis dispute arises out of Claimants' indirect (in the case of UP) and direct (in the case of CD Internationale) shareholding in CD Hungary. This shareholding is a property right under Hungarian law and, as the Tribunal observed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, is an investment for the purposes of the BIT and Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention.373\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 64 - 65; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 146 - 147, 160 - 162; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 162, 177; Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 March 2016, \u00a7 139.\n\n293.\n\nRelying on the decision in *Emmis*, Respondent argues that Claimants' case \"*fails because they are not able to demonstrate that they had a property right that is even capable of being expropriated.*\"374 Respondent's argument is without merit. Claimants' claims concern Respondent's indirect expropriation of their shareholding in CD Hungary - and this shareholding is similar to what the Respondent - in *Emmis* - accepted as an investment capable of expropriation. Thus, *Emmis* restates the uncontested principle that \"*property rights that are the subject of protection under the international law of expropriation are created by host State law*.\"375 Claimants' shareholding is a vested property right under Hungarian law and, therefore, constitutes a *\"right capable of expropriation\"* Claimants have, therefore, discharged the *\"burden of proving that they had a property interest capable of being expropriated\"376*\n\nC-II \u00a7 148; *Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. v.

Considering Hungarian law, the *Emmis* tribunal concluded that the essential attribute of a property right is that it is \"*an asset capable of ownership, valuation and alienation*.\"381 Tribunals must meticulously identify the rights alleged to have been expropriated.382 Once it is confirmed that such a right has been affected, the analysis turns to whether the taking is expropriatory.383 The *RosInvest* and *ST-AD* cases, among others, demonstrated that while a shareholder may claim a loss in value resulting from damage to the company in which it invested, that damage must result from interference with a separate and distinct property right to be recoverable.384\n\nR-I \u00a7 164; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 208 - 209; *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v.

For future profit claims to be successful, there must be a demonstrable property interest in those future earnings.388 Here, it is undisputed that Claimants had no contract or any other type of commitment that guaranteed them a particular volume of business or access to a certain market for a pre-determined period of operation. That Claimants' future operations had value to them does not make it a property right.389\n\nR-I \u00a7 174; *Merrill & Ring v.

Indeed, Respondent regularly reviewed and modified the voucher system, changed the exemption cap, and introduced new vouchers, and Claimants routinely switched their product-mix, as well as their sales force and market strategy, to take advantage of these changes.390 Rather than continue to adjust and diversify, Claimants decided to suspend operations and claim that the Government deprived them of \"*business activity*\", \"*profits*\", or \"*market*.\" No vested right, however, has been violated by the State.391 Claimants' argument that they had assets and know-how that were tailored to particular market should be rejected. Claimants' only business was made possible as an indirect consequence of Respondent's efforts to provide social benefits to its citizens. Claimants had no reasonable expectation that the tax advantages that they had been able to profitably exploit would remain unchanged.392\n\nR-I \u00a7 176; R-II \u00a7 218; FTI First Report \u00a7 3.6 **[CEX-1]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 218 - 220; D\u00e9r Statement, \u00a7\u00a7 10 - 12, 35, 37 **[CWS-1]** ; Second FTI Report, 4.51, 5.41 **[CEX-2]** ; *Oscar Chinn Case (U.K. v.

Closing).\n\n**(c) Tribunal Considerations and Conclusions**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n302.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, it concluded that, pursuant to Art. 1 of the BIT, Claimants' shareholding in CD Hungary constitutes an \"*investment*\" and Claimants fall within the definition of \"*investor*.\"396\n\nArticle 1 of the France-Hungary BIT, CLA-0001 / RLA-0079, provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n*1. The term 'investment' shall apply to assets such as property, rights and interests of any category, related to economic activity in any sector whatever, established after 31 December 1972, in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory or maritime zones the investment was made, and particularly but not exclusively, to:* [...] *(b) Shares and other forms of participation, albeit minority or indirect, in companies constituted in the territory of either Party;*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*2. The term 'investor' shall apply to:* [\u2026] *(b) Any body corporate constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation and having its registered office there* [\u2026] because the shareholding is not what Claimants allege Respondent has taken. According to Respondent, Claimants' entire claim is based on the loss of economic profitability.\n\n303.\n\nRespondent does not dispute that Claimants have an investment - their shareholding - for the purposes of asserting jurisdiction. In its view, however, the existence of this right is irrelevant\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept that view. Claimants do not submit that Respondent expropriated a right to expect stability or future profits or a right to a particular tax or regulatory system. Rather, Claimants submit that Respondent indirectly expropriated their shareholding in CD Hungary by dispossessing them of the economic value of the shareholding as it existed before the 2011 Reform.\n\n305.\n\nEven if shares remain legally held by a claimant, if a State's measures result in the loss of the shares' economic value, this may be considered an indirect expropriation. This is confirmed by a wide body of jurisprudence such as the awards in *RosInvest*,397*Burlington Resources*,398 and others.399 The *Metalclad* tribunal defined indirect expropriation as an interference which has the effect of depriving the owner \"*of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property[\u2026]*\"400 It has further been established that such a loss of value must be substantial and sufficiently permanent, though a substantial deprivation alone will suffice.401\n\n*RosInvest v.

Indirect Expropriation / The Existence of a Substantial Dispossession**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimants' Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n307.\n\nExpropriation under international law requires an investor to have been substantially deprived of the economic value of or - alternatively - of the use, management or control of its investment. Thus, an expropriation may happen \"*indirectly*\", *i.e.* without a formal transfer of property. The determinative factor is whether the investor has been \"*substantially deprived*\" of its investment. As reflected in Art. 5(2) of the BIT, an assessment of the effect of the relevant measures - as opposed to the State's intention - is critical.402 When assessing evidence of an indirect expropriation, decisive consideration must be given to the effects of the measure in question (the \"*sole effects*\" test).403\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 249 - 250, 262 - 265; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 192 - 198; R-I \u00a7 210; *Burlington v.

First, the issue in this case is whether the 2011 Reform rendered it impossible for Claimants to make economic use of their investment, thereby destroying its value. The issue is not whether the loss is compensable.405 Second, interpreting the term \"*dispossession*\" in accordance with its ordinary meaning and the other terms in the BIT, as required by Art. 31 of the VCLT, shows that it is synonymous with \"*expropriation*.\" Another interpretation whereby dispossession and expropriation were not synonymous would lead to impractical results which, while theoretically possible, would be contrary to the BIT's object and purpose of promoting and protecting investments.406 The preparatory work related to the conclusion of the BIT also indicates that the terms - in French and in Hungarian - are synonyms with the same ordinary meaning.407 Third, Respondent's assumption that \"*dispossession, as it pertains to French treaties*\" must be given special meaning is unjustified. Rather, the terms of French treaties make it clear that the opposite is true.408 Fourth, unlike in *Total* where the tribunal erroneously interpreted the term \"*dispossession*\", the *Vivendi* tribunal made it clear that a reference to \"*dispossession*\" does not alter the applicable legal standard. Rather, \"*dispossession*\" as described therein is the customary international law standard of \"*substantial deprivation*.\"409 Article 5(2) of the BIT, therefore, protects an investor from suffering a substantial deprivation of its investment.410\n\nC-I \u00a7 244; International Investment Law: A Changing Landscape, a Companion Volume to International Investment Perspectives, Chapter 2 \"Indirect Expropriation and The Right to Regulate\" in International Investment Law, OECD, 2005, 49 **[CLA-0010]** ; *S* \u00f6 *hne v.

Under Art. 5(2), \"*control*\" must be understood in the economic sense - *i.e.*, that Claimants have been substantially deprived of the economic value of their investment and have been stripped of their ability to make economic use of it.411 The concept of \"*control*\" is meaningless unless it includes the ability of an investor to continue to operate its investment economically.412 Respondent's focus on \"*control*\" is wrong as a matter of international law.413 Although Claimant CD Internationale continues to hold 100% of the shareholding in CD Hungary, Claimants have nonetheless been substantially deprived of their investment, and this constitutes a taking under Art. 5(2) of the BIT.414\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 207 - 208, 210; *EnCana v.

The 2011 Reform did not reduce CD Hungary's profitability; it destroyed it and reduced CD Hungary to a company with assets but without business.424 CD Hungary exists only on paper and has 2 employees, one who is on maternity leave and cannot be made redundant, and one who runs Claimants' operations in Poland.425 Meal vouchers accounted for 97% of CD Hungary's issue volume by value in 2011. Excluding CD Hungary from the meal voucher market struck at the economic heart of Claimants' investment, bringing CD Hungary to a standstill.426 By destroying CD Hungary's economic value and viability, Respondent substantially deprived Claimants of their investment.427 Respondent has made its refusal to amend the 2011 Reform clear and has shown no willingness to amend the conditions for issuing the SZ\u00c9P Card.428\n\nC-II \u00a7 212; C-I \u00a7\u00a7 256 - 257; Summary table, \"Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner Kft 1997-2012\" **[C-0057]** ; Edenred, Sodexo, Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner press release \"Reform of the restaurant voucher in Hungary\" (2012) **[C-0071]** ; Extract from Internal CD Hungary presentation (2013) **[C-0122]** ; Legrand Statement, \u00a7 39 **[CWS-3]**.\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 211 - 213, *see also* C-I \u00a7\u00a7 256, 258 - 259; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 217 - 218; Summary table, \"Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner Kft. 1997-2012\" **[C-0057]** ; Edenred, Sodexo, Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner press release \"Reform of the restaurant voucher in Hungary\" (2012) **[C-0071]** ; Extract from Internal CD Hungary presentation (2013) **[C-0122]** ; Legrand Statement, \u00a7 39 **[CWS-3]** ; \"Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\", 53 UN GAOR Supp. (No. 10) at 43, UN Doc.

Legitimate exercises of a government's regulatory authority are not expropriatory, regardless of the alleged deprivation or loss. Adopting the broad formulation proposed by Claimants would be contrary to customary international law and its application through the relevant arbitral jurisprudence, which recognize that governments must be free to act in the public interest, in particular through new or modified tax regimes or the granting or withdrawal of government subsidies.433\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 168 - 169; *Saluka v.

In *Emanuel Too v. Greater Modesto Insurance Associates*, the tribunal explained that \"*a State is not responsible for... economic disadvantage resulting from bona fide general taxation... provided it is not discriminatory[\u2026]*\"438\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 3.\n\nR-II \u00a7 114.\n\nR-II \u00a7 114; *ADM v.

For indirect expropriation as alleged by Claimants, the intent is to provide compensation only for those acts which cause the investor to be dispossessed of its ownership (*i.e*., title or use/right of possession) and not a loss of economic value.440 Claimants remain in control of their shares and were free to manage the operations of CD Hungary as they saw fit. None of their assets or offices were seized and they were free to sell vouchers, including their hot and cold meal vouchers, to new and existing clients. Their products still enjoyed tax advantages.441 Here, however, Claimants complain about reduced profits and alleged lost opportunities to expand and maintain their market share.442 Economic loss alone is not compensable under the BIT. Claimants cannot base an expropriation claim on the loss of value or capacity to earn a commercial return, but instead must show a loss of one of the attributes of ownership.443\n\nR-I \u00a7 205; C-I \u00a7 343.\n\nR-II \u00a7 167; C-II \u00a7 300; Dominique Carreau et Patrick Juillard, *Droit International Economique,* 1\u00e9re \u00e9dition, 2003, paras. 1376-1377 **[CLA-0208]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 210; R-II \u00a7 188; RPHB-I \u00a7 5.\n\nR-II \u00a7 155; C-II \u00a7 155.\n\nR-I \u00a7 205; R-II \u00a7 173.\n\n317.\n\nAlthough largely similar to expropriation, \"*dispossession*\" is not a functional equivalent of expropriation, but rather is an element of expropriation.444 In *Total v. Argentina*, it was described as a term that was \"*more restrictive*\" than \"*expropriation*.\"445 Claimants acknowledge that the text of the BIT is to be interpreted as to its ordinary meaning.446 Here, the BIT plainly refers to dispossession, the ordinary meaning of which relates to the taking of property, usually real property.447 This was not an accidental choice of language - the signatories selected a term that has a specific meaning under civil law systems. The French Expropriation code distinguishes between the transfer of legal title and the taking of possession. Expropriation under French law requires both transfer of legal title and dispossession. The requirement to pay just compensation results not from the loss of property itself, but the loss of its material and physical attributes. That dispossession requires a loss of control is further evidenced by the law concerning the loss of property in the territory which used to be under French Protectorate.448 Because dispossession requires a loss of possession, it necessarily contemplates a loss of material control and the ability to exercise the rights associated with ownership of the property.449 Claimants' observation that Hungary and France failed to distinguish between \"dispossession\" and \"expropriation\" - even in the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* - does not militate in favor of a broader understanding of what is required to establish a claim under Art. 5(2).450 The *travaux* confirm Hungary's position.\n\nR-I \u00a7 206; *Vivendi v.

It may also be typical to experience short-term loss before being able to recalibrate and achieve profit.473 The limited documentation provided appears to recognize that losses were not likely to be indefinite.474 While Mr. Legrand claims that CD Hungary was unable to diversify in the short-term, the documented strategic analysis instead suggests that diversification and the return of lost customers might be possible.475 CD Hungary did not even attempt to adjust to new market conditions.476 Instead, the record indicates that even as of 27 October 2012, Claimants preferred to take advantage of the BIT and the potential it offered for full reparation.477 The BIT, however, is not intended to be an insurance policy, nor does it protect the investor from taking necessary measures to make their investment profitable.478\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 195; SZ\u00c9P Card Proposal, 28 **[R-0008]** ; *Burlington v.

Since the 2011 Reform, the Government expanded the use of some vouchers and began subsidizing new ones. These are opportunities that Claimants could have taken advantage of, had they not suspended operations.481 The circumstances surrounding Claimants' decision to leave Hungary show that they also did not anticipate or understand the 2011 Reform or attendant losses to be permanent: they told their affiliates that they were \"*suspending*\" performance, not permanently leaving the market.482\n\nR-II \u00a7 204; *S.D.

Closing).\n\n**(c) Tribunal Considerations and Conclusions**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal recalls that Art. 5(2) of the BIT expressly clarifies that it considers as an *\"expropriation\"* \"[...] *measures which could cause the investors of the other Party to be dispossessed, directly or indirectly, of the investments belonging to them in its territory* [\u2026] \"492\n\nIn the official French version of the France-Hungary BIT, Art. 5(2) states as follows: \"*Les Parties contrastantes ne prennent pas de mesures d\u2019exportation ou de nationalisation ou toutes autres mesures dont l\u2019effet est de d\u00e9poss\u00e9der, directement ou indirectement, les investisseurs de l\u2019autre Partie des investissements leur appartenant sur son territoire et dans ses zones maritimes, si ce n\u2019est pour cause d\u2019utilit\u00e9 publique et a condition que ces mesures ne soient pas discriminatoires, ni contraires a un engagement particulier.* [...]\" **[CLA-0001] / [RLA-0079]** (emphasis added).\n\n331.\n\nThus, any \"*measures*\" have to be considered, irrespective of whether they are legislative, administrative, or other measures undertaken by the State.493 What is relevant is whether such measures had the effect of dispossessing Claimants, directly or indirectly, of their investment. Therefore, the test is not which measure caused which effect, but whether the \"*measures*\" taken together as a package resulted in the dispossession. For the present case, this means that the Tribunal need not examine whether Respondent's taxation changes, administrative decisions taken, or the introduction of the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher and the SZ\u00c9P Card, each by themselves, caused a dispossession. Rather, the Tribunal must examine whether these measures together had the effect of dispossession.\n\nAs mentioned in the *Edenred* Award (\u00a7 316), this conclusion is supported (applying Art. 31(1) VCLT) by the literal wording of the BIT, which uses the adjective \"*any*\" to emphasize the broadness of scope. Consequently, the term \"*measures*\" encompass all administrative acts taken by the Hungarian State, including its agencies and territorial bodies, legislative acts of general application, formalized as laws approved by Parliament or as decrees or other regulations authorized by the Government, and judicial decisions adopted by Hungarian courts and other judicial bodies.\n\n332.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal has noted the Parties' discussion of a possible difference between \"*expropriation*\" and \"*dispossession*.\" The Tribunal does not consider that discussion relevant for its own decision. From the text of Art. 5(2), it is clear that the terms \"*expropriation*\", *nationalization*\", and \"*other measures*\" describe the action taken by a government and indicate, by inserting the word \"*other*\", that the term \"*measures*\" includes all three of these terms. Thereafter, the term \"*dispossessed*\" describes the result of such measures.\n\n333.\n\nTherefore, to determine if there is a dispossession, the Tribunal has to compare the economic value of Claimants' investment, *i.e.* its shareholding, before the disputed measures, to the value after such measures. This analysis will show whether there was a substantial loss in value and whether this loss was an effect of the measures.\n\n334.\n\nBefore Respondent's 2011 Reform, Claimants' investment had produced a profit every year since 2004, including the years after Reforms 2009 and 2010 to which Claimants had to readapt their access to the market.494 While the extent of profit and the effective value of the shareholding will have to examined in the later chapter on damages, in the present context it suffices to state that, for years, the shareholding was an investment with a considerable economic value.\n\n*See* C-I \u00a7\u00a7 34 - 45, 139 (chart), 141.\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal now has to examine whether Claimants were substantially dispossessed of that economic value by Respondent's 2011 Reform.\n\n336.\n\nRespondent concedes that \"[i] *n order to constitute an indirect expropriation, measures taken by the State must interfere with property rights to such an extent that these rights are 'rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have been expropriated' so that the measures thus must effectively destroy the economic benefit of the investment, resulting in the 'neutralization, radical deprivation, irretrievable loss, inability to use, enjoy or dispose of the property' and/or 'that the property can no longer be put to reasonable use' or 'makes any form of exploitation of the property disappear.'\"*495\n\nR-II \u00a7 183; *National Grid v.

Iran* **[RLA-0065]**.\n\n337.\n\nWhile the Tribunal does not necessarily subscribe to every detail of this interpretation, it considers that, in the present case, the essence of this interpretation by Respondent itself is fulfilled.\n\n338.\n\nThe evidence as confirmed at the Hearing shows that Respondent, as part of the 2011 Reform, adopted a number of measures which it itself considered as a package under that name: (1) the SZ\u00c9P Card, (2) the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher, and (3) a preferential tax rate.496 Taking into account the earlier considerations to the effect that the results of the package rather than those of each particular measure are relevant for an examination under Art. 5(2) of the BIT, the Tribunal now has to examine the results of the package of the 2011 Reform.\n\nThis was acknowledged by Respondent's witness Szatm\u00e1ry at Tr. Day 2 at 155:8-13 (Szatm\u00e1ry).\n\n339.\n\nThe first measure was the introduction of the SZ\u00c9P Card by decree of 12 April 2011.497 Although Respondent has argued that it was only designed to purchase holiday-related services, Respondent's witness Mr. Szatm\u00e1ry confirmed at the Hearing that, from the outset, the government intended to use the SZ\u00c9P Card to purchase hot meals.498 And indeed, the provisions of the PIT Law applicable to the SZ\u00c9P Card were quickly amended after the entry into force of the decree of 12 April 2011 to allow the SZ\u00c9P Card to purchase hot meals.499\n\nDecree No. 55/2011 **[C-0073]** / **[RLA-0091]**.\n\nTr. Day 2 at 154:10-12 (Szatm\u00e1ry) (\"*Q. Isn't it the case that by 1 January 2012 the SZ\u00c9P Card had been extended to hot meals? Is that correct? A.

R-II \u00a7\u00a7 94, 326. Regardless, however, as the Tribunal finds below, the modifications were not foreseeable as of the Valuation Date..\n\nDecree No. 55/2011, 3 **[C-0073]** / **[RLA-0091]**.\n\n341.\n\nSince all of these cumulative criteria had to be satisfied, there was no way that CD Hungary could qualify. These criteria were obviously tailored such that only a small number of pre-selected issuers would qualify.502 Mr. Szatm\u00e1ry confirmed at the Hearing that the government knew, prior to the adoption of the SZ\u00c9P Card decree, which companies would qualify.503\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 144 - 155; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 82 - 86; The letters exchanged in February 2011 between the Ministry for National Economy and the PSZAF show that, having restricted the possibility to become a SZ\u00c9P Card Issuer to financial institutions, Respondent tailored the criteria to ensure that no more than two or three banks would be eligible. *See* Letter from Mr. Endre Horv\u00e1th (Deputy Minister of State, responsible for economic development) to Mr. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balogh (Vice-President, the PSZAF), 15 February 2011 **[C-0148]** ; Letter from Mr. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balogh (Vice-President, the PSZAF) to Mr. Endre Horv\u00e1th (Deputy Minister of State, responsible for economic development), 28 February 2011 **[C-0149]**.\n\n*See* Tr.

(...) *The MNE requests the HSFA to review these terms and conditions* (...) *to ease them to ensure that potentially the 2-3 largest actors should be able to comply with them*.\"); Letter from Mr. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balogh (Vice-President, the PSZAF) to Mr. Endre Horv\u00e1th (Deputy Minister of State, responsible for economic development) (28 February 2011) **[C-0149]**.\n\n342.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes from the evidence that Respondent defined criteria for SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers that only selected banks could meet. While the SZ\u00c9P Card Decree theoretically makes it possible for any company to become an issuer, Respondent knew - and intended - that in practice no company other than three selected banks, and certainly not the Claimants, would qualify.\n\n343.\n\nThe second measure was the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher. It was a paper voucher which could only be issued by a State-owned entity, the MNUA, and was introduced by the 2011 PIT Law.504 The Erzs\u00e9bet voucher was initially presented to be used for the purchase of cold meals only. As confirmed by Respondent, it decided to extend it to hot meals first for 2012 only, and then permanently from 2013 onward.505.\n\n2011 PIT Law **[C-0074] / [RLA-0088]**, National Ministry of Economics, Proposal for the Government in Connection with the Amendment of Certain Tax Acts and Other Related Acts (11 October 2011), 9 **[R-0016]**.\n\nC-I \u00a7 158; Law CVX of 2013 on The amendment of certain acts on economic matters (21 June 2013) **[C-0086]**.\n\n344.\n\nFor Claimants, this measure eliminated the remaining segment of the market in which CD Hungary could have continued to sell its vouchers. This segment was relevant, because of the low acceptance of electronic cards in many areas of Hungary. If the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher had been confined to cold meals, clients who wanted to buy hot meal vouchers for their employees without using the SZ\u00c9P Card could have turned to the hot meal paper vouchers issued by CD Hungary. With the extension of the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher to hot meals, however, this possibility disappeared.\n\n345.\n\nThe third measure was a change in the taxation rules applicable to meal vouchers, adopted by the 2011 PIT Law.506 The SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher were given a preferential tax rate over the existing meal vouchers sold by CD Hungary and other issuers. The 2011 Reform reserved a preferential tax rate of 30.94% (Art. 71 of 2011 PIT Law) for the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher, while transferring the hot and cold meal vouchers sold by CD Hungary (and other French issuers) to another category of \"*specific defined benefits*\" (Art. 70 of the 2011 PIT Law) which were subject to a tax rate of 51.17%, *i.e.* significantly higher than the rate applicable to the two new products.\n\n2011 PIT Law **[C-0074] / [RLA-0088]**.\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent's argument that non-meal vouchers were taxed at the same rate as the SZ\u00c9P Card and Erzs\u00e9bet voucher after the 2011 Reform. Only meal vouchers are relevant to this arbitration. It is also not relevant that the SZ\u00c9P Card and Erzs\u00e9bet voucher were taxed at the same rate as CD Hungary's vouchers above the exemption ceiling, because the meal voucher market only exists, in practice, up to the exemption ceiling.507 Finally, the Tribunal does not consider it relevant that CD Hungary's vouchers were still, after the 2011 Reform, subject to a tax rate that was lower than the rate applicable to salaries (96%), because, in practice, there was no market for these vouchers above the exemption ceiling, and employers could not be expected to increasingly use vouchers instead of salaries to pay their employees.\n\nAs explained by Ms. Nagy, clients would normally have a budget to buy meal vouchers for their employees which corresponds to the cumulated value of the exemption ceiling for hot and cold meal vouchers. Once the total exemption ceiling has been reached, clients would have no more budget. It is therefore irrelevant that CD Hungary could theoretically compete with the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher and the SZ\u00c9P card on equal terms above the exemption ceiling. Virtually no company would have purchased vouchers above the exemption ceiling. Tr. Day 2 at 21:14 - 22:3 (Nagy).\n\n347.\n\nIn view of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent created a tax differential in favor of its two new products, the SZ\u00c9P Card and Erzs\u00e9bet voucher, which disadvantaged CD Hungary. Whether this preferential tax treatment alone would have caused a dispossession of Claimants' investment does not have to be determined by the Tribunal because, for the reasons elaborated above, it is the result of Respondent's *package of measures*, *i.e.,* the SZ\u00c9P Card, the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher, and the tax advantages, which together result in a dispossession.\n\n348.\n\nIn 2011, CD Hungary, Edenred, and Sodexo together accounted for 86% of the Hungarian meal voucher market.508 The evidence shows that the 2011 Reform was intended to - and in fact did -exclude CD Hungary (and other French issuers) from the meal voucher market and replace them, such that the profits made in this sector would no longer be made by foreign-owned companies such as CD Hungary, and repatriated to their foreign owners like Claimants, but would instead stay in Hungary.\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 3.17, 3.19-3.20 **[CEX-1]**.\n\n349.\n\nThat this was, indeed, a goal of the package was confirmed by a speech by the State Secretary of the KIM to the Hungarian Parliament in which he mentioned:\n\n[a]*s for the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher in particular: this field has been controlled by foreign owned companies. The 10% financial profit of the voucher market, which exceeds HUF 200 billion, has been realized by foreign-owned companies. By this proposal, 100% of the profit will stay in Hungary and serve a public purpose, the social and child-based catering. For the Government, it is hard to find resources financing public well-being and community purposes, but this is a typical success story, since the profit, which had [sic] until now migrated abroad now forms a huge meal-voucher market as profit, it will serve the purposes of social and children catering henceforward.* [... ]509\n\nSpeech No. 152/90 by Dr. Bence R\u00e9tv\u00e1ri (State Secretary of the KIM) (Plenary Session of Parliament) (12 December 2011) **[C-0119]** / **[R-0055]**.\n\n350.\n\nThis is also confirmed by a Draft Proposal of September 2011 for the reform of the fringe benefit system, which was addressed to the Government.510 It clearly states that the hot meal account of the SZ\u00c9P Card *\"would be the successor of the previous hot meal voucher in the form of a card* [\u2026] \"511 Like the May 2011 Memorandum, this September 2011 Draft Proposal repeated that the hot meal account of the SZ\u00c9P Card \"*would thus be the electronic card version of the previous hot meal vouchers\"* and expressly clarified that *\"[t]his decision would mean that the hot meal benefits would be issued by the institutions entitled to issue the SZ\u00c9P Card instead of the current issuers. \"*512 The reference to *\"instead of the current issuers\"* leaves no doubt that the hot meal vouchers would be issued by the SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers and would no longer be issued by the existing or then-current issuers - including CD Hungary.\n\nProposal for the Government on the reform of the system of fringe benefits, dated September 2011 **[R-0015]**.\n\n*Id*. (emphasis added).\n\n*Id*. (emphasis added).\n\n351.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal concludes from the evidence that Respondent intended to create a State monopoly and evict CD Hungary from the meal voucher market, or at the very least, it knew that the effect of the 2011 Reform would be that no clients would continue to buy CD Hungary's meal vouchers and that they would buy the SZ\u00c9P Card and Erzs\u00e9bet voucher instead.\n\n352.\n\nAs a result of the 2011 Reform, CD Hungary was evicted from the meal voucher market. Meal vouchers represented 97% of its business in 2011.513\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7 4.23 **[CEX-1]**.\n\n353.\n\nAs argued by Claimants, CD Hungary was in a desperate position within months after the implementation of the 2011 Reform, and there is no evidence that Respondent had any intention to change the 2011 Reform. The destruction of the value of Claimants' shareholding was permanent, or at least sufficiently permanent for the purposes of expropriation. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal accepts that Claimants' decision to shut down as of 2013 and to repatriate some of CD Hungary's reserves after CD Hungary started to collapse following the 2011 Reform was inevitable. This was a legitimate and reasonable decision justified to avoid further losses.\n\n354.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the package of Respondent's measures in the 2011 Reform, resulting in creating in fact a State monopoly and excluding CD Hungary from the meal voucher market, dispossessed Claimants of the greatest part and the economic heart of their investment, bringing CD Hungary to a standstill. By destroying CD Hungary's economic value Respondent substantially dispossessed Claimants of their investment.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this conclusion is in conformity with that in the *Edenred* Award, though certain factual and legal differences between the two cases exist.514\n\nEdenred, \u00a7 434 (\"*In summary, the counter-arguments submitted by Respondent cannot be endorsed by the Arbitral Tribunal. The 2012 Reforms constitute 'measures having the effect of directly or indirectly dispossessing' Edenred of its investment in Hungary, in breach of Art. 5(2) of the BIT*.\") *.*\n\n356.\n\nHaving established that a dispossession as required under Art. 5(2) of the BIT was indeed effected by Respondent, the Tribunal will now turn to the question whether this dispossession was lawful and, therefore, that it does not justify the consequences provided by Art. 5(2) of the BIT or by a breach of that provision.\n\n**3.

Their statements are attributable to Respondent and are a clear indication of the true intention of the Government.529 While Respondent seeks to downplay the significance of these remarks, Respondent's deliberate targeting of Claimants' investment supports a finding of expropriation.530\n\nC-II \u00a7 253; Respondent press release, \"The Government Launches Social Holidays Programme\" (12 January 2012) **[C-0083]** ; Dr. Bence R\u00e9tv\u00e1ri (State Secretary of the KIM), Speech at the Parliament No 152/90 (12 December 2011) **[C-0119]** ; Mr. Mikl\u00f3s Solt\u00e9sz (Ministry of Natural Resources), Speech at the Parliament No 152/161 (12 December 2011) **[C-0120]** ; Mr. Mikl\u00f3s Solt\u00e9sz (Ministry of Natural Resources), Speech at the Parliament No 152/165 (12 December 2011) **[C-0121]**.\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 292 - 294; *ADC v.

Opening).\n\n366.\n\nSecond, Respondent's claim that the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher was created to fund a social welfare program cannot serve as an excuse to create a monopoly. There were less onerous measures that could have achieved the same purpose - including the imposition of a social tax - without excluding CD Hungary and other French issuers.536\n\nCPHB-I Annex No. 7.\n\n367.\n\nThird, in response to Respondent's alleged public purpose that the reform would solve structural problems identified in a review of the voucher system, Respondent has failed to show that such a review ever existed. None of the documents upon which Respondent relied prove that the information was gathered, analyzed, or collated on the structural problems or that a review was conducted.537 Likewise, none of Respondent's witnesses have demonstrated that there were problems in the voucher system or that a review was conducted.538\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 55 - 60; Tr.

Voucher issuers did not receive a subsidy from the State. Rather, the issuers issued vouchers that benefitted from a preferential tax treatment through reduced rates of healthcare contributions and personal income tax rates. The issuer's clients (employers) benefitted from the preferential tax and thus, the employees, not the issuer, benefitted.539\n\nCPHB-I Annex No. 7\n\n369.\n\nFifth, Respondent's public purpose arguments that the SZ\u00c9P Card was meant to allow the creation of a more modern, secure, efficient, solvent and cost-effective system based on electronic vouchers does not explain (1) the stringent criteria to become a SZ\u00c9P Card Issuer or (2) the preferential tax rate, as neither are necessary to achieve this objective.540 To the contrary, Respondent's creation of the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher as a paper voucher contradicts the stated intention to dematerialize the voucher market.541\n\n*Id*.; CPHB-I \u00a7 63.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 64; First Guller Statement, \u00a7 32 **[RWS-1]**.\n\n**(ii) Proportionality and the Effect of the Measure**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nTo be a legitimate exercise of police power, regulatory measures must be proportionate to the public purpose pursued. That measures are adopted in the public interest does not preclude them from being expropriatory or absolve the state from its duty to compensate.542 As with any other measure, the critical question is the extent of the interference with the investor's property.543 The deference due to a host state does not preclude tribunals from scrutinizing the proportionality of the measures adopted.544\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 227, 229; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 178, 182; *Tecmed v.

First, Respondent failed to demonstrate that the problems it alleges ever arose. Second, no other EU Member State had imposed comparable requirements on the issuers of electronic vouchers. Third, less restrictive measures were available to Respondent. Fourth, Respondent rebuffed Claimants' and AETR's efforts to engage with Respondent, and this in and of itself was disproportionate. Fifth, even credit institutions are not subject to statutory conditions comparable to those contained in Art. 13 of the SZ\u00c9P Decree. A voucher cannot be equated with a bank card. The CJEU agreed and found that the conditions for the issuance of the SZ\u00c9P Card were neither necessary nor proportionate.545\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 239 - 240; *EC v.

This precludes the 2011 Reform from being a legitimate exercise of Respondent's general regulatory powers.546\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 241 - 244; *EC v.

Rather, (1) CD Hungary was in like circumstances to the Beneficiaries of the 2011 Reform, and (2) the 2011 Reform subjected it and Claimants as investors to differential treatment without reasonable justification.550 Respondent has not discharged its burden of proof that no discrimination has taken place. The differential treatment included (1) establishing criteria for the issue of SZ\u00c9P Cards (which could be used as an \"account\" to purchase hot meals) that only three Hungary-based groups could meet, (2) granting MNUA a monopoly over the issue of Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers (initially limited to cold meals, but extended to hot meals), and (3) introducing a tax framework that subjected CD Hungary's meal vouchers to higher tax rates than those imposed on the SZ\u00c9P Card and Erzs\u00e9bet voucher, in order to penalize CD Hungary by encouraging clients and users to switch products.551\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 236, 245, 263; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 178, 196; *Tecmed v.

After the 2011 Reform, the Beneficiaries used their new found fiscal advantage to drive the non-Hungarian Issuers from the market. By 2012, the Non-Hungarian issuers who had made up 86% of the market were almost completely displaced.552\n\nC-I \u00a7 286; Edenred, Sodexo, Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner press release \"Reform of the restaurant voucher in Hungary\" (2012) **[C-0071]** ; First FTI Report, \u00a7 1.11 **[CEX-1]**.\n\n376.\n\nThere was no reasonable justification for the imposition of differential tax treatment - CD Hungary's meal vouchers were functionally identical to the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher and the meals account on the SZ\u00c9P Card.553 There was no reason to reclassify CD Hungary's meal vouchers as \"*specific defined benefits*\" with a higher tax rate, rather than \"*non-wage benefits*\", as the Erzs\u00e9bet and SZ\u00c9P Card were classified and as CD Hungary's vouchers were previously classified.554 The 2011 Reform deliberately targeted Claimants' investment, breaching Respondent's international obligations and Claimants' legitimate expectations. Such a bad faith measure cannot be a legitimate exercise of the State's police powers.555\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 288 - 289; C-II \u00a7 249; PIT Law as amended in 2010, effective 1 January 2011 **[C-0068]** ; 2011 PIT Law, Art. 70, 71(1)(bb) **[C-0074] / [RLA-0088]**.\n\nC-I \u00a7 287.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 290; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 251 - 252, 259 - 260; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 178, 203; *Vivendi v.

It requires, in the words of *ADC v. Hungary*, that there be an \"*actual and substantive legal procedure for a foreign investor to raise its claims against the depriving actions [,..]\"556* The expropriation was carried out without due process. The FIDESZ government so weakened the independence and reach of the judiciary that the basic requirement of due process would not have been met in relation to any measures passed at the time of the 2011 Reform.557 To the extent that Respondent alleges that it fulfilled its due process obligations by engaging in \"*extensive consultation*\" with market participants, to the extent that any consultation was conducted, key stake holders and the existing issuers were excluded.558\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 300 - 302; *AIG v.

A lawful expropriation under Art. 5(2) of the BIT must be accompanied by prompt and adequate compensation - the failure to pay compensation will make an otherwise lawful expropriation unlawful.559 Although it can be argued that the failure to pay compensation should not render an otherwise lawful expropriation unlawful, Respondent has never even offered Claimants compensation. Accordingly, Respondent committed an unlawful expropriation contrary to Art. 5(2) of the BIT.560\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 265; C-I \u00a7\u00a7 305 - 311; *Burlington v.

As Claimants agree, economic damage caused by *bona fide*, general, proportionate, and non-discriminatory regulation is not, in normal circumstances, compensable.561 The application of the police powers doctrine, in particular with respect to tax and fiscal policy, precludes a finding of expropriation. Nothing in international law or the BIT prohibits a country from creating tax breaks or subsidies, so long as those decisions are not discriminatory.562 The deprivations of which Claimants complain are not expropriatory at all - rather, they are a legitimate exercise of the government's regulatory authority.563 Below, Respondent demonstrates that the measures were (1) enacted for a public purpose, (2) were proportional to these goals, and (3) were non-discriminatory. Further, Respondent complied with (4) the requirements of due process. Accordingly, (5) Claimants are not owed compensation.\n\nR-I \u00a7 178; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 97 - 99; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 221 - 224, 231, 265; C-I \u00a7 178; *Marvin Feldman v.

Respondent does not tax vouchers - it offers tax breaks on some income that is provided as vouchers rather than salary. Claimants were not deprived of their investment or of any right by application of an excessive tax, making their \"*confiscatory tax*\" theory inapt.564\n\nR-II \u00a7 106; C-II \u00a7 225.\n\n381.\n\nWhile Claimants wanted Respondent to accede to their demands and maintain the *status quo*, Claimants' sense of entitlement does not sustain a claim under the BIT.565 The 2011 Reform did not contradict any commitment made by Respondent to Claimants, making this situation similar to that in *Methanex*, where - in the absence of a promise upon which to base their allegations of expropriation - the case was dismissed.566 Claimants were not entitled to expect that the Hungarian regulatory regime would remain unchanged - the market was always predicated on a discretionary regulatory system.567\n\nR-II \u00a7 125; C-II \u00a7 235.\n\nR-I \u00a7 202; *Methanex v.

The 2011 Reform resulted from critical budget concerns as well as a mandate from the Hungarian electorate and was undertaken for important public and social goals. As part of the 2011 Reform, the SZ\u00c9P Card was designed to protect consumers through regulation and technological innovation, as well as to encourage Hungarians to improve their health, among other social purposes.571 The criteria for the issuance of the SZ\u00c9P Card were designed to protect the end-user, as well as other participants in the previously unregulated fringe benefits system.572 The Erzs\u00e9bet program is a social benefits program that uses the issuance of vouchers to fund itself, which also aimed to regulate and create a more transparent fringe benefit system. Both measures were constitutional under Hungarian law.573\n\nR-I \u00a7 182; *ADC v. Hungary*, \u00a7 432 **[CLA-0030]** / **[RLA-0004]** ; *Tecmed. v.

Rather, the available documentation reflects the concerns about achieving the stated voucher objectives. The statements of re-election seeking officials, who made their statements when the 2011 Reform was already in place, are not able to reveal the true intention of the government.574\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 183 - 185; SZ\u00c9P Card Proposal **[R-0008]**.\n\n386.\n\nAlthough Claimants state that they were ignorant of problems facing the voucher system, the lobby group of which they were a part - AETR - began already in January 2010 to provide proposals on how to \"*combat, and sanction, misuse of vouchers*\" in light of criticisms that had been presented. AETR recognized the need for regulation and acknowledged that it was in the interest of all \"*participants in the sector to ensure that the activities of voucher issuers are regulated*.\" The clear implication is that, at least by January 2010, fringe benefits were not efficiently serving their purpose.575 Claimants also admit that they began studying moving to an electronic card (\"*dematerialization*\") in 2006 because cards enabled a level of governmental oversight that was not possible with paper vouchers. Finding the option too expensive, however, CD Hungary chose not to pursue it.576\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 128, 130; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 53, 128; Proposal from the AETR concerning the universal regulation of the system for allocating benefits in kind (January 2010) **[C-0145]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 129; Internal CD Hungary memorandum, \"Outline of situation - cards on the Hungarian market\" (18 July 2007) **[C-0134]** ; First Nagy Statement, \u00a7 44 **[CWS-2]**.\n\n387.\n\nThe introduction of the new fringe benefits - the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher and the SZ\u00c9P Card - and the other aspects of the 2011 Reforms, served multiple interrelated economic and social objectives, including the (1) creation of an efficient and secure system, (2) promotion of healthy living and prevention of disease, (3) promotion of domestic tourism and stimulation of economic growth, (4) generation of revenue to fund social welfare programming, (5) elimination of voucher misuse, and (6) enhancement of consumer protection.\n\n388.\n\nRegarding (1), the Government aimed to incentivize dematerialization - *i.e.*, the shift to electronic vouchers. Electronic cards would mitigate the problems of lost or expired vouchers by enabling issuers to easily track usage and to compensate employees for lost vouchers.577 The shift to electronic cards would also contribute to the overall modernization of the Fringe Benefit System and to Hungary generally, by spurring the proliferation of POS machines.578 The Government also wanted to reduce inefficiencies endemic in the Fringe Benefit System, including those related to commission expenses. The SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers are prohibited from charging commissions to employers and employees and may only charge affiliates a fixed commission of 1.5%.579\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 106 - 107; SZ\u00c9P Card Proposal, 4 **[R-0008]** ; Tr.

Issuers also have reporting obligations to the Hungarian Trade Licensing Office and the Office is responsible for monitoring the activity of the Issuer and publishing a report every six months.

These were proportionate in light of (1) the importance of these goals to the Hungarian government and the Hungarian people, (2) the pervasive nature of inefficiencies and violations tainting the previous system, and (3) Claimants having had no legitimate expectation that such measures would not ever be enacted.595 Claimants' analysis also overlooks that there were more onerous options that were rejected by Respondent. For example, the Government could have closed the market to Claimants by limiting the market to just SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers and the MNUA. Instead, however, all issuers were entitled to continue to issue vouchers and a number of vouchers continued to receive favorable tax treatment. This is because the 2011 Reform was aimed to regulate - not abolish - the voucher system. CD Hungary's fellow French issuers continue to operate and issue vouchers in the market.596\n\nR-I \u00a7 188.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 190; R-II \u00a7 126; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 98, 239, 242.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 188 - 189; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 134 - 135; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 107, 108; First Nagy Statement, \u00a7\u00a7 52 - 53 **[CWS-2]** ; First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 243 - 246 **[REX-1]**.\n\n397.\n\nThe 2012 UNCTAD Publication on Expropriation confirms that it is inappropriate to transplant the proportionality analyses designed an applied to one particular legal regime to the investment treaty context.597 The proportionality analysis in investment law is far less onerous and less broad than in the European human rights context or in the CJEU analysis in its 23 February 2016 decision.598 Claimants were not represented in the CJEU proceedings and those proceedings did not consider any alleged \"*burden*\" on Claimants.599\n\nR-II \u00a7 119; UNCTAD, *Expropriation* (2012)\"] **[RLA-0239]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 118; *EC v.

Further, while in most countries only 20 - 25% of employees use vouchers, in Hungary nearly 80% do, representing a different level of risk and exposure posed by the market.600 There is significant variation as to how different jurisdictions regulate the issuance of fringe benefit vouchers and many restrict or otherwise regulate the market.601\n\nR-II \u00a7 131; Wanjek, *Food at Work* (2005) **[RLA-0109]** ; First Navigant Report, Figure 4 **[REX-1]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 132; C-II \u00a7 92 (bullet 2); Wanjek, *Food at Work* (2005) **[RLA-0109]** ; Belgian Royal Decree laying down the approval conditions and the approval procedure for the issuers of food vouchers in electronic format **[RLA-0197]** ; French Labor Code, Art.

It settled on requiring that every issuer have an office in every town of more than 35,000 inhabitants, to balance the need to obtain geographic coverage for clients, users, and affiliates with the cost to potential issuers.604 This standard is not \"*arbitrary*\", as Claimants suggest.605\n\nR-II \u00a7 136; *Joseph Charles Lemire v.

The true value of the Erzs\u00e9bet program is that is a \"*self-sufficient, viable project, which can function without state budget resources as an effective social tool in years of economic downturn*.\" Claimants' argument that social programs should simply be funded by the State exposes their ignorance of the state of the Hungarian economy as of the 2011 Reform. Claimants are also unaided by referencing considerations about a possible solidarity tax, which could not generate as much funds as could be generated through the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher.607 The Erzs\u00e9bet Program was carefully tailored to achieve its goals of ensuring that food is available to the most disadvantaged and marginalized, and that the revenues so generated were put to charitable purposes. The issuance of this voucher by the State-owned MNUA assured that these goals would be prioritized. They were issued for a modest amount (HUF 5,000, approximately EUR 16), above which they no longer attracted a better tax rate than other vouchers, including the hot and cold meal vouchers sold by CD Hungary. The Erzs\u00e9bet voucher created no competition regarding Claimants' cold meal vouchers. For the first quarter of 2012, 20% of Claimants' customers used both Erzs\u00e9bet and CD Hungary products.608\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 139 - 140; *EC v.

The tax law concerned the economy as a whole.613\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 146 - 147; *Marvin Feldman v. Mexico*, \u00a7 170 [ **CLA-0013]** / **[RLA-0041]** ; *Metalpar S.A. and Buen Aire S.A. v.

Nothing prevents a non-Hungarian issuer from becoming a Card Issuer, and this was not the intent. The three Card Issuers were foreign owned initially, and two still are.614 That Claimants describe them as \"*Hungary-based*\" is misleading and confusing - the same term could be applied to CD Hungary.615\n\nR-I \u00a7 198; Letter from Mr. Mih\u00e1ly Varga (Minister of the National Economy) to Mr. Jacques Landriot (CEO, Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner CCR, Legal representative of the President, CD Internationale) (26 July 2013) **[R-0025]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 149.\n\n405.\n\nClaimants were not \"*in like circumstances to the Beneficiaries*.\" Unlike Claimants, the enterprises that ultimately issued SZ\u00c9P Cards met the SZ\u00c9P Card criteria.

Rather, it shows that Respondent made efforts to propose criteria that were reasonable and not so restrictive that no one could qualify.617 The Erzs\u00e9bet program excludes all issuers because it is a social program and not a market.618 The taxation structure contains no elements that discriminate between non-Hungarian and Hungarian voucher issuers. Different tax rates applied to different vouchers related to specific government objectives to achieve certain social goals and to stimulate participation.619 Claimants' allegations of bad faith, including that the measures were taken to drive the French issuers out of the market, are without merit and without factual support.620\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 150; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 246, 248; Letter from Mr. Mih\u00e1ly Varga (Minister of the National Economy) to Mr. Jacques Landriot (CEO, Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner CCR, Legal representative of the President, CD Internationale) (26 July 2013) **[R-0025]**.\n\nTr.

While international law recognizes a State's duty to compensate for a lawful expropriation, it does not recognize a similar obligation to compensate for the effects of a valid exercise of regulatory powers.628 Dozens of cases, including *Burlington v. Ecuador*, confirm that adverse effect will not suffice to ground liability, where the measures are within the host State's police powers and the host State has not acted arbitrarily or discriminatorily.629\n\nR-II \u00a7 107.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 107, 115 - 116; Draft Convention on the protection of foreign property, Text with Notes and Comments, OECD (16 October 1967) **[CLA-0212]** ; *Burlington v.

Costa Rica*, which concerned only the amount of compensation due and not whether an expropriation had occurred. In suggesting that *Santa Elena* helps establish a rule that general measures will result in liability and an obligation to compensate, Claimants wrongly conflate a lawful expropriation taken for a public purpose and a legitimate exercise of sovereign regulatory power.630 Claimants' reliance on *Tecmed*, which involved the closure of a landfill in contravention to specific undertakings, similarly falls flat.631\n\nR-II \u00a7 112; C-II \u00a7 227; *LG&E v.

Int'l Econ. Law 224 (2012) **[RLA-0224]**.\n\n**(c) Tribunal Considerations and Conclusions**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the second paragraph of Art. 5(2) of the BIT provides expressly that *\"any dispossession measures taken shall give rise to the payment of prompt and adequate compensation* [\u2026] \" The last sentence of Art. 5(3) requires compensation even for dispossessions that result from a State of national emergency, which has not been claimed to exist by Respondent in the present case and indeed did not exist at the time of the 2011 Reform.\n\n411.\n\nIt is undisputed that no compensation was offered or paid by Respondent after the 2011 Reform. For that reason alone, it is clear that Respondent breached Art. 5(2) of the BIT.\n\n412.\n\nNevertheless, in view of the respective discussions of the Parties, the Tribunal will consider the other criteria that may be relevant for the lawfulness of the dispossessions.\n\n413.\n\nIt is recalled that Art. 5(2) expressly provides that a dispossession may be permitted \"*for reasons of public necessity* [\u2026]\" The Tribunal notes that this wording seems to provide a higher threshold than that found in similar BIT provisions requiring that the dispossessing measure must be for \"*public purpose*.\"\n\n414.\n\nIt is undisputed that the fringe benefit legislation in general was for the public purpose of ensuring a better nutrition and food supply for employees in Hungary. However, as already elaborated above, Respondent's purpose of the 2011 Reform was to exclude the Non-Hungarian issuers from the Hungarian voucher market. Respondent has admitted that the 2011 Reform was intended to keep the profit previously \"*realized by foreign-owned companies*\" within Hungary.632 The public policy goal of keeping profits within the country is not a legitimate public purpose under Art. 5(2) of the BIT.633\n\nC-II \u00a7 253; Respondent press release, \"The Government Launches Social Holidays Programme\" (12 January 2012) **[C-0083]** ; Dr. Bence R\u00e9tv\u00e1ri (State Secretary of the KIM), Speech at the Parliament No 152/90 (12 December 2011) **[C-0119]** ; Mr. Mikl\u00f3s Solt\u00e9sz (Ministry of Natural Resources), Speech at the Parliament No 152/161 (12 December 2011) **[C-0120]** ; Mr. Mikl\u00f3s Solt\u00e9sz (Ministry of Natural Resources), Speech at the Parliament No 152/165 (12 December 2011) **[C-0121]**.\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 292 - 294; *ADC v. Hungary*, \u00a7 423 **[CLA-0030]** / **[RLA-0004]**.\n\n415.\n\nRespondent has not shown that the measures in question were justified on the grounds that they were a \"*legitimate exercise of Hungary's general regulatory powers*.\" The Tribunal has found above that Respondent targeted Claimants' investment. Measures deliberately targeting an investor or three foreign investors cannot be a legitimate exercise of a state's police powers.634\n\nThis conclusion is in conformity with the respective reasoning in the *Edenred* Award, 94, as well as *Tecmed v. Mexico* **[CLA-0022]** / **[RLA-0068]** and *ADC v. Hungary* \u00a7\u00a7 429 *et seq*. **[CLA-0030]** / **[RLA-0004]**.\n\n416.\n\nTaxation measures can also be part of the regulatory powers of the State. However, the Tribunal does not have to decide whether in the present case the taxation measures, which were part of the 2011 Reform, were by themselves confiscatory. As elaborated above, their effect together with the other measures of the 2011 Reform as a package taken by Respondent dispossessed Claimants of the economic value of their investment.\n\n417.\n\nArticle 5(2) also expressly provides that the dispossession measures must not be \"*discriminatory*.\" While, in view of the lack of compensation in the present case, this criteria is not needed to establish Respondent's breach of Art. 5(2). The Tribunal notes that the above conclusion that the 2011 Reform was intended to and in fact did exclude CD Hungary and the two other foreign investors from the market, also renders the 2011 Reform discriminatory. This was also confirmed by the decision of the CJEU,635 though the criteria of European law are obviously different.636\n\n*EC v. Hungary*, CJEU Judgment, at 32 **[C-0153]**.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the same conclusion in the *Edenred* Award, \u00a7\u00a7 353 to 355, where more details are provided.\n\n418.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal had raised its Question (b)(a) *: The Relevance, if at all, of EU law to the Parties' respective positions on the application and interpretation of* [...] *Article 5 of the France-Hungary BIT.* It is noted that. the Parties agree that EU law has no relevance to the Parties' respective positions on the application and interpretation of Art. 5 of the BIT.637 The Tribunal agrees. Although Art. 9(3) of the BIT requires the Tribunal to rule in accordance with international law, only breaches of the BIT and not of EU law will give rise to liability in these proceedings. Article 5 of the BIT has no equivalent in the TEU or the TFEU or in secondary EU law such as EU directives or regulations.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 294; Tr. Day 4 at 86:9-11 (R. Closing).\n\n419.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent's dispossession of Claimants' investment was not lawful and that, therefore, Respondent breached Art. 5(2) of the BIT.\n\n**B. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT (ART. 3 OF THE BIT)**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nArticle 3 of the BIT provides that:\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall undertake to accord, in its territory and maritime zones, to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, just and equitable treatment, excluding any unjustified or discriminatory measure which might impede their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation.*638\n\nFrance-Hungary BIT, Art. 3 **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]**.\n\n**1. The Legal Standard**\n-------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimants' Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n421.\n\nArticle 3 of the BIT is independent of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. Had the parties wished to codify the minimum standard of treatment, they could have done so in explicit terms.639\n\nRfA \u00a7\u00a7 88 - 90; C-I 314 - 315; \u00a7 *Vivendi v.

At its most basic level, the FET standard allows tribunals to assess the substantive fairness of the state's treatment of the investor.641 Article 3 of the BIT prohibits any unreasonable or discriminatory measures which impede the investors' enjoyment of their investment.642\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 316 - 317; *CMS Gas v.

Even if they did exist, however, the measures used by Respondent were not appropriately tailored to the alleged public policy pursued, and were adopted without due regard for the investor.667 Second, even assuming that income was being diverted from the intended beneficiaries (which is denied), Respondent misrepresents how the voucher system works in order to reach that conclusion: (1) Claimants never received subsidies from Hungary; (2) commissions are not a diversion of income (as the employers benefitted from the exemption irrespective of the commissions); and (3) there was no correlation between the amount of the commissions and the extent of the 2011 Reform.668 Third, Respondent's alleged goal of \"*efficiency, security and accessibility*\" does not explain the strict criteria for the issuance of the SZ\u00c9P Card and the introduction of preferential tax treatment.669 Fourth, the alleged goals of health and nutrition promotion were already fulfilled by the meal voucher system prior to the 2011 Reform.670 Fifth, the alleged \"*welfare*\" purpose of the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher does not explain why it needed to be created as a monopoly, at the expense of Claimants.671\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 140 - 141; Proposal from the AETR concerning the universal regulation of the system for allocating benefits in kind (January 2010) **[C-0145]** ; *Ioan Micula v.

Claimants cannot satisfy this burden by looking to *ad hoc* arbitral awards, but rather must point to general and consistent practice of States that flow out of a sense of legal obligation.672 Claimants' sole support for the existence of the proportionality requirement is a passage from *EDF v. Romania*, which cites cases that refer to proportionality not as part of the FET standard but as part of the expropriation analysis.673\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 224 - 225; C-II \u00a7 276.\n\nR-II \u00a7 226; *James v.

This two-part definition requires that (1) \"*a rational policy is taken by a state following a logical (good sense) explanation with the aim of addressing a public interest matter*\", and (2) \"*an appropriate correlation between the state's public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it*.\"674 Respondent's policy objectives with respect to the 2011 Reform were to (1) achieve the social benefits for which the voucher system was intended and stimulate the economy, and (2) eliminate the problems and inefficiencies that had otherwise plagued the use of fringe benefits in the past.675 As the recent award in *Bilcon v. Canada* made clear, Respondent is not required to show that the measures were perfect in their design or implementation.676\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 215 - 216; R-II \u00a7 229; *AES v.

The voucher system was no longer serving the purpose for which it was created, it had no regulatory oversight, and it presented risks for consumers. The State was also forfeiting PIT revenues in the form of tax benefits that were being redirected away from intended recipients. Thus, the policy underlying the 2011 Reform was rational: Respondent sought to reform the voucher system (a system aiming to address public interest concerns including stimulating economic growth, consumer protection, public health, and public welfare, among others), such that it efficiently and effectively achieves the governmental objectives while eliminating the problems in the previous system.677\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 218 - 220; R-II \u00a7 229.\n\n437.\n\nThere is an appropriate correlation between the public policy objective and the measures adopted.678 Here, problems with the old system included (1) lack of voucher regulation, (2) the misuse of vouchers as a cash equivalent, (3) the emergence of a secondary market, and (4) voucher issuers' interest in unredeemed vouchers and high commission rates diverting the tax benefit away from the intended recipients. The new system has addressed each of these issues. SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers must satisfy particular criteria to become Card Issuers and are limited in the amount of commission that they can charge. Audits confirm that Issuers are complying with the requirements, meaning that the tax benefits are still being enjoyed by the intended beneficiaries. The shift to electronic vouchers also precludes their use as a cash-equivalent and their resale in a secondary market. The Erzs\u00e9bet voucher has also achieved its social objectives of improving access to affordable food for Hungarian workers, and hundreds of thousands of marginalized, impoverished, and otherwise disadvantaged people have benefitted from the revenue generated through this program.679\n\nR-I \u00a7 220.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 220 - 224.\n\n438.\n\nMeasures are discriminatory if similarly situated investments are subject to differential treatment without a reasonable basis. The 2011 Reform does not discriminate against Claimants in violation of Art. 3 of the BIT.680 There is no regulatory distinction between foreign and domestic voucher issuers. There are no nationality requirements for participating in the voucher system and there is nothing preventing a foreign company from being permitted to issue SZ\u00c9P Cards. The first three companies to issue SZ\u00c9P Cards were foreign-owned when they became Issuers.681 Regarding taxation, there is no discriminatory treatment between like entities and no discrimination based on nationality. Rather, taxation rates distinguished on the basis of the type of good or service for which the voucher was redeemable. The tax scheme, like all tax schemes, was designed to encourage certain spending and consumption habits in support of economic and social goals. All SZ\u00c9P Cards are taxed at the same rate of 35.7%. All other employer contributions that serve a social benefit (school assistance, health insurance, pension funds, local transit passes) are taxed at the same rate as SZ\u00c9P Cards and Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers. All other vouchers are taxed at 51.17%, which is preferential treatment as compared with the tax rates applied in the PIT. If Claimants had chosen to issue any voucher except the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher, they would have been taxed at the same rate as the other issuers.682\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 225 - 228; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 255, 256; C-I \u00a7\u00a7 157, 288; C-II \u00a7 290 - 291; *CMS Gas v.

The SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher offer advantages and serve different purposes than CD Hungary's meal vouchers. Claimants' claim of discrimination falters because discrimination requires differential treatment between things in like circumstances, and CD Hungary's product was not sufficiently similar to the SZ\u00c9P Card or the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher. The SZ\u00c9P Cards are more secure and more efficient, involve lower commissions and bear the cost of education of the Hungarian market regarding the products. CD Hungary has never issued either the SZ\u00c9P Card or the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher and, accordingly, was never \"*subject to the same laws and regulations*\" as either SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers or MNUA. Any differential treatment was objective, rational, and established pursuant to Hungary's general regulatory powers.684 These are products with an inherent public value that the Government wants to encourage and promote *via* its tax policy. The Government also rationally uses its tax policy to encourage people to use Erzs\u00e9bet vouchers, to generate more revenue for social programs.685 That CD Hungary's customers chose the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher over CD Hungary's products does not reflect pressure - it reflects that customers, logically and predictably, place value on a product that would be used for charitable purposes.686 The Erzs\u00e9bet voucher excludes all issuers, and the regime is no different from that prior to the 2011 Reform, where the Holiday voucher was issued exclusively by MNUA.687\n\nR-II \u00a7 244; *Cargill v.

While Respondent acknowledges that CD Hungary does not meet the criteria to be a SZ\u00c9P Card Issuer, it is preposterous to deduce that the standards were designed with this outcome in mind. The 28 March 2011 proposal for the SZ\u00c9P Card explains the rationale behind the standards. All aspects of the criteria are objectively defendable as improving the functioning of the voucher system and this is confirmed by the contemporaneous internal governmental documentation - far more so than Claimants' reliance on a handful of public statements by politicians.688 The Erzs\u00e9bet voucher did not create a monopoly over cold meal vouchers, which CD Hungary was able to continue to issue.689 There was no aim to exclude CD Hungary from the market.690 Respondent's refusal to adopt Claimants' proposal when it was weighing conflicting interests and priorities in developing the 2011 Reform, does not mean that Respondent \"*chose to ignore*\" alternatives or chose to exclude Claimants.691 The market involved a variety of taxpayers and participants, including the employers and employees who were the target of the legislation as both the main end-users and the tax payers. The Government worked with all stakeholders, including Ms. Nagy, to make the system more efficient and effective in serving its goals.692\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 230 - 232; R-II \u00a7 253; SZ\u00c9P Card Proposal **[R-0008]** ; Szatm\u00e1ry Statement, \u00a7\u00a7 29 - 43 **[RWS-2]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 254.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 234, 240; C-II \u00a7 232.\n\nR-II \u00a7 233; C-II \u00a7 282.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 11 - 16.\n\n441.\n\nContemporaneous evidence demonstrates the baselessness of the claim that the 2011 Reform was designed to exclude CD Hungary.

The 28 February 2011 letter from Mr. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balogh focused on helping more entities to become SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers and proposed relaxing the requirements. The SZ\u00c9P Card Proposal noted that the Government was attuned and sought to avoid requirements that were not properly justified, and this undermines Claimants' argument that the Government disregarded the consequences of their policies.694 The October 2011 proposal merely acknowledges that \"*as of 1 October 2012, ready-to-eat meal vouchers would be issued by the issuer appointed by the governmental decree provided under the authorization of the [PIT]*.\"695\n\nR-II \u00a7 235; Letter from Mr. Endre Horv\u00e1th (Deputy Minister of State, responsible for economic development) to Mr. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balogh (Vice-President, the PSZAF) (15 February 2011) **[C-0148]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 236 - 238; C-II \u00a7 282; Letter from Mr. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balogh (Vice-President, the PSZAF) to Mr. Endre Horv\u00e1th (Deputy Minister of State, responsible for economic development) (28 February 2011) **[C-0149]** ; SZ\u00c9P Card Proposal, 11 **[R-0008]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 239; National Ministry of Economics, Proposal for the Government in Connection with the Amendment of Certain Tax Acts and Other Related Acts (11 October 2011) **[R-0016]**.\n\n442.\n\nMany of Claimants' arguments repeat those made in reference to their expropriation claim. Claimants' claims, however, do not show that there was anything \"*unreasonable*\" about requiring that the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher only be issued by a state entity, nor do they challenge the \"*unreasonableness*\" of the SZ\u00c9P Card Issuer criteria. That the 2011 Reform was unique within the EU is of no significance and the comparison between Belgium and France (which have meal voucher rates of 25% and 10.5%, respectively) and Hungary (meal voucher rate of 80%) is inapt.

Czech Republic*), host States have an obligation not to purposefully inflict damage upon an investment.701 This is different from a \"*do no harm*\" standard, which Claimants do not advocate.702 The present case is an example of an expulsion of an investment based on local favoritism.

The tribunal in *Vivendi* was referring to the government's obligation not to disparage and undercut a concession and there was no indication that this reasoning should be adopted in situations where there is no contractual relationship between the host state and the investor.

The *Parkerings* tribunal observed that, although an expectation that the legislative framework will never change will only be legitimate in the face of a stabilization clause, investors have a right to \"*a certain stability and predictability*\", which encompasses the expectation that the host state will conduct itself in a lawful manner.720 Under *Feldman*, the absence of \"*definitive, unambiguous and repeated*\" assurances does not preclude a finding of unfair and inequitable treatment. The present dispute is different from *GAMI*, as \"*the Claimants' legitimate expectations were founded (in large part) upon express and unequivocal undertakings by the Respondent*.\"721\n\nC-I \u00a7 343; *Saluka v.

Both the BIT and the Europe Agreement were critical to Claimants' decision to invest, and obliged Respondent to refrain from adopting disproportionate and discriminatory measures, such as the 2011 Reform.

By creating the voucher market and welcoming foreign investors, Respondent accepted certain basic obligations toward those investors - and the investors had the right to expect stability. Respondent could not adopt changes beyond certain acceptable margins. Claimants did not accept the risk of being treated arbitrarily or discriminatorily, and they did not accept the risk of being deliberately targeted by the Hungarian legislature.733 The 2011 Reform arbitrarily, discriminatorily, and confiscatorily altered the legal framework in which CD Hungary operated, rendering a once profitable enterprise inoperable.734\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 348 - 349, 351; Respondent press release, \"Common Communication Campaign for the Success of the Sz\u00e9p Card\" (16 December 2011) **[C-0079]** ; Patrik And\u00f3, \"Hundreds of Millions for Promotion Purposes\", Vil\u00e1ggazsdas\u00e1g (12 March 2012) **[C-0091]** ; *El Paso v.

Absent an express commitment or a stabilization clause, the doctrine of legitimate expectations cannot be invoked to protect the investor from all legislative or regulatory changes, especially those that are foreseeable. Changes in law are to be expected and all that an investor may expect is that the law be applied.737\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 74 - 75; *MTD v. Chile*, \u00a7 50 **[CLA-0050]** ; *Total v.

This argument must be rejected because it is based on a misunderstanding of arbitral jurisprudence. The tribunal in *Parkerings* did not endorse a broad or universal expectation of stability. In ultimately rejecting the claim in *Parkerings*, that tribunal found that the doctrine of legitimate expectations, without more, cannot protect the investor from legislative or regulatory changes.738 Many scholars and other authorities require that legitimate expectations are founded in specific State conduct.739 Interpreting the FET clause as broadly as proposed by Claimants would run afoul two principles of international investment law: (1) it would unduly restrict the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders, and (2) it would grant the investor insurance against any change in regulation, irrespective of whether they had negotiated for that right or protection.740\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 264 - 266; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 308, 314; *Parkerings v.

At best, the only expectation that Claimants held would be that the State would implement a draft law which would then be put into effect after a vote in Parliament and put into force according to law.

With respect to Art. 3 of the BIT, tribunals have held that the FET standard as articulated in international investment law has no parallel in EU law.760\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 27 - 28; Tr.

Slovakia* Award on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 250 **[RLA-0250]**.\n\n466.\n\nWhile the TFEU and the FET standard contain a prohibition of discrimination on the basis of nationality, there are substantial and significant differences in the application of the nondiscrimination standard in investment law and EU law. First, the two legal regimes tend to apply different comparator clauses to ascertain if two situations or objects are alike for the purpose of comparison. Respondent states that \"*EU law has recently moved from the application of formal criteria - that refused to consider the competitive relationship between products - to endorsing economic considerations and even subjective elements in determining whether products or situations are similar. Investment law, [however], typically considers the competitive relationship between products to ascertain if products are alike.*\"761 Second, EU law limits the specific public policy grounds that may be invoked and requires that the disadvantage caused by the measure be \"*necessary*\" and \"*proportionate*\" to obtaining the public policy objective pursued.762 In investment law, however, the treatment of investors must merely bear a \"*reasonable*\" relationship to the rational policies determined within the state's wide discretion.763 Thus, while a particular measure may contravene both EU law and the BIT, a violation of EU law alone will not trigger a violation of the BIT, as Claimants agree.764\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 31; Nicolas F.

Rather, the CJEU determined that the 2011 Reforms violated the freedom of establishment and the freedom of movement of services.765 That cause of action finds no parallel in the BIT or investment law generally, which provides protection for existing investments and compensates investors for damage that actually occurred.766 Further, the factual findings have no relevance to the claims here. While the CJEU found that certain aspects of the SZ\u00c9P Card framework violated the EU law principle of freedom of establishment, that freedom only protects the right of a company to choose the location of its incorporation within the EU without being subjected to differential treatment on that basis.767 The SZ\u00c9P Card Decree contains an implicit requirement that, in order to qualify as an Issuer, a company must incorporate in Hungary and it stipulates the form of incorporation. These requirements were found by the CJEU to violate four separate provisions of Directive 123/2006/EC of the EU (\"*Services Directive*\").768 Unlike the BIT, EU law requires that the State recognize incorporation in Hungary as equivalent to incorporation elsewhere in the EU.769 While this criterion ran afoul of EU law, it is not the criterion that Claimants complain of because, factually, CD Hungary was incorporated in Hungary and, thus, this criterion could not have been the cause of Claimants' damage.770\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 33; *EC v.

The requirement to submit to the jurisdiction makes sense for a business such as this one where issuers sell products that serve as a cash substitute and where employers and affiliates need confidence that an issuer would be able to satisfy ongoing obligations and that there would be redress before Hungarian courts. In this regard, Hungary is no different from most of the jurisdictions where Claimants operate in that local incorporation is a requirement of doing business.772\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 36.\n\n469.\n\nThe CJEU Decision does not conclude that the SZ\u00c9P Card discriminates based on nationality.773 All companies - whether foreign or domestic-owned - were required to satisfy the same criteria to become SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers. There is no prohibition on foreign ownership and all of the current Issuers are foreign-owned Hungarian subsidiaries (as were those that were considered while the issuer criteria were being developed). There is no privilege whatsoever - the issue that the CJEU decided was a question of access to the market, not on whether the tax rates benefitted some over others (even assuming that the tax rates applied to issuers as opposed to fringe benefits, which they do not).774 Finally, all private companies, whether foreign or domestic, where precluded from issuing the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher because issuance was limited to the exclusive authority of the State, like analogous services such as health care, food stamps, etc. All such private companies were permitted to continue to issue other fringe benefits, including traditional paper vouchers for hot meals.775\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 37.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 37 - 38.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 39.\n\n**6.

Here, the Tribunal summarizes these arguments.\n\n**(a) Claimants' Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n472.\n\nThe contemporaneous documents confirm that the 2011 Reform was intended to exclude CD Hungary and the other French Issuers - which together accounted for 86% of the Hungarian meal voucher market - and to replace them, such that their profits would not be earned by foreign companies and would instead remain in Hungary.776\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 34; First FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 3.17, 3.19, 3.20 **[CEX-1]**.\n\n473.\n\nExhibits R-0010, R-0013, R-0015, and R-0016 demonstrate Respondent's intention that the SZ\u00c9P Card would replace hot meal vouchers issued by CD Hungary and other French issuers.777 Through the SZ\u00c9P Card Decree778 and changes to the PIT Law, Claimants' hot meal vouchers were moved from the \"*non-wage benefits*\" category in Section 71 of the PIT779 to Section 70's category of \"*specifically defined benefits*.\"780 The resulting tax differential made it impossible for CD Hungary to continue selling its vouchers, which offered the same service as the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher, but at a cost significantly higher to the clients.781 The hot meal vouchers issued by CD Hungary and other French issuers were thus effectively replaced on the market by the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher.782\n\nMemorandum for the Minister from Mr. Krist\u00f3f Szatm\u00e1ry and Dr. \u00c1d\u00e1m Balog, Subject: The future of fringe benefits (31 May 2011) **[R-0010]** ; Sz\u00e9chenyi Recreational Card - Project Status (9 September 2011) **[R-0013]** ; Proposal for the Government on the reform of the system of fringe benefits (September 2011) **[R-0015]** ; National Ministry of Economics, Proposal for the Government in Connection with the Amendment of Certain Tax Acts and Other Related Acts (11 October 2011) 9 **[R-0016]**.\n\nDecree No. 55/2011 **[C-0073]**.\n\nPIT Law as amended in 2010, effective 1 January 2011 6 **[C-0068]**.\n\n2011 PIT Law at 5 **[RLA-0088] / [C-0074]**.\n\nCPHB-I Annex No. 6, first Table.\n\nCPHB-I Annex No. 6.\n\n474.\n\nClaimants further state that Exhibits R-0010, R-0016, and Dr. Guller's First Witness Statement783 show that Respondent intended that the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher would replace the cold meal vouchers issued by CD Hungary and other existing issuers.784 This change was implemented through changes to the PIT Law creating the Ersz\u00e9bet cold meal voucher785 and the Decree on the Issuance of the Erzs\u00e9bet Voucher, which gave the MNUA a monopoly over the issuance over the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher.786 The Erzs\u00e9bet voucher's scope was also extended to cover hot meals, and this extension was made permanent in 2013.787\n\nFirst Guller Statement, \u00a7 31 **[RWS-1]**.

First, CD Hungary and the other foreign-owned issuers could not make a profit because they were no longer competitive. Second, as for SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers, they are loss-making and, thus, have been unable to repatriate any profits. Finally, the profits generated by MNUA on the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher remain in Hungary, as MNUA is a state-owned entity.789\n\nDr. Bence R\u00e9tv\u00e1ri (State Secretary of the KIM), Speech at the Parliament No. 152/90 (12 December 2011) **[C0119]** ; Mr. Mikl\u00f3s Solt\u00e9sz (Ministry of Natural Resources), Speech at the Parliament No. 152/161 (12 December 2011) **[C-0120]** ; Mr. Mikl\u00f3s Solt\u00e9sz (Ministry of Natural Resources), Speech at the Parliament No. 152/165 (12 December 2011) **[C-0121]**.\n\nCPHB-I Annex No. 6.\n\n476.\n\nClaimants agree that Exhibit R-0005, which Claimants state envisioned the creation of a card system by a 100% State-owned financial enterprise, did not become law.790\n\nCPHB-I Annex No. 6, n.5.\n\n**(b) Respondent's Arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n477.\n\nClaimants' claim that they were deliberately targeted by reforms and that their removal from the market was the Government's motivation is inconsistent with the evidence.791 Claimants are mistaken when they state that the proposed reforms discussed in Exhibits R-0005, R0010, R0015, and R-0016 were \"*reflected entirely in the law which came into force on 1 January 2012*\", as those are preparatory documents where the Government or other related individuals considered possible options for reform. Some of the options contained therein, including the complete elimination of the voucher system, were not implemented into law as part of the 2011 Reform or ever found their way into any legislation or act of the Hungarian Parliament.792\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 16.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 96.\n\n478.\n\nSecond, Claimants have conflated products (fringe benefits) and the entities that facilitated the provision of those products to end-users (issuers, like CD Hungary), in an effort to manufacture ill-intent. Claimants are wrong to suggest that the Government's consideration of whether to eliminate a particular fringe benefit - the cold meal voucher - offers evidence of an intent to eliminate an issuer or set of issuers from the market. The Government elects to grant a tax benefit for a number of reasons that are particular to the fringe benefit in question. When priorities or budgets change, the Government might eliminate or add new fringe benefits because they were focused on the provision of services and/or goods, the end-users, and/or the impact on the economy. The Government was not focused on the potential market participants who might facilitate the use of the vouchers, which is at best a derivative business and not the focus of the system.793\n\n*Id*.\n\n479.\n\nExhibit R-0005 is only a partial translation of a document that highlights the main elements of the proposed SZ\u00c9P Card. While the Government considered limiting the issuance of the SZ\u00c9P Card to a State-owned enterprise, the Government also considered that the SZ\u00c9P Card might be issued/operated by tender-winning private entities, including CD Hungary.794 Had the proposal been adopted, Claimants would have been prohibited from issuing the SZ\u00c9P Card, but not other fringe benefits. The proposal did not address the issuer criteria or suggest any intent to create overly restrictive criteria. The SZ\u00c9P Card Issuer criteria were designed to identify qualified issuers having a particular skillset that the Government viewed as relevant to the intended purpose, and these criteria applied equally to any party wishing to issue the SZ\u00c9P Card.795 In developing the SZ\u00c9P Card criteria, the Government identified entities that were most likely to have the necessary infrastructure and would most likely be able and willing to agree to restricted commissions.796 Claimants could have satisfied the issuer criteria and become a SZ\u00c9P Card Issuer by partnering with a bank, but chose not to.797\n\nRPHB-I Table 7, n.180; The main elements of the introduction of Sz\u00e9chenyi Recreational Card, prepared by: Rudolf Petendi, head counselor (24 September 2010) **[R-0005]**.\n\nRPHB-I Table 7; Tr.

Day 2 at 79:7 - 10 (Gans and Nagy).\n\n480.\n\nExhibit R-0010 makes it clear that the Government was not focused on Claimants or even the so-called hot meal benefit, but rather on ensuring the efficient and effective delivery of fringe benefits to the Hungarian population. Under the 2011 PIT Law,798 employers and employees could obtain the benefit of the hot meal either through a paper voucher and/or through the SZ\u00c9P Card. Under section 70(1)(a) of the 2011 PIT Law, hot and cold meal fringe benefits continued to receive a tax advantage and were neither eliminated by the reforms nor replaced by the SZ\u00c9P Card or the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher. Due to the language of Exhibit R-0010, the SZ\u00c9P Cards would render the retention of the vacation voucher futile. At the time, that voucher was issued exclusively by the State. If the Government had intended to abolish the hot meal voucher and replace it with the SZ\u00c9P Card (a product), that does not mean that the Government intended to replace or exclude a particular issuer. The Government did not intend to exclude anyone or force anyone out.799 The Government intended and assumed that issuers that were unable to qualify alone would partner with banks and issue the SZ\u00c9P Card and/or would continue to sell other products.800 There were sound reasons to expand the SZ\u00c9P Card to include catering and restaurant services, including to mitigate against initial distrust and, thus, to facilitate comfort with and adoption of the new benefit.801 Finally, the State focused on all aspects of the Fringe Benefit System, and this supports the conclusion that the State was engaged in *bona fide* regulation and not in the improper targeting of Claimants or foreign nationals.802\n\n2011 PIT Law **[C-0074]** / **[RLA-0088]**.\n\nRPHB-I Table 7; Tr.

Day 2 at 47:23 - 48:24 (Nagy).\n\nRPHB-I Table 7.\n\n481.\n\nSome of Claimants' allegations were based on a translation error of page 2 of Exhibit R-0015, which Respondent provided, and which should read \"*this fringe benefit is the electronic cardbased version of the previous hot meal voucher*.\"803 Exhibit R-0015 shows that the Government considered a number of options for reform of the Fringe Benefit System, including abolishing paper-based hot meal vouchers. There was nothing, however, about being a \"*current issuer*\" that precluded an entity from also becoming a SZ\u00c9P Card Issuer. Exhibit R-0015 affirms the *bona fides* of the 2011 Reforms.\n\n*Id*.; Tr. Day 2 at 143:19-25 - 144:6-22 (Szatm\u00e1ry) (*explaining* that there was no replacement of issuers).\n\n482.\n\nRegarding Exhibit R-0016, this proposal was ultimately not adopted as part of the 2011 Reforms. Neither the 2011 PIT Law nor any other law contains any limitation as to who can issue hot meal vouchers.804 Moreover, that the Government considered abolishing hot meal vouchers does not mean that the Government intended to exclude or target any issuers. There is no basis for Claimants' interpretation that issuers were targeted. Exhibit R-0016 reaffirms the *bona fides* of the reform and the legitimate intentions of the Government.805\n\nRPHB-I Table 7.\n\n*See e.g*., National Ministry of Economics, Proposal for the Government in Connection with the Amendment of Certain Tax Acts and Other Related Acts (11 October 2011) 4, 5 **[R-0016]**.\n\n483.\n\nRegarding Exhibit C-0119, there is no possible argument that the State or any state sanctioned entity or even the SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers appropriated any profits from Claimants. Claimants had no right to future profits. Both MNUA and SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers had to generate their own customer bases and revenues. Due to the limits on commissions and the high infrastructure costs, the SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers are not making a profit but, rather, are losing money.806\n\nRPHB-I Table 7, Tr. Day 3 at 80:8-12 (Nicholson).\n\n484.\n\nRespondents also stated that, while the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher can be used to purchase the same end product, they offer more in terms of benefits to the population (like a less expensive product, due to restricted commissions). These products did not fully replace the hot meal and cold meal vouchers because those have been retained in the system.807\n\nTr. Day 4 at 58:2-10 (R. Closing).\n\n**7. The Parties' Arguments in Response to the Tribunal's Question (d)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n485.\n\nThe Tribunal's question (d) was as follows:\n\n*d) Having regard to Hungary's membership of the European Union from 2004, whether, absent a sustained claim under Article 5 of the France-Hungary BIT, treatment consistent with Article 4 of the BIT is relevant to an evaluation of the just and equitable treatment claim under Article 3 of the BIT, save for any claim arising out of an alleged breach of EU law going to just and equitable treatment.*\n\n**(a) Claimants' Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n486.\n\nArticle 3 of the BIT contains a specific prohibition of discrimination or unreasonable measures and a wider obligation to treat the investor's investment fairly and equitably.808 Article 3 goes beyond national treatment and prohibits every type of discrimination with respect to the treatment of foreign investors.809\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 117 - 122, 300 - 301; Tr. Day 4 at 97:21-25, 98:1-2 (R. Closing).\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 125, 302 - 304; Andrew Newcombe and Lluis Paradell, Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Treatment, 1st Edition, Kluwer Law International, 2009 \u00a7\u00a7 6.27, 6.28 **[CLA-0055]** ; Rudolf Dolzer, \"Fair and Equitable Treatment: Today's Contour\", 12 Santa Clara J.

Ukraine*, PCA UNCITRAL, Award (29 July 2014) \u00a7 394 **[CLA-0250]**.\n\n487.\n\nArticle 3, however, does not include discrimination based on EU law, which - as was illustrated in the CJEU's judgment of 23 February 2016 - is subject to different criteria. Claimants have never advanced any allegation based on discrimination under EU law to prove their claim under Art. 3 of the BIT. Neither Art. 4 of the BIT nor EU law is relevant to the evaluation of the just and equitable treatment claim under Art. 3 of the BIT.810\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 305 - 307; *EC v. Hungary*, CJEU Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 66 - 68, 85 - 92 **[C-0153]**.\n\n**(b) Respondent's Arguments**\n------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nThe fact that Hungary has been a Member State of the EU since 2004 should have no relevance for establishing any violation of any BIT provision. While circumstances that lead to a breach of EU law might result in a breach of the BIT, that would depend on the particular facts. The facts that led the CJEU to reach its conclusions in the CJEU Decision would not support a claim under Art. 3.811\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 43.\n\n489.\n\nArticles 4 and 3 of the BIT afford different protections and/or create different obligations for the host State. While Art. 4 requires the State to treat investors of other nations equal to domestic investors, Art. 3 requires that the State act fairly to investors.812 The fact that the State treated similarly situated investors the same could be relevant to determining that there was no liability under Art. 3, as it could demonstrate that the State acted justly and fairly and undertook a general regulation that did not target a particular investor or group of investors.813\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 44; *Flemingo DutyFree Shop Private Limited v. Republic of Poland,* UNCITRAL, Award (12 August 2016) \u00a7 531 **[RLA-0261]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 44.\n\n490.\n\nA showing that a party had not acted in accordance with Art. 4 would not necessarily suffice to establish a claim under Art. 3.814 As various authorities have recognized, particularly in the area of fiscal policy, there may be sound reasons to differentiate between domestic and foreign taxpayers.815 Accordingly, the fact that a challenged measure had the effect of distinguishing between local and foreign investors would violate the national treatment clause, but would not result in liability under Art. 3 of the BIT if that effect was incidental to a valid purpose and/or if that differentiation was supported by sound and justifiable policy reasons.816 The underlying facts or conduct could result in liability under each of EU law, Art. 3, and/or Art. 4, but the assessment of whether facts give rise to a cause of action is unique to each cause of action and the particularities thereof.817\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 45; *see, e.g*., Tr.

Tribunal Considerations and Conclusions Regarding FET**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nClaimants' requests in this arbitration as quoted above are:\n\n*- Find that Hungary expropriated UP and C.D Holding Internationale of their investment in Hungary, in breach of Art. 5(2) of the BIT;*\n\n*- Find that Hungary (i) failed to accord UP and C.D Holding Internationale's investment in Hungary fair and equitable treatment and (ii) adopted unjustified and discriminatory measures that impeded the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation of that investment, in breach of Art. 3 of the BIT;*\n\n*and consequently*\n\n*- Award compensation to UP and C.D Holding Internationale for their entire loss in the amount of \u20ac39,465,434 plus compound interest and net of any taxes, subject to adjustment until the date of payment;*\n\n*- Order Hungary to pay all costs, expenditures and fees in respect of the arbitration proceedings including legal fees incurred by UP and C.D Holding Internationale.*\n\n492.\n\nRespondent's Request on the Merits is that the Tribunal dismiss all claims raised by Claimants.\n\n493.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties do not submit different requests as resulting from a possible breach of Art. 5(2) and of Art. 3 of the BIT. Above, the Tribunal has concluded that Respondent has breached Art. 5(2) and is, thus, liable. Therefore, if the Tribunal were to find that Respondent also breached Art. 3 of the BIT, it would not lead to any damages in excess of those which result from the breach of Art. 5(2). In the interest of procedural efficiency, therefore, the Tribunal considers that it need not examine whether Respondent also would be liable for a breach of Art. 3.\n\n**IX. NO FURTHER CLAIMS RAISED BY CLAIMANTS**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n494.\n\nAs a precaution, the Tribunal asked the Parties to address the following issue:\n\n*c) The Relevance, if at all, of Article 4 of the France-Hungary BIT, and in particular its national treatment aspect, noting that the Claimants have not advanced an allegation of breach of Article 4*.\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS' ARGUMENTS**\n---------------------------\n\n495.\n\nClaimants have not made a claim for breach of Art. 4 of the BIT, which obliges the host State to accord foreign investors \"*the same treatment accorded to its own investors*.\"818 To prove a breach of Art. 4, it would be necessary to prove that the 2011 Reform was discriminatory based on nationality. This contrasts with Art. 3 (FET).819 Here, Claimants have proved that the 2011 Reform was discriminatory based on the differential treatment that Respondent imposed on them in comparable circumstances, without justification.820\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 298 - 299; France-Hungary BIT, Art. 4 **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 299; Agreement between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Hungary for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, signed 15 May 1996, in force as of 1 March 2002 **[CLA-0005]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 299.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n496.\n\nArticle 4 of the BIT has no relevance because Claimants have not alleged a breach of Art. 4, nor could they in light of the Signatories' limited consent to arbitration. Claimants' choice not to allege a violation of Art. 4, however, may have some relevance to the Tribunal's understanding of Claimants' claim and the defects thereof.821 Article 4 requires that foreign investors be treated equally to domestic investors, while Art. 3 requires that they be treated fairly. In theory, there could be measures that apply equally to domestic and foreign nationals, but nonetheless violate Art. 3. Likewise, measures could comply with Art. 3, but run afoul Art. 4.822 Here, the measures do not discriminate on the basis of nationality. Rather, any party that met the qualifications to become a SZ\u00c9P Card Issuer and agreed to the limitations thereon was entitled to issue the SZ\u00c9P Card, regardless of the nationality of the owners of the issuing company.823 Even if Claimants were able to substantiate a claim of disparate treatment, this alone would not go far enough to substantiate a claim under the provision they have actually invoked - Art. 3.824\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 40; France-Hungary BIT, Art. 9(2) **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 41; Ulf Linderfalk, On the Interpretation of Treaties (Springer 2007) **[RLA-0275]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 42.\n\n*Id*.\n\n**C. TRIBUNAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nFrom the replies it is clear that Claimants have not submitted a claim regarding a breach of Art. 4.\n\n498.\n\nThus, this Award only has to decide on the claims actually raised, *i.e.* whether there were breaches of Arts. 5(2) and 3.\n\n**X. DAMAGES**\n--------------\n\n**A. THE STANDARD OF COMPENSATION UNDER ART. 5(2) OF THE BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n499.\n\nRegarding the standard of compensation, Art. 5(2) of the BIT states as follows:\n\n*[...]*\n\n*Any dispossession measures taken shall give rise to the payment of prompt and adequate compensation, the amount of which must equal the real value of the investments concerned on the day prior to the date on which the measures are taken or made public.*\n\n*Such compensation shall be payable to investors in convertible funds, and shall be freely transferrable. It shall be paid promptly starting from the date of the dispossession, failing which, interest calculated at the applicable market rate shall be charged up to the date of payment825*\n\nFrance-Hungary BIT, Art. 5(2) **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]**.\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n500.\n\nCompensation for the unlawful expropriation of CD Hungary is governed by customary international law, rather than Art. 5(2) of the BIT.826 To compensate Claimants for losses resulting from Respondent's violations of the BIT, damages must be calculated in accordance with the principle of full reparation, which aims to put Claimants in the position they would have been in, had Respondent not breached its obligations under the BIT.827 Unlike the standard of compensation set forth in Art. 5(2), the customary international law standard allows the Tribunal to (1) consider events after the Valuation Date when quantifying Claimants' loss, and (2) assess both the value of the enterprise and the consequential damages flowing from Respondent's breaches.828 In its post-hearing submission, Claimants highlighted that the consequential damages claimed by Claimants are the losses associated with Vyroba, Claimants' subsidiary.829\n\nC-II \u00a7 346.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 34; C-I \u00a7 353; *Chorz\u00f3w Factory (Claim for Indemnity) (Merits), Germany v.

Article 5(2), however, contains an express carve-out and is therefore only *lex specialis* for lawful expropriation. Further, as confirmed in investment jurisprudence, including *ADC v. Hungary*, unless a treaty contains a clear reference to damages due for unlawful expropriation, the compensation rule referred to in the BIT will only apply to lawful expropriation, with damages for unlawful expropriation being governed by customary international law. The compensation rule prescribed in Art. 5(2) of the BIT, therefore, does not apply to unlawful expropriation.831\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 361 - 363; C-II \u00a7 348; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 253 - 256.\n\nC-I \u00a7 356; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 347 - 356; CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 168 - 172; France-Hungary BIT, Art. 5(2) **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]** ; *ADC v.

While restitution in kind would most closely conform to the principle of full reparation, such is frequently neither possible nor practical. Here, it would be impossible to restore the *status quo ante* and any attempt to do so would require significant interference with Respondent's sovereignty. The appropriate remedy should therefore be the payment of a sum corresponding to the value that restitution in kind would bear, as defined by Art. 36 of the ILC Articles.832\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 365 - 367; *Yukos v.

First, it fails to interpret Art. 5(2) in its context and in light of the BIT's object and purpose, as required by the VCLT.834 Second, it relies on a mistaken distinction between the present case and *Vivendi*. Contrary to Respondent's assertion, that tribunal found that the France-Argentina BIT did not purport to establish *lex specialis* governing the standards of compensation for wrongful expropriations.835 Third, the submission is founded upon an erroneous translation of the text *\"measures de dispossession qui pourraient etre prises\",* which in the authoritative French and Hungarian does not allow for \"*any*\" measure (as argued by Respondent, based on the non-authoritative English translation), but rather restricts the compensation calculation method in Art. 5(2) to permissible or lawful expropriation. Thus, the interpretation of the relevant wording in other French BITs supports Claimants' position that it only applies to lawful expropriation measures.836\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 357 - 361; *ADC v.

Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n505.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the BIT specifies that Claimants can only be entitled to the actual value of their investment as damages - nothing more. Although international law recognizes a right to \"*full reparation*\" for an international wrong, Claimants must prove the existence of damage as well as a causal link between the breaches of the BIT and the damage alleged. Full reparation does not permit the recovery of damages that have not been suffered or that are too remote. Rather, reparation should put the claimant in the same - but no better - position that it would have occupied in absent the breach.838 Exemplary or punitive damages that are too attenuated from the breach or which could have been mitigated should be excluded from the obligation to make full reparation.839\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 287 - 291.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 292.\n\n506.\n\nThe French and Hungarian language versions of Art. 5(2) do not use the term \"*any*\", but nonetheless employ generic pronouns, indicating that the term \"*dispossession measures*\" refers to any of a large number, class, or category of dispossession measures. The first paragraph of Art. 5(2) sets the compensation standard that \"*shall*\" apply to all types of measures contemplated therein and it stands to reason that that remains unchanged in the second paragraph. The entirety of Art. 5(2) sets forth the conditions for lawful and unlawful dispossessions. Logically, it does not permit an additional standard of compensation. It, therefore, constitutes *lex specialis* that governs any compensation that may be awarded to Claimants and limits the quantum of any award to the real value of the investment in Hungary.840\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 253 - 255; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 275 - 277; *Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater Caribe, C.A., v.

They reach this conclusion by an impermissible reading of Art. 5(2) that interprets the phrase \"*could be taken*\" or \"*might be taken*\" as referring only to lawful takings under the BIT. The phrase, however, makes no such distinction. It refers to measures that factually have the capacity of being adopted. Claimants' interpretation is contrary to the plain and ordinary meaning of the word \"*could*\" and leads to a misinterpretation of the BIT.841\n\nR-I \u00a7 256; R-II \u00a7 278; C-I \u00a7 359; C-II \u00a7 362.\n\n508.\n\nThe claim that paragraph two specifies a condition for lawful expropriation does not follow from the text.842 Claimants' argument also fails to acknowledge the third paragraph of Art. 5(2), which details the compensation contemplated in the second paragraph and is critical to understanding the object and purpose of the article. The third paragraph details the compensation in the second paragraph, including that \"*it shall be paid promptly from the date of dispossession, failing which, interest calculated at the applicable market rate shall be charged up to the date of payment.*\" Thus, on Claimants' reading of Art. 5(2) (that a failure to provide prompt payment converts a lawful expropriation into an unlawful one), Respondent explains that \"*Art. 5(2) must set the calculation method for compensation for both lawful and unlawful compensation, including providing that where an expropriation is unlawful due to a failure to provide prompt compensation, interest must be paid.*\"843\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 278 - 280; C-II \u00a7 359, 362, 368; France-Hungary BIT, Art. 5(2) **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 281 (emphasis in original); C-II \u00a7\u00a7 173, 354; France-Hungary BIT, Art. 5(2) **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]**.\n\n509.\n\nFurther, the same word must be given the same meaning in the same document. The term \"*dispossession measures*\" as found in Art. 9(2) and Art. 5(2) gives the Tribunal jurisdiction over all disputes concerning lawful and unlawful dispossessions, as well as the compensation that would flow from such disputes. In respect of compensation, therefore, the term should be interpreted as concerning lawful and unlawful dispossessions.844\n\nR-II \u00a7 282; C-II \u00a7 173; France-Hungary BIT, Art. 9(2) **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]**.\n\n510.\n\nEach treaty must be interpreted and applied as written, and *ADC v. Hungary* does not stand for the proposition that there is a general rule of construction that would presume that the compensation rule referred to in all BITs will apply only to lawful expropriations unless they explicitly state that they also apply to unlawful expropriations.845 In *British Caribbean Bank Ltd. v. Belize*, the tribunal rejected the approach that Claimants advocate here and instead found that the standard of compensation set forth in the BIT provided the standard for breach thereof.846 Likewise, Claimants' argument based on *Vivendi* is flawed, as the underlying treaty in that case delineated the standard only for lawful compensation.847 It is, therefore, inapplicable here.\n\nR-II \u00a7 283; C-II \u00a7 356; *ADC v.

Tribunal Considerations and Conclusions**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with Respondent's view that, while accepting a distinction between lawful and unlawful expropriation, it is \"*both necessary and logical*\"848 that the compensation rules of Art. 5(2) should apply to both lawful and unlawful expropriation. It is by no means \"*logical*\" that a breach of Art. 5(2) by an unlawful dispossession should not result in any wider liability than a lawful dispossession. Most legal systems, though by different terminology and criteria, distinguish between a \"*compensation*\" for lawful measures and a liability for \"*damages*\" as a result for unlawful measures. As Claimants correctly argue, Art. 5(2) contains an express *lex specialis* for lawful expropriation. Indeed, as confirmed in investment jurisprudence, including *ADC v. Hungary*, unless a treaty contains a clear reference to damages due for unlawful expropriation, the compensation rule referred to in the BIT will only apply to lawful expropriation, with damages for unlawful expropriation being governed by customary international law. The compensation rule prescribed in Art. 5(2) of the BIT, therefore, does not apply to unlawful expropriation.849\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 361 - 363; C-II \u00a7 348; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 253 - 256.\n\nC-I \u00a7 356; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 347 - 356; CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 168 - 172; France-Hungary BIT, Art. 5(2) **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]** ; *ADC v.

Under this standard, compensation must wipe out the consequences of the illegal act.850 Thus, the customary international law principle of full reparation includes reparation for consequential damages.\n\n*See* discussion Meg Kinnear, \"Damages in Investment Treaty Arbitration\", in Katia Yannaca- Small (ed.), Arbitration under International Investment Agreement, a Guide to the Key Issues, Oxford University Press, 2010, 559 **[CLA-0089]** ; *Siemens v.

THE STANDARD OF COMPENSATION FOR VIOLATION OF ART. 3 OF THE BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n513.\n\nFor a breach of Art. 3 of the BIT, the compensation awarded to Claimants should be determined in accordance with customary international law.851 The principle of full reparation as articulated by the PCIJ in *Chorzow Factory* and reflected in Art. 31 of the ILC Articles applies to claims under Art. 3 of the BIT.852\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 376 - 378; *Chorz\u00f3w Factory (Claim for Indemnity) (Merits), Germany v.

As a result, Claimants are entitled to the same damages as would be due in the case of an unlawful expropriation.853 This principle has been adopted by academics,854 and has been illustrated in cases.855\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 379, 382.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 380; Campbell McLachlan, Laurence Shore, and Matthew Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration Substantive Principles*, 1st Edition, Oxford University Press, 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 9,107 - 9,019 **[CLA-0078]** ; Christopher F.

Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n516.\n\nRespondent has not acquiesced to Claimants' proposed standard of compensation for claims under Art. 3 of the BIT. The BIT does not define the manner in which damages are to be calculated for treaty violations other than expropriation. In similar situations, relying on principles of international law, most tribunals have held that the appropriate standard of damages for these types of breaches is the loss \"*adequately connected to the breach*\" of that specific provision of the treaty.859\n\nR-II \u00a7 294 - 296; C-II \u00a7 371; *S.D. Myers v. Canada* Partial Award, \u00a7 309 **[CLA -0027]** ; *Marvin Feldman v. Mexico*, \u00a7\u00a7 194 - 197 [ **CLA-0013]** / **[RLA-0041]** ; *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, NAFTA, Second Partial Award (21 October 2002) \u00a7 140 **[RLA-0174]**.\n\n517.\n\nWhere expropriation and non-expropriatory breaches produce the same effects, it may be appropriate to measure the loss, and therefore compensation, by focusing on the market value of the investment loss. It would not be proper to make such an award where doing so would compensate Claimants beyond the actual harm.860 Thus, the appropriate focus is on the nature and extent of the loss caused by the conduct in question. Accordingly, if Claimants fail to show that they were substantially deprived of their investment to support an expropriation claim, they will be no more able to recover that loss under Art. 3 than under Art. 5(2).861\n\nR-II \u00a7 297; *Marvin Feldman v.

Tribunal Considerations and Conclusions**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nAs the Tribunal has concluded above that it does not need to examine whether, in addition to the breach found above regarding Art. 5(2) of the BIT, there is also no need to examine that standard for compensation for a possible breach of Art. 3.\n\n**C. ARGUMENTS RELATED TO THE PARTIES' AND EXPERTS' DAMAGES CALCULATIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n519.\n\nThe Parties also agree that, in case the Tribunal finds a breach of the BIT and does not apply the compensation standard of Art. 5(2) for lawful measures, damages may be assessed using a **DCF method**,862 though they disagree how it should be applied in the present case.863\n\nIn the DCF assessment, the business's year-on-year future cash flow (revenue less expenses) is projected from the Valuation Date, onward. A discount rate is then applied to the projected net cash flow to calculate the present value of those cash flows.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 163; Navigant's Opening Slide 4; Tr.

Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n520.\n\nIn their post-hearing submission, Claimants updated their losses to total **EUR 27.4 million** before interest (as opposed to EUR 26,909,000 before interest).864 Claimants reported that the loss in value of CD Hungary was **updated to EUR 23.6** (as opposed to EUR 23.2 million in the Second FTI Report) and the value of Vyroba\u2019s lost profits amount to EUR 3.8 million (as opposed to EUR 3.7 million).865 Claimants seek to recover for the loss of the value of the expropriated enterprise and the value of their subsidiary, Vyroba, from which CD Hungary procured its vouchers.866 The Second FTI Report adjusted the discount rate related to CD Hungary from 12.6% to 12.8%.867 The discount rate used to assess the lost profits of Vyroba was adjusted in the Second FTI Report from 10.5% to 11.7%.868\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 279; C-II \u00a7 420.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 279; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 429 (*reporting* the value of CD Hungary as EUR 23.2 million) and 432 (*reporting* Vyroba\u2019s lost profits as EUR 3.7 million).\n\nC-I \u00a7 371.\n\nC-II \u00a7 427; Second FTI Report, Appendix 3 para A3.43, A3.12-3.16 - 3.21 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nC-II \u00a7 430.\n\n521.\n\nFTI confirms the reliability of its DCF valuation by comparing it to the results obtained by using other methodologies: the market value of other publicly-listed comparable companies and past transactions involving companies comparable to CD Hungary. FTI's DCF valuation is well within range values derived from these benchmarks.869\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 393 - 394; First FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 5.1, 5.10 - 5.24 **[CEX-1]**.\n\n522.\n\nThe DCF methodology is most appropriate for assessing Claimants' losses because it best reflects the value of an enterprise that is well-established and has been operating for a sufficient period of time to allow for a meaningful projection of future profits.870 Claimants have demonstrated that CD Hungary was a successful and profitable operation. The conclusion that there would have been future profits is well-founded, satisfying the test for the award of future lost profits.871 Although some tribunals have been reluctant to apply the DCF valuation methodology, this is of no relevance to the present case. Unlike the claimants and/or investments in *Siemens AG v. Argentina*, *Wena Hotels v. Egypt*, *Metalclad v. Mexico*, and *Siag v. Egypt*, CD Hungary had a long operational history and had been reliably profitable since 2004.872 Indeed, on the Valuation Date, CD Hungary had been operational for over 15 years and had just completed its 8th year of profitability, which is sufficient for deriving reliable cash flow projects for a future 5-year period. Unlike in the *Tecmed* and *SPP v. Egypt* cases, applying the DCF methodology in such a situation cannot be described as \"*speculative.*\"873\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 374 - 376, 385; C-II \u00a7 384; *Biwater v.

Revenues include (1) issuing commission (assumed to be 1.09% in the projection period, based on the average commission in 2011); (2) reimbursement commission (assumed to be 2.97%, the 2011 average); (3) revenue from lost or expired vouchers (assumed to be 0.3% of issue volume); and (4) financial income (assumed to be 5% of cash flows).875 Future expenses were then deducted from these revenues. FTI next adjusted these cashflows to take depreciation, overhead costs, capital expenditure, and tax into account.876 Following the initial projection period, FTI assumes that the business continues after the terminal date.\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 386 - 387; First FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 4.18, 4.37 **[CEX-1]**.\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 94, 388; Extract from Mazars Summary Notes on CD Hungary, \"Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner Kft., Hungary\", dated 31 December 2009, 31 December 2010, and 31 December 2011 - 31 December 2013, at 6 **[C-0044]** ; D\u00e9r Statement \u00a7 14 **[CWS-1]** ; First Nagy Statement, \u00a7\u00a7 9 - 10 **[CWS-2]** ; First FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 4.54, 4.61, 4.65 **[CEX-1]**.\n\nC-I \u00a7 389; First FTI Report, \u00a7 A3.12 **[CEX-1]**.\n\n524.\n\nNext, FTI applied a discount rate to the cash flows. The discount rate was initially calculated as CD Hungary's weighted average cost of equity capital (\"WACC\"), as derived from (1) the risk free rate (calculated at 1.9%, the risk free rate of US government bonds with a 10-year maturity), (2) the equity market risk premium (calculated at 6.01%, representing the expected return on the market portfolio), (3) Beta (0.72%, representing the degree of market risk of the asset, later corrected to 0.96%), (4) country risk premium (3.6%, based on Hungarian equity markets as at December 2011), and (5) small-size premium (2.0%, risks that are mitigated by CD Hungary's position as a subsidiary in a large company).877\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 390 - 391; First FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 A4.1, A4.29 - A4.43 **[CEX-1]**.\n\n525.\n\nIn response to Navigant's comments, the Second FTI Report adjusted the WACC to 12.8%.878 FTI also adjusted its analysis with respect to the value of the float, and this had a standalone effect of reducing the value of CD Hungary in the but-for scenario by EUR 3.3 million.879\n\nC-II \u00a7 419; Second FTI Report, \u00a7 1.3 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 425 - 426; Second FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 2.8 - 3.9 **[CEX-2]** (*correcting* First FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 4.63 - 4.66 **[CEX-1]**); First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 159 - 160 **[REX-1]**.\n\n526.\n\nThe alleged \"*uncertainty*\" in the Hungarian voucher market does not change FTI's but-for scenario analysis. Future legislative change was already reflected in FTI's valuation of CD Hungary in the following ways: (1) prior to 2012, there was a trend of increases in the tax exemption limit for meal vouchers, (2) CD Hungary had previously been able to influence voucher related legislation in Hungary, (3) CD Hungary had been able to adapt to unfavorable legislation in the past, (4) changes in legislation are a standard business risk, and (5) a likely buyer of CD Hungary has a portfolio that would diversify away CD Hungary's specific risks. Thus, it is unnecessary to add an additional risk premium to the discount rate.880\n\nC-II \u00a7 409 - 411; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 265, 267; Second FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 5.39 - 5.41, 6.7, 6.10, 6.12; Appendix 3 \u00a7\u00a7 A.3.23 - A.3.27 **[CEX-2]** ; First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 187 **[REX-1]**.\n\n527.\n\nClaimants also pointed out that Respondent overstated the uncertainty associated with the meal voucher market.881 Respondent was unable to rebut FTI's response to Respondent's criticisms, contained in FTI's Second Report, and Respondent's proposed adjustment must be rejected.882 First, Claimants clarified that *\"Claimants' position is not that CD Hungary was somehow immune from any legislative changes as a result of lobbying but rather that any nondiscriminatory changes would not affect CD Hungary, in part because of its proven ability to prevent or limit their negative effects*.\"883 Second, while it may be correct that fringe benefits legislation changed yearly, that is not correct as far as meal vouchers are concerned.884 Third, Respondent's claim that there was a great deal of legislative uncertainty was contradicted by independent analyses of the industry.885 Fourth, FTI undermined Navigant's position, which results in a quadruple counting of the effects of any uncertainty.886\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 195; Second Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 143 - 145 **[REX-2]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 196, 203; Second FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 5.39 - 5.41, 6.7, 6.10 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 197 (emphasis in original); Tr.

At the Hearing, FTI explained that all of the evidence available in 2011 showed that projects mandating dematerialization prior to the 2011 Reform had not made progress because the Hungarian market was not ready.887 A prospective buyer would not have believed that a law mandating dematerialization would be passed in the short term *i.e*., within 5 years. Navigant's claims that (1) CD Hungary and its competitors had considered launching or had launched electronic vouchers prior to the 2011 Reform, and that (2) payment card trends were moving in the direction of dematerialization were unconvincing and unsubstantiated.888 Further, Respondent's 2012 belief that it had no other option but to issue the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher in paper contradicts Navigant's position that the market was ready for dematerialization at the time.889 Navigant ultimately concluded at the Hearing that the market was not ready for dematerialization as at the valuation date.890 Accordingly, the Tribunal should reject Respondent's proposed adjustments to Claimants' framework.891\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 204.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 206 - 211; Tr.

Since CD Hungary's business has been completely destroyed, its value in the actual scenario is negative. It carries costs for (1) redundancy and outplacement of staff (HUF 216,423,235 and HUF 18,339,843, respectively), (2) early termination of vehicle rentals (HUF 20,924,432), and (3) lawyers' costs related to pursuing the case before the EC (HUF 55,431,255). These costs form part of the \"*financially assessable*\" consequences of the breach recoverable under the *restitutio in integrum* principle and as contained in Art. 36 of the ILC Articles. As a result of such expenses, CD Hungary made losses totaling EUR 2,670,000 in 2012 and 2013.893\n\nC-II \u00a7 395; First FTI Report, \u00a7 2.8 **[CEX-1]** ; Second FTI Report, \u00a7 2.5 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 395 - 398; First FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 4.106 - 4.107 **[CEX-1]** ; *Siemens v.

None of these arguments have any bearing on the valuation of Claimants' losses.895 Respondent has not demonstrated how Navigant's Alternative But-For Scenario could be used to measure the Claimants' losses. It is too speculative to be of any value896 and this conclusion is not altered by the Award in *Amco*, which concerns the question of the relevance of factors subsequent to an internationally wrongful act when calculating damages.897 FTI's evaluation of the consequences of the 2011 Reform using the but-for valuation technique is entirely consistent with the *Amco* tribunal's conclusions.898\n\nC-II \u00a7 396 - 397; CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 216 - 217; First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 116 - 124, 154 - 155 **[REX-1]**.\n\nC-II \u00a7 398 - 399; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 295 - 297.\n\nC-II \u00a7 402 - 403, 408; Second FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 4.1, 4.12, 4.26 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nC-II \u00a7 404 - 405; R-I \u00a7 263.\n\nC-II \u00a7 406; *Amco Asia Corp. v.

Without that, they would have been ordinary competitors in the voucher market.899 First, since the market was not ready for dematerialization, the SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers could not have succeeded in the market. The SZ\u00c9P Card has only taken a limited share of the market, even with the preferential tax rate.900 Without the preferential tax rate, neither the SZ\u00c9P Card nor the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher issuers would have taken a significant market share from CD Hungary, due to the high barriers to entry in this market, as well as cost differences between the products.901 In particular, the Tribunal should reject Navigant's change in position that the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher would have gained 20% of the market, rather than the initial 0% assigned to it, because Navigant - preparing expert reports in the related *Sodexo* and *Edenred* Arbitrations - was quite familiar with the market when it issued its first report.902\n\nC-II \u00a7 407; CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 218 - 228; Tr.

Like CD Hungary, FTI used the DCF methodology for the valuation of Vyroba's future lost profits. This was appropriate, since Vyroba has a profitable trading history from 1999 to 2011.908 Respondent's submissions opposing compensation for these losses confuse the investment protection under the BIT and the damages claimed.909\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 402 - 404; Notarised deed (24 May 2002) **[C-0055]** ; \"Contrats Mandataires\" between Vyroba and CD Hungary - 1 January 2004 - 22 December 2008 - 15 December 2010 - 29 August 2011 **[C-0056]** ; First FTI Report, \u00a7 A4.48 **[CEX-1]**.\n\nC-II \u00a7 413.\n\n534.\n\nWhile Respondent has argued that this would not translate to a one-for-one loss for Claimants, from an economic point of view, the impact of the losses suffered by a 100%-owned group company will be suffered at the group level, by Claimants.910 Claimants' case is materially different from the *Nykomb* case, as Claimants' damages claim is for Vyroba's lost profits only. FTI has deducted all of the elements listed by the Tribunal in *Nykomb* from the income lost as a result of Respondent's breaches of the BIT.911 The only deduction to Vyroba's profits that could be argued to be necessary here would be dividend withholding tax, but no such taxes applied because EU law forbids the application of taxes on dividends distributed by EU companies to their parent companies also incorporated in the EU, as is the case here.912 FTI's calculation of Claimants' loss of Vyroba's profits amounts to EUR 3.8 million.913\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 273.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 273 - 275; Tr.

Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n540.\n\nIf the Tribunal finds that the introduction of the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher are *bona fide* regulations but that the tax differential breached the BIT and caused a total loss of Claimants\u2019 investment, Navigant has calculated the appropriate amount of damages, excluding interest, as EUR 7,552,000. If the Tribunal accepts Respondent\u2019s argument as to the appropriate compensation standard set forth in Art. 5(2) of the BIT, this amount needs to be further reduced to eliminate the amounts claimed for Vyroba\u2019s lost profits (EUR 126,000), redundancies, outplacement costs and vehicle lease penalties (EUR 872,707), lawyers\u2019 fees (EUR 186,377), and/or the Terminal Value of CD Hungary (EUR 1,422,642).923\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 354 - 355; Second Navigant Report, Table 1 **[REX-2]**.\n\n541.\n\nAlthough some tribunals have awarded compensation under an additional head of damage to \"*wipe out the consequences of the wrongful act*\", that would only become relevant if the Tribunal declined to apply the standard articulated in Art. 5(2) of the BIT. Claimants must demonstrate that they actually incurred the incidental damages after the breach, including those needed to mitigate harm. Claimants\u2019 claims for damages related to (1) redundancy and outplacement costs / equipment costs, (2) lawyers\u2019 fees associated with pursuing complaints before the EC, and (3) lost profits associated with Vyroba are too remote or unforeseeable (defined as being not reasonably anticipated by both parties as the probably result of the breach at the time of the breach) to be compensable. For the first items, Claimants have not proven the circumstances surrounding these expenditures, why they were incurred, and if they were incurred.924 The same is true for the lawyers\u2019 fees, which were not incurred in the course of fending off particular attacks by Hungary, but were presumably lobbying costs that Claimants incurred as a matter of due course when Claimants elected to challenge Hungary\u2019s regulatory powers.925\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 329 - 334; C-I \u00a7 396; CD Hungary\u2019s exceptional Costs, November 2014, \u00a7 6.3.3 **[AC-45]** ; Sergey Ripinsky and Kevin Williams, Damages in International Investment Law, \u00a7\u00a7 5.1, 5.4 and 5.52 (2008) 162 **[RLA-0232]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 335 - 337; *Pope & Talbot v.

The limited evidence indicates that there were many factors contributing to Claimants' losses.

Under the BIT, there is nothing that requires that the existing issuers be allowed to participate - only that the criteria for issuers be non-discriminatory.929 Claimants have maneuvered their claim and now it appears that their true claim relates to the so-called differential tax and not the introduction of the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher or the SZ\u00c9P Card.930\n\nR-II \u00a7 307; C-II \u00a7\u00a7 402, 407; Thomas W.

Thus, the but-for world must account for the increased competition from the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher.933 Further, the 2011 Reform-based SZ\u00c9P Card requirements of a 1.5% commission cap for affiliates and zero commission for employers/clients and the requirement to return lost or expired vouchers to employers are not considered wrongful or in violation of international law or the BIT. The competitive impact of these requirements among all voucher issuers reduce Claimants' claim to damages and cannot be assumed away.934 Claimants' effort to remove the impact of competition from the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher and SZ\u00c9P Card, by claiming that if they were introduced, in the absence of more favorable tax treatment, they would have been the same as any other competitor cannot be successful.935 While CD Hungary's competitive position would have given Claimants some advantage, this would not be sufficient to preserve their market share indefinitely. Claimants' analysis fails to account for the benefits of the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher or the SZ\u00c9P Card that distinguish them in the market place.936 The low commissions and the electronic cards would have helped the SZ\u00c9P Card compete with competitors' vouchers.937\n\nR-II \u00a7 308.\n\nR-I \u00a7 262; C-I \u00a7 257; First Navigant Report, \u00a7 123 **[REX-1]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 309.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 310 - 311; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 264, 294 - 298; First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 238 - 241 **[REX-1]** ; Second Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 102, 105 **[REX-2]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 277 - 278; R-II \u00a7 312, 315; C-II \u00a7 407; Second FTI Report, \u00a7 4.34 **[CEX-2]** ; First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 190, 242 **[REX-1]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 313; Second Navigant Report, \u00a7 V(C), \u00a7\u00a7 50, 106, 113 **[REX-2]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 314; Second Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 50, 102 - 103 **[REX-2]**.\n\n546.\n\nClaimants demand compensation based on a DCF valuation model that relies on speculative projections for 2012 - 2016. Damages must be proven with reasonable certainty and speculative hypotheticals must be disregarded. Hypothetical lost profits are typically only included where the anticipated income stream is legally protected. Tribunals have rejected the use of a DCFbased valuation in circumstances where the data was too speculative and unreliable. Here, CD Hungary had no contractual arrangements or other means by which to ground a legally protected interest. It lacked a sufficiently well-established history of dealings to make their anticipated income stream certain.938\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 257 - 260, 272 - 275; *ADC v.

II) **[RLA-0099]**.\n\n547.\n\nThe First FTI Report contains three defects that render the entire model flawed and the resultant valuation inaccurate and inflated: (1) it fails to account for the impact of legitimate measures taken by Hungary that were not in violation of the BIT, (2) it ignores uncertainties that existed in the Hungarian voucher system, and (3) it overstates the loss associated with Vyroba by incorrectly ascribing the entirety of lost profits to events in Hungary.939\n\nR-I \u00a7 261; First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 115 - 130 **[REX-1]**.\n\n548.\n\nClaimants\u2019 DCF analysis in the First FTI Report overstates the counterfactual valuation.940 The First FTI Report made six errors that resulted in overstating CD Hungary\u2019s forecasted cashflows. First, by forecasting CD Hungary\u2019s issue volumes based only on the 2011 numbers, FTI assumed that volumes would continue to grow at the same pace as in other EU countries with far lower penetration rates. The impact of correcting this error results in a EUR 356,000 reduction in the value of CD Hungary.941 Second, FTI\u2019s assumption that CD Hungary would continue to exhibit higher growth in the forecasted period is unsupported, and is based on a one-time event attributable to the combined tax-free exemption limit for hot and cold meal vouchers that released pent-up demand for cold meal vouchers in 2011. Expectations for wage and job growth as of the Valuation Date were weak. A reasonable buyer would anticipate more moderate growth during the forecast period, beginning at 6 percent in 2012 and declining to 3 percent by the end of the period. This results in a EUR 6.5 million reduction in the value of CD Hungary.942 Third, FTI overestimates that income from three of CD Hungary\u2019s four revenue streams. Sustaining the value of revenue from lost and expired vouchers is unsustainable, given the shift to electronic cards. This results in a EUR 1.1 million reduction in the value of CD Hungary.943 Fourth, with regard to \"*floats*\" (financial revenues), FTI\u2019s calculations are riddled with errors, which with correction result in a EUR 3.3 million reduction in the value of CD Hungary.944 Fifth, the FTI Report further assumes that the interest generated from the float will remain constant, contrary to the downward inflation trend in the year preceding the Valuation Date. This results in a EUR 2.8 million reduction in the value of CD Hungary.945 Sixth, the FTI Report predicts no decrease in client commissions over time, even though this source had shown constant decline since 2007 with only slight recovery in 2011. This results in a EUR 0.74 million reduction in the value of CD Hungary.946\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 272, 276; First Navigant Report, \u00a7 VIII **[REX-1]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 279 - 281; First Navigant Report, \u00a7 138 **[REX-1]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 282 - 284; First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 141, 147, 149 **[REX-1]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 285 - 286; First Navigant Report, \u00a7 157 **[REX-1]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 287; First Navigant Report, \u00a7 160 **[REX-1]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 288; First Navigant Report, \u00a7 165 **[REX-1]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 289; First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 167, 169 **[REX-1]**.\n\n549.\n\nIn their second report, FTI has failed to correct other flaws in their model. First, FTI's assumptions with respect to employment trends are inconsistent with the trends as of the Valuation Date. Second, FTI's projection that CD Hungary would experience an increase in their market share disregards the increasingly competitive environment prior to the Valuation Date, as reflected in CD Hungary's eroding profit margins during those years. Third, FTI excludes the impact that CD Hungary's decision to not transition to using electronic cards would have of CD Hungary's revenues and financial performance. Fourth, FTI's model assumes that CD Hungary's client commissions would increase after the Valuation Date, even though there is no analysis to support this conclusion and it contradicts the falling trend in client commission prior to the Valuation Date. Fifth, FTI's WACC is understated as it (1) understates CD Hungary's cost of debt and (2) fails to add a risk premium for the specific risks to the Hungarian Market.947 Although the First FTI Report calculated the WACC to be 12.6%, Navigant recommends using the inflation forecast for the projection period through 2016, raising the inflation-adjusted cost of equity to 13.3 %, which results in a EUR 1.6 million reduction in the value of CD Hungary.948\n\nR-II \u00a7 328; Second Navigant Report, \u00a7 VII(A)(i)(1) - (3), (6), VII (A)(ii) **[REX-2]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 290 - 292; First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 172, 187 **[REX-1]**.\n\n550.\n\nClaimants' valuation contains assumptions about the voucher market that are not supported by the available evidence. Claimants' analysis overlooks the threat to CD Hungary's business from dematerialization. Although Claimants appear to erroneously state that they were not pursuing dematerialization, evidence indicates that in 2011, CD Hungary developed an advertising campaign promoting its own card.949 Navigant presents clear and convincing evidence that the transition to electronic cards in Hungary was both inevitable and imminent. In contrast, the only objective evidence that Claimants' expert relies upon is a 2008 National Bank of Hungary Report - and this report shows that even in 2008, the trajectory of digitization was positive.950\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 316 - 317; Second FTI Report, \u00a7 4.10 **[CEX-2]** ; Presentation, Benefits of the Card System, Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner (17 June 2011) **[R-0051]** / **[NAV-0059]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 318; National Bank of Hungary, \"The payment card business in Hungary\", 2008 **[FTI-02]** ; Second Navigant Report, \u00a7 85 **[REX-2]**.\n\n551.\n\nFTI's valuation also ignores the uncertainty that existed within the fringe benefit system. The Government routinely changed the relevant legal framework, and these changes would have signaled uncertainty to a buyer. Nonetheless, FTI unsoundly assigns no value to this uncertainty and assumes away all risk based on lobbying skills and adaptability. A hypothetical buyer would not assume that CD Hungary's operations would continue exactly as they had in the past, regardless of legislative changes. FTI's analysis is simply unreasonable and not the result of sound methodology.951\n\nR-I \u00a7 265 - 267; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 319 - 323; Second FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 6.3 - 6.10 **[CEX-2]** ; *American International Group, Inc. and American Life Insurance Company v.

The CJEU Decision prompted Respondent to amend the laws challenged here by Claimants. Thus, beginning on 1 January 2016, Claimants' cold meal vouchers would receive the same tax treatment as the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher. Further, the criteria for becoming a SZ\u00c9P Card Issuer have been lessened. The re-establishment of the so-called level playing field has been established. Thus, Claimants have been granted the full reparation that they seek in the form of restitution in-kind, rather than compensation. This analysis must be adjusted to exclude lost profits beyond 1 January 2017. This value represents more than 64% of the claimed damages.952\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 324 - 327; *Glamis Gold v.

The uncertainty present on the Valuation Date of 1 January 2012 precludes reliable comparisons. The selected companies Edenred and Sodexo are not comparable - both have different growth and risk prospects as compared with CD Hungary. Ultimately, with respect to Edenred, the FTI Report (1st) reached the same conclusion and acknowledged that Sodexo operates a substantially different type of business, as it is primarily a catering company. Both companies are significantly more diversified and international than is CD Hungary and would be valued much higher than CD Hungary.953\n\nR-I \u00a7 299 - 304; First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 194, 199, 205 **[REX-1]**.\n\n554.\n\nClaimants have not supported the damages associated with Vyroba. The question of whether a claimant can seek remedy for losses suffered by companies it owns rather than losses it suffered itself has been discussed in the jurisprudence. Respondent argues in that context that *Gemplus* is also instructive in the distinction between claims of a shareholder, as opposed to claims of the company.954 Reparation serves to compensate an investor for losses it suffered - not for losses suffered by third parties over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction.955 The measure for compensation is the change in value of the shareholding and not, as Claimants allege, the loss suffered by Vyroba. Here, there is no basis to assume that the entire value of the lost profits incurred by a subsidiary will be experienced in identical magnitude by the shareholder or an indirect shareholder.956 Here, the damages are attenuated - Claimants are seeking to recover lost profits suffered by a third company (Vyroba) in a third country (Czech Republic) which one of the Claimants (CD Internationale) purports to own indirectly through various non-party subsidiaries that have not been properly identified. Claimants have failed to prove that either of them are actually the ultimate shareholder of Vyroba. The figure provided by Mr. Nicholson does not demonstrate an actual link between the various alleged owners.957 Navigant states that CD Hungary owned a 33.2% equity interest in Vyroba as of the valuation date.958 But, even if Claimants had proven that CD Internationale was the ultimate shareholder, Claimants have shown no injury to CD Internationale that would entitle them to compensation - there has been no loss of dividends or decrease in the value of CD Internationale\u2019s shareholding resulting from the alleged injury to Vyroba. There is no legal or economic basis to assume that the value of the lost profits incurred by a subsidiary will be experienced in identical magnitude by the shareholder or even an indirect shareholder. Vyroba is not an investor under the BIT and tribunals in similar situations have declined to award damages.959 Respondent argues that the losses allegedly suffered by Vyroba are not recoverable because Vyroba is not an Investor under the BIT, nor is it a protected investment.960 The case *ADM v. Mexico*, where the tribunal determined that it could not award damages allegedly suffered by a subsidiary on the basis that the losses occurred outside of Mexico, is illustrative and consistent with prevailing case law.961\n\n*Gemplus v.

It would be reasonable to assume that in the four years since the alleged breach, Vyroba would have undertaken steps to mitigate their losses and to turn their focus to other profitable activity.962 It is instead reasonable to assume that a company like Vyroba would, in the intervening four years since the purported breach, undertake steps to mitigate these losses. Navigant reports that Vyroba indeed mitigated losses and calculates Navigant's calculation of lost profits of Vyroba (in Claimants' corrected \"But-For\" analysis) amounts to EUR 429,000.963\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 268 - 271, 293; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 347 - 348; Extract from Internal CD Hungary presentation (22 June 2009) **[C0062]** ; First Data, \"Prepaid Card Issuingand [sic] POS Acquiring Services - Indicative Proposal for Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner Hungary\" (4 July 2011) **[C-0135]** ; *AIG v.

Although Claimants have presented a March 2012 presentation where the need to study diversification was noted, there is no evidence that a study on diversification was conducted or that diversification was attempted. Instead, Claimants simply state that diversification was \"*not an option*.\" FTI then assumes that CD Hungary must have considered diversification because there is no evidence that they did not. Neither statement is sufficient to discharge Claimants' duty to mitigate.964 This stands in stark contrast to the mitigation efforts that LCD's Spanish subsidiary took to adapt to changing legislation in that country.965\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 349 - 350; *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hung. v.

Rather than seeking an amount that would make Claimants whole, Claimants seek to be put in a position that they would never have obtained but for breach.966 Claimants and their expert have conceded that their valuation makes no adjustments for competition or for the introduction of an electronic card.967 Claimants' model also does not account for a reduction in commission rates and it assumes that the 2011 conditions or something similar would prevail for the indefinite future.968 Claimants are asking the Tribunal to insulate it from the completely foreseeable and accepted risks of the market, including imminent and inevitable dematerialization.969\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 18.\n\n*Id*.; Tr.

Navigant's model reflects the fundamental dependence of the system on tax incentives, the risk that a potential buyer would perceive in light of economic and legislative changes, and the multi-faceted impact of the inevitable shift to electronic cards.970 Navigant's analysis enables the specific damages resulting from the allegedly wrongful acts to be isolated and quantified. Since Claimants do not allege that Respondent was foreclosed from introducing new fringe benefits or regulating issuers thereof, Claimants may only seek compensation for harm flowing from the differential tax treatment.971 By excluding the introduction of the SZ\u00c9P Card and the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher from the but-for model, Navigant's framework enables the Tribunal to determine a proper quantum of damages, should such calculation prove necessary.972\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 19; Navigant Presentation, slides 7 - 19.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 19, n. 51.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 19.\n\n559.\n\nIn its closing statement Respondent also pointed out that Mr. Nicholson was instructed that one of the breaches to the BIT was the fact that MNUA undertook a media campaign in relation to the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher. It is unclear how this could breach the BIT.973\n\nTr. Day 4 at 65:3 - 7 (R. Closing).\n\n**3. Tribunal Considerations and Conclusions**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nAbove, the Tribunal has found that there was a compensable breach of Art. 5(2) of the BIT, and that the compensation standard is not governed by Art. 5(2) for lawful measures, but rather by the full reparation principle of customary international law. Further, the Tribunal recalls that the Parties accept 1 January 2012 as the Valuation Date.974 The Tribunal found that the destruction of the value of Claimants\u2019 shareholding was permanent at that point in time and accepted Claimants\u2019 decision to withdraw from the market in 2013,975 rendering the costs associated with that withdrawal compensable.\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 379 - 384, 413; R-I \u00a7 250.\n\n*See* \u00a7 353, *supra*.\n\n561.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Parties and their Experts accept that using the DCF method is appropriate in the present case.976 The Tribunal agrees and now proceeds to examine the experts\u2019 application of the DCF method to the present case.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 163; Navigant\u2019s Opening Slide 4; Tr. Day 3 at 127:18-22 (Navigant); R-I \u00a7 251.\n\n**(a) DCF Valuation for Loss to CD Hungary**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Parties' and their Experts' Agreements**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n562.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls its conclusion that Respondent intentionally created a state monopoly and evicted CD Hungary from the meal voucher market or, at the very least, it knew that the effect of the 2011 Reform would be that no clients would continue to buy CD Hungary\u2019s meal vouchers and that they would instead buy the SZ\u00c9P Card and Erzs\u00e9bet voucher. The but-for calculation must start from that basis to assess the damage Claimants suffered compared to the value of their investment, had such a state monopoly not been established.\n\n563.\n\nFTI provided in detail reasons why a five-year projection period is appropriate, given the trading history of CD Hungary and the relative maturity of the Hungarian market (with a 62% penetration rate), and in view of CD Hungary's rates of growth in the years until 2011.977 Navigant also uses a five-year projection period for its calculations.978 The Tribunal agrees that the five-year projection period is appropriate in the present case. The projection period for CD Hungary's cash flows, therefore, spans five years, from 2012 to 2016 while, thereafter, CD Hungary would have only attained growth thereafter in line with the long-term rate of inflation in Hungary.979\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7 7.4 **[CEX-1]**.\n\nSecond Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 30 - 31 **[REX-2]**.\n\nSecond FTI Report, Table 5-1 **[CEX-2]**.\n\n564.\n\nThe Experts agree that the appropriate discount rate should be a WACC.980\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 3.14 - 3.16 **[CEX-1]** ; Second Navigant Report, \u00a7 141 **[REX-2]**.\n\n**(ii) The Parties and their Experts' Key Areas of Disagreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n565.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered and refers to the reports of both Experts in assessing the but-for scenario, *i.e.*, that without the introduction of the 2011 Reform. The key areas of disagreement between the reports of FTI and Navigant regarding the but-for valuation of CD Hungary relate to the following:981\n\n\u2022 Hungary's economic outlook,\n\n\u2022 CD Hungary's exposure to legislative risks,\n\n\u2022 The market risk from Reforms of 2009 and 2010,\n\n\u2022 The impact of SZ\u00c9P Card / Erzs\u00e9bet voucher's entry on the playing field, and\n\n\u2022 The effect of transition to electronic cards (dematerialization.\n\nNavigant Presentation at Hearing (24 May 2017), slide 4.\n\n566.\n\nHereafter, to avoid repetition, the Tribunal will address these interlinked areas of disagreement together. The Tribunal's role, as explained in *Gemplus*, is not \"*to make a simplistic binary choice between the two very different cases advanced by the two sides*.\"982 Rather, as did the PCIJ in *Chorz\u00f3w*, this Tribunal ascertains damages owed for the treaty violation by reference to the different valuations presented by the Parties and their Experts and bases its conclusions on the valuations, facts, and documents submitted to it.983 This Tribunal's exercise of its broad discretion is guided by its aim to conduct these proceedings efficiently, while ensuring fairness to the Parties.984\n\n*Gemplus v. Mexico*, \u00a7\u00a7 12-57 **[CLA-0093]**.\n\n*Compare Chorz\u00f3w Factory (Claim for Indemnity) (Merits), Germany v. Poland*, 1928 P.C.I.J. Ser. A., No. 17, Judgment No. 13, Award (13 September 1928), 53 - 54 **[CLA-0079]**.\n\n*Compare* *Corn Products v. Mexico*, \u00a7 19 (point 8) **[CLA-0033]**.\n\n567.\n\nHere, the helpful and plausible calculation spreadsheets provided by each Expert, which have been the subject of review and comment by the opposing side, enable the Tribunal to conduct its own calculation based on the factors identified and argued by both sides, without the need to further revert to the Parties for calculations based on the elements that the Tribunal has found persuasive.\n\n568.\n\nThe assumptions that inform the DCF projections in a fair market value analysis must be based on information that would have been known to a hypothetical buyer as of the Valuation Date. Therefore, it is appropriate to forecast growth in the Hungarian voucher market in accordance with expected wage growth in Hungary as of the Valuation Date.985 The relevant macroeconomic factors that indicate growth in revenues for the voucher market are: (1) employment growth (increased demand), (2) higher minimum wages, and (3) higher inflation, which increases interest rates, thereby increasing financial revenues earned from the cash float.986 Contrary to Navigant's assumption of a negative economic outlook as of the Valuation Date,987 the Tribunal is more persuaded by FTI's assessment of the situation that Hungary's economic outlook was positive as of that date. This would have affected the voucher market in Hungary and particularly CD Hungary's position in it. The issue volumes used by FTI are based on appropriate projections that are supported by actual developments.988\n\nFirst FTI Report, Figure 5-1 **[CEX-1]** ; First Navigant Report, \u00a7 137, Appendix I.2f **[REX-1]**.\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7 3.34 **[CEX-1]** (*citing* AC-19 Table 3-1; AC-8 3); *see also* Second FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 5.9 - 5.12 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nNavigant based its assumption of a negative economic outlook as of the valuation date on Economist Intelligence Unit, \"Hungary Country Forecast,\" November 2011, 13 **[NAV-12]**, which contains positive indications for Hungary's growth from 2011 - 2016, including growth in employment (and, by extension, Issue Volume) and growth in wages.\n\nSecond FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 5.3 *et seq*. **[CEX-2]** ; *see also* First Navigant Report, \u00a7 147 **[REX-1]** (*citing* Economist Intelligence Unit, \"Hungary Country Forecast,\" November 2011, 13 **[NAV-12]** (*showing* that employment was projected to increase during the relevant period)).\n\n569.\n\nLegislative risks existed for Claimants from the very beginning of their investment, as Respondent's relevant legislation was updated yearly. As Respondent has explained,989 employers' incentive to buy vouchers, and the employees' incentives to use them, hinges on preferential tax treatment - *i.e.*, legislation that the Parties agree was updated regularly. Claimants have shown that they were aware of legislative risk and took it into account and adapted to the yearly changes, including the Reforms of 2009 and 2010. However, the 2011 Reform was different. As concluded above, it was a series of measures that created a state monopoly which was not foreseeable by Claimants and in fact dispossessed them of their investment, in violation of the BIT.\n\n*Supra*, \u00a7 V.A.\n\n570.\n\nThe Experts disagree on whether an additional risk premium should be added to CD Hungary\u2019s WACC to account for the Hungarian market-specific risks that were present following the 2009 and 2010 voucher market reforms, which resulted in more uncertainty in the voucher market than before.990 In response to those changes, however, CD Hungary maintained a strong competitive position in the Hungarian voucher market in 2009 and 2010 and it achieved \"*our best ever results in 2011.*\"991 The Tribunal, therefore, accepts that CD Hungary\u2019s lobbying skills (*i.e.*, its ability to influence legislation) and its ability to adapt to legislative changes would mitigate legislative risk, as shown in their past performance.992 A hypothetical buyer would have been able to assume that CD Hungary\u2019s operations would continue as they had in the past, regardless of legislative changes (as they were to be expected from past practice, but not of the kind that have been found to be a breach above) and how CD Hungary might be able to adapt to further reforms and to what degree this would adversely impact CD Hungary\u2019s margins/value. Therefore, the Tribunal finds the additional legislative risk premium of 1.5% to be added to the WACC, as recommended by Navigant, inappropriate.993 The Tribunal agrees with FTI\u2019s use of the 12.8% WACC.\n\nFirst Navigant Report, \u00a7 187 **[REX-1]** ; Second Navigant Report, \u00a7 143 **[REX-2]**.\n\nD\u00e9r Statement, \u00a7\u00a7 32 - 37 **[CWS-1]**.\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 6.3 - 6.7 **[CEX-1]**.\n\nFor detailed discussion *see* First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 174 - 177 and 183 - 186 **[REX-1]**.\n\n571.\n\nNavigant994 estimated that CD Hungary\u2019s market share would gradually decline by approximately one third (33 percent) over the projection period, because the SZ\u00c9P Card Issuers established themselves in the hot meal voucher market and took market share from the incumbent issuers. Having found the introduction of the SZ\u00c9P Card to be among the measures included in the Treaty breach, however, the Tribunal cannot accept this assumption in the but-for analysis.\n\nSecond Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 113 **[REX-2]**.\n\n572.\n\nA potential buyer would have taken the transition to electronic vouchers (dematerialization) into account because dematerialization would result in a reduction in revenues from lost or expired vouchers. While the experts agree that dematerialization would take approximately five years,995 they disagree as to whether dematerialization would have begun on the Valuation Date (as Navigant argues) or after the projection period (as FTI argues). CD Hungary had contemplated dematerialization996 and was in the process of recruiting a POS contractor in June 2011, should dematerialization become imminent.997 While dematerialization of vouchers represented a longterm growth opportunity for CD Hungary that the company had studied since 2006, CD Hungary did not consider that by the Valuation Date the Hungarian market was ready for electronic vouchers. The Tribunal agrees that dematerialization was not imminent as of 1 January 2012 and the documentary record confirms that Hungary was not prepared for dematerialization as of that date.998 Indeed, the 2015 introduction of an electronic card combining the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher and SZ\u00c9P card999 confirms Hungary's lack of preparedness for dematerialization as of the Valuation Date.1000\n\n*See* Second FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 4.21 - 4.22 **[CEX-2]** (five or six years); Second Navigant Report, \u00a7 93 **[REX-2]** (five years).\n\nBenefits of the card system, flyer dated 17 June 2011 **[NAV-59]** ; First Data, \"Prepaid Card Issuingand [sic] POS Acquiring Services - Indicative Proposal for Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner Hungary\" (4 July 2011) **[C-0135]**.\n\nFirst Data, \"Prepaid Card Issuingand [sic] POS Acquiring Services - Indicative Proposal for Le Ch\u00e9que D\u00e9jeuner Hungary\" (4 July 2011) **[C-0135]**.\n\n*See e.g*., \"Shift to Digital Strategy,\" Edenred, November 2011 **[NAV-19]**.\n\nSecond FTI Report, \u00a7 4.14 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nSecond FTI Report, \u00a7 4.16 **[CEX-2]**.\n\n573.\n\nThe Experts agree that the revenue from lost/expired vouchers would be 0.3% in Issue Volume at the Valuation Date, based on the actual revenues earned by CD Hungary from 2009 - 2011.1001 The Tribunal finds this assumption reasonable for the forecast period. Navigant's assumption of a 50% reduction in revenues lost and expired revenues vouchers over the forecast period was based on dematerialization beginning at the Valuation Date - an assumption that the Tribunal has rejected.1002\n\nFirst Navigant Report, \u00a7 157 **[REX-1]** ; (*accepting* 0.3% as the starting point); First FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 4.60 - 4.61, Figure 4-5 **[CEX-1]** ; Second FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 5.57 - 5.59 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nSecond Navigant Report, \u00a7 132, Appendix I.2g **[REX-2]**.\n\n574.\n\nWhile later developments based on new decisions by Respondent after the Valuation Date were not foreseeable for Claimants and, therefore, Claimants' decision to shut down was justified as concluded above, Respondent argues that they must be considered for the calculation of Claimants' future losses. Respondent argues that the CJEU Decision prompted Respondent to amend the laws challenged here by Claimants. Beginning 1 January 2017, cold meal vouchers were to receive the same tax treatment as the Erzs\u00e9bet voucher and the criteria for becoming a SZ\u00c9P Card Issuer were to be lessened. Respondent explains that these changes re-established the so-called level playing field in the relevant market, and support Respondent's argument for excluding the terminal value, as it compensates Claimants in kind, rather than monetarily.1003 As indicated, however, Respondent has not met its burden of proving the establishment of a level playing field.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 324 - 327.\n\n575.\n\nThe Parties' Experts accept that CD Hungary had growth of 13.8% in Issue Volume in 2011.1004 CD Hungary's average growth rate in Issue Volume was 9.7% over the final two years (2010, 2011), 7.8% over the final three years (2009 to 2011), and 16.5% over the final four years (2008 to 2011).1005 The Tribunal considers that FTI has sufficiently justified the growth projection of 13.8% for CD Hungary. By contrast, Navigant has provided no sufficient documentary support for its assumption of only 6.0% growth,1006 for its position that 13.8% growth projected toward the future would be unreasonable, or that the 13.8% growth in 2011 was a one-time event, based on pent up demand or customers pre-ordering vouchers.1007\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7 4.30 **[CEX-1]** ; First Navigant Report, \u00a7 140 **[REX-1]**.\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7 4.30 **[CEX-1]** (*citing* RSM DTM Hungary, Cafeteria 2012, 7 December 2011 **[AC-6b]** - **[AC-6f]**).\n\nFirst Navigant Report, \u00a7 149 **[REX-1]**.\n\nSecond Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 140 - 142 **[REX-2]**.\n\n576.\n\nRegarding impact of inflation on financial revenues, Navigant's review of CD Hungary's historic financial revenues from 2006 through 2011, after adjusting for inflation, shows that CD Hungary's real return varied from negative 2.8 percent to positive 2.2 percent,1008 and that the average real interest rate was just 0.2 percent and the median was 0.5 percent over this period.1009 Navigant's analysis, if accurate, relies on an IMF Report that reports the true, rather than forecasted, inflation rates for the projection period and is, thus, not appropriate for use in the but-for scenario.1010 Instead, the Tribunal is more persuaded by FTI's assessment, which references a 2015 IMF Report that contains the actual and the then-projected values for each year.1011 FTI's analysis was based on CD Hungary\u2019s prior performance and relies on information that a prospective buyer would have had at the Valuation Date.1012\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7 134, Appendix J.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at Appendix J.\n\nIMF World Economic Outlook, Inflation expectations updated 28 September 2015 **[FTI-9]**.\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7 4.65, Figure 4-6 **[CEX-1]** ; Second FTI Report, \u00a7 5.48 **[CEX-2]**.\n\n577.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal notes the competitive pressures facing the voucher market in 2009 - 2011 and CD Hungary\u2019s strategy of pursuing government clients at particularly low client commission rates.1013 The Parties appear to rely on the same graph reflecting the historic trend of CD Hungary\u2019s Client Commission percentage.1014 FTI and Navigant agree that it is appropriate to use Edenred as a benchmark for client commissions,1015 but neither Expert has provided Edenred\u2019s Client Commissions for Hungary.1016 Edenred\u2019s client commission rate from its global operations was 1.6% in 2010.1017 Unable to report Edenred\u2019s Client Commissions, FTI reports that the Erzs\u00e9bet Client Commission rates ranged from 3.1% - 3.5% from 2012 - 2014, which was higher than the 1.09% Client Commissions projected for Claimants.1018 Navigant\u2019s assumption in Appendix I.2c in the Corrected Framework, which is provided without documentary support, is that Cold Voucher Commissions would be pressured to 0.75% due to competition with SZEP and Erzs\u00e9bet, Hot Voucher Network fees would be restricted to 1.5%, and Client Commissions would be restricted to 0% due to SZEP.1019 While the Tribunal cannot consider the effects of competition with the Erzs\u00e9bet Voucher and the SZ\u00c9P Card in the but-for scenario, it is nonetheless noteworthy that the Erzs\u00e9bet Client Commission rates ranged from 3.1% - 3.5% from 2012 - 2014, which was higher than the 1.09% Client Commissions projected for Claimants. The Tribunal is, therefore, not persuaded that it would be reasonable as at the Valuation Date to project that Client Commissions would decrease by approximately 2% per year until 2016.1020\n\nFirst Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 166 - 169 **[REX-1]**.\n\n*See id*., at Figure 14 **[REX-1]** ; First FTI Report, Figure 4-3 **[CEX-1]**.\n\nSecond Navigant Report, \u00a7 135 **[REX-2]** (*citing* First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 166 - 169 **[REX-1]**), First FTI Report, \u00a7 4.46 **[CEX-1]** ; Second FTI Report, \u00a7 5.53 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nSecond FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 5.53 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7 4.46 **[CEX-1]** (*citing* Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, Report on Edenred, 27 July 2011, p 10 **[AC-8]**).\n\nSecond FTI Report, \u00a7 5.55 **[CEX-2]**.\n\nSecond Navigant Report, Appendix 1.2, Tab 1.2c **[REX-2]**.\n\n*Compare* First Navigant Report, \u00a7\u00a7 166 - 169 **[REX-1]**.\n\n578.\n\nCD Hungary did not have any debt at the Valuation Date, and while the Experts do not disagree with FTI's inclusion of debt in the WACC, Navigant states that FTI's calculation of CD Hungary's WACC is understated.1021\n\nSecond Navigant Report, \u00a7 141 **[REX-2]**.\n\n579.\n\nFTI's calculation of CD Hungary's cost of debt relies as a benchmark on interest coverage ratios of Edenred SA, Sodexo Pass International, Wex, and Fleetcor and thereby applies a rating of AA which is the second-highest credit rating available.1022 Navigant points out that such a rating equates the credit rating of CD Hungary to that of large, multinational, diversified parent companies and that the other four companies relied on in comparison by FTI are significantly larger and more diversified than CD Hungary.1023 FTI explains that CD Hungary is a wholly owned subsidiary of Claimants - which is not disputed - with debt held at the parent company level. That capital structure has no necessary connection with the risks of the Hungarian voucher industry.1024 The Tribunal does not find it unreasonable to calculate CD Hungary's debt based on debt held at the parent company level: CD Hungary's parent company in France is a large multinational company. Navigant has not provided sufficient evidentiary support for the need for an additional 1% to be added to the cost of debt. The Tribunal, therefore, declines to add an additional 1% premium on CD Hungary's cost of debt, as recommended by Navigant.1025\n\nFirst FTI Report, Appendix 4, \"Cost of debt ratings\" worksheet **[CEX-1]**.\n\nSecond Navigant Report, \u00a7 142 **[REX-2]**.\n\nSecond FTI Report, \u00a7 3.15 **[CEX-2]** ; First FTI Report, 2 **[CEX-1]**.\n\nSecond Navigant Report, \u00a7 142 **[REX-2]**.\n\n580.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the Experts positions regarding the comparable companies analysis that FTI used to cross-check its results. Indeed, while the analysis does not prove the accuracy of FTI's analysis, it does not weaken it as alleged by Navigant. In any event, the Tribunal has not relied on it as such in its deliberations. The damages to be awarded in this case are based on a factors analysis of each input in each Expert's report. The comparable companies and comparable transactions analyses, while interesting, did not assist in the assessment of each variable of the Expert's DCF models, and have ultimately had no impact on the Tribunal in reaching its conclusions.\n\n581.\n\nThe Experts disagree regarding the acceptance of a Terminal Value, (*i.e.*, value of lost cash flows beyond the projection period). FTI maintains that following the standard approach in business valuation, a Terminal Value must be added to the net present value of the cash flows in the projection period. To determine this Terminal Value, FTI assumes that in the period beyond 2016, CD Hungary would have grown at no more than the projected long-term rate of inflation in Hungary, being 3%, which the Tribunal accepts as an accurate projection of Hungary's long-term inflation rate as at the Valuation Date.1026\n\nFirst FTI Report, \u00a7\u00a7 497, 498 **[CEX-1]**.\n\n582.\n\nNavigant argues that the Terminal Value should be excluded.1027 The Tribunal agrees with FTI that, indeed, it is standard practice to include a Terminal Value and sees no reason not to do so in the present case. Respondent dispossessed Claimants of an investment with long-term income generating prospects, and the proper compensation to be awarded is its fair market value as of the Valuation Date. At the time of dispossession, there was no prospect that after a certain period, Hungary would annul the legislative measures in breach of the BIT, as it now has. The BIT provides that the fair market value must be established as of the Valuation Date, with the information which a prospective buyer would have had at that time. There is, thus, no reason to deduct the terminal value in CD Hungary's DCF model.1028\n\nSecond Navigant Report, \u00a7 68 **[REX-2]**.\n\nThe same conclusion was reached in the *Edenred* Award, \u00a7\u00a7 620 - 622.\n\n583.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants sought to amend their Terminal Value with the result that the Terminal Value would increase, during the Hearing. While the Tribunal believes that Claimants have met their burden of proof in establishing the Terminal Value and that this proposed modification does not change that, it rejects the Claimants' late amendment to the Terminal Value. As this change was only introduced by the Expert in his oral testimony and then by Claimants only in the post-hearing brief, and since there was no 2nd round of post-hearing briefs, Respondent has not had an opportunity to object. Further, the Tribunal does not find that Claimants provided the Tribunal sufficient evidence demonstrating what was changed or how, as only the results of the new calculation was provided. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not accept the purported correction.\n\n**(iii) Resulting damages for CD Hungary**\n------------------------------------------\n\n584.\n\nTaking into account all the above considerations regarding CD Hungary (without Vyroba and without interest, both of which will be discussed hereafter), based on Respondent's breach of the BIT, the Tribunal accepts FTI's calculation of damages to CD Hungary as summarized in FTI's second report, Appendix Four Tab \"Total Losses.\"\n\n585.\n\nAccordingly, the damages suffered by CD Hungary are **EUR 23,196,000**.\n\n**(b) Losses Associated with Vyroba**\n-------------------------------------\n\n586.\n\nThe Parties agree that Vyroba is a third company located and incorporated in the Czech Republic, and that Vyroba supplied Claimants' paper vouchers. The Parties dispute whether losses suffered by Vyroba are compensable in these proceedings, whether Vyroba is 100% owned by either of the Claimants and, if so, whether and to what extent such losses are compensable.\n\n587.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the view expressed in *Gemplus* cited by Respondent and in other jurisprudence1029 that the payment of damages resulting from a breach of a treaty serves to compensate an investor for *\"losses it has actually suffered - not for losses suffered by third parties over which the tribunal has no jurisdiction*.\"1030\n\n*Khan Resources v. Mongolia*, \u00a7 388 **[RLA-0163]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 340 - 341; *Gemplus v. Mexico*, \u00a7 12-50 **[CLA-0093]** ; *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, \u00a7 95 **[RLA-0146]**.\n\n588.\n\nThe Claimants seek to recover lost profits suffered by a third company (Vyroba) in a separate country (Czech Republic) that one of the Claimants (CD Internationale) purports to own indirectly through various different subsidiaries that are not parties to or part of the relevant investments. Vyroba is neither an \"Investor\" nor a protected investment under the BIT. The BIT defines \"*investment*\" as assets established \"*in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory or maritime zones the investment was made.\"1031* Indeed, as pointed out by Respondent, the case *ADM v. Mexico* deals with a similar scenario and thus is illustrative. In that case, the claimant's investment was a Mexican distributor of corn syrup that was manufactured in the US. As part of their damages claim, the claimants sought compensation for the US subsidiary's lost sales of corn syrup that could have been sold in Mexico. The tribunal determined that it could not award such damages on the basis that the losses had occurred outside of Mexico. This conclusion is consistent with prevailing case law.1032 A similar conclusion was reached in the *Canadian Cattlemen* case though this was a decision under NAFTA.1033\n\nArt. 1 of the France-Hungary BIT **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 346; *ADM v. Mexico* **[CLA-0032]**.\n\n*Canadian Cattlemen v. USA*, \u00a7\u00a7 194-223 **[RLA-0149]**.\n\n589.\n\nTherefore, without the need to examine further the Parties' dispute regarding the evaluation of the claim of EUR 3.8 million raised regarding Vyroba,1034 that claim has to be dismissed.\n\nC I \u00a7 432; CPHB-I \u00a7 279.\n\n**XI. INTEREST**\n----------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS' ARGUMENTS**\n---------------------------\n\n590.\n\nIn its post-hearing submission, Claimants stated that the interest accrued on Claimants' losses amounts to EUR 12.1 million as of 22 September 2017.1035\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 282; *compare* C-II \u00a7\u00a7 433 - 434 (interest applied 1 April 2016 totalled EUR 8.7 million).\n\n591.\n\nBased on Art. 5(2) paragraph 3 of the BIT, the calculation of the interest payable by Respondent should not be limited to a calculation of the \"*taux de march\u00e9 appropri\u00e9*\" in the BIT, but should be defined by consideration of what would fully compensate Claimants. This Tribunal should be guided by the principle of *restitutio ad integrum* under international law, as expressed in Art. 38 of the ILC Articles.1036 The appropriate interest rate should take into account the amount of compensation that the amount awarded would have earned, had it been paid after the expropriation.1037\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 406 - 407; \"Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\", 53 UN GAOR Supp. (No. 10) at 43, UN Doc.

Interest shall accrue annually from 2 January 2012 and compound annually until the date of payment.1038 EURIBOR is a reasonable interbank rate and represents a risk-free rate of interest on investments.1039 The use of such a rate in isolation is disadvantageous, requiring the application of a surcharge to the applicable rate.1040\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 405, 413 - 415.\n\n*Id*., at \u00a7\u00a7 409 - 410; *Gemplus v.

RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n593.\n\nThe BIT mandates that the interest for expropriation claims should be calculated based on an \"*applicable market rate*.\" The appropriate market rate should be the market lending rate or a commercial lending rate, not the market premium which is used to assess the market return on equity. Further, if Claimants seek compensation in EUR, a EUR-based market lending rate should be applied - not a market risk premium calculated for the US market.1041\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 306; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 352 - 353; France-Hungary BIT, Art. 5(2) **[CLA-0001]** / **[RLA-0079]** ; First Navigant Report, \u00a7 251 **[REX-1]**.\n\n594.\n\nWhile Respondent agrees with using the EURIBOR, it alleges that Claimants' proposed interest rate using the EURIBOR plus 6.01 percent to reflect the equity market risk premium is overstated.1042\n\nR-I \u00a7 305.\n\n**C. TRIBUNAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls its conclusion above that Respondent has breached Art. 5(2) of the BIT and that its measures were not a lawful, but rather an unlawful dispossession. Therefore, the limitation for the interest on compensation in case of a lawful dispossession in Art. 5(2) to a calculation of the \"*taux de march\u00e9 appropri\u00e9*\" cannot be applied.\n\n596.\n\nRather, guidance should be taken from the principle of *restitutio ad integrum* under international law1043 as reflected in Art. 38 of the ILC Articles, which states:1044\n\n*Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result*.\n\n*RosInvest v. Russia*, \u00a7 684 **[CLA-0099]**.\n\nResponsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001), 53, UN GAOR Supp. (No. 10) at 43, U.N. Doc. A/56/83 (2001), Art. 38(1) **[CLA-0080]**.\n\n597.\n\nTherefore, as stated by the tribunal in *Siemens v. Argentina*,1045 the appropriate rate of interest should take into account \"*the interest rate the amount of compensation would have earned had it been paid after the expropriation*\", in order to give effect to the principle of full reparation.\n\n*Siemens v. Argentina*, \u00a7 396 **[CLA-0028]** / **[RLA-0063]** ; *see also* *Yukos v. Russia*, \u00a7\u00a7 1682-1685 **[CLA-0071]** ; and Sergey Ripinsky and Kevin Williams, \"Damages in International Investment Law\", BIICL, 2008, 373 **[CLA-0100]**.\n\n598.\n\nThe Parties agree that using the EURIBOR is appropriate for the determination of interest in the present case.\n\n599.\n\nThough, as pointed out above, the ruling in Art. 5(2) of the BIT for lawful dispossessions cannot be applied here, because Respondent's measures were unlawful and a breach of the BIT, guidance can still be taken from the fact that Art. 5(2) provides the \"*applicable market rate*.\" While the Tribunal has carefully considered Respondent's and Navigant's views regarding the appropriate market rate,1046 the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that EURIBOR plus 6.01% is appropriate in the circumstances of the present case.\n\nR-I \u00a7 306; First Navigant Report, \u00a7 250 **[REX-1]**.\n\n600.\n\nAccording with the standard practice in recent investment arbitration,1047 from 2 January 2012, the interest shall accrue annually and be compounded annually until the date of payment.\n\n*See e.g.,* ICSID Award of 30 November 2017, in *Bear Creek Mining Corporation v. Republic of Per\u00fa* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/21); *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB 06/18, Award (28 March 2011), at \u00a7 360; *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich A.G. and Gesti\u00f3n e Ingenier\u00eda S.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/19 Award (18 November 2014) at 968; *OI European Group B.V. v.

Argentina*, at \u00a7\u00a7 9.6.1 - 9.6.2 **[CLA-0021]** / **[RLA-0021]**.\n\n**XII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n601.\n\nIn their Reply Statement of Costs dated 26 January 2018, Claimants state that their total amount of costs, expenses, and fees in respect of the arbitration proceedings, is **EUR 3,570,753.76 plus USD 450,000**.1048\n\nClaimants' Letter (26 January 2018). The amount of USD 450,000 corresponds to the ICSID lodging fee and the advances made by Claimants to ICSID until 26 January 2018, which were \"subject to any adjustment by ICSID.\"\n\n602.\n\nClaimants request that the Arbitral Tribunal order Hungary to pay all these costs, expenses, and fees including the legal fees and expenses incurred by UP and CD Internationale.\n\n603.\n\nClaimants explained that their request is based on the \"*costs follow the event*\" principle and on the fact that Claimants have brought their claims to arbitration fairly and have used their best effort to achieve an efficient resolution of the dispute. In the event that the Tribunal were to find Respondent liable, but for a lower amount of damages, the Tribunal must still order Respondent to pay the entirety of Claimants' costs incurred, because reparation must wipe out the consequences of the illegal act and restore the situation that would have existed without such acts. Here, absent these illegal acts, there would have been no arbitration and, thus, no related fees or expenses. To restore the situation that would have existed in the absence of Respondent's illegal actions, Claimants must, therefore, be awarded their entire costs incurred in connection with these proceedings. Respondent's alleged good faith and professional behavior (which are denied) are irrelevant in this regard.\n\n604.\n\nRespondent's suggestion that Claimants should be penalized for their efforts to preserve the initial hearing dates are ludicrous.\n\n605.\n\nRespondent is not permitted to claim reimbursement of the VAT, and its expert fees are excessive, amounting to nearly 40 percent more than Claimants' expert costs. This is especially so, given that Navigant has served as expert in other similar cases.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n606.\n\nIn its first Submission on Costs also dated 12 January 2018, Respondent states that its costs in respect of the arbitration proceedings are **HUF 647,284,339.00 plus USD 1,384,447**.1049\n\nRespondent's Letter (12 January 2018). The amount in USD includes the amounts advanced by Respondent to ICSID until 12 January 2018 to cover the costs of the proceeding.\n\n607.\n\nRespondent argues that the circumstances of this case warrant an award of full costs for Respondent, without apportionment. If Respondent prevails in these proceedings, there is no sound policy reason to prevent a successful host State from obtaining the benefit of a \"*cost follows the event*\" or \"*loser pays*\" rule.\n\n608.\n\nRegarding apportionment, Respondent requests that, even if Respondent were to not wholly prevail, it should not be required to pay any portion of Claimants' costs or their share of the administrative costs because it presented good faith defenses in a straightforward and professional manner. Alternatively, Respondent argues that the most appropriate apportionment would be for the Parties to share in the costs of the proceedings equally and for each to bear its legal costs. There is no inconsistency between Respondent's entitlement to full costs should it prevail, and the fact that Claimants should not be reciprocally entitled to any costs award against Respondent should the Tribunal even partially grant Claimants' claims. The reason for this is the distinction between the nature of Claimants' manifestly unfounded claims on the one hand and Respondent's measured response to those claims on the other.\n\n609.\n\nClaimants' unreasonable and non-cooperative behavior aggravated costs in many ways. Their failure to precisely state their claims or provide basic information to Respondent forced Respondent to undertake substantial independent investigation and adjust its defense to respond to a number of speculative scenarios. Next, Claimants complicated their late notification of Mr. D\u00e1vid Pusztai's attendance at the Hearing by failing to provide appropriate assurance regarding his involvement in the case. Claimants complicated matters related to the unforeseen and unavoidable delay in the December Hearing by resisting postponement. Similarly, Claimants challenged Respondent over a number of inconsequential procedural matters, including Respondent's effort to resolve an inadvertent procedural matter. Their aggressive tactics hindered and delayed the Parties' ability to make simple procedural arrangements and otherwise increased costs.\n\n610.\n\nClaimants' arguments that they are entitled to costs are without merit, as Respondent's notice related to the *Achmea* Decision was appropriate.\n\n**C. TRIBUNAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nThe applicable arbitration rules are Art. 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. They allow the Tribunal a degree of discretion.\n\n612.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the question of how the arbitration costs shall be apportioned between the Parties, because the evaluation of the amounts claimed by a party will only be relevant for the Tribunal's decision insofar as the Tribunal finds that a party has to reimburse to the other party some of the costs that party incurred.\n\n613.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal takes into account the following. First, Respondent failed in its objection to jurisdiction as decided in this Tribunal's Decision on Preliminary Issues of Jurisdiction dated 3 March 2016. The Tribunal does not share Respondent's view1050 that this failure should not be taken into account, because its objection was raised in good faith and engaged a novel question of law on which other tribunals have held differently (including, notably, the *Edenred* tribunal), and because Respondent agreed to resolve the jurisdictional issue on the preliminary basis with a view towards reducing costs for both Parties, were the objection to be upheld. While the Tribunal does not doubt that Respondent made its objections to jurisdiction in good faith, this does not change the fact that it failed with these objections and that particularly the separation of the procedure on jurisdiction caused a considerable delay and part of the total costs of this procedure.\n\nRespondent's First Cost Submission (12 January 2018), \u00a7 17\n\n614.\n\nSecond, Respondent failed on the question of liability, as the Tribunal concluded that Respondent's measures were in breach of Art. 5(2) of the BIT. This part of the proceedings was the major part of the dispute and caused the major part of the time and costs of the case.\n\n615.\n\nThird, regarding Quantum, Respondent partially prevailed, as the Tribunal awarded only the amount of EUR 23,196,000, plus interest, of the total of EUR 39,465,434 requested by Claimants. With rounding, this amounts to nearly 60% of Claimants' claim.\n\n616.\n\nTaking the above considerations into account, including the considerable work involved in the procedural matters regarding Respondent's jurisdictional motion where Claimants ultimately prevailed, the Tribunal considers it appropriate and fair that Respondent shall bear 75% of the costs reasonably claimed by Claimants.\n\n617.\n\nIn view of this decision, the Tribunal only has to examine whether and to which extent the costs requested by Claimants are to be considered appropriate and reasonable and therefore subject to reimbursement according to Art. 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n618.\n\nThough objecting to bearing any costs claimed by Claimants by apportionment, Respondent has not objected to the calculation of the costs claimed by Claimants.1051 Indeed, the Tribunal also considers that the costs claimed by Claimants are reasonable.\n\nRespondent's Second Costs Submission (26 January 2018).\n\n619.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):1052\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses\n\nProfessor Dr. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel 356,001.86\n\nThe Honourable L. Yves Fortier QC 146,883.31\n\nSir Daniel Bethlehem QC 121,236.20\n\nAssistant's fees and expenses 68,716.48\n\nICSID's administrative fees 170,000\n\nDirect expenses (estimated)1053 136,729.48\n\n**Total 999,567.33**\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\nThis amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (courier, printing and copying).\n\n620.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in the amount of USD 1,149,788, of which USD 574,950 were paid by Claimants and USD 574,838 were paid by Respondent.1054 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 499,783.67.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n621.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has to bear its own costs of arbitration, and has to reimburse 75% of the **EUR 3,570,753.76** requested by Claimants as legal fees and expenses as well as 75% of the **USD 524,783.671055** corresponding to the expended portion of the Claimants' advances to ICSID and the ICSID lodging fee, ***i.e.*** **EURO 2,678,065.32 plus USD 393,587.75**.\n\nThis amount in USD includes the amounts advanced by Claimants to defray the costs of the proceeding and the ICSID lodging fee paid by Claimants.\n\n622.\n\nThe rate of interest found above to be applicable for the damages awarded also has to be applied to this payment for arbitration costs, however only from the date this amount is due, *i.e.* from the date of this Award.\n\n**For convenience, in order to facilitate the signing of the Award by the members of the Tribunal, the Decisions and Signatures are placed below on a separate page.**\n\n**XIII. DECISIONS**\n-------------------\n\n623.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n**1. Respondent breached Art. 5(2) of the BIT between France and Hungary signed in Paris on 6 November 1986.**\n\n**2. Respondent shall pay to Claimants damages amounting to EURO 23,196,000.**\n\n**3. Respondent shall bear its own costs of arbitration and shall reimburse Claimants 75% of Claimants' total arbitration costs, i.e. 75% of the expended portion of Claimants'advances to ICSID and the ICSID lodging fee (USD 393,587.75), and of Claimants' legal fees and expenses (EURO 2,678,065.32).**\n\n**4. Respondent shall pay, on the above amount of damages awarded, i.e. EURO 23,196,000, interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus 6.01% compounded annually from 2 January 2012 until date of payment.**\n\n**5. Respondent shall pay, on the above amounts of arbitration costs to be reimbursed to Claimants according to Decision No. 3 above, interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus 6.01% compounded annually from the date of this Award until date of payment.**\n\n**6. All other claims are dismissed.**"}]}
