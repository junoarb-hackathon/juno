PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.1.\n\nThe Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim on December 30, 2015. Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence on September 1, 2016. In its Statement of Defence, the Respondent proposed that these proceedings be bifurcated into two phases and noted:\n\n*The Claimant has agreed to consider Canada's bifurcation proposal and to advise the Tribunal by September 16, 2016, whether it will consent to bifurcation with respect to Canada's objections described above. Should the Claimant not consent to bifurcation, the Disputing Parties have agreed that Canada will submit a Request for Bifurcation setting out the rationale supporting bifurcation in greater detail by September 29, 2016.*\n\n1.2.\n\nBy letter of September 14, 2016, the Claimant stated that it was \"unable to consent to bifurcation on the basis of the proposal set out in Canada's Statement of Defense.\"\n\n1.3.\n\nIn accordance with the Disputing Parties' agreement, the Respondent submitted its Request for Bifurcation on September 29, 2016 and the Claimant submitted its Opposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation on October 13, 2016.\n\n1.4.\n\nAs notified to the Disputing Parties on October 19, 2016, and in Procedural Order No. 3 dated November 3, 2016, the Tribunal held a hearing on bifurcation via teleconference on November 7, 2016. During that hearing Mr Luz made submissions on behalf of the Respondent and Dr Feldman and Mr Valasek made submissions on behalf of the Claimant.\n\n1.5.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered all the points presented by the Parties in their written and oral submissions, and summarises the key positions below. The Tribunal stresses that its considerations and decisions regarding bifurcation should in no way be understood to prejudice the substance of the preliminary objections or the submissions on the merits.\n\n**2. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n2.1.\n\nIn its Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent submits that these proceedings should be bifurcated to address in a preliminary phase its jurisdictional objections under NAFTA Articles 1101(1), 1116(2), 1117(2) and 2103 and its admissibility objection under Article 1102(3). The Respondent notes that \"these objections are discrete, succinct and ripe for determination without need for expert or witness testimony or delving into the merits of the Claimant's Article 1102, 1105 or 1110 claims against the Nova Scotia measures.\"1 The Respondent emphasises the potential time and cost savings that could be achieved by the Disputing Parties if its motion for bifurcation is granted.2\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 3.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 2.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Respondent recalls Article 21(4) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (\"**UNCITRAL Rules**\") which, in its submission, creates \"a presumption in favour of bifurcating jurisdictional questions that should be declined only if, in the circumstances of the particular case, the Tribunal determines that it would be inefficient or would cause prejudice to a disputing party.\"3 The Respondent submits that it has done enough to enliven that presumption and that the Claimant now carries the burden of rebutting that presumption.4 The Respondent cites a number of NAFTA cases in which jurisdiction was decided as a preliminary matter and makes particular reference to *Philip Morris v Australia*.5 In that case, the Tribunal (operating under the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules) \"considered bifurcation to be appropriate when: (i) the objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial, (ii) the objection can be examined without prejudging or entering the merits, and (iii) the objection, if successful, could dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised.\"6 The Respondent adopts these criteria when analysing its objections to jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 4; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 7:9-17.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 30:14-20.\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Limited (Hong Kong) v The Commonwealth of Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 8 Regarding Bifurcation of the Procedure, 14 April 2014.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 6 citing *Philip Morris Asia Limited (Hong Kong) v The Commonwealth of Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 8 Regarding Bifurcation of the Procedure, 14 April 2014, para 109; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 7:18-8:7.\n\n**Jurisdictional objection under Article 1101(1): The Nova Scotia Measures do not \"relate to\" the investor or the investment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.3.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent argues that \"Resolute's claim cannot even pass through the gateway to [NAFTA] Chapter Eleven because the measures adopted by Nova Scotia are not relating to the Claimant's investment in Quebec.\"7 The Respondent submits, first, that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in respect of the Nova Scotia Measures because they do not \"relate to\" the Claimant nor its investment in Qu\u00e9bec and therefore fall outside of the scope and coverage of NAFTA Chapter 11 as required by Article 1101(1). The Respondent submits that the Nova Scotia Measures \"at most, \u2018affected' [the Laurentide mill] in an indirect and remote manner' do not provide a sufficient legal nexus to bring the claim within Article 1101. This constitutes in its view a \"*prima facie* serious and substantial\" objection.8 The Respondent also contends that the disagreement between the Disputing Parties as to the proper test to be applied \u2013 the Respondent favouring the \"legally significant connection\" test espoused in *Methanex9* and the Claimant preferring the \"causal connection test\" adopted by the Tribunal in *Cargill v Mexico*10 \u2013 in assessing the preliminary objection speaks to the fact that this objection is serious and substantial.11\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 10:1-5.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 9.\n\n*Methanex Corporation v United States of America* (UNCITRAL) Partial Award, 7 August 2002.\n\n*Cargill, Incorporated v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 11:1-4.\n\n2.4.\n\nSecond, adjudication of the Article 1101 objection will not require prejudgment of or entry into the merits since, even if the Tribunal accepted the allegation that the Nova Scotia Measures contributed to the closure of the Laurentide mill, there would still not be a \"legally significant connection\"12 so as to pass the threshold set by Article 1101(1).13\n\n*Methanex Corporation v United States of America* (UNCITRAL) Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para 147.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 10; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 13:8-13.\n\n2.5.\n\nThird, if this objection were successful, it would dispose of all of the Claimant's claims in respect of the Nova Scotia Measures, leaving only the claims in respect of the Federal Measures for determination.14\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 11; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 14:24-15:4.\n\n**Jurisdictional objection under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2): Time bar**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.6.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* pursuant to Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2). In short, the Respondent submits that the Nova Scotia Measures were all adopted more than three years prior to the date of the Notice of Arbitration and, therefore, the Claimant's claims in respect of the Nova Scotia Measures are time-barred if the Tribunal finds that \"Resolute knew or should have known of the breach and loss before December 30, 2012.\"15\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 12; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 16:24-17:1.\n\n2.7.\n\nFirst, the objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial since the Nova Scotia Measures were adopted between three and fifteen months before the relevant cut-off date of December 30, 2012.16 Therefore, the claims would be time-barred since NAFTA tribunals have historically \"applied the time-bar limitation strictly\".17 At the Hearing on Bifurcation, the Respondent further submitted that the fact that the Claimant's \"Objection to Bifurcation is dedicated almost entirely to arguing why Canada's legal interpretation of time bar is wrong\u2026 shows that the objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial.\"18\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 13.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 13.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 18:10-20.\n\n2.8.\n\nSecond, assessment of the time-bar objection only requires an assessment of the \"dates on which the Claimant first had knowledge of the measures alleged to violate NAFTA Chapter Eleven and that it had suffered some cognizable loss.\"19 Such an assessment will not require the Tribunal to prejudge or consider the merits of the Claimant's substantive allegations.20 At the Hearing on Bifurcation, the Respondent relied on Exhibit R-081 to Canada's Statement of Defence, Resolute's original draft NAFTA Notice of Intent, to demonstrate that \"Resolute took the position that it suffered damage starting in 2012\", putting it on the wrong side of the time-bar.21 In Respondent's submission, the question of knowledge is \"wholly separate and unrelated to the merits of whether there has been an expropriation, a breach of national treatment, or a breach of the minimum standard of treatment\" and is a simple factual inquiry appropriate for bifurcation.22\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 14.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 14.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 19:6-20:15.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 20:20-24.\n\n2.9.\n\nThird, if this objection were successful, the entirety of the claim based on the Nova Scotia Measures would be time-barred thereby \"drastically reduc[ing] the scope of the arbitration and eliminat[ing] any need to delve into any of the highly complex questions that will be involved in determining the merits of the Claimant's national treatment, minimum standard of treatment and expropriation claims.\"23\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 16; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 23:14-25.\n\n**Jurisdictional objection under Article 2103: claims under NAFTA based on taxation measures**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.10.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the basis that Article 2103 provides that \"nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation matters,\" other than as set out in Article 2103 itself.24 The Respondent submits that Article 2103 does not refer to Article 1105 and, additionally, Article 2103(6) specifies that \"any claim that a taxation measure constitutes an expropriation must be submitted to the competent taxation authorities of the NAFTA Parties at the time of filing the Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration.\"25 The fact that NAFTA specifically provides for a mechanism to be followed in respect of taxation matters means that this is a *prima facie* serious and substantial objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to determine whether any alleged \"discounted property taxes\" amount to a breach of Article 1105.26\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 18.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 18.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 18.\n\n2.11.\n\nSecond, the hearing of this objection will, according to the Respondent, solely require determination of whether Article 2103 permits expropriation claims under Article 1105 and, in respect of the claim under Article 1110, \"whether the Claimant submitted the measure to the NAFTA Parties' taxation authorities at the time of its [Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration].\"27 The determination of these questions will not require examination or prejudgment of the substantive claims.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 19.\n\n2.12.\n\nThird, if the Article 2103 objection is successful, the discounted property tax elements of the Article 1105 and 1110 claims could be disposed of, saving the Tribunal from \"delv[ing] into the difficult terrain of whether, how and to what extent the taxation measure at issue provided a financial benefit to Port Hawkesbury at all and whether or not it played any cognizable role in the Claimant's decision to close its Laurentide mill in October 2014.\"28\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 20.\n\n2.13.\n\nAt the Hearing on Bifurcation, the Respondent conceded that \"Canada would not have proposed holding a separate preliminary phase to deal solely with this objection\" but considers it appropriate to consider the objection in a preliminary phase if other preliminary objections are also to be determined.29\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 28: 16-29:1.\n\n**Admissibility objection under Article 1102(3): The meaning of \"treatment\" under NAFTA across State or Provincial borders**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.14.\n\nEven though the Respondent's objection to admissibility does not fall within the ambit of Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal is permitted to consider the objection as a preliminary matter pursuant to Article 15(1) since, under that provision, the Tribunal is entitled to \"conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, provided that the parties are treated with equality and that at any stage of the proceeding each party is given a full opportunity of presenting its case.\"30 The Tribunal in *Philip Morris v Australia* deemed it unnecessary to classify Australia's Temporal Objection as one relating to jurisdiction or admissibility on the basis of corresponding provisions in the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.31\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 21.\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Limited v The Commonwealth of Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 8 Regarding Bifurcation of the Procedure, 14 April 2014, para 118.\n\n2.15.\n\nApplying the criteria used to assess the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, the Respondent submits that its admissibility objection under Article 1102 is, first, *prima facie* serious and substantial given that Article 1102(3) defines \"treatment\" as referring to \"injurisdiction treatment, not treatment accorded across multiple jurisdictions.\"32 At the Hearing on Bifurcation, the Respondent noted that this is an exceptional case given that \"there has never been a NAFTA case where an investor in one province seeks to challenge the measures adopted by a provincial government in a different province in which the investor has no investment.\"33 Second, it can be assessed without prejudging or entering the merits as the Tribunal can assess the objection by answering one question alone: does the Claimant have a supercalendered paper investment within the jurisdiction of Nova Scotia?34 Third, if the objection were successful, the Tribunal could dispose of the Claimant's Article 1102 claim, would not be required to consider \"Canada's procurement and subsidies defences based on Articles 1108(7)(a) and (b)\", and would not be required to analyse whether the Port Hawkesbury and Laurentide mills were \"in like circumstances\".35\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 23; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 25:4-22.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 26:8-15.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 24; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 26:21-23.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 25; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 27:9-22.\n\n**Claims against the Federal Measures are not prejudiced by bifurcation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.16.\n\nThe Respondent submits further that the Federal Measures claims are \"separate and factually distinct\" from the Nova Scotia Measures claims and there is \"no intrinsic overlap between the facts necessary to dispose of the Nova Scotia Measures as against the Federal Measures.\" For this reason, there is no prejudice to the Claimant in bifurcating the proceedings and hearing the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility in respect of the Nova Scotia Measures in a preliminary phase.36\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, paras 27-29.\n\n**3. CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n3.1.\n\nIn its Opposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, the Claimant \"agrees with Canada that bifurcation could, in some cases, serve purposes of fairness, efficiency and economy.\"37 The Claimant submits that the Respondent's motion should be judged against these three criteria. By doing so, the Claimant contends that bifurcation of these proceedings \"would be unfair, inefficient, and costly\" because \"issues of liability and measures of damages are bound up in Canada's theories for dismissal\", leading to duplication of effort and requiring the Tribunal to \"prejudge[e] or [enter] into the merits\" in the preliminary phase.38 The Claimant adopts the test espoused in *Philip Morris v Australia* and relied upon by the Respondent and argues that the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility do not satisfy the *Philip Morris* criteria.39\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 2.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 2.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 4; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 32:12-18.\n\n**Response to objections under Articles 1101(1) and 1102(3)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.2.\n\nThe Respondent's objections under both Articles 1101(1) and 1102(3) will require the Tribunal to consider the same fact, \"that the Nova Scotia Measures were deliberately aimed at giving Port Hawkesbury Paper an advantage over competitors located outside Nova Scotia.\"40 This fact, the Claimant says, is \"fundamental to the merits of Resolute's claim\", thereby making bifurcation inconvenient.41 In respect of the Respondent's objections under both Article 1101(1) and 1102(3), the territorial limitation advanced by the Respondent is unmaintainable in this case because the measures in question are not ordinary legislative or regulatory measures, but were specifically intended to have effect beyond the borders of Nova Scotia.42 The Claimant also contends that these objections do not satisfy the *Philip Morris* test.43\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 5; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 34:7-10.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 5.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 36: 3-25.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 6.\n\n*Objection under Article 1101(1)*\n---------------------------------\n\n3.3.\n\nFirst, the \"legally significant connection\" test relied upon by the Respondent in respect of Article 1101(1) has been criticised and subsequently recalibrated by other NAFTA tribunals.44 The Claimant relies on the \"causal connection\" test espoused in *Cargill v Mexico45* and endorsed by the tribunal in *Mesa Power Group v Canada*.46 On that test, the term \"related to\" in Article 1101(1) must be understood as requiring \"only some connection and [not requiring] that the measure be adopted with the express purpose of causing loss.\"47\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 8; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 35:18-24.\n\n*Cargill, Incorporated v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009.\n\n*Mesa Power Group LLC v Government of Canada*, PCA Case No 2012-17, Award, 24 March 2016.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 10 citing *Cargill, Incorporated v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009, para 57.\n\n3.4.\n\nSecond, the Claimant relies on \"substantial evidence\" which demonstrates that the Nova Scotia Measures were intended to have effects beyond the province of Nova Scotia and were not, as the Respondent suggests, \"aimed solely at facilitating the sale of the Port Hawkesbury mill in Nova Scotia.\"48 The Claimant contends that the stated goal of the Nova Scotia Measures was to give the Port Hawkesbury mill a competitive advantage so as to make it \"the most efficient paper producer in the world.\"49 Therefore, the Claimant submits that the Respondent \"cannot credibly argue that the [Nova Scotia] Measures had no legally significant effect on other supercalendered paper producers, outside Nova Scotia, nor that it did not know they would.\"50 This, in the Claimant's view, \"demonstrates a *prima facie* case\" that the Nova Scotia Measures \"relate to\" the Claimant and so the jurisdictional objection under Article 1101(1) is unmaintainable and is not appropriate for bifurcation as it requires assessment and prejudgment of the merits.51\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, paras 13-16.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 17.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 22.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 15; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 38:5-22.\n\n*Objection under Article 1102(3)*\n---------------------------------\n\n3.5.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent's Article 1102(3) objection similarly fails the *Philip Morris* test. First, the plain words of the NAFTA text do not support the Respondent's contention that Article 1102(3) only relates to intra-state treatment by a state or province.52 The Claimant submits that the Respondent's interpretation would require one to \"actually modify or\u2026 [read] into 1102(3) additional language.\"53 The Claimant notes that the Respondent does not cite any other authority in support of this contention. Given the lack of authority in the NAFTA text or otherwise, the Claimant submits that this objection cannot be considered serious or substantial.54 The Claimant further submits that the Respondent's assertion that it is impossible for the claim to succeed given Article 1102(3) demonstrates that the objection is not a limited legal inquiry, but rather requires exploration of the merits of the case.55\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 26; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 43:3-4.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 43:11-15.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 27.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 46:12-47:5.\n\n3.6.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal will be required to enter into and prejudge the merits to determine whether the Claimant and the Port Hawkesbury mill are \"in like circumstances\", whether Nova Scotia knew its measures would have a prejudicial effect on foreign investors outside of Nova Scotia and whether other remedies are available to investors in Canada as are available to US competitors who have not invested in Canada.56\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, paras 28-31.\n\n3.7.\n\nThird, the assessment of all of these matters is \"inseparable from the merits\", fails to dispose of the claims under Articles 1105 and 1110, and therefore bifurcation \"would be costly and inefficient.\"57\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, paras 34-35.\n\n**Response to objections under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.8.\n\nAs a starting point, the Claimant notes that the Respondent's objection under Article 1116(2) and 1117(2) relies solely on the date the Nova Scotia Measures were adopted and \"ignor[es] almost entirely the question of when Resolute acquired knowledge that the [Nova Scotia] Measures caused it loss.\"58 In the Claimant's submission, this analysis is only possible with reference to the merits and damages portions of the claim.59\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 36.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 36.\n\n3.9.\n\nAdopting the *Philip Morris* analysis again, the Claimant submits that this objection is not serious and substantial as it has ignored half of the standard set out in Article 1116(2). Relevantly, Article 1116(2) provides: \"An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have [first] acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.\" The Claimant notes that the Respondent's objection emphasises the first half of this standard, but not the second half; that is, when the Claimant knew or should have known that it had incurred loss or damage.60 This knowledge must relate to damage actually suffered, not predicted future damage.61 According to the Claimant, \"the standard\u2026 as a matter of law is for a Claimant to have acquired knowledge that it has incurred loss or damage.\"62 In the Claimant's submission, this objection \"cannot be segregated\" but must be joined to the merits so it \"may be considered in connection with the parties' evidence on loss and damages.\"63 The Claimant emphasises that \"the realities of commerce and the market\" mean that it was impossible to know at the time the Nova Scotia Measures were implemented whether the Port Hawkesbury mill would succeed and take market-share from other competing supercalendered paper mills.64 Accordingly, it is incorrect to assume that the Claimant knew or should have known of its loss at the time suggested by the Respondent.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, paras 37, 43.\n\n*Pope & Talbot v Canada* (UNCITRAL), Award in Relation to Preliminary Motion By Government of Canada to Strike Paragraphs 34 and 103 of the Statement of Claim From the Record, 24 February 2000; see also Meg Kinnear, Andrea Bjorklund et al, \"Article 1116 \u2013 Claim by an Investor of a Party on its Own Behalf\" in *Investment Disputes under NAFTA: An Annotated Guide to NAFTA Chapter 11*, Supplement No 1, March 2008 (Kluwer 2006) 1116-36c \u2013 1116-36d.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 49:12-14.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 45; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 50:2-4.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 58:15-60:5.\n\n3.10.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's reliance on Exhibit R-081, the draft NAFTA Notice of Intent, the Claimant explains that this is a \"non-paper\", provided as a courtesy to the Government of Canada and not intended to be a final document.65 Accordingly, the Claimant suggests that the document \"has no substance or meaning in context.\"66\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 56:3-57:7.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 56:22-57:1.\n\n3.11.\n\nFurther, the Claimant submits that even if this objection were successful, it would not dispose of the entirety of the claim against the Nova Scotia Measures as suggested by the Respondent. Rather, the Claimant submits that its expropriation claim only crystallized upon the closure of the Laurentide mill in October 2014 and its claims in respect of continuing violations would similarly not be time-barred.67 Given that these remaining claims would require the analysis of the \"very same issues that would be relevant to the analysis of the claims under Articles 1102 and 1105\", there is no time or cost saving achieved by bifurcation.68\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 46.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 46.\n\n**Response to objection under Article 2103**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n3.12.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's objection under Article 2103 is misconceived as: first, Article 2103(6) only refers to expropriation claims where such expropriation takes place through the impugned tax measure, not in circumstances where a tax measure forms part of a series of measures which \"contributed to the constructive expropriation of Resolute's Laurentide mill\";69 and second, given that the Respondent concedes that Article 2103 does not preclude its national treatment claim under Article 1102 and its minimum standard of treatment and expropriation claims under Articles 1105 and 1110 respectively encompass more than just the tax-related measures, a successful objection would not dispose of the claims and therefore would not lead to greater fairness, efficiency or economy.70 At the Hearing on Bifurcation, the Claimant submitted further that the purpose of the Article 2103(6) exception is to \"deny claims that taxes might have been used as a tool to expropriate\", not deal with circumstances such as these where tax relief afforded to a third party gives that third party a competitive advantage.71 To interpret Article 2103(6) in the manner suggested by the Respondent would \"distort the exception's intent.\"72\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 48.\n\nOpposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, paras 49-51.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 53:5-15.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 53:4-5.\n\n**4. THE TRIBUNAL'S CONSIDERATIONS**\n------------------------------------\n\n4.1.\n\nThe Respondent asks the Tribunal to bifurcate these proceedings in order to rule on four of Canada's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility as preliminary questions pursuant to the general rule in Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n4.2.\n\nAs summarised in detail above, these objections are that:\n\n(1) the claims in respect of the Nova Scotia Measures are time-barred under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2);\n\n(2) the Nova Scotia Measures do not \"relate to\" the Claimant nor its investment in Qu\u00e9bec as required by Article 1101(1);\n\n(3) Article 1102(3) should be understood as relating only to intra-State \"treatment\" where measures are taken by State or Provincial governments; and\n\n(4) Article 2103(6) requires NAFTA claims based on taxation measures to be \"submitted to the competent taxation authorities of the NAFTA Parties at the time of filing the Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim.\"\n\n4.3.\n\nAs a starting point, Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that \"[i]n general, the arbitral tribunal should rule on a plea concerning its jurisdiction as a preliminary question. However, the arbitral tribunal may proceed with the arbitration and rule on such a plea in their final award.\" This creates a presumption in favour of bifurcation, subject to the Tribunal exercising discretion to deal with jurisdictional pleas together with the merits in appropriate circumstances. Thus, both Disputing Parties acknowledge that in some cases bifurcation can serve purposes of fairness, efficiency and economy but that \"bifurcation is not appropriate in every case.\"73 The Disputing Parties also agree that for a Tribunal to determine whether bifurcation is appropriate in a given case, it is helpful to apply the three-part test applied in *Philip Morris v. Australia,* which posed the following questions *:*\n\n(1) Is the jurisdictional objection *prima facie* serious and substantial?\n\n(2) Can the objection be examined without prejudging or entering the merits?\n\n(3) Could the objection, if successful, dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised?74\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 3; Opposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 2. Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 71:3-10.\n\nBoth parties embrace the test enunciated in *Philip Morris Asia Limited (Hong Kong) v The Commonwealth of Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 8 Regarding Bifurcation of the Procedure, 14 April 2014: Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 7:18-23; Request for Bifurcation, para 6; Opposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 2.\n\n4.4.\n\nThe determination of the first part of the test, namely whether an objection is \"*prima facie* serious and substantial\" should not, in the Tribunal's view, entail a preview of the jurisdictional arguments themselves. Rather, at this stage the Tribunal is only required to be satisfied that the objections are not frivolous or vexatious. In respect of the four objections that Canada seeks to have resolved on a preliminary basis,75 the Tribunal is satisfied that they are each credible and brought in good faith and cannot be excluded on a *prima facie* basis. The Tribunal emphasises however that such an assessment should in no way be understood to prejudice how the Tribunal will resolve the substance of the preliminary objections themselves, or any issues on the merits.\n\nCanada does not seek a preliminary determination on its jurisdictional objection that the challenged electricity rate negotiated between PWCC and NSPI is not attributable to Canada and thus not a measure \"adopted or maintained by a Party\". Respondent's Statement of Defence, para 75; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 74:4-15.\n\n**A. Time Bar Objection under NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.5.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider the time bar objection under NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).\n\n4.6.\n\nAs a matter of NAFTA practice, time bar issues are normally decided as preliminary questions.76 The same approach would normally be taken in domestic proceedings as well.\n\nSee, e.g., *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al v United States of America* (UNCITRAL) Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 20 July 2006, para 29.\n\n4.7.\n\nUnder Article 1116(2) and 1117(2), an investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor (or the enterprise on whose behalf the claim is made) first acquired or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor (or enterprise) has incurred loss or damage. The relevant 3-year cut off in this case is December 30, 2012.\n\n4.8.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that its assessment of Canada's objection under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) in this case would entail a factual enquiry of limited scope. The date of the alleged breaches\u2014the Nova Scotia Measures\u2014are uncontested. Rather, the Tribunal's enquiry will turn on the question of when the Claimant first knew \u2013 or ought to have known \u2013 that it incurred loss or damage. Canada contends that the reappearance onto the market of the Port Hawkesbury mill is sufficient evidence of when loss or damage ought to have been known to Resolute. In support of this contention, Canada describes as \"telling\" a sentence in a draft Notice of Intent given by the Claimant to the Respondent that \"Resolute's market share for all SC Paper has declined from 2012 to 2014.\"77 The Claimant indicated that while evidence as to its acquisition of knowledge of damage was \"not yet on the record\", it expected it could be shown that \"probably only in January, February [2013] after we have the quarterly data and can see what in fact is going on in that quarter will we have any real knowledge that there is a loss taking place.\"78\n\nExhibit R-081 to the Respondent's Statement of Defence, para. 19; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 23:2-12.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 60:21-61:2.\n\n4.9.\n\nThe above-referenced exchanges with the Parties during the Hearing suggest that the evidentiary enquiry that the Tribunal will need to undertake to decide the time bar is a rather limited one. A bifurcated hearing would give the Disputing Parties the opportunity to put evidence on the record as to what the Claimant knew (or ought to have known) and when, and allow the Tribunal to decide the jurisdictional objection on the basis of that evidence. Such a limited enquiry would not involve the Tribunal prejudging or entering the merits of the claims.\n\n4.10.\n\nIf successful, the time bar objection could dispose of all claims relating to the Nova Scotia Measures, which constitute a substantial and discrete part of the Claimant's case.\n\n4.11.\n\nCanada's time bar objection accordingly meets the criteria for bifurcation enunciated in *Philip Morris v. Australia*, which were accepted by both Disputing Parties as the relevant standard.\n\n4.12.\n\nIn circumstances where it is appropriate to bifurcate the proceedings for the purpose of hearing Canada's time bar objection, it would be procedurally efficient to deal with the three other objections to jurisdiction and admissibility in a bifurcated proceeding, even if the Tribunal might not have ordered bifurcation on the basis of any of those other objections alone. Having so decided, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to determine whether the Respondent's other objections would justify bifurcation. Nonetheless and for completeness, the Tribunal considers below the appropriateness of bifurcating for the remaining objections.\n\n**B. Applicability of NAFTA and the definition of \"relating to\" in Article 1101(2)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.13.\n\nCanada objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over claims relating to the Nova Scotia Measures because the measures adopted or maintained by Nova Scotia did not, within the meaning of Article 1101 of NAFTA, \"relat[e]\" to Resolute or its investment, which was located in Qu\u00e9bec. The indirect economic effect of the measures in the form of the alleged loss of market share was, according to Canada, too remote and lacks sufficient legal significance, to pass the \"gateway\" provision of Article 1102 of NAFTA.79 Canada submits that Resolute's claim fails the \"legally sufficient connection\" test in *Methanex*.80\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, para 74; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 10:1-5.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 10:9-18; *Methanex Corporation v United States of America* (UNCITRAL) Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para 139 (\"There must [be] a legally significant connection between the measure and the investor or the investment. With such an interpretation, it is perhaps not easy to define the exact dividing line, just as it is not easy in twilight to see the divide between night and day. Nonetheless, whilst the exact line may remain undrawn, it should still be possible to determine on which side of the divide a particular claim must lie\").\n\n4.14.\n\nCanada stated in its written and oral submissions that it is prepared to accept, for purposes of resolving this preliminary objection, that Resolute's allegations are true *pro tem.*81 Even if the Tribunal has to consider whether the *Methanex* standard is at odds with tests adopted by other tribunals,82 the Tribunal considers that resolving this aspect of the preliminary objection would entail only a question of interpretation and would not involve an extensive duplicative or factual enquiry or prejudge the merits.\n\nRespondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 10; Bifurcation Hearing Transcript 13:8-13.\n\nFor example: *Bayview Irrigation District and others v United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/1, Award on Jurisdiction, 19 June 2007; *Cargill, Incorporated v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009; *William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 17 March 2015.\n\n4.15.\n\nIf successful, the Article 1101 objection would dispose of the claims relating to the Nova Scotia Measures, which constitute a substantial and discrete part of the claims raised by Claimant.\n\n4.16.\n\nIn light of the above, Canada's Article 1101(2) objection also meets the accepted criteria for bifurcation enunciated in *Philip Morris v. Australia*.\n\n**C. Scope of application of Article 1102(3) in respect of measures taken by a state or provincial government**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.17.\n\nRespondent's preliminary objection on the basis of Article 1102(3) requires the Tribunal to accept that the national treatment protection only applies in respect of provincial measures where the complaining investor has an investment within that province. Article 1102(3) provides:\n\nThe treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that state or province to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.\n\n4.18.\n\nThe arguments put forward by the Parties on this issue83 indicate that its resolution at the preliminary objection phase will involve a distinct and relatively straightforward question of treaty interpretation. The Disputing Parties acknowledge that this case is novel in as far as it is the first NAFTA case that deals with measures by a provincial government which are said to affect an investment not in that province84 and accordingly raises a novel issue of NAFTA interpretation.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript: 24:10-27:20; 42:18-47:23.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 26:8-15; 44:6-7.\n\n4.19.\n\nResolving the preliminary objection will not entail a factual assessment of whether the two mills were in \"like circumstances\". Therefore it will involve no prejudgment of the merits nor deprive the Claimant the opportunity to fairly present its case in respect of the existence (or not) of \"like circumstances\".85 If successful, the objection would dispose of an essential part of the claim.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 47:1-5; Opposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 30.\n\n**D. Claimant's requirement to raise a claim in respect of \"tax measures\" otherwise in accordance with Article 2103**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.20.\n\nCanada conceded that it would \"not have proposed holding a separate preliminary phase to deal solely with this objection,\" but submitted that if a preliminary phase were held to deal with Article 1101(1) and the time bar, then Canada's objection relating to Article 2103 is \"straightforward enough to merit inclusion in the preliminary phase.\"86 Canada submitted that doing so \"will provide clarity for both Parties.\"87\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 28:16-29:1.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Transcript 28:22-25.\n\n4.21.\n\nIn light of this concession, in circumstances where the Tribunal has determined it appropriate to bifurcate the proceedings for the purpose of hearing Canada's other objections, it would be procedurally efficient also to deal with this objection in the bifurcated proceeding, even if the Tribunal might not have ordered bifurcation on this basis alone. The exercise would not entail prejudging the merits; and may help narrow the issues for the merits phase.\n\n**E. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n4.22.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to order bifurcation of the proceeding covering all four grounds raised in Canada's motion to bifurcate.\n\n4.23.\n\nIn so ordering, the Tribunal reiterates that any views expressed in this decision are without prejudice to any findings of fact or law that the Tribunal will make on the preliminary objections or any issues on the merits.\n\n4.24.\n\nAccordingly, the schedule set out at paragraph 5.2 of Procedural Order No. 3 issued on November 3, 2016 applies. The Tribunal recalls that pursuant to paragraph 4.4 of Procedural Order No. 3, the Disputing Parties are welcome to consult and agree upon adjustments to the calendar.\n\n**5. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n5.1.\n\nThe Tribunal determines that the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility under:\n\n(1) Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) in respect of time-bar;\n\n(2) Article 1101(1) in respect of whether the Nova Scotia Measures \"relate to\" the Claimant's investment;\n\n(3) Article 1102(3) in respect of the applicability of NAFTA to \"treatment\" by a provincial government where such measures have extra-provincial effects; and\n\n(4) Article 2103(6) in respect of claims relating to taxation measures,\n\nshall be treated as preliminary questions and the proceedings shall be bifurcated for the purposes of determining such objections.\n\n5.2.\n\nThe Tribunal adopts Schedule A of paragraph 5.2 of Procedural Order No. 3, subject to the Disputing Parties submitting any agreed amendments to such schedule."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2018-01-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility\n------------------------------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **LIST OF DEFINED TERMS** |\n| **Article 1128 Submissions** | Submissions filed by the United States and Mexico pursuant to Article 1128 of NAFTA on June 14, 2017 |\n| **C$** | Canadian Dollars |\n| **Canada** | The Government of Canada |\n| **CCAA** | *Companies' Creditor Arrangement Act*, R.S.C. 1985, ch. c-36 (Exhibit R-025) |\n| **Claimant** | Resolute Forest Products, Inc.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. THE DISPUTING PARTIES**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in this arbitration is Resolute Forest Products Inc., a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware, United States of America (the '**Claimant**'). The Claimant's address is 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, United States of America. The Claimant brings this arbitration as an investor on its own behalf and on behalf of Resolute FP Canada Inc, a corporation incorporated in Canada that is directly owned and controlled by the Claimant. The address of Resolute FP Canada Inc is 111 Duke Street, Suite 5000, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec H3C 2M1, Canada. The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Dr Elliot J Feldman, Mr Michael Snarr and Mr Paul M Levine of Baker Hostetler LLP, 1050 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, United States of America; and Mr Martin J Valasek, Ms Jenna Anne de Jong and Mr Jean-Christophe Martel of Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP, 1 Place Ville Marie, Suite 2500, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec H3B 1R1, Canada.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent in this arbitration is the Government of Canada ('**Canada**' or the '**Respondent**'). The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by Mr Mark Luz, Mr Rodney Neufeld, Ms Jenna Wates and Ms Michelle Hoffmann of the Trade Law Bureau (JLT), Global Affairs Canada, 125 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G2, Canada.\n\n**B. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nA dispute has arisen between the Claimant and Canada in respect of which the Claimant commenced arbitration pursuant to Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement ('**NAFTA**').\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute concerns the Claimant's investment in the Laurentide supercalendered paper mill ('**Laurentide mill**') in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, as well as the Dolbeau and K\u00e9nogami mills, also located in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.1 According to the Claimant, it was forced to close the Laurentide mill because it was unable to compete with another supercalendered paper mill located in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia (the '**Port Hawkesbury mill**'). The Claimant alleges that the Nova Scotia Government implemented a series of measures in 2012 (the '**Nova Scotia Measures**') to 'ensure that the Port Hawkesbury mill would have competitive advantages above any other [supercalendered] paper producer, including Resolute.'2 Specifically, it is alleged that Nova Scotia preserved the Port Hawkesbury mill so that it could be sold as a going concern, provided electricity to the Port Hawkesbury mill at a discounted rate and provided the Port Hawkesbury mill with more than C$124 million in assistance to ensure its competitiveness. The Claimant alleges that these measures are tantamount to the expropriation of the Laurentide mill, in violation of Article 1110 of NAFTA, and also constitute a violation of the minimum standard of treatment and national treatment standards of NAFTA (Articles 1105 and 1102, respectively).\n\nSupercalendered paper is a glossy paper used for such things as newspaper supplements and advertising brochures.\n\nNotice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 4.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant further alleges that officials of the Government of Canada discriminated against the Claimant by excluding it from a joint defence group in respect of an investigation by the United States Department of Commerce in relation to the Canadian supercalendered paper industry (the '**Federal Measures**').\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant claims compensation for: (a) the direct losses caused by the measures of Canada and Nova Scotia that amount to a violation of NAFTA; (b) consequential damages arising as a result of the offensive measures; (c) the costs of the proceedings, including the costs of the arbitration; and (d) interest.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's allegations in respect of the measures taken by Nova Scotia are time-barred under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA (the '**Time-Bar Objection**'). Alternatively, the Respondent also argues that the Nova Scotia related claims fall outside the scope of application of NAFTA under Article 1101(1) of NAFTA (the '**Scope Objection**'), that the Claimant's national treatment claims are inadmissible under Article 1102(3) of NAFTA (the '**Provincial Treatment Objection**'), and that the questioned measures are not tantamount to expropriation of the Laurentide mill (the '**Expropriation Objection**'). Finally, the Respondent also considers the Tribunal to lack jurisdiction in respect of the Nova Scotia claims insofar as they relate to taxation measures implemented by Nova Scotia (the '**Taxation Measures Objection**').\n\n8.\n\nIn addition to its arguments on jurisdiction and admissibility, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's claims on the merits and requests the Tribunal to dismiss the claims in their entirety and order the Claimant to bear all the costs of the arbitration.\n\n9.\n\nThis Decision deals with the Time-Bar Objection (in Part V.B), the Scope Objection (in Part V.C), the Provincial Treatment Objection (in Part V.D), the Expropriation Objection (in Part V.E), and the Taxation Measures Objection (in Part V.F). Either the Time-Bar Objection or the Scope Objection, if upheld by the Tribunal, would entirely dispose of Claimant's claims in relation to the Nova Scotia Measures, whereas the other Objections would dispose of the claims in part.\n\n10.\n\nThese Objections relate only to the Nova Scotia Measures. The Disputing Parties agree that the Objections relating to the Federal Measures fall to be dealt with in a subsequent phase of this arbitration.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn September 30, 2015, the Claimant served on Canada its Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration pursuant to Article 1119 of NAFTA.\n\n12.\n\nOn 30 December 2015, the Claimant served its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim ('**Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim**') under Chapter Eleven of NAFTA on Canada. Pursuant to Article 1120(1)(c) of NAFTA, the Claimant also indicated its election to proceed with the arbitration pursuant to Article 3 of the United Nations Commission on international Trade Law Arbitration Rules of 1976 ('**UNCITRAL Rules**').\n\n13.\n\nOn February 9, 2016, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and Article 1123 of NAFTA, the Claimant notified the Respondent of its appointment of Dean Ronald A Cass as arbitrator. Dean Cass is Dean Emeritus of Boston University School of Law and a national of the United States of America.\n\n14.\n\nOn March 18, 2016, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and Article 1123 of NAFTA, the Respondent notified the Claimant of its appointment of Dean C\u00e9line L\u00e9vesque as arbitrator. Dean L\u00e9vesque is Dean of the Faculty of Law, Civil Law Section at the University of Ottawa and a national of Canada.\n\n15.\n\nOn May 25, 2016, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and Article 1123 of NAFTA, the Disputing Parties appointed H.E. Judge James R Crawford, AC as the presiding arbitrator by mutual agreement. Judge Crawford is a judge of the International Court of Justice and a national of Australia.\n\n16.\n\nEach arbitrator duly provided the Disputing Parties with a Statement of Independence.3 The Disputing Parties have both confirmed that 'the Tribunal has been duly constituted in accordance with Article 1123 of the NAFTA. The Disputing Parties have no objections whatsoever to the constitution of the Tribunal or to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal in respect of matters known to them' as at June 2016.4\n\nProcedural Order No 1, June 29, 2016, para 3.2.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, June 29, 2016, para 3.3.\n\n17.\n\nOn June 28, 2016, the Tribunal convened a preliminary procedural teleconference with the Disputing Parties.\n\n18.\n\nFollowing the teleconference, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 on June 29, 2016. Among other things, Procedural Order No. 1 recorded the Disputing Parties' confirmation that the Tribunal had been duly constituted in accordance with Article 1123 of NAFTA, and their agreement that the 1976 version of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules would apply to this arbitration, that the place of arbitration would be Toronto, Ontario, that the languages of the arbitration would be English and French, and that the Permanent Court of Arbitration ('**PCA**') would act as registry in relation to this arbitration. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out procedural rules and a date for Canada to file its Statement of Defence ('**Statement of Defence**').\n\n19.\n\nBy letters of July 27, 2016 and August 8, 2016, the Claimant and Respondent respectively presented an agreed procedural calendar for the Tribunal to decide on bifurcating any jurisdictional and admissibility objections in a preliminary phase. The Disputing Parties noted their agreement that the Claimant would indicate whether it consented to bifurcation by September 15, 2016. By the same correspondence, the Disputing Parties also outlined their respective positions in relation to the timing of submissions under Article 1128 of NAFTA by Non-Disputing NAFTA Parties and Amici Curiae. The Claimant provided further comments on the timing of the Article 1128 Submissions in a letter of August 11, 2016.\n\n20.\n\nIn accordance with Articles 7.1 and 8.1 of PO1, on September 1, 2016 the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence and accompanying documents.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter of September 14, 2016, the Claimant explained that it was unable to consent to bifurcation on the basis of the proposal set out in the Respondent's Statement of Defence.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter of September 22, 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Disputing Parties had reached agreement on a Procedural Order regarding procedures to be followed during document production. The Respondent also informed the Tribunal that the Disputing Parties had largely agreed to the text of a confidentiality order, however, there were a number of outstanding issues to be decided by the Tribunal. The Respondent's letter also enunciated the Respondent's position on the areas of disagreement regarding the confidentiality order.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant provided its comments on the outstanding issues regarding the draft confidentiality order on September 22, 2016.\n\n24.\n\nOn September 29, 2016, the Respondent filed its Request for Bifurcation ('**Request for Bifurcation**') and accompanying documents.\n\n25.\n\nOn October 13, 2016, the Claimant filed its Opposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation ('**Opposition to Bifurcation**').\n\n26.\n\nOn October 14, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 dealing with document production. On the same date, the Tribunal issued a Confidentiality Order, which the Disputing Parties signed on October 27, 2016.\n\n27.\n\nOn November 3, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, setting out two alternative schedules, one in the event that the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the proceedings and one in the event that bifurcation was refused.\n\n28.\n\nOn November 7, 2016, the Tribunal held an oral hearing on bifurcation via teleconference.\n\n29.\n\nOn November 18, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 by which the Tribunal decided to bifurcate these proceedings for the purpose of hearing the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility under Articles 1116(2), 1117(2), 1101(1), 1102(3) and 2103(6) of NAFTA as preliminary questions. Having decided to bifurcate the proceedings, the Tribunal also adopted Schedule A of Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n30.\n\nOn December 12, 2016, having considered the Disputing Parties' correspondence, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 setting out a revised schedule for the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings. The Tribunal reserved any decision in respect of the scheduling for the merits phase of these proceedings.\n\n31.\n\nOn December 22, 2016, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction ('**Memorial**') and accompanying documents.\n\n32.\n\nBy email of January 25, 2017, the Claimant informed the Tribunal on behalf of the Disputing Parties that they had agreed to hold the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility at Arbitration Place in Toronto, Canada.\n\n33.\n\nOn February 22, 2017, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction ('**CounterMemorial**') and accompanying documents including an Expert Witness Statement of Jerry Hausman, Ph.D. on the issue of whether the management of the Claimant could have known of the damage to its supercalendered paper business prior to Q1 2013 (the '**Hausman Statement**').\n\n34.\n\nBy email of March 2, 2017, the Claimant designated: (a) the entire Hausman Statement; and (b) Exhibits C-026 and C-038 as confidential information.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter of March 3, 2017, the Respondent consented to the confidentiality designations in respect of Exhibits C-026 and C-038, but objected to the Claimant's designation of the entire Hausman Statement as confidential. Pursuant to Section 12.1 of PO1, the Respondent also sought the data and information relied upon by Dr. Hausman in the preparation of his report.\n\n36.\n\nOn March 8, 2017, the Claimant provided the source information for the Hausman Report sought by the Respondent and proposed more specific confidentiality designations.\n\n37.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, the Respondent filed its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction ('**Reply Memorial**') and accompanying documents.\n\n38.\n\nOn May 3, 2017, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction ('**Rejoinder Memorial**') and accompanying documents.\n\n39.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, the PCA published on its website a Press Release in both English and French inviting submissions from the Non-Disputing NAFTA Parties and potential *amici curiae* by May 31, 2017.\n\n40.\n\nOn May 31, 2017, an application to participate as *amici curiae* was submitted jointly by Professor Robert Howse and Mr Barry Appleton.\n\n41.\n\nOn June 14, 2017, following an extension of time granted by the Tribunal, the United States of America ('**United States**') and the United Mexican States ('**Mexico**') submitted Non-Disputing Party submissions pursuant to Article 1128 (the '**Article 1128 Submissions**').\n\n42.\n\nOn June 21, 2017, Canada submitted its objection to the participation of Professor Howse and Mr Appleton as *amici curiae*. On June 23, 2017, Resolute confirmed that it 'has no comments regarding the amicus application.'\n\n43.\n\nOn June 29, 2017, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 6 on the Participation of Professor Robert Howse and Mr Barry Appleton as *amici curiae*, rejecting their joint application.\n\n44.\n\nOn July 12, 2017, the Disputing Parties filed their comments on the Article 1128 Submissions of the Non-Disputing NAFTA Parties.\n\n45.\n\nA pre-hearing conference was held amongst the Disputing Parties and the Presiding Arbitrator on July 19, 2017.\n\n46.\n\nPursuant to paragraph 22.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, on July 21, 2017, the Tribunal provided a number of questions in writing for the Disputing Parties to address in their oral submissions during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.\n\n47.\n\nAt the instruction of the Tribunal and having consulted with the Disputing Parties, the PCA issued a Press Release on August 1, 2017 with information for the public live-streaming of the forthcoming Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.\n\n48.\n\nThe Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility was held at the Arbitration Place in Toronto, Canada on August 15 and 16, 2017.

With the agreement of the Disputing Parties, the Tribunal decided that no post-hearing briefs were necessary.\n\n**III. THE UNCONTESTED FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimant is a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, United States of America. It was created in 2007 following the merger of two forest product companies, Abitibi-Consolidated Inc and Bowater Inc.5 The Claimant describes itself as 'an integrated forest products company that manufactures and markets a diverse range of wood and paper products, including a product known as supercalendered paper, or 'SC paper'.'6\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 21; Respondent's Statement of Defence, para 20.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 22.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimant's Canadian subsidiary, Resolute FP Canada, owns three SC paper mills located in Canada: the Dolbeau and K\u00e9nogami mills located in Qu\u00e9bec and the 'now-defunct' Laurentide mill, also located in Qu\u00e9bec.7\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 23.\n\n52.\n\nThe Port Hawkesbury mill, located in Nova Scotia, also produces SC paper and competes with Resolute in the North American SC paper market. In 2007, a US company, NewPage Corporation ('**NPC**') acquired the Port Hawkesbury mill which was then operated by its wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary NewPage Port Hawkesbury ('**NPPH**').8 However, following losses of C$4 million per month, NPPH announced that it was shutting down the mill in August 2011.9\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 12; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 27.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 25. Respondent's Memorial, para 13.\n\n53.\n\nOn September 6, 2011, NPPH sought creditor protection under the *Companies' Creditor Arrangement Act* ('**CCAA**'), pursuant to which the Port Hawkesbury mill would be sold as part of a court supervised sale process.10 The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia appointed Ernst & Young (the '**Monitor**') to 'monitor the business and financial affairs of NPPH during the CCAA proceedings' and the sales process of NPPH.11\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 27; Respondent's Memorial, paras 12-14.\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 27; Respondent's Memorial, para 14.\n\n54.\n\nDuring the time that NPPH was seeking creditor protection, Nova Scotia implemented measures so as 'to support the sale of the Port Hawkesbury mill in a way that would improve the chances it would be purchased as a going concern, which would result in continued employment for workers in the Cape Breton region, rather than the mill be dismantled for scrap.'12 Two measures are relevant to this period.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, para 39; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 29.\n\n55.\n\nFirst, Nova Scotia agreed with NPPH to create a '$14-million Forestry Infrastructure Fund' pursuant to which 'NPPH would serve as an intermediary between [Nova Scotia] and the approximately 350 independent contractors who would provide forestry services' as part of Nova Scotia's forest management activities and forestry strategy.13 Nova Scotia provided an 'additional $12 million in funding to the FIF' on March 16, 2012.14\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, para 41; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 37.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, para 42; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 37.\n\n56.\n\nSecond, Nova Scotia provided up to C$5 million in funding for the Port Hawkesbury mill to remain in 'hot idle' so that it could be sold as a going concern once NPPH's cash ran out and it was no longer able to maintain the Port Hawkesbury mill in 'hot idle' on its own.15 At the same time that Nova Scotia announced the additional funding to the FIF, Nova Scotia also announced a further C$5.8 million in hot idle funding for the Port Hawkesbury mill.16\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, paras 44-46; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, paras 33, 37.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, para 47; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 37.\n\n57.\n\nThe Monitor published public notices of the sales process and directly contacted 110 parties who might be interested in acquiring the Port Hawkesbury mill, including the Claimant.17 Four bidders submitted final offers in December 2011, two intended to acquire the Port Hawkesbury mill as a going concern with the other two proposing liquidation.18 Ultimately, the Monitor recommended, and NPPH accepted, a bid from Pacific West Commercial Corporation ('**PWCC**') for the acquisition of the Port Hawkesbury mill.19\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 30;

Respondent's Memorial, paras 15-16.\n\n58.\n\nOn July 6, 2012, PWCC and NPPH entered into the Plan Sponsorship Agreement (the '**Plan**') pursuant to which 'PWCC would act as the sponsor of a plan of compromise and arrangement for NPPH under the CCAA' and acquire Port Hawkesbury for C$33 million.20 An amended and restated version of the Plan was sanctioned by the Court following creditor approval on September 25, 2012.21\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 17; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 43.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 17; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 43.\n\n59.\n\nThe sale to PWCC was conditional on 'certain support [being] provided by Nova Scotia.'22 The Respondent observes that these conditions 'are a matter of public record' and notes the following:\n\nAmong these conditions was the requirement for PWCC to have entered into certain agreements with Nova Scotia, including a Sustainable Forest Management and Outreach Program Agreement in respect of achieving sustainable harvest and forest land practices in woodlands in Nova Scotia, a Forest Utilization License Agreement in respect of access to fibre on Crown Lands, a Letter of Offer Agreement in connection with the provision of certain financial assistance by Nova Scotia to PWCC and a Real Property Agreement with respect to the purchase and sale of certain real property owned by NPPH.\n\nPWCC also conditioned the implementation of the restructuring and sale transaction on the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board (the \"UARB\" or \"Board\") approving a Load Retention Tariff (\"LRT\") Pricing Mechanism governing the mill's electricity rates, which was the subject of a private agreement between PWCC and the mill's privately-owned electricity supplier, Nova Scotia Power Inc (\"NSPI\").23\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 18; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 32.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 19-20; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, paras 31-42.\n\n60.\n\nOnce the conditions were met, the sale between NPPH and PWCC was completed on September 28, 2012.24\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 17; Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 43.\n\n61.\n\nFollowing the Court's approval for the sale of the Port Hawkesbury mill to PWCC, the United States Trade Representative ('**USTR**') investigated the support provided by Nova Scotia to the Port Hawkesbury mill.25 In late 2012, the Government of Canada responded to questions regarding Nova Scotia's support for the Port Hawkesbury mill from the USTR and the United States raised during a meeting of the WTO Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures on October 23, 2012.26\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, paras 56-57;

RELIEF SOUGHT**\n---------------------\n\n63.\n\nIn its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, the Claimant has sought the following relief:\n\ni. Damages exceeding US$70 million or such other amount to be proven in these proceedings in compensation for the direct losses caused by the measures of Canada and Nova Scotia that are inconsistent with Canada's obligations under Section A of NAFTA Chapter Eleven;\n\nii. Additional consequential damages arising as a result of the illegal measures, in an amount to be proven in these proceedings;\n\niii. the full costs associated with these proceedings, including all professional fees and disbursements, as well as the fees of the arbitral tribunal and any administering institution;\n\niv. pre- and post-award interest at a rate to be fixed by the Tribunal; and\n\nv. such further relief as counsel may advise and the Tribunal may deem just and appropriate.29\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 121.\n\n64.\n\nWithin the jurisdictional phase, the Claimant has requested the Tribunal to 'issue a Partial Award commencing the Merits and Quantum Phases of this arbitration' and order Canada 'to pay Resolute's costs and legal fees for this phase.'30 It submits that the 'Tribunal should confirm that it does have jurisdiction over Resolute's claims and that the claims are admissible' and therefore the Tribunal 'should convene the Parties and move on to the next phase of this arbitration to determine liability and damages.'31\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 217.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para 147.\n\n65.\n\nIn its Statement of Defence, the Respondent has requested the Tribunal to (a) dismiss the Claimant's claims in their entirety; (b) require the Claimant to bear all costs of the arbitration, including legal costs and Tribunal costs; and (c) grant any other relief it deems appropriate.32\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, para 106.\n\n66.\n\nWithin the jurisdictional phase, the Respondent requests this Tribunal to issue an award:\n\ni. dismissing the Claimant's Nova Scotia Claims under Articles 1102, 1105 and 1110 in their entirety and with prejudice on grounds of lack of jurisdiction;\n\nii. dismissing the Claimant's Nova Scotia Claims under Article 1102 in their entirety and with prejudice on grounds of admissibility;\n\niii. ordering the Claimant to bear the costs of this preliminary phase of the arbitration in full and to indemnify Canada for its legal fees and costs in the preliminary phase of this arbitration; and\n\niv. granting any further relief it deems just and appropriate under the circumstances.33\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 141. See also Reply on Jurisdiction, para 171.\n\n**V. THE ARGUMENTS OF THE DISPUTING PARTIES**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. BURDEN OF PROOF**\n----------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Disputing Parties have competing views as to who bears the burden of proof, in particular in respect of the Time-Bar Objection. Some of their arguments touch upon the proof of jurisdictional and admissibility requirements more broadly. The Respondent considers time-bar to go to this Tribunal's jurisdiction and that the burden of proof falls on the Claimant. However, the Claimant considers time-bar to be an issue of admissibility, not jurisdiction, and thus, it argues, the burden of proof falls on the Respondent. The Non-Disputing NAFTA Parties both support the Respondent's position that the question of time-bar goes to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and is for the Claimant to prove.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant 'bears the burden of proving that the respondent has consented to arbitration and that the tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute' since it is the one bringing the claim under NAFTA.34 The Respondent argues that a NAFTA Party's consent to arbitrate under Article 1122 is only engaged when certain requirements are met 'by a claimant.'35 The Respondent refers to numerous NAFTA cases, such as *Bayview, Grand River* and *Gallo* as authority for the proposition that 'it is for the claimant to establish that its claims fall within NAFTA Chapter Eleven and the tribunal's jurisdiction.'36 By reference to the decisions in *Methanex* and *Feldman*, the Respondent submits that Article 1122(1) establishes the time bar provisions of Article 1116 and 1117 of NAFTA as jurisdictional hurdles, not matters affecting the admissibility of the claim, since the time bar concerns the NAFTA Parties' advance consent to arbitrate.37\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 10.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 11, referring to *Methanex Corporation v United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award (Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and Liability), August 7, 2002, para 120 (**CL-001**) and (**RL-018**) ('***Methanex*****, Partial Award**').\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 13.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 155:11-157:20; see also 162:12-165:11.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent also considers the Claimant to have 'overstat[ed] the extent to which its allegations are to be accepted as true *pro tem* for the purposes of this jurisdictional phase' and submits that the Claimant is nonetheless required to prove the existence of facts on which it relies in the jurisdictional phase.38 The Respondent refers this Tribunal to a number of NAFTA and other investor-state cases where, it says, 'the principle that a claimant bears the burden of proving all facts necessary to establish a tribunal's jurisdiction is [...] well established.'39 In particular, it cites the following paragraph from the Interim Award in *Spence International Investments v Costa Rica* :\n\nIt is for a party advancing a proposition to adduce evidence in support of its case. This applies to questions of jurisdiction as it applies to the merits of a claim, notably insofar as it applies to the factual basis of an assertion of jurisdiction that must be proved as part-and-parcel of a claimant's case. The burden is therefore on the Claimants to prove the facts necessary to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction.40\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 12.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 14.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 14, citing *Spence International Investments, LLC, Berkowitz, et al. v Republic of Costa Rica*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, October 25, 2016, para 239 (**RL-028**) ('***Spence*****, Interim Award**').\n\n70.\n\nThe *Spence* tribunal went on to explain that only once a claimant proffers that proof does the burden shift to a respondent to show why the tribunal lacks jurisdiction.41 The Respondent notes that this rule 'makes perfect sense' in the context of this case where it would be unfair, for example, to put the burden on the Respondent to disprove the Claimant's state of knowledge, a matter on which the Claimant would have more extensive evidence.42\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 15, referring to *Spence*, Interim Award, para 239.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 17.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimant 'misinterprets' Article 24(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in order to attempt to shift the burden of proof onto the Respondent.43 Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\nEach party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defence.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 18.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this provision should be understood as referring only to the burden applicable to 'affirmative defences' raised by the Respondent and does not absolve the Claimant of its obligation to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction.44 The Respondent submits that the *Pope & Talbot* decision incorrectly determined that jurisdictional objections constitute an 'affirmative defence' and has since been 'overtaken by the more recent decisions in *Methanex*, *Apotex*, *Bayview*, *Grand River* and *Gallo*.'45\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 19, referring to D Caron & L Caplan, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary* (2nd ed, OUP 2012), 558 (**RL-078**).\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 20.\n\n**3. The Claimant's Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimant accepts that it bears the burden of proof in respect of establishing this Tribunal's jurisdiction.46 The Claimant considers itself to have satisfied this burden in respect of the relevant jurisdictional elements, i.e., that Resolute is an American company doing business in Canada and had an investment in Canada at the relevant time that the impugned measures were adopted.47 However, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's time-bar objection does not affect the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, only the admissibility of the claim; consequently, the Claimant maintains that it is the Respondent which bears the burden of proof in respect of the time-bar.48\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 12.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 13.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 15.\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimant notes that there have been 'complementary theories' as to whether the time-bar objection is 'a defence against asserted claims' or 'pertain[s] to the admissibility of claims', but either theory is unrelated to the Respondent's consent to arbitration or the Tribunal's authority and so the burden falls on the moving party, in this case, the Respondent.49 The Claimant cites the *Pope & Talbot* decision which considered Canada's timeliness objection in that case to be 'in the nature of an affirmative defence'; therefore the burden fell on Canada.50\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 17.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 18-19 referring to *Pope & Talbot Inc v Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award by Arbitral Tribunal in relation to Preliminary Motion by Government of Canada to Strike Paragraphs 34 and 103 of the Statement of Claim from the Record, February 24, 2000, paras 11-12 (**CL-002**); see also Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 24, referring to Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 20.\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimant refers to the decision in *Feldman* as well as scholarly writings and domestic court decisions from the United States and Canada in support of the proposition that a time-bar objection does not relate to the tribunal's jurisdiction.51 The Claimant submits that the only NAFTA case on point is *Pope & Talbot* where 'that tribunal recognized the time bar as an affirmative defence, and as an affirmative defence, it carries with it a different consequence.'52 By comparison, the Claimant considers the Respondent's reliance on *Methanex*, *Apotex*, *Bayview*, and *Grand River* to be misconceived since none of those cases considered the question of whether a timeliness objection goes to jurisdiction or admissibility.53 The Claimant also cautions this Tribunal from relying on the decision in *Spence v Costa Rica* since that case was under the DR-CAFTA 'whose terms are notoriously different from NAFTA's' and whose tribunal itself 'caution[ed] any reading of this Award that would give it wider \"precedential\" effects.'54 In fact, other non-NAFTA decisions, including *Tecmed* have similarly determined that time limitation objections are not related to the tribunal's jurisdiction but should be considered as admissibility objections.55\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 20-23; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 293:10-297:6.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 297:7-15\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 25-28; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 297:16-300:8.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 29, citing *Spence*, Interim Award, para 166 (**RL-028**); Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 303:5-23.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 31, referring to *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v The United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, May 29, 2003 (**CL-038**) ('***Tecmed*****, Award**').\n\n76.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant considers sufficient proof to have been provided that it has brought its claims within time. Specifically, the Claimant points to the fact that the Respondent's case, at its highest, 'speculates that Resolute should have anticipated losses that Canada claims were incurred in a price drop in January 2013. '56\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 33.\n\n**4. The Non-Disputing NAFTA Parties' Comments**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe United States submits that a NAFTA Party's consent to arbitrate is 'limited by the procedural conditions set out in Chapter Eleven' including, *inter alia*, the requirements of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).57 The time-bar imposed by these Articles, it says, 'impose a *ratione temporis* jurisdictional limitation on the authority of a tribunal to act on the merits of the dispute.'58 It submits that 'NAFTA Parties consistently raise, and tribunals generally address, the time bar defence as a jurisdictional objection' and cites *Glamis Gold*, *Apotex I & II* and *Spence International Investments v Costa Rica* as examples of such a consistent approach.59\n\nSubmission of the United States, para 2.\n\nSubmission of the United States, para 3.\n\nSubmission of the United States, para 4, citing *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised), May 31, 2005 ('***Glamis Gold*****, PO2**'); *Apotex Inc. v United States of America*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/10/2, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, June 14, 2013 (**RL-023**) ('***Apotex*****, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility**'); and *Spence*, Interim Award.\n\n78.\n\nMexico expresses its agreement with the Respondent that the Claimant 'bears the burden of proving that the respondent has consented to arbitration and that the tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute.'60 Mexico also recalls the decisions in *Methanex*, *Apotex*, *Spence International Investments v Costa Rica* and *Emmis International Holding v Hungary* as cases where the respective tribunals each found that the claimant bears the burden of proof in respect of the tribunal's jurisdiction, with the *Methanex* and *Spence* tribunals specifically noting that time-bar provisions (under NAFTA and DR-CAFTA, respectively) go to the jurisdiction of the tribunal.61\n\nSubmission of Mexico, para 2, citing Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 10.\n\nSubmission of Mexico, paras 3-5, citing *Methanex*, Partial Award; *Apotex*, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, para 150; *Spence*, Interim Award; *Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., and MEM Magyar Electronic Media kereskedelmi \u00e9sSzolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. v Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Award, April 16, 2014 ('***Emmis*****, Award**').\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Article 1128 submissions of Mexico and the United States should be given 'considerable weight' when the NAFTA Parties 'express concordant, common and consistent views on how to interpret NAFTA, they create subsequent agreement and practice within the meaning of Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention'.62 The Respondent points out that both the United States and Mexico support its position that the time bar is in the nature of a jurisdictional objection for which the Claimant bears the burden of proof.63\n\nReply of the Government of Canada to the NAFTA Article 1128 Submissions of the Governments of the United States and the United Mexican States, July 12, 2017 ('**Canada's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions**'), paras 6-8; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 165:12-167:9.\n\nCanada's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, paras 15-25.\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimant prefaces its comments on the Article 1128 submissions by observing that all the NAFTA Parties 'can be expected to express similar interpretations of NAFTA because all are cast as respondents in Chapter Eleven proceedings, and all would prefer to limit the occasions when they have to defend their respective governments against foreign investor claims.'64 The Claimant acknowledged during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility that the interpretation of NAFTA by the NAFTA Parties through their Article 1128 submissions 'must be valued by the tribunal for its persuasive authority.'65 The Claimant did, however, note that just as the Tribunal has been asked to take into account the agreement of the NAFTA Parties as to the interpretation of the treaty, the Tribunal should also pay serious attention to areas where the NAFTA Parties disagree with one another.66\n\nComments on the Article 1128 Submissions of Mexico and the United States, July 12, 2017 ('**Claimant's Reply to Article 1128 Submissions**'), para 1.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 306:4-12.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 306:16-307:1.\n\n81.\n\nWith respect to the burden of proof, the Claimant reiterates its view that the time bar goes to admissibility and that Canada bears the burden. The Claimant argues that the United States' submission in this respect fails to distinguish between admissibility and jurisdiction, and that the United States incorrectly characterizes *Pope & Talbot* as wrongly decided.67\n\nClaimant's Reply to Article 1128 Submissions, paras 6-15.\n\n**5. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nSection B of Chapter Eleven of NAFTA deals with settlement of disputes between investors and States Parties. Its central provision, jurisdictionally speaking, is section 1122 ('Consent to Arbitration'), paragraph 1 of which reads:\n\nEach Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement.\n\n83.\n\nThe clear inference is that arbitration of a claim not submitted in accordance with those procedures is not consented to and that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction. Although the time limit specified in Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) is not itself a procedure, compliance with it is required for the bringing of a claim, which is certainly a procedure. This is enough to justify the conclusion that compliance with the time limit goes to jurisdiction.\n\n84.\n\nEven if it did not, and was to be classified (as time limits in other contexts are often classified) as a matter of admissibility, it would not necessarily follow that the onus of proof in that regard was on the respondent party. Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which are applicable here by virtue of Article 1120(1) of NAFTA, imposes on the relevant party 'the burden of proving the facts relied on to support [its] claim or defence'. The Tribunal does not see any reason to limit Article 24(1) to matters of substance, and the facts necessary to establish that a claim has been brought in accordance with Section B of Chapter Eleven are, in its view, facts relied on in support of the claim.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the *Pope & Talbot* dictum that time bar objections under NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) constitute an 'affirmative defence'. The language of NAFTA treats the 3-year time limit as one among a number of requirements that a claimant under Chapter Eleven has to meet to attract jurisdiction over a claim. The Tribunal agrees with later tribunals, and with the United States and Mexico in their Article 1128 submissions, that the claimant has to establish its case on this and other points.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal would however add that too much importance should not be attached to the onus of proof in international arbitration. In the end, the question is whether one or the other party has done enough to persuade the tribunal of its case. It is relevant that the fact in question is one which is peculiarly within the knowledge of one or the other party.\n\n**B. THE TIME-BAR OBJECTION**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n87.\n\nTurning to the substance of the time-bar objection, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's claims relating to the Nova Scotia Measures are time-barred under NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2). NAFTA Article 1116(2) provides:\n\nAn investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.\n\n88.\n\nNAFTA Article 1117(2) is couched in similar terms:\n\nAn investor may not make a claim on behalf of an enterprise described in paragraph 1 if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage.\n\n89.\n\nIt is common ground between the Disputing Parties that the present dispute was submitted to arbitration on December 30, 2015, making December 30, 2012 the critical date for present purposes. The Respondent contends that the Claimant knew or could not have been unaware of the enactment of the Nova Scotia Measures which constitute the alleged NAFTA breach in this case, and that the Claimant had incurred loss or damage prior to that critical date of December 30, 2012. As such, the Claimant's case relating to the Nova Scotia Measures is, in the Respondent's submission, time-barred.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimant, on the other hand, argues that it did not and could not know of its loss or damage as a result of the Nova Scotia Measures before the first quarter of 2013. Therefore, the Claimant submits that it referred this dispute to arbitration in a timely manner.\n\n91.\n\nAs the Tribunal noted in its Decision on Bifurcation, 'if successful, the time bar objection could dispose of all claims relating to the Nova Scotia Measures.'68\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, Decision on Bifurcation, November 18, 2016, para 4.10.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's claims related to the Nova Scotia Measures are time-barred in their entirety on the basis that the Claimant knew or ought to have known of its damage or loss more than three years before the submission of its claim to arbitration, i.e., before December 30, 2012. The Respondent raises five arguments in relation to this submission. First, the Claimant alleges that Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) impose a strict time limit on the initiation of arbitration under NAFTA. Second, the time limits are triggered once the Claimant has either actual or constructive knowledge of loss or damage. Third, the Claimant does not need to know the full extent of its loss or damage to trigger the time-bar period. Fourth, the Claimant in this case did in fact have knowledge of the alleged NAFTA breaches and its loss or damage prior to December 30, 2012. Fifth, the Claimant's reliance on a 'continuing' breach so as to renew the limitation period is misconceived in law and fact.\n\n**(a) Rigidity of the time limit established by Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Respondent submits that NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) 'impose a strict three-year time limit for a claimant to submit a claim to arbitration in its own behalf or on behalf of an enterprise that it owns or controls.'69\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 25.\n\n94.\n\nIn the Respondent's submission, the rigidity of the time limit established by the text of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) is 'not subject to any suspension [...], prolongation or other qualification.'70\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 26 citing *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, December 16, 2002, para 63 (**RL-021**) ('***Feldman*****, Award**').\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent submits that compliance with the time limits set out in these provisions is a precondition to a NAFTA Party's consent to arbitration. In this respect, the Respondent relies on NAFTA Article 1122(1) which provides that each NAFTA Party 'consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in [NAFTA].'71\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 23 citing *Methanex*, Partial Award, para 120.\n\n96.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent submits that initiation of this arbitration after the three-year time limit specified by Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) means that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*72 The Respondent points to the awards in *Grand River*,73*Apotex*74 and *Bilcon*75 as instances where tribunals have dismissed claims following a strict application of the three year time limit.76\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 28.\n\n*Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd v United States, of America*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, July 20, 2006 (**RL-022**) ('***Grand River*****, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction**').\n\n*Apotex*, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.\n\n*William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc v Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, March 17, 2015 (**RL-025**) ('***Bilcon*****, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability'**).\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 29-31; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 153:24154:3.\n\n**(b) Conditions for triggering the time limits under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the plain words of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) establish two possible points in time from which the time limit may commence running: (1) the moment when an investor or enterprise 'first acquired' knowledge of the alleged breach and loss, or (2) the moment when an investor or enterprise 'should have first acquired' knowledge of the alleged breach and loss.77 Thus either actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged breach and loss would be sufficient to trigger the time limit.78\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 32; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 153:4-11.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 32; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 153:12-23.\n\n98.\n\nBy reference to the decision in *Grand River*, the Respondent argues that Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) require investors to exercise a measure of 'reasonable care' and 'diligence', thereby preventing a claimant from 'feign[ing] ignorance of facts it should reasonably have been aware of had it conducted appropriate due diligence' so as to circumvent the time limitation established under the NAFTA.79\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 34, 36 citing *Grand River*, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras 4473.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent refers this Tribunal to a series of NAFTA decisions in *Grand River*, *Mondev*, and *Bilcon*, as well as the Canada-Venezuela BIT decision in *Rusoro Mining v Venezuela*, in support of the proposition that Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) do not require a claimant to know the full extent of the damage or loss. Rather, the time limit begins to run from the time the claimant knew or ought to have known that some loss or damage to it has been caused.80\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 42 citing *Rusoro Mining Limited v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award, August 22, 2016 (**RL-030**).\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondent considers the *Mondev* tribunal to have been unequivocal when it stated that 'a claimant may know that it has suffered loss or damage even if the extent of quantification of the loss or damage is still unclear.'81 Such a position is necessary because, as the *Bilcon* tribunal explained, requiring knowledge of the full extent of damage or loss 'might prolong greatly the inception of the three-year period and add a whole new dimension of uncertainty to the time-limit issue.'82\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 38 citing *Mondev International Ltd v United States, of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, October 11, 2002, para 87 (**RL-029**) ('***Mondev*****, Award**'); Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 173:4-14.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 39 citing *Bilcon*, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, para 275.\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent considers the Claimant's interpretation of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2), which would require the loss or damage to be sufficiently precise before the claimant could know of it, to be incorrect since it would 'allow claimants to ignore the fact that they have already incurred a loss or damage simply because the amount of that loss or damage will not be measured and reported to the claimants' investors and the public until the end of the relevant financial reporting period.'83 This, the Respondent submits, is 'directly contrary to the ordinary meaning of \"incurred\"' which was considered in *Grand River* and where that tribunal found:\n\nA party is said to incur losses, debts, expenses or obligations, all of which may significantly damage the party's interests, even if there is no immediate outlay of funds or if the obligations are to be met through future conduct. Moreover, damage or injury may be incurred even though the amount or extent may not become known until some future time.84\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 97.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 97, citing *Grand River*, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, para 77.\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondent submits that non-NAFTA tribunals arrived at a similar interpretation of time-bar provisions in Rusoro Mining v Venezuela, Corona Materials v Dominican Republic, Spence International Investments v Costa Rica, and Ansung Housing v China.85 The Respondent contends that the only case cited against it on this point, Pope & Talbot, was incorrectly decided and inconsistent with the NAFTA and non-NAFTA cases to which it has referred.86\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 98-101.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 103.\n\n**(c) When did the Claimant first acquire (or should have first acquired) knowledge of its loss or damage?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent explains that since this arbitration was submitted on December 30, 2015, the 'critical date' is December 30, 2012.87 If the Claimant had actual or constructive knowledge of its loss or damage prior to December 30, 2012, then the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis*.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 43.\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent considers it uncontested that the Nova Scotia Measures were all adopted between September 2011 and September 2012, that is, before the 'critical date' of December 30, 2012.88 The Claimant has not denied that it knew of the implementation of the Nova Scotia Measures at the time and, in any event, could not have been unaware of them given that they were a 'matter of public record' and 'the subject of numerous news releases issued by Nova Scotia, [...] court filings in the CCAA' and legislative debate in Nova Scotia.'89 Additionally, the Respondent alleges that 'the Claimant publicly acknowledged the adoption of the Nova Scotia Measures in November 2012,' during an Earnings Conference Call.90\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 45.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 49.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 49, referring to CQ Transcriptions, transcript, 'Q3 2012 Resolute Forest Products Inc. Earnings Conference Call - Final' (November 2, 2012), 9 (**R-096**).\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant, with the knowledge of the Nova Scotia Measures by November 2012 at the latest, must have known or could not have been unaware of its loss or damage on the basis of 'an abundance of market data and analysis available prior to December 30, 2012, which confirmed the impact on Resolute's market share and SC paper prices.'91 Since the 'damage to the Claimant's competitive position is [...] the only loss or damage that the Claimant attributes directly to the Nova Scotia measures', it 'should have known about this alleged competitive disadvantage on September 28, 2012, when the last of the measures were adopted and the sale of the Port Hawkesbury mill to Pacific West closed.'92\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 52.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 220:21-221:10.\n\n106.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent refers to press reports and industry analysis in October 2012 regarding the capacity of the newly re-opened Port Hawkesbury mill and the effect it would have on market share and prices.93 For example, one report in November 2012 assessed that 'Resolute's market share would fall from 20.1 per cent at the end of 2011 to 13.5 per cent at the end of 2012.'94 Similarly, market data and reports were noting a fall in SC paper prices as a result of the increased capacity due to the reopening of the Port Hawkesbury mill.95\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 63-64.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 64, referring to Verle Sutton, *Reel Time*, Special Edition (November 8, 2012), 7 (**R-102**).\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 65-67.\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent additionally submits that it is 'not credible' for the Claimant to argue that it was unaware of its loss or damage until the First Quarter of 2013 since 'prices for shipments of SC paper are contracted at least a month in advance.'96 The Respondent points out that the Claimant's expert, Professor Hausman, accepts that it is industry practice to contract at least a month in advance97 and considers it conclusive that the Claimant has not led any evidence to contradict either the Respondent's submission or Professor Hausman's testimony on this point.98 The Respondent refers to the findings of the US ITC that 'lead times between order and delivery dates range from 35 to 45 days for US producers and 28 to 45 days for US importers,' which took into account Resolute's firm-specific lead times that have not been put into evidence by the Claimant before this Tribunal.99 The Respondent, therefore, concludes that the Claimant must have known 'in November or December 2012 what its January 2013 prices were going to be.'100 The Respondent submits that this was widely reported in industry publications and data at the time and acknowledged simultaneously by Resolute's competitors.101 The Respondent notes that even though the Claimant criticizes these market data and forecasts as 'speculation and prognostication,' the Respondent considers that 'they were accurate' and 'the Claimant has not cited a single divergent opinion from the industry publications at that time.'102\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 66, 68; Respondent's Reply Memorial, paras 69-70.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 71, referring to Hausman Statement, para 7 and fn. 29.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 72.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 70, 72; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 229:16-230:14.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 72.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 74-91; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 197:13-18.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 233:5-11.\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent also points to five instances where, it alleges, the Claimant acknowledged that it had incurred loss or damage starting in 2012. The Respondent submits that any one of these five facts alone would 'be sufficient to establish Resolute's knowledge of the alleged loss or damage before the critical date.'103 First, the Respondent refers to a draft notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration under NAFTA Chapter Eleven presented to it on February 24, 2015 (the '**Draft NOI**') which alleged that 'Resolute's market share for all SC Paper has declined from 2012 to 2014' as a result of the Nova Scotia Measures.104 The Respondent asks this Tribunal to disregard the Claimant's description of this document as a 'non-paper' and 'rough internal draft' and instead characterises the Notice as 'a carefully crafted document which the Claimant's President and CEO, Mr Richard Garneau, presented to Canada's Minister of International Trade during an inperson meeting in order to threaten legal action against Canada.'105\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 198:20-23.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 54, referring to Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration Under Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement (February 24, 2015), para 19 (**R-081**); Respondent's Reply Memorial, paras 26, 30.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 55; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 223:15224:16.\n\n109.\n\nThe Respondent also considers the Claimant's allegation that it has 'misread' the Draft NOI as 'hollow'.106 Contrary to the Claimant's allegation, the meaning of the word 'from' used in the Draft NOI can only be understood as 'starting in', therefore revealing a decline in market share 'starting in' 2012, not merely noting a drop in market share in 2014 vis-\u00e0-vis market share held in 2012.107 The Respondent also considers the Draft NOI to have 'significant probative value' given the time at which it was prepared and submitted to the Canadian government.108\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 31.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 31; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 196:8197:12.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 32-33.\n\n110.\n\nSecond, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant did not have to wait until the reopening of the Port Hawkesbury mill in September 2012 to know of its loss or damage. The Respondent refers to a transcript of a conference call relating to Resolute's 2012 second quarter results and Mr Garneau's comment that the restart of the Port Hawkesbury mill would 'certainly have an impact on the market' and it would be 'impossible not to have an impact on the market.'109\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 56, referring to Resolute Forest Products Inc., Form 8-K (August 1, 2012), Exhibit 99.2: Transcript of Earnings Conference Call Held on August 1, 2012, p. 10 (**R-097**); Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 26.\n\n111.\n\nThird, the Respondent points to the Claimant's decision to shut down a paper machine at its Laurentide mill in November 2012 based on both a drop in demand and increase in market capacity elsewhere as evidence that the Claimant knew of the impact of the Port Hawkesbury mill's restart.110 The Respondent alleges that references by senior management of the Claimant to 'increased market capacity' could only refer to the re-opening of the Port Hawkesbury mill since: (a) the only other increase in capacity at the relevant time was from another Resolute mill in August 2012; and (b) a public statement by Mr Pierre Choquette (a spokesman for the Claimant) directly referred to the restart of a competitor mill in Nova Scotia.111\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 58-61.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 60, referring to Radio-Canada, 'Shawinigan: 111 emplois perdus \u00e0 l'usine Laurentide' (November 6, 2012) (**R-101**);

Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 197:19-198:8, 236:25-238:25.\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's allegation that Line #10 at the Laurentide mill closed down due to the reopening of the Dolbeau mill 'contradicts its earlier contemporaneous public statements'112 as well as the public record.113 In the Respondent's view, this contradiction and the lack of corroborating evidence 'destroys the credibility of a claimant's assertions'.114\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 34.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 43.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 44.\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it would be irrelevant if the Claimant could establish other reasons for the closure of Line #10 since it has already cited 'the reopening of Port Hawkesbury as one of its main reasons.'115 The Respondent considers irrelevant the Claimant's suggestion that there was uncertainty about the reopening of Port Hawkesbury since Line #10 was not closed until November 6, 2012, over a month after Port Hawkesbury was reopened in September 2012.116 The Respondent points to a number of public statements throughout 2011 and 2012 where the Claimant expressed uncertainty about the reopening of Dolbeau and the effect that might have on its other operations; it submits that as late as August 2012, when the Dolbeau mill was finally reopened, Mr Garneau made public statements in reassurance that the reopening of Dolbeau would not affect the Laurentide mill.117\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 45.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 46.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 48-60.\n\n114.\n\nFourth, the Respondent also points to public statements surrounding the temporary shutdown of Line #11 at the Laurentide mill on December 19, 2012, one month after the permanent shutdown of Line #10, which 'explicitly cited the reopening of the Port Hawkesbury mill as one of the reasons for this decision.'118\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 41, referring to Guy Veillette, 'Un march\u00e9 difficile, r\u00e9p\u00e8te Produits forestiers R\u00e9solu', *Le Nouvelliste*, December 19, 2012 (**R-120**); Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 239:1-15.\n\n115.\n\nBy contrast to the publicly available evidence relied on above, the Respondent considers the Claimant to have 'failed to provide any direct or credible response in its Counter-Memorial to refute its past admissions' and finds it 'remarkabl[e]' that the Claimant has not presented a witness of fact 'who is willing and able to attest to what it actually knew during the relevant period.'119 The Respondent submits that these uncontested contemporaneous statements from Resolute 'demonstrat[e] that Resolute actually knew that the reopening of Port Hawkesbury had caused it the loss or damage that it claims in this arbitration' and the statements therefore have great probative value.120\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 27-28; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 20:22-22:13.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 199:1-6, August 16, 2017, 422:18-423:17.\n\n116.\n\nBy comparison, the Respondent submits that Professor Hausman's report has 'no probative value' since: (a) he conceded during cross-examination 'that he has no experience working in sales or marketing of supercalendered paper' and so 'can't offer an opinion on what a reasonable producer should have known and when based on specialized industry knowledge or expertise'; (b) the report is not based on interviews with Resolute's employees or managers about their actual knowledge; (c) the report 'relies on a limited amount of data which was curated by Resolute'; (d) his regression analysis used a market price index instead of prices from Resolute or, more specifically, Laurentide; and (e) he considered the weighted average price of three Resolute mills combined, rather than the Laurentide mill in isolation.121\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 204:21-207:14.\n\n117.\n\nFifth, the Respondent considers the Claimant to have selectively cited statements of PHP during an Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Investigation pursued by the US International Trade Commission and says the Claimant has taken those statements out of context.122 For example, the Claimant is alleged to have omitted the fact that the US ITC did not accept PHP's submission that it was 'impossible for PHP to cause any injury in 2012. '123 Similarly, the Claimant is said to have omitted PHP's testimony that it had customers 'willing and able to start business with us shortly after we restarted' leading to a production in 2012 of 72,000 metric tonnes.124 This amounted to '20 per cent of the Port Hawkesbury mill's total annual production capacity [...] and [...] as much as the average quarterly production capacity and actual sales tonnage of Resolute's Laurentide and Dolbeau mills combined.'125\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 61.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 62, referring to *In Re Supercalendered Paper from Canada*, Inv. No. 701-TA-530, Final Determination Commission Opinion, p. 25 (**C-054**).\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 64, citing October US ITC Transcript p. 240:14-24 (**C-052**).\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 64-66.\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent concludes on the basis of the above that the Claimant was not, and could not have been, unaware that 'a loss or damage in the form of decreased market share, lower prices and a competitive disadvantage' would be incurred as soon as the Port Hawkesbury mill reopened on October 3, 2012 with the support of the Nova Scotia Measures.126 Accordingly, the time-bar clock started to run from October 3, 2012 and as such, the Claimant's submission of this arbitration on December 30, 2015 is out of time insofar as it concerns the Nova Scotia Measures.127\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 69; Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 93-94.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 70-71.\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent submits that if the Tribunal nonetheless determines that it has insufficient evidence to make a determination on this matter, the Tribunal should dismiss the claim on the basis that the Claimant has failed to meet its burden to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction.128 Alternatively, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal should join the time bar issue to the merits so as to avoid a decision at this stage that would be *res judicata*.129 Finally, the Respondent suggested that the Tribunal should order a targeted production of documents on the part of the Claimant directed at disclosing the internal state of knowledge of its senior executives.130\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 189:12-190:5; August 16, 2017, 421:12-422:3.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 422:4-11.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 190:5-191:15; August 16, 2017, 422:1-3.\n\n120.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent observes that if the Claimant succeeds on the time bar issue, that establishes a 'jurisdictional dilemma that [...] prevents the expropriation claim from proceeding' to the merits phase since:\n\nIf the substantial deprivation was unknown and unknowable until the intervening actions of Port Hawkesbury [...] then the Nova Scotia measures did not relate to the Claimant, and the expropriation was not a measure adopted or maintained by Canada. But if the substantial deprivation was known or should have been known by Nova Scotia, then Resolute also knew and so did everyone else in the market.131\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 219:5-18.\n\n**(d) Whether the Nova Scotia Measures constitute a continuing breach**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent asks the Tribunal to reject the Claimant's contention that the Nova Scotia Measures are 'ongoing measures' that constitute 'continuing violations' of NAFTA and so are not time-barred.132 The Respondent raises two arguments in this respect.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 72.\n\n122.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the notion of 'continuing breach' would disregard the plain wording of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) which provide that the time-bar starts to run once the Claimant '*first* acquired, or should have *first* acquired knowledge of the alleged breach and loss.'133 To interpret Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) otherwise would go against the consistent findings of NAFTA tribunals and the practice of the NAFTA Parties themselves.134\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 73 (emphasis in original).\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 73.\n\n123.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that a continuing breach argument is not sustainable as a matter of fact since the Nova Scotia Measures were all concluded prior to the 'critical date' of December 30, 2012.135 The Respondent draws a distinction between 'continuing acts and completed acts that continue to cause loss or damage', with the Nova Scotia Measures possibly falling into the latter category, but certainly not the former.136\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 74.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 75.\n\n**(e) The alleged breaches that took place after December 30, 2012**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's reliance on a January 2013 electricity regulation allegedly granting a C$6-8 million yearly benefit to Port Hawkesbury did not appear in its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim and was introduced in its Counter Memorial.137 The Respondent submits that the Claimant's submissions only on this topic are 'outside of the scope of claims that Resolute submitted to arbitration' and, unless the Claimant is permitted to amend its claim under Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules, should be ignored.138\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 105.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 104, 109; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 194:15-18, 208:11-210:12.\n\n125.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent submits that any claim based on the January 2013 Renewable Energy Regulations is also time-barred since any arbitration based thereon would have had to have been submitted by January 2016.139 Since this claim was omitted from the Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, it would be out of time even if the Tribunal allowed the Claimant to amend its claim.140\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 109.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 109-110.\n\n126.\n\nThe Respondent also considers it 'specious' for the Claimant to contend that its expropriation claim under Article 1110 is brought within time because the expropriation did not occur until October 2014, i.e., the date the Claimant shut down the Laurentide mill.141 It is uncontested that the Nova Scotia Measures were all adopted in 2012, therefore they could not give rise to a case of 'creeping expropriation' here since the Claimant cannot point to any conduct in 2013 or 2014 that forms the basis of an expropriation claim.142 Rather, the Claimant's current formulation of its case demonstrates that no legally significant connection exists between the Nova Scotia Measures and its investment.143\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 111-112.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 112.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 111.\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that part of the Claimant's allegedly expropriated property included its sales and market share. While the Respondent denies these are assets capable of expropriation, it submits that if the Claimant were right on this point, it must have first acquired knowledge of the alleged breach as well as its loss and damage prior to December 30, 2012 and so would also be time-barred under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).144\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 115.\n\n128.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that acceptance of the Claimant's argument regarding the date of expropriation and the consequent effect on time-bar would lead to an absurd result in NAFTA arbitration. For example, the Respondent recalls that the Claimant reserved the right to claim expropriation in the event its Dolbeau and K\u00e9nogami mills closed as a result of the Nova Scotia Measures. The Respondent argues that permitting a claimant to rely on the date it decided to close its mill up to six or more years after the impugned measures were adopted would render the time limitation under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) irrelevant.145\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 113.\n\n**3. The Claimant's Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n**(a) Conditions for triggering the time limits under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the three-year time limits established under Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) are triggered upon the Claimant having actual or constructive knowledge of both (a) a breach of NAFTA and (b) loss or damage that has been incurred as a result of such a breach.146 Contrary to the Respondent's submission, the Claimant argues that its knowledge must relate to losses or damages that have been 'incurred'; knowledge of the probability or likelihood of damages being insufficient to trigger the time limit.147 In this respect, the Claimant relies on the decision in *Pope & Talbot* where the tribunal held 'the critical requirement is that the loss has occurred and was known or should have been known by the Investor, not that it was or should have been known that loss could or would occur.'148\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 56; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 258:19-24.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 57.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 57.\n\n130.\n\nThe Claimant characterises the Respondent's argument that the time period runs even if a claimant does not know the 'full extent' of its loss or damage as an obfuscation and seeks to distinguish the *Mondev*, *Grand River* and *Bilcon* decisions relied upon by the Respondent.149 The Claimant points out that in *Mondev*, the tribunal found that the claimant knew of its damage in 1992 when it brought proceedings in US courts, this was seven years before it filed its NAFTA claim and the claimant was therefore clearly out of time.150 In *Grand River*, the statutory obligation to make payment into a 25 year escrow was sufficient to constitute 'loss or damage' under Articles 1116 and 1117 despite the fact that the payments were not yet due.151 Finally, in *Bilcon*, the tribunal determined that damages arising from the Claimant's loss of quarry operations as of May 2004 were sufficiently certain although not precisely quantified and therefore out of time since the arbitration was only commenced in June 2008. This finding was in spite of the fact that the relevant Canadian federal minister did not accept the results of the Joint Review Panel until December 2007.152 The additional non-NAFTA decisions referred to by the Respondent in its Reply Memorial are, according to the Claimant, also distinguishable since 'in each case, there was no serious dispute that the incurred damage was caused by the breaches.'153\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 58; Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 89.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 60-61.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 62; Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 57.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 63.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 90.\n\n131.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimant submits that *Pope & Talbot* is 'factually similar to the instant dispute' and therefore the more persuasive authority.154 In that case, the Canadian government unsuccessfully argued that the investor knew or should have known of its loss or damage at the time the relevant regulation was enacted, four years prior to the investor submitting the dispute to arbitration.155 A similar outcome should be reached in this case since Canada here, like in *Pope & Talbot*, 'relies upon uncertain market responses' to 'retrospective[ly] speculate' without affirmative evidence that the Claimant knew or ought to have known of its loss or damage in 2012.156\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 64.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 64.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 65-66; Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 91.\n\n**(b) When did the Claimant first acquire (or should first have acquired) knowledge of its loss or damage?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's contention that Resolute knew or could not have been unaware of the effect of the re-entry of the Port Hawkesbury mill on the market following the implementation of the Nova Scotia Measures, the Claimant submits that 'there was great uncertainty as to the immediate likely effects of Port Hawkesbury's re-entry into the market, and the statute of limitations is not triggered by probability, anticipation, fear or speculation.'157 The Claimant maintains that it did not know of any loss or damage until the first quarter of 2013 and makes six submissions in support of this contention.158\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 67.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 68.\n\n133.\n\nFirst, the uncertainty surrounding the Port Hawkesbury mill reopening, longevity and the effect of its entry into the market is critical, in the Claimant's view, in demonstrating that it could not have known of its loss or damage prior to December 30, 2012. The Claimant submits that the US ITC proceedings regarding Port Hawkesbury confirm the uncertainty surrounding the re-opening of the mill and that losses could not have been incurred before 2013. Counsel for PHP stated that: 'PHP didn't really get into the market until 2013. As such, it's impossible for PHP to cause any injury in 2012.'159 Additionally, PHP's counsel noted that upon its re-entry in the market, PHP deliberately sought to avoid disrupting the US market by exporting its product.160 Similarly, the American petitioners noted the uncertainty surrounding the re-entry of PHP in the market, the volume of sales it might make and the effect it would have on the market.161 All of this demonstrates that PHP was not 'in the market' in any significant way before 2013.'162 These statements, the Claimant says, 'are consistent with Prof. Hausman's findings that PHP did not affect the market (or cause Resolute to incur damages) in 2012.'163\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 71, referring to March 18, 2015 US ITC Transcript at 14:7-9 (**R-083**); Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 60.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 61, referring to March 19, 2015 US ITC Transcript at 14:22-15:2 (**R-083**).\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 73.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 73.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 62.\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimant acknowledges that 'after September 28, 2012 [...] PHP had reopened and would have some effect on the market, but no thoughtful or responsible observer was certain what the effect might be.'164 Accordingly, the Claimant regards as implausible the Respondent's argument that the Claimant knew or should have known of its loss or damage immediately upon the reopening of Port Hawkesbury mill.165\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 58.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 59.\n\n135.\n\nSecond, the Claimant relies on the expert report of Professor Jerry Hausman asserting that 'Resolute could not have concluded that the firm's SCP operation had been financially harmed by the reopening of the PHP mill prior to the first quarter of 2013.'166 Professor Hausman concludes that given Resolute's 2012 results 'showed no harm caused by Port Hawkesbury', 'Resolute would not have been able to determine the negative effects of PHP's reopening until at least Q2 2013. '167 The Claimant relies on its own data and Professor Hausman's analysis to show that prices and sales quantities in the fourth quarter of 2012 were not affected by Port Hawkesbury's reopening.168 However, a price decrease was observed from the first quarter of 2013 and diminution in Resolute's sales quantities after Q1 2013, although these sales volumes were 'consistent with sales in [Q1 2012].'169\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 74, citing Hausman Statement, para 14.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 74, citing Hausman Statement, para 27; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 48:9-22.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 75-77; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 259:19-260:7.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 78-79.\n\n136.\n\nThird, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to meet its evidential burden regarding the potential market effects of the reopening of the Port Hawkesbury mill and accuses the Respondent of selectively and misleadingly quoting certain statements of the Claimant's CEO.170 For example, in relation to an August 2012 conference call quoted by the Respondent, the Claimant points to other extracts in which its CEO 'pushed back against the notion that it was going to incur loss or damages' and expressed a desire to compete with Port Hawkesbury, even foreseeing 'some improvement' in Q4 2012.171 Similar confidence in Resolute's ability to compete was expressed in a November 2012 Earnings Conference Call, this portion having been omitted by the Respondent.172\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 82-83.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 84.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 85.\n\n137.\n\nFourth, the Respondent's selective reliance on various market forecasts is misplaced given that these forecasts are necessarily speculative and the forecasters in this case have acknowledged that their forecasts were incorrect.173 For example, predictions regarding a surge in imports and price fall were ultimately proved to be incorrect with PHP 'mov[ing] \"seamlessly into the market\"' instead.174 The Claimant considers these forecasts to be 'legally irrelevant' for determining when the Claimant knew or ought to have known of its loss or damage.175\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 87-88.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 88, referring to PHP Post. Conf. Br. At Attachment D (**C-044**); March 2013 *Reel Time Report,* pp. 4-5 (**C-026**).\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 89.\n\n138.\n\nFifth, the Claimant submits that the Respondent erroneously relies on its February 2015 Draft Notice of Intent to submit a claim to arbitration.176 For one thing, the Claimant notes that this document was merely a 'Draft Only' and 'Strictly Confidential' paper that was intended to 'initiate a conversation that might lead to compensation for Resolute.'177 Additionally, this document does not, as the Respondent believes, reveal that the Claimant knew of its loss or damage in 2012, but only specifies that 'Resolute's market share for all SC Paper has declined from 2012 to 2014.'178 That is to say, 'Resolute's market share for SC paper was less in 2014 than it was in 2012.'179 The Claimant rebuffs the Respondent's assertion that the word 'from' in the draft NOI must be understood as a 'starting point' for the loss of market share.180 The Claimant points to the Respondent's own Reply Memorial as conflating 'from December 2012' with 'in January 2013' as a demonstration that the phrase 'from 2012' in the draft NOI does not have the meaning ascribed to it by the Respondent.181\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 94-97.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 96, referring to Letter from Richard Garneau to Minister Ed Fast (March 2, 2015) (**R-082**).\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 95, citing Resolute Draft Notice of Arbitration, para 19 (**R-081**).\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 95.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 38-40.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 41, referring to Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 86.\n\n139.\n\nThe Claimant considers the Respondent's focus on the supercalendered paper price forecasts between 2012 and 2014 to be defective for five key reasons:\n\ni. despite the Respondent's assertions, the Claimant's volumes and profits did not decline between December 2012 and January 2013, which are insufficient in any event to constitute a broader trend;182\n\nii. the Respondent has not presented evidence that prices decreased in December 2012, rather it accepts they held firm, so the Claimant had not incurred loss in December 2012;183\n\niii. the seasonality of prices means that 'it is not uncommon for prices to go down in January' and no causal link has been demonstrated between the reopening of Port Hawkesbury and any price decrease in January 2013. In fact, the prices recovered in February 2013;184\n\niv. the Respondent's assertion that the Claimant must have known of the price decrease in January 2013 because of its 28-45 day contract conclusion lead time disregards the fact that the Claimant's prices actually rose in February 2013 and this upcoming increase would have been known at a similar time;185 and\n\nv. there continued to be uncertainty surrounding the long term viability of Port Hawkesbury and the later increase in market prices in 2013 demonstrates that Port Hawkesbury's reentry in the market did not have such a dramatic effect.186 In this regard, the Claimant argues 'a lot of people at the time said - and a customer said at the ITC in the hearing, \"This place failed before. It lost its customers. Will the customers come back and trust it again?\" Nobody knew for sure. And that was the underestimate, as I tried to suggest, of just how committed the Nova Scotia government was to make it succeed.'187\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 43.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 44; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 66:20-67:1.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 45, 51-52; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 260:8-261:3.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 46; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 73:13-77:15.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 47; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 95:798:20, 274:14-275:2.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 279:12-22.\n\n140.\n\nSixth, the Respondent's assertion that the Claimant closed Line #10 at its Laurentide mill because of the reopening of Port Hawkesbury is factually incorrect. The Claimant points out that it attributed the closure of Line #10 to the reopening of the 'more modern and efficient Dolbeau plant' throughout 2011 and 2012, with the reopening of Port Hawkesbury not being certain until September 2012.188 The Claimant does acknowledge that the closure of Line #11 was attributable to Port Hawkesbury.189 However, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent that the temporary shutdown of Line #11 in 2012 was to be attributed to PHP, but was rather scheduled to coincide with the seasonal downturn in demand.190\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 98-107; Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 64, 66-83.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 64, 68.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 79.\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimant considers the Respondent's reliance on a particular statement by Resolute's spokesman, Pierre Choquette, regarding the closure of Line #10 to be misconceived.191 In fact, M. Choquette referenced the opening of Port Hawkesbury as potentially just one of 'several factors' leading to the closure of Line #10, and M. Garneau had elsewhere unambiguously referred to the fact that the reopening of Dolbeau would lead to the closure of another Resolute mill or machine.192 Elsewhere, M. Choquette repeated the CEO's message that the closure of Line #10 related to the decision to reopen Dolbeau and was unrelated to Port Hawkesbury.193 At the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, the Claimant also explained that 'the decision [to close Line #10] had been taken a full year earlier [...] but a company doesn't show fully its hand when it has workers who are going to be very distressed in a town that depends completely on that mill.'194\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 71.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 71-73.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 76, referring to Guy Veillette, '111 emplois perdus chez Laurentide', *Le Nouvelliste*, November 7, 2012 (**R-117**).\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 283:24-284:5.\n\n**(c) Certain NAFTA breaches were only known to the Claimant after December 30, 2012**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nWhile the Claimant acknowledges that certain breaches (but not loss or damage) were known by it by September 28, 2012, it submits that other breaches were not known to it until after December 30, 2012.195 The Claimant refers to two breaches that arose after December 30, 2012: the expropriation of the Laurentide mill which only occurred after the mill closed in October 2014, and a January 2013 Nova Scotia Measure relating to a biomass facility providing Port Hawkesbury with a C$6 to 8 million benefit.196 These two claims remain timely notwithstanding the outcome of the Respondent's jurisdictional objection in relation to the other claims.197\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para108.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 109.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 109.\n\n143.\n\nFirst, in relation to the Claimant's expropriation claim, the Claimant submits that it could not have known of the Respondent's breach of NAFTA Article 1110 until it had been substantially deprived of its investment in the Laurentide mill.198 This, the Claimant says, did not occur until the Laurentide mill closed in October 2014, after the critical date of December 30, 2012 and therefore within time for the purposes of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2).199 The Claimant explained during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility that the Laurentide mill had been sold in January 2016, and that 'it's no longer owned at all by Resolute. It's in other hands, and, therefore, the mill could not possibly be restored or reopened.'200\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 110; Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 94; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 25, 2017, 36:20-23.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 111-113; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 290:23-291:2.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 37:23-38:9, 285:11-24.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the closure of Line #10 - which, in any event, was not attributable to the reopening of Port Hawkesbury - would not constitute a 'substantial deprivation' of its investment so as to amount to a breach of Article 1110.201 The Claimant considers the Respondent's policy arguments regarding the operation of the time bar in relation to expropriation claims to be more prejudicial to investors than the NAFTA Parties if accepted since a 'claimant could be forced to bring an unripe NAFTA expropriation claim' that would necessarily be dismissed.202 The Claimant also disavows the Respondent's allegation that the expropriation claim considers sales and market share to have been expropriated, explaining instead that these are cognizable damages even if they are not capable of expropriation. Its claim instead relies on the closure of the Laurentide mill in 2014.203\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 114.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 97.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 98.\n\n145.\n\nSecond, the Claimant refers to the fact that Port Hawkesbury 'used steam provided by a Nova Scotia Power biomass facility to make its paper.'204 The Claimant alleges that the biomass facility needed to run full time to power Port Hawkesbury, but Port Hawkesbury was only required to pay for the amount of energy it used, i.e., 24 per cent, with the remaining 76 per cent being passed on to ratepayers.205 The passing down of costs was approved by the Nova Scotia Government by a regulation it passed in January 2013.206 This regulation constituted a C$6-8 million benefit to Port Hawkesbury and occurred after the critical date of December 30, 2012 so is nonetheless admissible.207 Contrary to the Respondent's contention that this argument was raised for the first time in the Claimant's Counter Memorial and is therefore out of time, the Claimant submits that these measures formed part of the 'electricity benefits received by PHP and identified by Resolute in its Statement of Claim.'208 In the event that the Claimant is required to amend its claim (which it does not believe it ought), the Claimant submits that the Tribunal should permit such an amendment as no prejudice would accrue to the Respondent; the arbitrators would only need to address this claim in the merits phase of this arbitration, there being no identified jurisdictional objection to this claim.209\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 115.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 115-116.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 116.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 117.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 99-102.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 102.\n\n**4. The Non-Disputing NAFTA Parties' Comments**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe United States supports the Respondent's contention that the limitation period established by Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) are 'clear and rigid' and 'not subject to any \"suspension\", \"prolongation\", or \"other qualification\".'210\n\nUnited States Submission, para 6.\n\n147.\n\nFurther, the United States agrees with the Respondent's interpretation of the plain text of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) regarding the start of the time limitation under those Articles. The United States recalls that the Articles require a 'claimant to submit a claim to arbitration within three years of the 'date on which the' investor or enterprise 'first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge' of the alleged breach and its loss or damage.211 Contrary to the Claimant's theory regarding continuing breach, 'an investor or enterprise *first* acquires knowledge [...] at a particular moment in time [...] such knowledge cannot *first* be acquired at multiple points in time or on a recurring basis.'212\n\nUnited States Submission, para 7.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 7.\n\n148.\n\nThe United States further submits that knowledge of 'incurred loss or damage' pursuant to Article 1116(2) and 1117(2) does not require 'the financial impact of the loss [to be] realized' but instead, the word 'incur' should be understood to refer to when the investor 'become[s] liable or subject to' such loss, even if 'that loss or damage is not immediate.'213\n\nUnited States Submission, paras 8-9.\n\n149.\n\nIn respect of the time a claimant acquires knowledge of an alleged breach of the expropriation standard under NAFTA Article 1110, the United States submits that 'a claimant has actual or constructive knowledge of the 'alleged breach' once it has (or should have had) knowledge of all elements required to make a claim under Article 1110 - including that the destruction of, or interference with, the economic value of the investment is sufficient to constitute a taking.'214 In cases where a series of measures are impugned as being expropriatory, knowledge of the expropriation can exist prior to the enactment of the last government measure.215 Additionally, the United States submits that 'a claimant may have actual or constructive knowledge that the interference with the economic value of its investment is sufficient to constitute a taking before that investment has lost all of its value.'216\n\nUnited States Submission, paras 10-11.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 11.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 11.\n\n150.\n\nIn a similar vein, Mexico agrees with the Respondent's submission that 'the plain language of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) does not require a claimant to acquire knowledge of the full extent of the loss or damage resulting from the alleged breaches in order to start the time limitation to submit a claim to arbitration.'217 In this regard, Mexico refers to the finding in *Mondev* where the tribunal determined that 'a claimant may know that it has suffered loss or damage even if the extent or quantification of the loss or damage is still unclear.'218\n\nMexico Submission, para 6.\n\nMexico Submission, para 6, citing *Mondev*, Award, para 87.\n\n151.\n\nThe Respondent points out these areas of agreement amongst the NAFTA Parties, and the authorities that they cite in common, including the statement of the *Mondev* tribunal that a 'claimant may know that it has suffered loss or damage even if the extent of the quantification of the loss or damage is still unclear.'219 The Respondent agrees with the United States that the holdings in *Pope & Talbot* and *Grand River* are not necessarily incompatible 'as a loss occurs when it is incurred, rather than when the financial impact of the loss is realized.'220\n\nCanada's Reply to Article 1128 Submissions, paras 10-14.\n\nCanada's Reply to Article 1128 Submissions, para 14.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimant considers that the distinction drawn by the United States between when a loss may be incurred and when the financial impact of the loss may be experienced, is irrelevant to the facts of the present case. That is because Resolute did not know and had no persuasive reason to know that it had either incurred or experienced injury prior to December 30, 2012.221\n\nClaimant's Reply to Article 1128 Submissions, paras 16-18.\n\n**5. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) General considerations**\n------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe relevant language of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) is identical: 'if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.' The triggering event is the knowledge, actual or constructive, that an alleged breach has occurred and that loss or damage has been incurred as a result. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent, and with the other NAFTA Parties in their Article 1128 submissions, that this time limit is strict, not flexible. There is no provision for the Tribunal to extend the limitation period, and there is no question here of any waiver on the part of the Respondent. On the other hand, the specified conditions must be fulfilled: the alleged breach must actually have occurred, the resulting damage must actually have been incurred, and the claimant must know, or be in a position such that it should have known, of these facts.\n\n154.\n\nAs to the requirement of breach, one cannot know of a breach until the facts alleged to constitute the breach have actually occurred. It is not enough that a breach is likely to occur: paragraph (2) deals with allegations, no doubt, but not with contingencies.222 There may thus be a difference between the date of different breaches arising from a given course of governmental conduct. The Claimant alleges breaches of Articles 1102(3) (national treatment), 1105(1) (unfair and inequitable treatment), and 1110(1) (expropriation). Breaches of Articles 1102(3) and 1105(1) occur when the governmental conduct complained of occurs. By contrast a breach of Article 1110(1) occurs when the expropriation (as there defined) occurs and not before. The gist of an expropriation is the loss of the property in question, as a result of a governmental taking (direct or indirect). Only when the investor is substantially or completely deprived of the attributes of property in an investment can there be an expropriation under Article 1110(1).223\n\nIn certain cases, tribunals have been prepared to overlook technically premature claims, provided the relevant requirements have subsequently been satisfied: e.g. *Ethyl Corporation v Canada*, Award on Jurisdiction, June 14, 1998, paras 85-88 (where the legislation complained of had not been passed or come into force). The question here is a different one: it is whether a strict 3-year limit for bringing a claim has been exceeded. The 3-year limit is counted from the date of actual (putative) breach and knowledge of harm.\n\nThe essence of the matter is the deprivation by state organs of the right of property either as such, or by permanent transfer of the power of management and control': *Brownlie's Principles* (8th edn, ed Crawford, 2012) 621.\n\n**(b) Knowledge (actual or constructive) of the alleged breaches**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nIn the present case, the essential acts alleged to constitute breaches of Articles 1102(3) and 1105(1) were completed by September 2012, three months before the critical date. It was in September 2012 that the sale of the Port Hawkesbury mill was finalised, along with the associated promises of support. Moreover, the Claimant was well aware of this at the time. It had previously declined to bid for the mill, and the proposed sale was covered in the trade press. Indeed, the Claimant, subject to an argument as to continuing breach, did not really argue otherwise. Its principal argument was that it did not suffer loss or was, reasonably, not aware of having done so until, at the earliest, January 2013, after the critical date.\n\n156.\n\nIn its written pleadings, at least, the Claimant also sought to argue that the Nova Scotia Measures were continuing breaches of Articles 1102(3) and 1105(1), breaches which continued after the critical date and which consequently were not caught by the 3-year time limit. In oral argument, this argument was not pressed, and in the Tribunal's view rightly not.\n\n157.\n\nThe core point is that in the present case, the Nova Scotia measures were taken within a short space of time and were effectively complete when taken. It is true that they eventually had a continuing effect on the Claimant (from what date is disputed), but that does not suffice to qualify them as continuing wrongful acts. There is a distinction between a continuing breach of an obligation and a perfected breach which continues to have injurious effects. Decisions to provide support to the Port Hawkesbury mill were taken and implemented in September 2012, and with one possible exception (as to which see paragraph 160 below) they did not call for further measures to be taken.\n\n158.\n\nArticles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA refer to the time when the breach 'first' occurred. According to the ordinary meaning of the terms used and the object and purpose of the provision (under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties), whether a breach definitively occurring and known to the claimant prior to the critical date continued in force thereafter is irrelevant. In terms of Article 14(2) of the Articles on State Responsibility, '[t]he breach of an international obligation by an act of a State having a continuing character extends over the entire period during which the act continues and remains not in conformity with the international obligation.'224 But the breach nonetheless occurs when the State act is first perfected and can be definitively characterized as a breach of the relevant obligation. Here the reopening of the Port Hawkesbury mill on favourable terms - alleged by the Claimant to constitute a breach of Articles 1102(3) and/or 1105(1) - first occurred not later than September 2012.\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* 2001, Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of Its Fifty-third Session, UN GAOR, 56th Sess, Supp No 10, 43, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001).\n\n159.\n\nIn these circumstances the Tribunal does not need to attempt to reconcile the apparent discrepancies between various NAFTA tribunals concerning continuing wrongful acts.225\n\nCf, on the one hand, *United Parcel Service of America Inc (UPS) v Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award, May 24, 2007, para 28 and, on the other, *Apotex Inc v Government of the United States*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/10/2, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, June 14, 2013, paras 325-7; *Glamis Gold, Ltd v United States of America*, UNCITRAL Award, June 8, 2009, para 348; *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations Ltd v United States*, Award, ICSID Case No ARB/10/5, IIC 481 (2011), January 12, 2011, para 74.\n\n160.\n\nA possible exception to this conclusion concerns the January 2013 electricity regulation granting a further benefit to Port Hawkesbury (see paragraph 124, 145 above). At the oral phase the Parties spent very little time on this argument. It was not (and in the Tribunal's view, could not have been) pleaded as giving rise to a new claim under Chapter Eleven; it was, if anything, a continuation of conduct already in operation. If necessary, the Tribunal would have permitted an amendment to the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, but in essence the 2013 electricity regulation was not more than an ancillary factor, linked to the original Measures. As such, it does not affect the operation of the time-bar.\n\n161.\n\nThe position is different, in the Tribunal's view, in respect of the alleged breach of Article 1110(1). The gist of an expropriation claim is the actual loss of property or (in the case of conduct tantamount to an expropriation) of control over it. In the words of the tribunal in *Glamis Gold* :\n\nClaims only arise under NAFTA Article 1110 when actual confiscation follows, and thus mere threats of expropriation or nationalization are not sufficient to make such a claim ripe; for an Article 1110 claim to be ripe, the governmental act must have directly or indirectly taken a property interest resulting in actual present harm to an investor.226\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award, June 8, 2009, para 328.\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimant summarized its case on expropriation in closing as follows:\n\nan expropriation is a measure that causes the substantial deprivation of my property. And if you, as a government, take measures, knowing that you will be supporting an entity in a way that will harm a limited number of other competitors in a shrinking market, I think that there is a very good basis to claim that that measure may cause the expropriation, indirect, constructive expropriation, of one of the other market players. It results in the substantial deprivation of my asset...227\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 458:19-459:4.\n\n163.\n\nIn accordance with this submission, the expropriation did not occur until 2014, when the Claimant's Canadian subsidiary decided to close down the Laurentide mill and the Claimant was thereby deprived of the benefit of its investment.228 As will appear, there are difficulties with this claim for breach of Article 1110(1), but in the Tribunal's view, the timing requirements of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) have not been infringed in respect of the expropriation claim.\n\nThere is an extensive case-law on the question when an expropriation occurs, much of it concerned with 'creeping' expropriation (which is not this case) and with issues of valuation rather than (as here) with jurisdiction. A typical finding is that of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal that:  \n When the alleged expropriation is carried out by way of a series of interferences in the enjoyment of property, the breach forming the cause of action is deemed to take place on the day when the interference has ripened into a more or less irreversible deprivation of the property rather than on the beginning date of the events  \n*International Technical Products Corporation v Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran*, Award No. 196-302-3, October 28, 1985, para 49, Iran-USCTR 206, 240-1 (1985). See further *Biloune and Marine Drive Complex Ltd v Ghana Investments Centre and the Government of Ghana*, UNCTIRAL, Award, October 27, 1989, 95 ILR 184, 210, para 30. See also e.g. *First National City Bank, Memorandum of determinations*, IIC 1023 (1973), April 9, 1973, *Chile (Overseas Private Investment Corporation)* ; *Compa\u00f1ia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena SA v Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award, February 17, 2000, paras 77-8; *Nykomb Synergetics Technology Holding AB v Latvia*, Award, December 16, 2003, para 4.3.1.\n\n**(c) Knowledge (actual or constructive) of losses incurred**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThis conclusion concerning expropriation makes it unnecessary for present purposes to decide when the Claimant became aware that it had suffered loss as a result of the alleged breach of Article 1110(1), or should have done so. But that question does arise with respect to the losses incurred by the Claimant as a result of the alleged breaches of Articles 1102(3) and 1105(1).\n\n165.\n\nOn this issue the Disputing Parties agreed that it is not necessary for this purpose that the full extent of losses incurred be known. As the tribunal said in *Mondev*, 'a claimant may know that it has suffered loss or damage even if the extent or quantification of the loss or damage is still unclear.'229\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, October 11, 2002, para 87.\n\n166.\n\nBeyond this point the Disputing Parties' positions diverged. The Claimant did not call its spokesman at the time, or its senior management, to testify as to their knowledge of present losses. Rather it called expert evidence in the person of Professor Hausman, who asserted that any adverse impact of the breaches did not occur until, at the earliest, the first quarter of 2013. The Respondent for its part contested Professor Hausman's evidence, although it did not call any expert in rebuttal. Instead, the focus of its case was on a series of statements, made by the Claimant in 2012 and subsequently, that, in the Respondent's view, indicated awareness that losses had already been incurred.\n\n167.\n\nThere is an almost metaphysical question whether a claimant which actually asserts that it has already suffered loss or damage can subsequently, in effect, argue that it was mistaken and that the loss or damage were only incurred at a later date. Is it possible to have actual knowledge of something that is not the case? But as not infrequently happens in the law, the metaphysical question does not really arise. Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) are concerned to set time limits on NAFTA claims once the claimant has notice of what it considers breach and consequential loss. A claimant which unequivocally asserts both elements, then waits more than 3 years to commence proceedings, can hardly be heard to say that its original assertion was premature.\n\n168.\n\nIt is thus necessary to review the statements relied on by the Respondent to see whether they constituted unequivocal assertions of loss already incurred. The various statements were itemized in paragraphs 108-117 above.\n\n169.\n\nThe draft notice of intent presented to the Minister on February 24, 2015 referred to market share having declined 'from 2012 to 2014'.230 The Tribunal does not accept Claimant's argument that this was merely a draft for the purposes of negotiation. It was a document transmitted to the Respondent with a view to the settlement of the dispute, and was correspondingly significant. However, the statement as to market share was not unequivocal. To say that market share declined from one year to another does not say anything specific about whether there was a decline in the first year, especially since only a few months in that year were implicated. The first year may be simply a comparator. The Tribunal does not read this isolated statement as an admission that Claimant suffered actual loss or damage in 2012.\n\nResolute Forest Products, 'Draft Notice of Intent', February 24, 2015, para 19 (**R-081)**. No further specification was offered.\n\n170.\n\nAs to the 2012 conference call and Claimant's statement that it was 'impossible [for the reopening of Port Hawkesbury] not to have an impact on the market',231 this certainly shows that the Claimant expected to lose market share. But made at a time when Port Hawkesbury had yet to reopen, this was a mere prediction, not an acknowledgement of loss already incurred.\n\nSee para 110.\n\n171.\n\nMore significant in this regard is the Claimant's closure of Line #10 at Laurentide in November 2012, and the contemporaneous explanations for this given by the Claimant. The Claimant argues that the major reason for the closure of Line #10 was its own decision, made a year before, to reopen its Dolbeau plant. This seems to have been the major reason, but the explanation reveals the interaction of economic factors in a saturated market. Claimant's spokesperson, Pierre Choquette, said at the time that the reopening of Port Hawkesbury was 'just one of several factors' in the decision to close Line #10 and the Tribunal is inclined to think that this statement was accurate. Moreover, the temporary closure of Line #11 at Laurentide was according to the Claimant itself, at least partly attributable to the reopening of Port Hawkesbury. But it is one thing, in a climate of uncertainty as to markets, to take precautionary measures, and another to acknowledge present loss or injury. The Claimant does not suggest that the temporary closure was a compensable loss, and in the Tribunal's view neither was it an acknowledgement of damage.\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent quotes press articles from late 2012, which state that the Claimant will lose market share: (i) a 'Reel Time' report published on November 8, 2012 predicted that Resolute's market share would fall from 20.1% at the end of 2011 to 13.5% at the end of 2012;232 (ii) the 'ERA Forest Products Monthly' November 2012 issue said that the Port Hawkesbury restart was already having an impact on contract negotiations for the first half of 2013;233 and (iii) 'Industry Intelligence' reports about drops in prices.234 The Claimant points out that previous reports by 'Reel Time' were erroneous, and asserts that speculation about markets is inherently uncertain.235\n\nCanada's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 64, citing Verle Sutton, *Reel Time*, Special Edition (Nov. 8, 2012), p. 7, available at: http://suttonpaperstrategies.com/PDFs/Nov%2012%20Forecast%20Issue.pdf. (**R-102**)\n\nCanada's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 65, citing ERA Forest Products Research, *ERA Forest Products Monthly* (November 30, 2012), p. 25 (**R-105**).\n\nCanada's Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 66-7, citing, Industry Intelligence, report, 'Industry Intelligence i2dashboard - 35 lb SC-A' (**R-108**) and Industry Intelligence, report, 'Industry Intelligence i2dashboard -33 lb SC-B' (**R-109**).\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras 88, 91.\n\n173.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it was clear when Port Hawkesbury restarted in September 2012 that paper prices would be affected at some point. But that fact is not equivalent to a finding that damage was already being incurred, and that is what Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) require. Press speculation and market predictions are no substitute for evidence of sales volumes and prices, or a clear acknowledgement of present loss.\n\n174.\n\nDr Jerry Hausman, a Professor of Economics at MIT, gave evidence on the former point. In his Expert Witness Statement he concluded that:\n\nThe management of Resolute could not have concluded that the firm's SCP operation had been financially harmed by the reopening of the PHP mill prior to the first quarter of 2013. Several factors underlie my conclusion. First, the price and financial effects of the reopening were not evident until January 2013 or later. Second, PHP did not have a material impact on the North American SCP market until 2013. Third, there was nothing in the financial results of Resolute's SCP operations during the fourth quarter of 2012 to suggest that Resolute had been materially harmed by the reopening, especially when viewed in the context of declining consumption of SCP during 2012. Fourth, even if Resolute's management had suspected adverse effects might arise from the reopening, it would not have known the extent of any effects, or their materiality, prior to the first quarter of 2013.236\n\nHausman, Expert Witness Statement, February 22, 2017, para 14.\n\n175.\n\nHe added:\n\nBased on the evidence presented [...] Resolute could not have contemporaneously known the damaging effects of PHP's reopening in 2012, due to the limited price, quantity, and profit effects apparent in Q4 2012.237\n\nIbid, para 40.\n\n176.\n\nDr Hausman was ably cross-examined on his Statement, but without resiling from its principal conclusions. He accepted that there had been a slight decline in SC paper prices in January 2013, and an even slighter increase in February 2013 (both of which would have been known in December), but said that someone in the Claimant's position should not have attached significance to that, given the relatively modest price changes and typical market fluctuations after the end of the holiday season. He also emphasized the uncertainties regarding Port Hawkesbury's reopening, which could not have been resolved in the short time scale in question. In his view the major impact on prices was not felt until later in 2013 or even 2014.238 In the absence of rebuttal evidence and in light of the indications of prices for supercalendered paper in the period November 2012 to February 2013, the Tribunal accepts his evidence cited above.\n\nThe oral evidence is at Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 50-99.\n\n177.\n\nAs noted (paragraph 119 above), the Respondent submitted at the hearing that the Tribunal should join (or rather rejoin) the time bar issue to the merits, or at least order a targeted production of documents directed at disclosing the internal state of knowledge of Claimant's senior executives. The Tribunal is disinclined to accept either procedural proposal. The Respondent sought bifurcation *inter alia* on this issue, yet at the jurisdictional phase issues will typically be decided on the basis of written party submissions.239 In fact, a quantity of documentary evidence was produced, including items taken from the trade literature and statements by informed company personnel, and the matter was fully argued. The resulting picture suggested that there was an expectation of increased competition and pressure on prices, but, consistent with the factual analysis presented above, there was no admission by the Claimant of immediate losses in the period after Port Hawkesbury restarted, and the economic evidence produced by the Claimant supported this conclusion. In the circumstances, no case for joinder or a special discovery process has been made out.\n\nCf *Grand River*, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, para 54.\n\n178.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimant did not know, and could not reasonably have known, by December 2012, that it had already incurred loss or damage by reason of the alleged breach. Indeed, it has not been established that it did actually suffer loss in this short period. Market participants and observers expected increased price competition in the longer term, but that is a different matter. The Respondent argued that at least the reopening of Port Hawkesbury precluded the Claimant from raising its prices, but as Claimant pointed out, there is no evidence that it planned a price increase,240 and anyway press speculation as to possible price increases is not the same thing as an admission of loss or injury. *A fortiori* it is not enough to trigger the time limit.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 54.\n\n179.\n\nFor these reasons, in the Tribunal's view the time-bar in Article 1116(2) and 1117(2) does not prevent the Tribunal exercising jurisdiction over the claims.\n\n**C. THE SCOPE OBJECTION**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n180.\n\nNAFTA Article 1101(1) deals with the 'Scope and Coverage' of NAFTA Chapter Eleven and relevantly provides:\n\nThis Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) investors of another party;\n\n(b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party; and\n\n(c) with respect to Articles 1106 and 1114, all investments in the territory of the Party.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the words 'relating to' in Article 1101(1) require a 'legally significant connection' between the impugned measures and the investor or its investment. The Respondent contends that such a connection does not exist in this case between the Nova Scotia Measures and the Claimant or the Laurentide mill and so the Nova Scotia Measures do not fall within the scope of application of NAFTA.\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimant, on the other hand, contends that the words 'relating to' only requires a 'causal connection' between the impugned measures and the investor or its investment. In this case, the Claimant submits that such a 'causal connection' exists here since the Nova Scotia Measures directly affected the Claimant and the Laurentide mill.\n\n183.\n\nAs noted by the Tribunal in its Decision on Bifurcation, if the Respondent's Article 1101(2) objection is successful, it would dispose of the entirety of the claims relating to the Nova Scotia Measures.241\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, Decision on Bifurcation, November 18, 2016, para 4.15.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n**(a) Interpretation of the words 'relating to' under Article 1101(1)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondent's jurisdictional objection revolves around whether the words 'relating to' are sufficiently broad to include cases where the impugned measures merely have an effect on the investor and its investment, or whether something more is required.242 The Respondent submits that the words 'relating to' impose a higher threshold than the 'causal nexus' test proposed by the Claimant and require a 'legally significant connection' between the impugned measures and the investor or its investment so as to be covered by NAFTA Chapter Eleven.243\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 81.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 79, 81; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 111:17.\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent compares the words chosen in Article 1101(1) with other provisions of NAFTA that are formulated more broadly in order to cover measures that have a mere direct or indirect effect on trade.244 The Respondent reinforces this point by reference to previous drafts of NAFTA which broadened the scope of application of Chapter Eleven to 'measures affecting investments [...] and investors'.245 However, this earlier drafting was rejected by the NAFTA Parties and reformulated in its narrower current form. The Respondent notes that the Disputing Parties agree that 'a measure that has a mere effect on an investment [...] is not sufficient to satisfy the Article 1101(1) threshold' and a measure 'must directly affect the investor or its investment for it to meet the \"relating to\" threshold.'246 The Respondent submits that it is also the agreed view amongst all three NAFTA Parties that the words 'relating to' ought to be understood as requiring a 'legally significant connection' between the measure, the investor and its investment so as to fall within Chapter Eleven's scope of application and, consequently, the jurisdiction of a NAFTA tribunal.247 This view, which has been expressed in cases such as *Methanex* and *Apotex*, was adopted by those tribunals in their reasoning. For example, the tribunal in *Methanex* found:\n\nIf the threshold provided by Article 1101(1) were merely one of 'affecting', as Methanex contends, it would be satisfied wherever any economic impact was felt by an investor or an investment...\n\nWe decide that the phrase 'relating to' in Article 1101(1) NAFTA signifies something more than the mere effect of a measure on an investor or an investment and that it requires a legally significant connection between them.248\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 81 referring to NAFTA Articles 709 ('this Section applies to any such [sanitary and phytosanitary] measure of a Party that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade between the Parties') and 901 ('this Chapter applies to standard-related measures [...] that may directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods or services').\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 82.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 118.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 83; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 111:8-114:19.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 84\n\n186.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this approach has been endorsed and adopted by subsequent tribunals in *Bayview*249 and *Cargill*.250 In respect of the *Cargill* decision, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's assertion that 'the *Cargill* tribunal considered that the 'legally significant connection' test set out in *Methanex*'sets the bar too high, or requires refinement.'251 Rather, the *Cargill* tribunal found that there was a 'causal nexus' between the investor, its investment and the Mexican permit regime imposed on the import of high fructose corn syrup.252 Although phrased differently, the Respondent submits that the 'causal nexus' test is essentially the same as the 'legally significant connection' test.253 In fact, the *Cargill* tribunal refused to comment on the stringency of the *Methanex* test, instead determining that: 'regardless of whether or not the test espoused in *Methanex* is too restrictive, it is satisfied.'254\n\n*Bayview Irrigation District v United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/1) Award, June 19, 2007 (**RL-005**) ('***Bayview*****, Award**'); Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 115:11-22.\n\n*Cargill, Incorporated v United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2) Award, September 18, 2009 (**RL-050**) ('***Cargill, Award***').\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 88, referring to Claimant's Opposition to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, para 10.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 88, citing *Cargill*, Award, para 174.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 88; Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 125.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 123, citing *Cargill*, Award, para 175.\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the very same argument was considered and rejected in the *Apotex* and *Apotex II* cases, especially where the tribunal in *Apotex II* determined:\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the *Cargill* tribunal was seeking to apply a different legal interpretation of NAFTA Article 1101(1) from the two tribunals in *Methanex* and *Bayview.*255\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 89, citing *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc v United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, August 25, 2014, para 6.13 (**RL-051**) ('***Apotex*****, Award**'); Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 122; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 136:16-21.\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the 'legally significant connection' test is the proper approach since it was the standard applied in *Bayview* and described by the *Bilcon* tribunal as 'a sound basis for deliberation.'256 The Respondent submits that the 'legally significant connection' test requires more than the measure 'merely affect' the claimant or its investment, but does not necessarily require that the measures be 'intended to deliberately harm' the investor nor 'create a legal impediment', even though measures such as these would 'undoubtedly meet the threshold' set by the 'legally significant connection' test.257\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 124 referring to *Bayview*, Award, para 101; *Bilcon*, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, para 240.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 116:18-117:16.\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondent urges this Tribunal to follow the line of authority established by the tribunals mentioned above and also followed by the tribunal in *Bilcon* and ignore the Claimant's reference to the *BG Group v Argentina* case which is based on the UK-Argentina BIT, inconsistent with NAFTA practice, and has never been endorsed by a NAFTA tribunal.258 To find otherwise, the Respondent says, 'would create a limitless class of affected investors' and 'do exactly what the *Methanex* tribunal cautioned against'.259\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 93.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 126; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 126:5-22.\n\n**(b) Whether a 'legally significant connection' exists between the Nova Scotia Measures, Resolute and Resolute's investments**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent submits that while Resolute may have felt the economic impact of the Nova Scotia Measures and the re-opening of the Port Hawkesbury mill, this is insufficient to satisfy the 'legally significant connection' test required by Article 1101(1). This is, quite simply, because the Claimant's operations are headquartered in Qu\u00e9bec and the Claimant has no investment in Nova Scotia and, conversely, the Nova Scotia government exercises no legal authority over the Claimant's investments outside of Nova Scotia.260\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 95; Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 130.\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent considers the Claimant to have inappropriately added a new claim via its Counter Memorial by alleging that the Nova Scotia measures were intended to harm a foreign investor.261 This allegation was not capable of being accepted *pro tem*, as alleged by the Claimant, since it only appeared for the first time in the Claimant's Counter-Memorial.262 Without permission to amend its claim under Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Respondent submits that this allegation should be ignored.263\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 128, 131, referring to Claimant's Counter Memorial, para 154.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 132.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 132.\n\n192.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent contends that this 'bare accusation of malign intent without so much as a hint of evidence' still does not satisfy Article 1101(1).264 The Respondent draws comparisons between this case and *Methanex*, where the claimant had permission to amend its claim so as to allege a conspiracy to harm in order to bolster its jurisdictional arguments.265 However, just as that tactic did not succeed in *Methanex*, so should the Claimant's attempt in this case fail.266 The Respondent submits that the Claimant's allegation of intention to harm is 'totally unsupported by evidence' and contradicts Resolute's evidence before the US ITC that 'PHP and Resolute were not in direct competition because they make a lesser quality paper.'267\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 132.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, paras 133-135.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 135.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 136, referring to March US ITC Transcript, p. 130:12-15 (**R-083**).\n\n193.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Respondent considers each category of the Nova Scotia Measures in turn to demonstrate 'that only a tangential, indirect connection exists between the measure and the Claimant's investment.'268\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 137.\n\n194.\n\nThe funding provided by the Forestry Infrastructure Fund was used to train and sustain workers in the forestry industry and to help keep the Port Hawkesbury mill in 'hot idle', thereby preventing the mechanical deterioration of the mill so that it could be sold as a going concern to prospective buyers.269 These measures contributed to the value of the Port Hawkesbury mill when being sold to prospective buyers, of whom Resolute could have been one, but could equally have been futile had no purchaser been found.270 Additionally, these measures do not 'relate to' the Claimant nor its investments in a different province, they solely relate to the Port Hawkesbury mill and its resale value.271 Canada asks that these measures be severed from the claim as not having a 'legally significant connection' to the investor or its investment since they were only 'temporary stopgap measures with neutral intent and limited scope.'272\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 97; Respondent's Reply Memorial, paras 138, 139; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 13:13-14:3.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 98.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 99.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 14:7-15, 138:3-141:2; August 16, 2017, 408:15-409:3.\n\n195.\n\nThe C$124.5 million in government support for PWCC's acquisition of the Port Hawkesbury mill similarly lacks a significant legal connection to the Claimant and its investments. This funding was not provided to PWCC to give it a competitive advantage, as suggested by the Claimant, but was provided to assist the new owners implement 'improved land management practices, preservation and expansion of Crown land, sustainable harvesting, and support for the local work force, the forestry sector and the Mi'kmaq people.'273\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 101; Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 140; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2107, 141:3-145:2.\n\n196.\n\nPWCC's Property Tax Agreement and preferential electricity rate negotiated with NSPI similarly have no connection to the Claimant or its investments since the Claimant does not pay property taxes in Nova Scotia nor is it subject to electricity rates in Nova Scotia.274 In respect of the Property Tax Agreement, the Respondent submits that this agreement, between Richmond County and NewPage and Port Hawkesbury, does not relate to Resolute's investment in 'another province entirely where a different tax regime applies'.275 The Respondent argues that it is insufficient for the Claimant to contend that the Property Tax Agreement 'benefitted PHP, and that's good enough for it to be related to Resolute.'276 In respect of the preferential electricity rate, this was negotiated and given because it was in NSPI's interest, as a 'privately-owned, commercially-run corporation', to preserve PHP as a customer and was in the public interest since PHP's continued existence 'benefitted all of the customers on the grid' by avoiding a 'hike in electricity rates for all other customers on account of the loss of this extra-large customer.'277\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 102; Respondent's Reply Memorial, paras 141-142.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 147:6-14.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 147:14-18.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 145:3-21.\n\n197.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimant's case relating to the biomass facility, in addition to being made belatedly, must fail 'for the same reasons as the Property Tax Agreement [...] because it doesn't draw the necessary legal connection.'278\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 147:19-149:5.\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's complaints themselves illustrate how no 'legally significant connection' exists between the Claimant, its investments and the Nova Scotia Measures. For example, the Claimant's complaint that it was not afforded similar treatment as the Port Hawkesbury mill demonstrates how there is no 'legally significant connection' since such treatment was not afforded to it for the simple fact that it is not located in Nova Scotia.279 Similarly, the fact that (on its own case) the Claimant did not know the economic impact of the Nova Scotia Measures until the first quarter of 2013 demonstrates that the Nova Scotia Measures did not relate to the Claimant's investment in a 'legally significant' way.280\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 103.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 104; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 16:14-24.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent draws a parallel between this case and the *Methanex* case, where the impugned measures did not directly affect the claimant but only had an effect on the market that was felt by the claimant.281 The Respondent contends that 'such market effects are too far removed to meet the threshold of Article 1101(1)' and therefore submits that the Claimant's claims relating to the Nova Scotia Measures fall outside the scope of application of Chapter Eleven of NAFTA.282\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 107-109.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 109.\n\n200.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent distinguishes this case from *Cargill* where the impugned measures were intended to harm the High Fructose Corn Syrup industry.283 By comparison, in this case the Nova Scotia Measures are of 'general application to the entire industry and are not intended to drive Resolute out of the market, are not intended to have the same types of effect that the very measure, the very tax that was at issue in *Cargill* did.'284 The Respondent argues that the Nova Scotia Measures were intended to 'bring back 330 jobs and to help stabilize logging in Cape Breton', not to 'make sure that we have one market player here and that there isn't another one to compete with.'285 In this respect, the present case is different to that in *Cargill* in terms of the 'directness' of the measure.286 The Respondent clarified its position in this way during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility:\n\nIf you have a measure that applies directly to a company, whether you want to harm them or not, and it has a relationship to them, it doesn't have to intend to harm them. If you have an indirect measure that is helping somebody else, one of the ways of showing the relationship to the claimant in a situation like that would be to show an intention. Might there be other evidence to show a relationship? Sure. But my simple point is that you have to show a relationship. You have to show a legally significant connection to the rest of the industry or the ripple effects that that might cause.287\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 119:17-124:7, August 16, 2017, 412:16-415:14.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 124:8-15.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 125:10-20.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 125:10-20; August 16, 2017, 415:15-417:6.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 135:13-24.\n\n201.\n\nAt the hearing, the Respondent observed that the Claimant simultaneously argues that Nova Scotia 'wanted to create a national champion at the expense of Resolute' but, at the same time, that the impact of the reopening of the Port Hawkesbury mill was 'unknown and unknowable' until 2014.288 This inconsistency, the Respondent contends, demonstrates that no legally significant connection exists between the Nova Scotia Measures and the Claimant or its investment. The Respondent accordingly invites the Tribunal to follow the approach of the *Methanex* tribunal and dismiss the claim since it does not fall within the scope of NAFTA required by Article 1101(1).289\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 16:2-17:7-11.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 17:7-23, 108:2-11.\n\n202.\n\nThe Respondent further observes that the Claimant's argument, that 'predatory pricing' by PHP in 2014 caused the shutdown of the Laurentide mill itself, demonstrates a lack of a 'legally significant connection' as required by Article 1101(1).290 The Respondent submits that it was PHP, not the Government of Nova Scotia that would have engaged in any alleged predatory pricing and, since PHP's actions are not attributable to the Respondent, the Claimant's claim lacks 'a fundamental jurisdictional prerequisite.'291\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 18:6-11.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 18:6-21; 19:23-20:1.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent summarized its case in this way during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility:\n\n[B]enefit to PHP that allows it to eventually, if successful, and if market conditions permit, cause harm to the Claimant's investment can't constitute a measure relating to the Claimant's investment. It's indirect, and it doesn't establish a legally significant connection...\n\nAs Professor Hausman said, government support is not sufficient to make a company successful. There, we're talking again about the preconditions. If that's the case, if the government support isn't sufficient to make the company successful in the first place, how is it that that same government support has a clear relationship to the investor or its investment? Clearly it doesn't.292\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 149:17-150:19.\n\n**3. The Claimant's Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n**(a) Interpretation of the words 'relating to' in Article 1101(1)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the stated purpose of the Nova Scotia Measures was to 'make the Port Hawkesbury mill the national champion in SC paper' by making it the 'lowest cost' producer in North America and putting it in direct competition with Resolute, 'a leading SC paper producer, in the Canadian and North American markets.'293 This, the Claimant says, is sufficient to clear the 'low threshold' imposed by Article 1101(1) which only requires, in the words of the Ontario Superior Court, 'some connection' between the measures and the investor/investment and not requiring 'that the measure[s] be adopted with the express purpose of causing loss.'294\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 118-119.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 123, citing *United Mexican States v Cargill, Inc.,* 2010 ONSC 4656, para 57, affirmed by 2011 ONCA 622, application for leave to appeal dismissed, 2012 CanLII 25159 (SCC) (**CL-004**); Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 108.\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Ontario Superior Court formulation in *Cargill* of 'some connection' is the appropriate standard, not the 'legally significant connection' test espoused in *Methanex* and relied upon by the Respondent.295 The Claimant observes that the *Cargill* tribunal thought the *Methanex* standard 'might be \"too restrictive\"', noting that 'Article 1101 has a causal connection requirement as well: the measures adopted or maintained by the Respondent must be those 'relating to' investors of another Party or investments of investors of another Party.'296 While the *Cargill* tribunal found that the Mexican regulations requiring the Claimant to obtain a permit to import High Fructose Corn Syrup passed the *Methanex* test because it imposed a 'legal impediment' on Cargill's business, it also found that a tax imposed on products sweetened with High Fructose Corn Syrup was a measure 'relating to' Cargill.297\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 124; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 333:19-334:14.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 128, citing *Cargill*, Award, paras 174-175 (**CL-003**); Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 332:24-333:9.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 128-129.\n\n206.\n\nSimilar to the facts in this case, the tax measure impugned in *Cargill* was not imposed on the Claimant directly, but Cargill was nonetheless 'directly affected by a measure that was intended to protect a local industry and hurt its competitors outside the relevant jurisdiction.'298 The Claimant argues that this view was recently endorsed by the tribunal in *Mesa Power.*299 That case dealt with Ontario legislation imposing new regulations on the power industry but where the claimant did not receive a contract under the newly created 'feed-in tariff program'. The *Mesa Power* tribunal specified that the requirement imposed by Article 1101(1) that the measures 'relate to' the investor or its investments would be satisfied so long as the measures 'have a causal nexus with the Claimant or its investment.'300 Even though the measures in question in that case did not create a legal impediment or intend to harm the Claimant, the tribunal nonetheless considered the 'causal connection' between the legislation and the Claimant's injury to be sufficient.301\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 130;

Nova Scotia undertook a series of measures late in 2012 to ensure that the Port Hawkesbury paper mill would have competitive advantages above any other SC paper producer, including Resolute.\n\nii. Nova Scotia understood that the SC paper market was in 'secular decline'.\n\niii. The unforeseen and unforeseeable introduction into the Canadian market of an SC paper mill bankrolled by public funds to become 'the lowest cost operation in North America' has had a devastating impact on the viability and competitiveness of Resolute's three SC Paper mills in Canada.\n\niv. Nova Scotia's measures openly threatened Resolute and other SC paper producers because Port Hawkesbury Paper would take their customers, create a downward pressure on prices, and 'push higher-cost operators out of business'.\n\nv. Port Hawkesbury Paper began to take market share from Resolute in 2013.\n\nvi. Resolute was forced to close its Laurentide mill permanently in October 2014 due principally to the added production capacity of Port Hawkesbury, which has driven prices down while producing at lower costs because of the measures taken by Nova Scotia.\n\nvii. Nova Scotia selected the Port Hawkesbury Paper mill as a national champion, chosen by a government, to establish it as the 'lowest cost and most competitive producer' in the SC paper market, displacing all other producers, including Resolute.\n\nviii. With tens of millions of dollars of assistance from the government and ongoing preferential operation arrangements, Port Hawkesbury Paper was empowered to drive Resolute's SC paper mills in Qu\u00e9bec out of business.\n\nix. Nova Scotia propped its own provincial mill up with benefits and operational advantages to ensure that its costs are lower than those of Resolute and other competitors in the Canadian, US and other markets, thereby creating grossly unfair conditions in an SC paper market in Canada that has very few producers.317\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 152, referring to Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, paras 4, 47, 48, 50, 53, 89, 95, 107; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 347:2-349-18.\n\n214.\n\nA causal connection exists between Resolute, its investments in Canada and the Nova Scotia Measures given that these measures 'eventually harmed Resolute directly' even though they 'were not aimed specifically at Resolute' nor were they 'adopted with the express purpose of causing [Resolute] loss.'318 The Claimant refutes the contention that it has alleged 'a grand, far-fetched conspiracy'. It simply states its case that the Nova Scotia Measures sought to make Port Hawkesbury the 'national champion'; even though the measures were not directly aimed at the Claimant, it nonetheless felt a direct impact from them.319 As was the case in *Cargill*, the Nova Scotia Measures were intended to harm an identifiable class of competitors, of whom 'Resolute was the lone foreign investor in Canada.'320 This, the Claimant submits, is sufficient to establish the necessary 'causal nexus' required by Article 1101(1).321\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 118.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 120-121.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 122; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 349:19-350:9.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 122.\n\n215.\n\nAt the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, the Claimant relied on the following documentary evidence to 'show the inextricable connection between [the Nova Scotia Measures] and the sale to Pacific West and making Pacific West the lowest cost producer in North America,'322 and to substantiate its submission that the Nova Scotia Measures 'relate to' the Claimant and the Laurentide mill:\n\ni. a CBC news report from September 2011 in which various individuals expressed the intention to sell the Port Hawkesbury mill as a going concern, despite the fact it was suffering 'significant operating losses' of around $50 million in operating losses per year. This report, the Claimant says, demonstrates the lengths to which Nova Scotia would support the Port Hawkesbury mill in order to ensure its ongoing viability. In this regard, reference in this report to the Forestry Infrastructure Fund shows that it was a measure required for the sale of the Port Hawkesbury mill and is not unrelated to the Claimant and the Laurentide mill.323\n\nii. a press release from Nova Scotia in which the Premier explains that 'the province had a role to play to make [the sale of Port Hawkesbury] a success. That the province took every reasonable step to keep this mill resale ready and facilitate the reopening', particularly through the hot idle funding.324\n\niii. various statements including: (a) of the Premier to the effect that the Forestry Infrastructure Fund was intended to keep the Port Hawkesbury mill 'resale ready';325 (b) of the Court appointed Monitor that the hot idle funding 'permit[s] a smooth resumption of production when circumstances permit';326 and (c) a press release from the Premier 'when they announced the actual financial package, this is mentioned simply as part of the support for making [Port Hawkesbury] the national champion.'327\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 444:1-6.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 444:15-450:10, referring to *NewPage Port Hawkesbury mill to be sold, CBC News*, September 7, 2011 (**C-005**).\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 450:15-451:25, referring to Nova Scotia Press Release, Province Standing with Strait after Announcement Mill Will Not Reopen, September 21, 2012 (**C-035**).\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 452:11-453:11, referring to Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, News Release, 'Province Presents Forestry Infrastructure Plan', September 20, 2011 (**R-039**).\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 453:12-454:1, referring to Re NewPage Port Hawkesbury Corp., Report of the Proposed Monitor (S.C.N.S.), September 7, 2011 (**R-046**); see also 454:2455:5 referring to Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, News Release, 'Province Will Keep NewPage Mill in Point Tupper Re-Sale Ready', January 4, 2012 (**R-048**).\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 455:6-458:3 referring to Nova Scotia Press Release, Province Invests in Jobs, Training, and Renewing the Forestry Sector, August 20, 2012 (**C-009**).\n\n216.\n\nNotwithstanding the Claimant's submission in relation to the inappropriateness of the *Methanex* 'legally significant connection' test, the Claimant submits that it would nevertheless meet the requirements of such a test if this Tribunal were to apply it.328 This is because the intent or purpose of the Nova Scotia Measures was 'not only to make PHP the lowest cost SC paper producer, but also to push higher-cost producers out of business.'329 The desire to give PHP such a competitive advantage necessarily implies an intention to harm foreign investors, such intention being sufficient to satisfy the 'legally significant connection' test espoused in *Methanex*.330\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 153; Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, paras 123-124.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 155.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 152-156.\n\n217.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the public spending measures implemented by Nova Scotia were 'designed to intervene in a competitive market and alter it to the advantage of the government's chosen champion.'331 Contrary to the Respondent's contention that 'a flood of claims by innumerable investors' could materialize 'if NAFTA Chapter Eleven applied every time government spending had an impact on market conditions', the Claimant submits that NAFTA Parties are permitted to 'spend public funds in a way that incidentally impacts market conditions' but 'may not spend public monies deliberately, or with the unavoidable expectation, of undermining foreign investors or their investments.'332\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 159.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 162.\n\n**4. The Non-Disputing NAFTA Parties' Comments**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nThe United States and Mexico both endorse the finding of the *Methanex* tribunal that the words 'relating to' in Article 1101(1) require a 'legally significant connection' between the impugned measures and the claimant or its investment.333 Both Non-Disputing NAFTA Parties further submit that if the 'relating to' requirement were satisfied by a 'mere, or incidental, effect that a challenged measure had on a claimant', an indeterminate number of investors may be entitled to bring claims under NAFTA and so the words 'relating to' would impose no threshold at all.334\n\nUnited States Submission, para 12; Mexico Submission, paras 8, 11.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 12; Mexico Submission, para 9.\n\n219.\n\nThe United States submits further that the question of whether a 'challenged measure bears a \"legally significant connection\" to a foreign investor or investment depends on the facts of a given case' but does require a 'direct connection between the challenged measure and the foreign investor or investment', not a mere 'negative impact' on the investor or investment.335 The United States notes that such a connection was found in *SD Myers* since the relevant measure 'was raised to address specifically the operations of SDMI and its investment'. In *Bilcon* there was clearly a 'legally significant connection' between the measure that rejected the claimant's investment. In *Cargill*, the import permit requirement 'directly affected' the claimant by imposing a 'legal impediment' on the conduct of its business.336 The United States notes that while a 'legally significant connection' was not found in *Methanex*, the tribunal speculated that such a connection would have existed had the claimant been able to prove that the 'Governor of California *intended* to penalize foreign producers of methanol (such as the claimant).'337\n\nUnited States Submission, para 13.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 14, citing *S.D. Myers, Inc. v Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, November 13, 2000, para 234 ('***SD Myers*****, Partial Award**'); *Bilcon*, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, paras 5, 12, 237, 239 and 241; and *Cargill*, Award, paras 173, 175.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 14, referring to *Methanex*, Partial Award, paras 151-159.\n\n220.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the NAFTA Parties all agree that to satisfy the 'relating to' requirement in Article 1101, a claimant must demonstrate that 'legally significant connection' exists between the challenged measures and the investor or its investment, and that something more than a 'negative impact' on the investor is required.338 The Respondent further agrees with the United States that Article 1101 was not meant to allow 'untold numbers of domestic measures that simply have an economic impact on a foreign investor or its investment' to meet the threshold.339\n\nCanada's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, paras 26-27.\n\nCanada's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, para 28.\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimant points out that the United States highlights that whether a measure is one 'relating to' an investment or investor 'depends on the facts of a given case'.340 The Claimant then recalls that the alleged purpose of the Nova Scotia Measures was to make Port Hawkesbury the national champion of the SC paper industry, necessarily to Resolute's detriment and that these facts, accepted *pro tem* by Canada for purposes of bifurcation, are 'sufficient to satisfy the Article 1101 standard'. Any findings on the facts for the Tribunal to make on this issue go to the merits of Resolute's claims.341 The Claimant also addresses concerns expressed by the United States that recognition of a claim would result in 'unlimited liability', by pointing out that the class of affected investors in the present case is narrowly confined.342\n\nClaimant's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, paras 20-23.\n\nClaimant's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, para 22.\n\nClaimant's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, paras 22-23.\n\n**5. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) The 'relating to' requirement: general considerations**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe term 'relating to' in Article 1101 of NAFTA would appear to require that the measure complained of have some specific impact on the claimant: Chapter Eleven was not intended as a vehicle for public interest litigation. Beyond that, however, Article 1101's limits are not very clear, and it is not a substitute for the specific requirements of other provisions of Chapter Eleven.\n\n223.\n\nUnder Article 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, when the ordinary meaning of a treaty text leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, the interpreter may have recourse to the preparatory work.343 In the earliest versions of Article 1101, dated December 1991, the investment chapter's scope referred to measures 'affecting' either investments of another party in the host state's territory or 'affecting' investors.344 By August 1992 the text was changed to 'relating to'. The drafts do not provide any explanation as to the modification.345\n\nArbitrator Cass, without diverging from the Tribunal's analysis, would use great caution in according weight to sources other than the text accepted by the signatory Parties.\n\nINVEST, December 1991, 1, Article 2101, 401.\n\nINVEST.826, Lawyers' Revision (August 26, 1992) 1, Article 2101 (**RL-045**).\n\n224.\n\nCanada's Statement of Implementation states that Chapter Eleven applies to:\n\nmeasures by a Party (i.e. any level of government in Canada) that affect: investors of another Party [...]; investments of investors of another Party [...]; and for purposes of the provisions on performance requirements and environmental measures, all investments.346\n\nDepartment of External Affairs, Canadian Statement on Implementation, Canada Gazette Part I, January 1, 1994, 148.\n\n225.\n\nThe United States' Statement of Administrative Action uses different language, paraphrasing this element of Article 1101(1), stating simply that, subject to exceptions 'the chapter applies to all governmental measures relating to investment...'347\n\nUS Statement of Administrative Action, 450.\n\n226.\n\nA number of tribunals have had the opportunity to analyze the 'relating to' requirement.\n\n227.\n\nIn *Ethyl Corporation*, Canada argued that the prohibition to import and trade a gasoline additive was not a measure relating to investment but one relating to the movement of goods. In rejecting the argument, the tribunal observed that Canada did not cite any authority, and did not elaborate any argument for a restrictive interpretation of the 'relating to' requirement.348\n\n*Ethyl Corporation v Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, June 24, 1998, para 63.\n\n228.\n\nIn *Pope & Talbot*, Canada contended that the implementation of the Canada-US Softwood Lumber Agreement did not relate to investments or investors but to trade in goods. The tribunal dismissed this argument. Among other things, it denied that a measure could be characterized as 'relating to' one subject matter to the exclusion of all others.349\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award in relation to Preliminary Motion by Canada, January 26, 2000, para 33 (**CL-002**).\n\n229.\n\nIn *SD Myers*, the applicant complained of a Canadian order prohibiting the export of PCB waste to the United States. The tribunal found that the 'relating to' requirement in Chapter Eleven was satisfied because the import ban was passed to address specifically the prospect that SDMI would carry through with its plans to expand its Canadian operations.350\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v Government of Canada*, Partial Award, November 13, 2000, para 234.\n\n230.\n\nIn *Methanex*, the claimant was a producer and marketer of methanol, a key raw material in the manufacture of the gasoline additive MTBE. The challenged measure was California's ban on the use of MTBE. In partially rejecting jurisdiction, the tribunal decided that there must be a legally significant connection between the questioned measure and the investor or its investment. Specifically, it said:\n\n... The possible consequences of human conduct are infinite, especially when comprising acts of governmental agencies; but common sense does not require that line to run unbroken towards an endless horizon. In a traditional legal context, somewhere the line is broken; and whether as a matter of logic, social policy or other value judgment, a limit is necessarily imposed restricting the consequences for which that conduct is to be held accountable. For example, in the law of tort, there must be a reasonable connection between the defendant, the complainant, the defendant's conduct and the harm suffered by the complainant; and limits are imposed by legal rules on duty, causation and remoteness of damage well-known in the laws of both the United States and Canada. Likewise, in the law of contract, the contract-breaker is not generally liable for all the consequences of its breach even towards the innocent party, still less to persons not privy to that contract. It is of course possible, by contract or statute, to enlarge towards infinity the legal consequences of human conduct; but against this traditional legal background, it would require clear and explicit language to achieve this result.\n\n... there must be a legally significant connection between the measure and the investor or the investment. With such an interpretation, it is perhaps not easy to define the exact dividing line, just as it is not easy in twilight to see the divide between night and day. Nonetheless, whilst the exact line may remain undrawn, it should still be possible to determine on which side of the divide a particular claim must lie.351\n\n*Methanex*, Partial Award, paras 138-9.\n\n231.\n\nBased on that reasoning, the tribunal determined that the meaning of the phrase 'relating to' in Article 1101(1) went beyond the simple effect of a measure on an investor or an investment and required a legally significant connection between them.352\n\nIbid, para 147.\n\n232.\n\nThus, the tribunal ruled it lacked jurisdiction to hear a claim based upon California's ban on the use of MTBE.353 However, the tribunal stated it could hear a claim based on intent on the part of California's governor to favour domestic ethanol producers over foreign producers of MTBE and methanol.354\n\nIbid, para 150.\n\n*Methanex Corporation v United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Tribunal's Letter re Request for Interpretation of Award, September 25, 2002, para 17.\n\n**(b) Application and critique of** ***Methanex*** **in subsequent cases**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe *Methanex* test was adopted by the tribunals in *Bayview*,355*Cargill*,356*Apotex II*,357*Bilcon*358and *Mesa*.359 While *Bayview* and *Bilcon* did not clarify the meaning of 'legally significant connection', the tribunals in *Cargill*, *Apotex II* and *Mesa* did contribute to a better, though not necessarily consistent, understanding of the test.\n\n*Bayview Irrigation District v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/1, Award, June 19, 2007, para 101. The tribunal decided it lacked jurisdiction because the investors were domestic investors in Texas, not foreign investors in Mexico (para 104).\n\n*Cargill, Incorporated v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, September 18, 2009, para 174. The tribunal held that there was a legally significant connection between an import permit requirement and Cargill's business in Mexico (para 175).\n\n*Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc v United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, August 25, 2014, para 6.13.\n\n*William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, March 17, 2015, para 240.\n\n*Mesa Power Group, LLC v Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award, March 24, 2016, para 259.\n\n234.\n\nIn *Cargill*, the claimant questioned Mexico's imposition of a tax on soft drinks containing HFCS and its failure to issue import permits. Mexico argued that the import permit requirement was a trade measure, not an investment measure.360 The tribunal considered that *Methanex* imposed two requirements: (a) that the questioned measure produce an effect on the investor or its investment; and (b) a 'causal connection requirement': there must be a legally significant connection between the measure and the investors of another party or investments of investors of another party.361 In that regard, the tribunal said that although the import permit requirement notionally prevented the claimant's goods from crossing the border from the United States into Mexico, the permit directly 'affected' the business of Cargill de Mexico.362 The tribunal also understood that the import permit requirement constituted a legal impediment to carrying on the business of Cargill de Mexico in sourcing HFCS in the United States and re-selling it in Mexico.363\n\n*Cargill, Incorporated v United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, September 18, 2009, para 170.\n\nIbid, para 174.\n\nIbid, para 173.\n\nIbid, para 175.\n\n235.\n\nWhen reviewing (and upholding) the *Cargill* award, the Ontario Superior Court held that the term 'related' in Article 1101 requires only some connection but not that the measure be adopted with the express purpose of causing loss. The Court said:\n\nWith reference to the threshold issues in Article 1101, Mexico acknowledges that Cargill was an investor, and that CdM was an investment. Clearly the measures adopted by Mexico related to the investor and the investment. The term 'related' requires only some connection and does not require that the measure be adopted with the express purpose of causing loss.364\n\n*United Mexican States v Cargill Inc*, 2010 ONSC 4656, para 57.\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the *Cargill* tribunal did not interpret or apply the 'relating to' threshold in any way differently from *Methanex* :365 while the *Cargill* tribunal used the phrases 'causal connection' and 'causal nexus' requirements, not 'legally significant connection', they share the idea that the measure must have a direct relationship constituting more than a mere effect on an investor or its investment.366 On the other hand, the Claimant considers that Cargill did not have to be the specific target of the measures in order for the tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over its claims; it needed only to be directly affected, for example, by a measure that was intended to protect a local industry and to hurt its competitors elsewhere.367\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, December 22, 2016, para 88; Respondent's Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction, 29 March 2017, para 122.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 125.\n\nClaimants Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 130.\n\n237.\n\nIn *Apotex II*, the claimant complained that the United States had imposed an import alert and detention of certain drugs produced in Canada.368 The tribunal considered that the *Cargill* tribunal applied the same interpretation of Article 1101(1) as in *Methanex* and *Bayview*.369 The tribunal considered that the circumstances of *Apotex II* were similar to those of *Cargill* but not to *Methanex.*370 The facts were similar to *Cargill* in that the immediate effect of the import alert made it impossible for the claimant's company in the host state to receive contracted products from its factories in Canada; as a direct result, the claimant's investment was prevented from carrying on a major part of its business.371 The facts were different from *Methanex,* because there the potential class of investors indirectly affected by the disputed measure was indeterminate and unknown, whereas in *Apotex II* the questioned measure affected the claimant immediately and directly.372\n\n*Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc v United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, August 25, 2014.\n\nIbid, para 6.13.\n\nIbid, para 6.23.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid, para 6.24.\n\n238.\n\nImportantly, contrary to the *Cargill* tribunal's causal connection requirement, the *Apotex II* tribunal thought it 'inappropriate to introduce within NAFTA Article 1101(1) a legal test of causation applicable under Chapter Eleven's substantive provisions for the merits of the Claimants' claims'. The tribunal stated that...\n\nFor jurisdictional purposes, the threshold is necessarily different under NAFTA Article 1101(1), given the ordinary meaning of the connecting phrase 'relating to.'373\n\n... Equally, in the Tribunal's view, it is no answer for the Respondent to invoke different theories as to the legal cause of loss to Apotex-US, other than the Import Alert. That issue may likewise affect issues of liability and quantum; but, again, there is no reason for requiring NAFTA Article 1101(1) to be so narrowly interpreted as to require only a claimant with a successful case on causation to pass through its threshold gateway; or to establish that the disputed measure is the only relevant possible measure.374\n\n... there is a practical problem in seeking to interpret and apply the phrase 'relating to' as a narrow threshold jurisdictional issue without any regard to the substantive NAFTA provisions invoked by a claimant investor in the particular case.375\n\nIbid, para 6.20.\n\nIbid, para 6.26.\n\nIbid, para 6.27.\n\n239.\n\nIn *Mesa*, the claimant questioned certain measures taken in Ontario to promote the generation and consumption of renewable energy in the province.376 In finding the government actions met the Article 1101(1) requirement, the tribunal followed *Cargill*, saying that all of the measures must have a causal nexus with the Claimant or its investment.377\n\n*Mesa Power Group, LLC v Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Award, March 24, 2016, para 254.\n\nIbid, para 259.\n\n240.\n\nThe *Methanex* test has been subject to criticism. The *Methanex* tribunal built its argument by resorting to analogy with the law of state responsibility, contract law and tort law\u2014that is, substantive law. Nevertheless, the tribunal used the test to exclude jurisdiction.378\n\nZ Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims* (CUP, 2009) 244, para 464.\n\n241.\n\nThe *BG* tribunal expressly rejected the *Methanex* test on additional grounds. The tribunal noted that several NAFTA chapters have exceptions to obligations that would not be necessary if measures which did not 'relate to' other NAFTA investors or their investments were already outside its scope.379 However, the *BG* tribunal seems to have understood that the *Methanex* test requires that a questioned measure, on its face, targets an investor.380 Additionally, BG's claim was brought under the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT, not under NAFTA.\n\n*BG Group Plc. v Republic of Argentina*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, December 24, 2007, para 230.\n\nIbid, para 231.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal's conclusion on the applicable test**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nArticle 1101(1) requires that the questioned measure 'relate to' an investor or an investment. Having regard to the preponderant case-law and the convergent views of the three NAFTA Parties (see paragraphs 218-220 above), the Tribunal concludes that there must exist a 'legally significant connection' between the measure and the claimant or its investment. It agrees with the *Apotex II* tribunal in rejecting the application of a legal test of causation. Chapter Eleven's substantive requirements of causation should be analyzed when deciding on the merits of the claim. Rather, the Tribunal should ask whether there was a relationship of apparent proximity between the challenged measure and the claimant or its investment. In doing so, the tribunal should ordinarily accept *pro tem* the facts as alleged. It is not necessary that the measure should have targeted the claimant or its investment\u2014although if it did so, the necessary legal relationship will be established. Nor is it necessary that the measure imposed legal penalties or prohibitions on the investor or the investment itself. However, a measure which adversely affected the claimant in a tangential or merely consequential way will not suffice for this purpose.\n\n**(d) Application to the present claim**\n----------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant complains about Nova Scotia's measures taken for the benefit of PHP.381 Canada argued that 'measures which merely affect an investor and its investment economically do not automatically allow an investor to invoke the protections of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.'382 In principle this is correct, but it is necessary for this purpose to draw a distinction between those measures aimed at maintaining the Port Hawkesbury mill in a condition where it could be offered for sale as a going concern and those involved in the actual transaction of sale and reopening on favourable terms.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 12-21.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on jurisdiction, para 82.\n\n244.\n\nAs to the former, the financial support offered by Nova Scotia to maintain the plant in 'hot idle' condition is key. It did not directly address, target, implicate, or affect the Claimant. Had the financial support not resulted in a sale of the plant as a going concern, it would have had no impact at all on Claimant or other producers of supercalendered paper. The cost to Nova Scotia of keeping the plant in 'hot idle' condition may or may not have been justified from a fiscal point of view but it maintained the plant's value and preserved the possibility of reopening, with consequent preservation of local employment opportunities. It was in no way a measure relating to the Claimant's investment in different plants, in a different province. Similar considerations apply to the other Nova Scotia measures taken during the period of administration of the company, including the FIF. Applying the principle as articulated in paragraph 242, these pre-sale measures fall outside the scope of Article 1101(1) of NAFTA and cannot form part of the present claim.\n\n245.\n\nThe position as concerns the actual terms of sale is arguably different. PWCC's winning bid of C$33 million had attached to it a number of conditions, notably concerning financial benefits offered or approved by Nova Scotia, including (a) C$124.5 million in loans (not under market conditions) and other payments; (b) tax savings in Nova Scotia for assets in other provinces; (c) municipal tax breaks; and (d) an electricity discount.383\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 21. [This footnote, along with the name of the mill in para. 330 below, were corrected by the Tribunal on 5 March 2018 pursuant to Art. 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules. The corrections have been incorporated into this consolidated electronic version of the Decision].\n\n246.\n\nAt the time of the measures there were only five companies in the business of producing supercalendered paper in the whole of North America. The measures allowed Port Hawkesbury to produce at a lower cost than it could have otherwise done. The Claimant argues that the total production capacity of the market increased, competition increased and market prices were, after a brief interval, driven down.\n\n247.\n\nTo determine whether these measures 'related to' the investor or its investment, the questions which need to be answered are: (a) is it possible that the benefits afforded to Port Hawkesbury might have allowed it to produce at a lower cost than its competitors?; (b) if so, is it possible that prices were reduced as a consequence?; (c) if so, is it possible that in a five-company market competitors might have incurred significant losses as a consequence?; and (d) if so, in a five-company market, is a significant business loss in Qu\u00e9bec proximate to benefits provided for a company in Nova Scotia? Positive answers to these four questions would in the Tribunal's view justify a finding that the questioned measures 'related to' the Claimant and its investment.\n\n248.\n\nThe Respondent stressed that the Measures did not target or discriminate against the Claimant or apply to it at all. But they were intended to put the purchaser in a favourable position, and in a small and saturated market it was to be expected that competitors would be affected. The Tribunal finds it unnecessary and inappropriate to parse the facts further at this preliminary stage: to do so risks intruding on issues of substance. The Tribunal regards the case as close to the line, but on balance it would answer each of the four questions identified above in the affirmative. It holds that the sale measures were sufficiently proximate to the Claimant and its investment to satisfy the 'relating to' requirement of Article 1101.\n\n**D. THE PROVINCIAL TREATMENT OBJECTION: NAFTA ARTICLE 1102(3)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n249.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Nova Scotia Measures are incapable of founding a national treatment claim under Article 1102(3). NAFTA Article 1102(3) provides:\n\nThe treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that state or province to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 1102(3) confines the scope of the national treatment obligation, insofar as concerns a component state or province, to treatment afforded to investors within the jurisdiction of that state or province. It does not extend to extraterritorial or extraprovincial treatment. Since the Claimant had no investment in Nova Scotia, there could have been no breach of the national treatment obligation by Nova Scotia in relation to it. The Claimant, for its part, submits that the Respondent's interpretation of Article 1102(3) is too narrow and would diminish the national treatment protection provided by NAFTA since it would exclude measures taken by one state or province that affect foreign investors in other states or provinces.\n\n251.\n\nIf the Respondent's objection is successful, it would dispose of the Claimant's national treatment claim in its entirety.384\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, Decision on Bifurcation, November 18, 2016, para 4.19.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Respondent refers to *Merrill & Ring* as the 'only NAFTA dispute [to date] in which the issue of cross-jurisdictional comparison has arisen.'385 In that case, the tribunal rejected a comparison between treatment provided by the federal Government of Canada and the provincial government of British Columbia, holding:\n\nTreatment accorded to foreign investors by the national government needs to be compared to that accorded by the same government to domestic investors [...] just as the treatment accorded by a province ought to be compared to the treatment of that province in respect of like investments.386\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 120.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 120, citing *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL) Award, March 31, 2010, para 82 (**RL-060**) ('***Merrill & Ring*****, Award**').\n\n253.\n\nThe Respondent considers it unreasoned that the Claimant characterises *Merrill & Ring* as distinguishable on the basis that it is a 'regulatory case'.387 The Respondent also considers the Claimant's reliance on *Bilcon* as erroneous since the tribunal in that case also determined that 'the claimant had the burden of proving that \"a government accorded Bilcon or its investment 'treatment' during the environmental assessment and 'that the *same* government accorded treatment to other domestic [...] investors or investments.\"'388 The Respondent submits that, in fact, 'every single one of the NAFTA national treatment cases relied upon by the Claimant undermines its own argument and proves Canada's point that this Article 1102 claim is inadmissible.'389\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 121; Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 157.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 122, citing *Bilcon*, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, para 717.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 159.\n\n254.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's complaint that 'it should have been accorded the same treatment in Qu\u00e9bec that Nova Scotia accorded to PWCC' is precluded by virtue of Article 1102(3).390 The Respondent points out that the Claimant 'has not identified any treatment it received directly as an investor in Canada [...] [nor] any treatment that it received within the jurisdiction of the province of Nova Scotia' and, therefore, the claim must fail.391\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 124.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 125.\n\n255.\n\nThe Respondent considers the Claimant's case as enunciated in its Counter-Memorial to demonstrate the 'fundamental illogic of its position'.392 The Respondent submits that plainly the Claimant's complaint that it was not afforded like treatment by Nova Scotia 'falls apart' since 'Nova Scotia cannot accord treatment to an investor over which it has no jurisdiction.'393 The Respondent submits that there is no 'treatment' by Nova Scotia of Resolute or the Laurentide mill, only treatment of third parties, forestry workers and First Nations industries and, as such, the claim under Article 1102 must necessarily fail.394 The Respondent points out that the Nova Scotia Measures covering 'the subject matters of property tax, hydro-electricity, and the management and disposition of provincial Crown land' are matters within the competence of the provincial government and are 'limited by its territorial jurisdiction, as defined by its geographic boundaries.'395 Accordingly, Nova Scotia simply has no competence to enact measures relating to Resolute's investment in Qu\u00e9bec.396\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 146.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 146; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 26:20-23.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 148; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 244:23-245:14.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 151.\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 151; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 245:15-21.\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent argues that acceptance of the Claimant's reading of Article 1102 would lead to the radical result that treatment by one state or province would permit a foreign investor in any other state or province to bring a national treatment claim against the federal government, meaning that 'the measure of a single state would automatically become the standard of treatment by which the remaining [...] states are held.'397\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 160.\n\n257.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant is attempting to 'get around what 1102(3) would not allow them to do [...] by saying that there was treatment accorded to them even though Nova Scotia could never have offered them the same treatment.'398 By reference to Judge Higgins' opinion in *Oil Platforms*, the Respondent alleges that the impugned conduct is not capable of constituting a breach of the NAFTA since a factual predicate is missing, and therefore the Respondent invites the Tribunal to determine that the claim is inadmissible.399\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 427:5-22.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 428:2-429:2. See *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America), ICJ Reports 1996, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, addressing the methodology for determining whether a particular claim falls within the compromissory clause of a treaty.\n\n258.\n\nFinally, the Respondent considers the Claimant's arguments regarding the meaning of 'in like circumstances' to be premature since this question ought not be answered in the jurisdiction and admissibility phase and can only be considered once the Tribunal determines whether the Claimant's Article 1102 claim is permissible.400\n\nRespondent's Reply Memorial, para 162.\n\n**3. The Claimant's Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent has shifted its interpretation of Article 1102(3) from being a 'geographic limitation precluding Resolute from making any national treatment claims with respect to Canadian investments located outside of Nova Scotia' to one referring to a 'metaphysical \"jurisdiction\"' which 'renders inadmissible claims that seek to compare treatment accorded by one government to the treatment accorded by a different government.'401 However, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's reformulated argument is 'irrelevant here' because the Claimant 'is not asking this Tribunal to compare treatment accorded by one province to treatment accorded by another province' or some other level of government.402\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 163-165; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 368:14-372:2.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 166; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 41:23-42:2.\n\n260.\n\nRather, the Claimant submits that its national treatment claim under Article 1102 deals with 'whether the treatment Nova Scotia accorded to Resolute is no less favourable than the treatment Nova Scotia accorded to PHP, when the purpose of the Nova Scotia Measures was to help PHP compete with Resolute in the SC paper business sector and in markets that they share in common.'403 The Claimant alleges that the Respondent's supposition 'that a province cannot accord treatment to foreign investors outside of the province's geographical or jurisdictional confines' is both legally and factually untrue.404\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 168; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 42:21-43:10.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 169; Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 129.\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimant submits that accepting the Respondent's 'narrow interpretation' of Article 1102(3) would permit provincial governments to favour local companies over competitors who are not physically located in the same province.405 Such an interpretation would require this Tribunal to read in additional words to the plain words of Article 1102(3) chosen by the NAFTA Parties and would run contrary to the objectives of NAFTA as they are promoted by the national treatment standard.406 The Claimant submits that measures undertaken to the benefit of a local investor and the detriment of a foreign investor operating elsewhere in Canada should properly be considered as 'treatment' under Article 1102.407\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 173-174.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 177-179; Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 140; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 390:18-391:20.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 131.\n\n262.\n\nIn fact, Nova Scotia did not see itself as limited to granting PWCC benefits within the jurisdiction, but also 'extended tax benefits to PWCC for assets outside Nova Scotia, thus reaching deliberately beyond its own borders, although still within Canada, to discriminate.'408 The Claimant alleges that 'Canada knew that it was responsible for the conduct of Nova Scotia and that Nova Scotia's conduct would have continent-wide consequences' and was 'put on notice of the extra-territorial impact of the Nova Scotia Measures' by the Claimant itself and the United States through the WTO.409 The Claimant alleges that despite this knowledge, Canada chose to defend and protect Nova Scotia's discriminatory measures that are 'contrary to the object and purpose of NAFTA.'410\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 182.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 184.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 185-186.\n\n263.\n\nThe size of Port Hawkesbury in the market made it obvious that the Nova Scotia Measures would necessarily have an impact and 'were intended to confer a comparative advantage on a domestic competitor, to the detriment of the foreign investor in the same business sector, which was not limited to the territory of Nova Scotia.'411 Accordingly, the Claimant submits that 'by distorting market competition, the Nova Scotia measures had extra provincial effects that constituted \"treatment\" for Resolute.'412\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 379:9-380:22.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 381:4-8.\n\n264.\n\nThe Claimant refers to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of NAFTA Chapter Eleven to the effect that the NAFTA Parties 'reject[ed] wording that would have restricted national treatment obligations of states and provinces to treatment of foreign investors physically within the province or state' but instead 'deliberately chose wording that did not allow a state or province to deny most favourable treatment to a foreign investor in like circumstances as the provincial investor solely because it was located in another state or province of the same country.'413\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 187-188; Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial, para 141; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 391:21-395:21.\n\n265.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the issue for this Tribunal to resolve is whether Resolute has been accorded 'national treatment' by Nova Scotia and Canada.414 This requires the Tribunal to assess whether the Claimant has been treated no less favourably than its Canadian competitors 'in like circumstances'.415 The Claimant submits that 'like circumstances' must be 'determined on a case-by-case basis' and, in past NAFTA cases, have been assessed according to the relevant 'economic and business sector, not geography or subnational jurisdiction.'416\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 189.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 189.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 190.\n\n266.\n\nThe Claimant finds support for this submission in the *SD Myers*, *Pope & Talbot*, *Archer Daniels Midland*, and *Cargill* decisions. The Claimant submits that these cases represent a consistent line of authority where each NAFTA tribunal has determined that the relevant comparison required by the words 'like circumstances' in Article 1102 relates to whether both comparators operate in the same business or economic sector.417\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 191-200.\n\n267.\n\nIn this case, the Claimant says that it is in 'like circumstances' to PHP because it is a competitor in the same North American SC paper market, not because of physical location in the same province.418 The Claimant submits that 'NAFTA jurisprudence has never gone as far' as to assert that the national treatment obligation relating to provincial measures requires comparison only with the treatment of other investors within that province.419 The Claimant seeks to distinguish this case from the decision in *Merrill & Ring* relied upon by the Respondent on the basis that the measures in the present case were not 'regulatory' but 'were intended to confer an advantage on a domestic competitor to the detriment of the foreign investor in the same business sector', such business sector not being limited to the province of Nova Scotia.420 In this case, the Claimant does not ask the Tribunal to compare the conduct of two different levels of government, as was the case in *Merrill & Ring*, but rather to compare the treatment of the Claimant and PHP by the Nova Scotia Government.421\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, paras 180-181.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 201.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 204; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 398:14-20.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 205; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 395:23-396:20.\n\n268.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimant recalls the following comments of the *Cargill* tribunal:\n\nThe Claimant's mills [in *GAMI* ] were certainly treated differently, but they were not the target of a measure to drive them out of business. But, here, the measure and the effect are different from *GAMI*. If the *GAMI* principle could be used to justify a measure that destroys an economically viable foreign investment in order to benefit a domestic competitor, the national treatment protection in Article 1102 would be meaningless.422\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 208, citing *Cargill*, Award, para 210.\n\n269.\n\nThe Claimant submits that similarly, reliance by this Tribunal on the *Merrill & Ring* principle would render Article 1102 meaningless since Nova Scotia's stated intention to make PHP the lowest cost SC paper producer 'could be achieved only through the introduction of discriminatory measures.'423\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 209.\n\n**4. The Non-Disputing NAFTA Parties' Comments**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe United States submits that the Article 1102 obligation 'prohibits nationality-based discrimination between domestic and foreign investors (or investments of foreign and domestic investors) that are \"in like circumstances\"', but does not impose an obligation to 'provide nationally uniform treatment.'424 Specifically, 'Article 1102(3) pertains to state and provincial measures only' and ensures that investors from NAFTA Parties are afforded the better of: (1) treatment accorded by a state or province to in-state (or in-province) investors or their investment; and (2) treatment accorded to domestic out-of-state (or out-of-province) investors or their investments.425\n\nUnited States Submission, para 15.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 16.\n\n271.\n\nThe United States submits that Article 1102(3) does not prevent a state or province from implementing measures that apply only to investors or investments in that state or province.426 The United States contends that 'an investor cannot rest its claim under Article 1102(3) on the fact that a domestic enterprise operating in another state or province receives a different or greater benefit or is subject to a different or lesser burden unless it is \"in like circumstances\" with that enterprise.'427 Whether the measures discriminate against a foreign investor 'in like circumstances' on the basis of their nationality will be a 'fact-specific inquiry at the merits phase.'428\n\nUnited States Submission, para 17.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 17.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 17.\n\n272.\n\nMexico agrees with Canada's submission that the NAFTA Parties did not intend by Article 1102(3) that 'the treatment by one state or province would become the national standard for the entire country.'429\n\nMexico Submission, para 13, citing Respondent's Reply Memorial, para 161.\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent does not disagree with the United States that an analysis of whether a foreign and domestic investor are 'in like circumstances' is a question for the merits. It points out, however, that such an analysis presumes there has been actual treatment accorded to the investor or its investment by the state or province in question in order for the claim to be admissible. In this respect, the Respondent states that 'absent any evidence of a link between Nova Scotia and the investor, the claim cannot even meet the *prima facie* basis of admissibility and can therefore be dismissed at this preliminary stage.'430\n\nCanada's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, para 33.\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the United States recognizes that proof of national treatment under Article 1102(3) requires a 'fact-specific inquiry at the merits phase' and states that such an inquiry 'by definition' cannot be made at this stage of the arbitration.431 Thus, the Claimant concludes that the US position is consistent with its own position, and, based on an examination of like circumstances, is contrary to Canada's categorical argument that a claim under Article 1102(3) in respect of a provincial measure is unavailable to an investor without an investment in that province.432\n\nClaimant's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, paras 25-26.\n\nIbid, paras 26-27.\n\n**5. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) The legal framework**\n---------------------------\n\n275.\n\nArticle 1102 of NAFTA, the national treatment clause, provides that each party must accord to investors of another party and to investments of investors of another party treatment no less favourable than it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors or their investments with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.433\n\nArticle 1102 paras 1 & 2, NAFTA.\n\n276.\n\nIn the present phase of this arbitration, the relevant measures were taken by Nova Scotia and not by the federal government. For those situations, Article 1102(3) of NAFTA provides that:\n\nThe treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that state or province to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.\n\n277.\n\nThe interpretation of Article 1102(3) is not without its difficulties. The underlying question is whether, in order to apply the national treatment standard, the NAFTA investor or its investment must already be present or intend to be present in the province. Or is it enough that the NAFTA investor or its investment is located within any part of the host state as long as it is accorded 'treatment' by the province?\n\n278.\n\nNAFTA's preamble and articles give limited help. The preamble expresses the NAFTA Parties' resolve to 'reduce the distortions to trade'. Provincial measures that give preference to in-province or domestic investors could be understood as distortions to trade. In light of the preamble, Article 1102(3) could be understood as prohibiting that a state or province accords treatment less favourable than the most favourable treatment it accords, in like circumstances, to investors, and to investments of investors. As long as there is treatment of the investor/investment by the state or province, it should not matter whether those distortions produce effects inside or outside the state or province which applied the questioned measure.\n\n279.\n\nThe initial proposal for what became Article 1102(3) was included in the December 1991 negotiating text. Specifically regarding Article 1102(3), the parties' proposals were as follows:\n\ni. The Mexican version read: 'shall mean, with respect to a province or state, treatment no less favorable than that granted by such province or state to any investor of that province or state.'434\n\nii. The US proposal was similar: 'The treatment accorded by a Party [under XX01 with\n\nrespect to nationals and companies, and under XX02 with respect to investments] shall, in any state or political subdivision, be no less favorable than the treatment accorded by such state or political subdivision to its residents, or companies legally constituted under its laws, or their investments in its territory.'435\n\niii. Canada's proposal said: 'treatment by a province or state shall be: no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded by such province or state to any like goods, services and service providers, investors and suppliers, as the case maybe [ *sic* ], of the Party of which it forms a part.'436\n\nINVEST, December 1991, 2-3, Article 2103.\n\nINVEST, December 1991, 3.\n\nINVEST, December 1991, 3, Article 105.\n\n280.\n\nBy April 1992 Mexico also joined the pertinent part of the United States' proposal437 with respect to political subdivisions.438 At that point the United States and Mexico supported one formulation while Canada supported another. On July 10, 1992, the three Parties agreed on a text. The text adopted a formulation close to the United States-Mexico proposal:439\n\nThe treatment accorded by a Party under this paragraph with respect to investors of another Party and their investments shall be, with respect to a state or province, no less favorable than the treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by such state or province to its residents, or entities legally constituted under its laws, or their investments in its territory.440\n\nMexico first did not endorse the US language that extended the obligation to any 'state or political subdivision' (March 1992). Later, Mexico agreed to extend obligations to 'states' but not to other 'political subdivisions' (6 April draft). See M Kinnear, A Bjorklund & J Hannaford, *Investment Disputes under NAFTA: An Annotated Guide to NAFTA Chapter 11* (Kluwer, 2006), 1102-6.\n\nINVEST.403, Washington Composite (Apr. 3, 1992) 10.\n\nINVEST.710, All-Star Composite (July 10, 1992) 4.\n\nIbid.\n\n281.\n\nOn July 22, 1992 a new text of the political subdivisions section was agreed:\n\nThe treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 shall mean, with respect to a state or province, treatment no less favourable than the treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by such state or province to its residents, or enterprises legally constituted under its laws, or their investments in its territory.441\n\nThat is to say, the 22 July version set forth that the baseline treatment owed to a NAFTA investor was that accorded by the host state's province to its in-province investors. On August 4, 1992 the parties agreed on a further version, almost identical to the final text.442 That text replaced the reference to 'by such state or province to its residents, or enterprises legally constituted under its laws, or their investments in its territory' by 'treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded by such state or province in like circumstances to investors of the Party of which it forms a part.' That is to say, the baseline treatment owed to a NAFTA investor was not only to be that accorded by the host State's province to its in-province investors, but could include out-of-province domestic investors and their investments. This conclusion, however, does not provide an answer to the Respondent's argument to the effect that Nova Scotia provided no treatment to the Claimant because it does not operate or is not located in that province.\n\nINVEST.722 July 22, 1992, 4.\n\nINVEST.805, Watergate Daily Update, August 4, 1992, 3.\n\n282.\n\nAs regards the NAFTA Parties' views of the final text, Canada's Statement on Implementation reads:443\n\nNational treatment means that Canada will treat US and Mexican investors and their investments as favourably as it treats Canadian investors and their investments, in like circumstances [...] National treatment by state, provincial, and local governments is defined as the best treatment provided by that government to any investor or investment...\n\nCanada's Statement does not distinguish between in-province, out-of-province and foreign investors.\n\nDepartment of External Affairs, Canadian Statement on Implementation, Canada Gazette Part I, June 1, 1994, 148-149.\n\n283.\n\nThe United States' Statement of Administrative Action reads:444\n\n... the treatment provided by state and provincial governments to investors from other NAFTA countries and their investments must be no less favourable than the most favourable treatment they provide to domestic investors and their investments.\n\nUnder the United States' Statement, the standard of treatment is what state and provincial governments provide to any domestic investor. Neither statement, however, provides an answer to Canada's arguments on the absence of treatment.\n\nUS Statement of Administrative Action, 141.\n\n**(b) NAFTA jurisprudence**\n---------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThree cases have dealt with issues close to but not exactly the same as the present one.\n\n285.\n\nIn *SD Myers*, the questioned measure was Canada's order prohibiting the export of polychlorinated biphenyl ('**PCB**') waste to the United States. The measure had been taken by the federal government.445 The tribunal, explaining Article 1102(3), said: 'in that context the relevant comparison is between the treatment accorded to an investment or an investor and the best treatment accorded to investments or investors within the jurisdiction of the sub-national authority.'446 This would require that a province provide a foreign investor the best treatment accorded to investors within the jurisdiction of that province. However, this comment was by way of *obiter dicta*.\n\n*SD Myers, Inc v Government of Canada*, Partial Award, November 13, 2000, para 123.\n\nIbid, para 240.\n\n286.\n\nIn *Pope & Talbot*, the dispute arose out of Canada's implementation of the Softwood Lumber Agreement between Canada and the United States. The Agreement established a limit on the free export of softwood lumber into the United States and required Canada to collect a fee for export of softwood lumber in excess of a set quantity.447 Canada argued that (a) the plural form of the language of Article 1102(2) placed a single investment outside its scope or required a claimant to demonstrate that there were other similarly-situated foreign investments; and (b) the plural form required a comparison of the treatment provided to the foreign investor with that accorded to more than one domestically owned investment. The tribunal rejected both arguments,448 on the ground that 'use of the plural form does not, without more, prevent application of statutory or treaty language to an individual case.'449\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc v Canada*, UNCITRAL, Memorial of the Investor (Initial Phase), January 28, 2000, paras 16-39.\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc v Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001, para 36.\n\nIbid, para 37.\n\n287.\n\nCanada also argued that NAFTA treats the two levels of government differently, imposing more rigorous restraints on provinces.450 Once again, the tribunal rejected this view. Specifically, the tribunal understood that 'the obligation of a state or province was to provide investments of foreign investors with the best treatment it accords *any* investment of its country, not just the best treatment it accords to investments of *its* investors.'451 Under *Pope & Talbot* neither Canada nor its provinces can comply with NAFTA by according foreign investments less than the most favourable treatment they accord any investment in Canada. But once again, the questioned measures there had been taken at federal level. Article 1102(3) was only discussed in order to compare it with Article 1102(2). The tribunal's reading of Article 1102(3) has no direct application here.\n\nIbid, para 40.\n\nIbid, para 41.\n\n288.\n\nIn *Merrill & Ring*, the claimant questioned Canada's timber export regime, which was implemented through both federal and provincial legislation. Both included a log surplus test prior to authorization of log removal or export from the province.452 The claimant complained that the federal regulations were disadvantageous compared to the provincial ones.453 Canada argued that Article 1102(3) specifically distinguished treatment accorded by a state or province from that of the national government and, thus, the two could not be compared.454 The tribunal understood that the 'treatment accorded to foreign investors by the national government needs to be compared to that accorded by the same government to domestic investors [...] just as the treatment accorded by a province ought to be compared to the treatment of that province in respect of like investments.'455 Thus for the tribunal 'the proper comparison is between investors which are subject to the same regulatory measures under the same jurisdictional authority.'456 The tribunal added that to establish a breach of national treatment, the key is to determine which investors are in like circumstances.457 The tribunal rejected using the better treatment offered by a province as a point of reference to compare the less beneficial federal regime, and thus declined to find a breach of the national treatment standard.458\n\n*Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award, March 31, 2010, paras 26-8.\n\nIbid, paras 61-2.\n\nIbid, para 81.\n\nIbid, para 82.\n\nIbid, para 89.\n\nIbid, para 83.\n\nIbid, para 94.\n\n289.\n\nCanada reads these awards, particularly *Merrill & Ring*, as saying that Article 1102(3) does not allow comparison of Nova Scotia's treatment of investors within its jurisdiction to the treatment received by the claimant from other governments, whether provincial or federal.459 The Claimant argues that the *Merrill & Ring* rationale does not apply to the present case because the facts are different. The Claimant says that the measures taken by Nova Scotia were not restrictions of an industry within its territory and were not regulatory. The measures were intended to confer an advantage on a domestic competitor to the detriment of the foreign investor in the same business sector which was not limited to the province's territory.460\n\nCanada's Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 125.\n\nClaimant's Counter-memorial on Jurisdiction, para 204.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal's conclusions**\n----------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the NAFTA parties that Article 1102(3) should not be read so as to impose, vis-\u00e0-vis foreign investments, a requirement of uniformity of treatment by the different component units of the three federal States which are Parties to NAFTA. It agrees with the tribunal in *Merrill & Ring* that Article 1102(3) only applies to 'the same regulatory measures under the same jurisdictional authority'. But it does not follow that Canada's argument limiting the effective scope of the national treatment obligation to investments located within the particular province should be accepted. Examples can be imagined of protective measures taken for the benefit of local investors while effectively keeping NAFTA investors or their investments out. Whether this would involve a breach of Article 1102 would depend on the circumstances, including the application of the 'like circumstances' requirement. But there seems no doubt that there *could* be a breach of the national treatment obligation in such case. The same would be true in a *Methanex* -type scenario if the out-of-province investor had been the specific target of a provincial campaign to cause it loss. The situation is not limited necessarily to a scenario where there has been a single specific target. While the Claimant does not suggest that it was specifically targeted by the Nova Scotia measures, it is open to it to establish on the merits a breach of Article 1102 on some other basis.\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal also stresses that it is not called on in this phase of the proceedings to discuss the application of the 'like circumstances' test to the present case. Nor is it necessary to discuss in further detail here the meaning of 'treatment' in Article 1102.\n\n292.\n\nFor these reasons and on this basis, the Tribunal rejects Canada's preliminary objection based on Article 1102(3).\n\n**E. JURISDICTION OVER THE EXPROPRIATION CLAIM UNDER THE** ***O****IL** **P****LATFORMS*** **TEST**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal has held that the Claimant's expropriation claim is not time-barred, on the ground that the expropriation, if there was one, could not have occurred until October 2014. But that claim requires more careful scrutiny, given that the last Nova Scotia measure of which the Claimant complains occurred in September 2012 and that the Claimant retained complete control of the Laurentide mill until it was closed and sold more than two years later.461\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 113.\n\n294.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent constructively expropriated the Laurentide mill by destroying the value of the investment.462 The Claimant goes on to say that: (a) there was no valid public purpose for the expropriation, since provincial protectionism is not a legitimate public purpose;463 (b) the expropriation was discriminatory because Nova Scotia favoured a domestically-owned, in-province mill over foreign-owned out-of-province mills, without any regard to principles of fair market competition;464 (c) the expropriation was taken in disregard of international standards of due process;465 and (d) the Claimant received no compensation.466\n\nNotice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, paras 88, 90.\n\nNotice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 94.\n\nNotice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 95.\n\nNotice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 96.\n\nNotice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, para 97.\n\n295.\n\nThe Respondent replies that the questioned measures cannot be construed as an indirect expropriation: (a) sales and market share cannot be expropriated;467 (b) the questioned measures are not the proximate cause of alleged damages;468 (c) neither Canada nor Nova Scotia substantially deprived the Claimant of its investment; and (d) the Claimant remained in control of the mill at all times.469\n\nCanada's Statement of Defence, para 82.\n\nCanada's Statement of Defence, para 83.\n\nCanada's Statement of Defence, para 83.\n\n296.\n\nAt the hearing, following a question from the Presiding Arbitrator, counsel for Canada referred to Judge Higgins' separate opinion in *Oil Platforms* as having addressed whether or not, on the facts as pled, the alleged conduct is capable of constituting a breach.470 He continued:\n\nwith respect to the expropriation claim, our view is that it's not capable of doing it because the alleged expropriation was not done by the state. It was done by a private actor. Similarly, here, it's not capable of constituting a breach because the language of 1102(3), the factual predicate that a province accord treatment to the investor is not here, and it couldn't be here because they're in a different province.471\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 428:2-429:2. See also Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 132:20-132:24.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 428:2-429:2. See also Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 132:20-133:7.\n\n297.\n\nBy contrast, counsel for the Claimant did not consider *Oil Platforms* to provide a basis for arguing inadmissibility for the purpose of Article 1101:\n\n[Article] 1101 is not a claim-related procedure. 1101 is very clear. It just requires Claimant to establish that the measures are related to their investment. It doesn't say that you can use that to short-circuit an analysis of the claims.472\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 16, 2017, 466:22-467:2.\n\n**2. The** ***Oil Platforms*** **Test and its Application to NAFTA Chapter Eleven Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nIn *Oil Platforms (Preliminary Objections)*, the Court determined the scope of various articles of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights between Iran and the United States on which Iran relied, deciding it had jurisdiction to entertain the Iranian claims only on the basis of one provision of the Treaty, Article X. The Court said:\n\n... the Parties differ on the question whether the dispute between the two States with respect to the lawfulness of the actions carried out by the United States against the Iranian oil platforms is a dispute 'as to the interpretation or application' of the Treaty of 1955. In order to answer that question, the Court cannot limit itself to noting that one of the Parties maintains that such a dispute exists, and the other denies it. It must ascertain whether the violations of the Treaty of 1955 pleaded by Iran do or do not fall within the provisions of the Treaty and whether, as a consequence, the dispute is one which the Court has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to entertain...473\n\n*Oil Platforms* (*Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)*, Judgment of December 12, 1996 (Preliminary Objections), ICJ Reports 1996 p. 810 (para 16).\n\n299.\n\nJudge Higgins explained the reasoning behind the Court's approach in the following terms:\n\nThe only way in which, in the present case, it can be determined whether the claims of Iran are sufficiently plausibly based upon the 1955 Treaty is to accept *pro tem* the facts as alleged by Iran to be true and in that light to interpret Articles I, IV and X for jurisdictional purposes, that is to say, to see if on the basis of Iran's claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more of them.474\n\n*Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)*, Judgment of December 12, 1996 (Preliminary Objections), Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, ICJ Reports 1996 p. 810 (para 32).\n\n300.\n\nIt should be stressed that both the Court and Judge Higgins treated this as a jurisdictional matter rather than one going to admissibility.\n\n301.\n\nThe *Oil Platforms* test has been applied by investment tribunals, although the arbitral practice is not entirely consistent. In particular, in *Methanex*, the tribunal, while paying lip service to *Oil Platforms*, held that since the UNCITRAL Rules refer only to preliminary objections on jurisdictional grounds, there was no scope for the application of that test to claims of inadmissibility. The tribunal said:\n\nIn order to establish the necessary consent to arbitration, it is sufficient to show (i) that Chapter 11 applies in the first place, i.e. that the requirements of Article 1101 are met, and (ii) that a claim has been brought by a claimant investor in accordance with Articles 1116 or 1117 (and that all pre-conditions and formalities required under Articles 1118-1121 are satisfied). Where these requirements are met by a claimant, Article 1122 is satisfied; and the NAFTA Party's consent to arbitration is established.\n\nAccordingly, there is no necessity at the jurisdictional stage for a definitive interpretation of the substantive provisions relied on by a claimant: the jurisdiction of the arbitration tribunal is established without the need for such interpretation [...] On the other hand, in order to establish its jurisdiction, a tribunal must be satisfied that Chapter 11 does indeed apply and that a claim has been brought within its procedural provisions. This means that it must interpret, definitively, Article 1101(1) and decide whether, on the facts alleged by the claimant, Chapter 11 applies. Similarly, insofar as the point is in issue, the tribunal must establish that the requirements of Articles 1116-1121 have been met by a claimant, which will similarly require a definitive interpretation of those provisions...475\n\n*Methanex,* Partial Award, paras 120-121.\n\n302.\n\nIn practice the *Methanex* tribunal assumed that the facts alleged by the claimant, albeit disputed by the USA, were correct only for the purpose of the award on jurisdiction. The tribunal went on to hold that it had no power to consider, under the rubric of admissibility, whether the claims were capable of giving rise to responsibility under the substantive provisions of Chapter Eleven.476\n\nIbid, paras 122-126.\n\n303.\n\nBut other tribunals have not taken this view. For example, in *UPS,* a NAFTA arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules, the tribunal decided that for the purpose of the respondent's challenge to jurisdiction 'the facts alleged [...] are to be accepted as correct.'477 After quoting *Oil Platforms* and noting the differences between the various formulations of the test offered by the Court and in separate opinions, it said that:\n\n... the Tribunal\u2019s task is to discover the meaning and particularly the scope of the provisions which UPS invokes as conferring jurisdiction. Do the facts alleged by UPS fall within those provisions; are the facts capable, once proved, of constituting breaches of the obligations they state? It may be that those formulations would differ in their effect in some circumstances but in the present case that appears not to be so.478\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) v Government of Canada,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on Jurisdiction, November 22, 2002, para 32.\n\nIbid, para 37.\n\n304.\n\nIn *Impregilo v Pakistan*, the tribunal quoted *Oil Platforms* and inquired whether the facts as alleged by the claimant, if established, were capable of coming within the provisions of the BIT invoked. It considered aspects of the claims were not capable of constituting 'unfair or inequitable treatment' or discriminatory measures for the purposes of the applicable BIT because they concerned merely the implementation of contracts.479\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 22, 2005, para 268.\n\n305.\n\nIn *Bayindir v Pakistan*, the tribunal cited *Impregilo*480 and defined the task as requiring it...\n\nto determine the meaning and scope of the provisions which Bayindir invokes as conferring jurisdiction and to assess whether the facts alleged by Bayindir fall within those provisions or are capable, if proved, of constituting breaches of the obligations they refer to. In performing this task, the Tribunal will apply a *prima facie* standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the BIT provisions and to the assessment whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches. If the result is affirmative, jurisdiction will be established, but the existence of breaches will remain to be litigated on the merits.481\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, November 14, 2005, para 193-194.\n\nIbid, para 197.\n\n306.\n\nThe tribunal found that it had jurisdiction, emphasizing that this decision was 'not equivalent to joining the question of jurisdiction to the merits' but rather that the claims were 'capable of constituting a violation of the BIT'. The tribunal added that '[t]he threshold at the jurisdictional level, which implies a *prima facie* standard, is different from the standards which the Claimant will have to discharge on the merits to show an actual treaty breach.'482\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, November 14, 2005, para 263.\n\n307.\n\nIn *Canfor*, a NAFTA arbitration under the UNCITRAL rules, the respondent relied on Article 1901(3) by way of a jurisdictional objection. The Respondent proposed that the tribunal apply the test enunciated by Judge Koroma in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction* case.483 In contrast, the claimants understood that article 1901(3) was an interpretative provision that did not concern jurisdiction, and that the *Oil Platforms* test need not be applied.484\n\n*Canfor Corporation and Terminal Forest Products Ltd. v United States of America*, Decision on Preliminary Question, June 6, 2006, para 174 (**RL-007**) ('***Canfor and Tembec*****, Decision**').\n\nIbid.\n\n308.\n\nThe *Canfor* tribunal quoted *Oil Platforms*, *Methanex* and *UPS*, and said that:\n\nThe above decisions make clear four points that a Chapter Eleven tribunal needs to address if and to the extent that a respondent State Party raises an objection to jurisdiction under the NAFTA:\n\n\u2014First, a mere assertion by a claimant that a tribunal has jurisdiction does not in and of itself establish jurisdiction. It is the tribunal that must decide whether the requirements for jurisdiction are met.\n\n\u2014Second, in making that determination, the tribunal is required to interpret and apply the jurisdictional provisions, including procedural provisions of the NAFTA relating thereto, i.e., whether the requirements of Article 1101 are met; whether a claim has been brought by a claimant investor in accordance with Article 1116 or 1117; and whether all pre-conditions and formalities under Articles 1118-1121 are satisfied.\n\n\u2014Third, the facts as alleged by a claimant must be accepted as true *pro tempore* for purposes of determining jurisdiction.\n\n\u2014Fourth, the tribunal must determine whether the facts as alleged by the claimant, if eventually proven, are *prima facie* capable of constituting a violation of the relevant substantive obligations of the respondent State Party under the NAFTA.\n\nIt is also clear that, in determining jurisdiction by applying the above test, a NAFTA tribunal is not in any way prejudging the merits of the case.485\n\nIbid, paras 171-172.\n\n309.\n\nThe tribunal found that under Article 1901(3) the only possible interpretation was that the entire Chapter Eleven did not apply with respect to the antidumping law and countervailing duty law of a NAFTA's party.486 Hence, it concluded that the respondent did not consent to arbitrate most of the claims, except those which did not form part of the respondent's antidumping law or countervailing duty law.487\n\nIbid, para 273.\n\nIbid, para 348.\n\n310.\n\nIn *Desert Line Projects v Yemen*, the tribunal cited *Oil Platforms* and several of the precedents that applied it.488 In deciding whether it had jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, the tribunal said that since 'issues of jurisdiction and admissibility are examined on the hypothesis that the relevant claims are factually founded in principle, the claim may still be defeated at the merits stage if they are not proven.'489 The respondent had argued that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction because the dispute had been heard by a Yemeni arbitration tribunal. The *Desert Line Projects* tribunal disagreed, on the basis that the claims formulated by the claimant were capable of constituting violations of the BIT, and that the claims asserted in the prior arbitration were fundamentally distinct from those related to the violation of the BIT.490\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v The Republic of Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, February 6, 2008, paras 129-134.\n\nIbid, para 134.\n\nIbid, paras 137-8.\n\n311.\n\nThis Tribunal agrees with these and other decisions on the point. A NAFTA tribunal (whether sitting under the UNCITRAL Rules or some other set of arbitral rules) is entitled to inquire not merely whether procedural prerequisites and time limits for commencing arbitration have been satisfied, but whether the claims, assuming *pro tem* that the claimant's allegations of fact are true, fall within the scope of Chapter Eleven of NAFTA, that is to say, are capable of giving rise to a finding of breach. It should be stressed that since, under *Oil Platforms*, this is a matter going to jurisdiction, not admissibility, it is not necessary for this purpose to consider whether Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which refers only to jurisdictional objections, excludes the power to rule as a preliminary matter on questions of admissibility of claims.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Article 1110 claim for expropriation of the Laurentide mill faces considerable difficulties, even assuming the facts as pleaded. These include the following:\n\ni. The Claimant retained full control over the mill until its closure in October 2014, and subsequently negotiated its sale. It was the Claimant's choice to close Laurentide rather than one of its other two mills in Quebec.\n\nii. The closure decision was allegedly made because of the low paper prices offered by PHP, and did not involve state action of any kind. The Claimant has not alleged that PHP: (a) was a state agency; (b) exercised governmental powers delegated to it; or (c) was controlled by government officials in taking its pricing decisions.\n\niii. There was a significant delay between the Nova Scotia measures taken in September 2012 and the alleged expropriation in October 2014. The Claimant argues that it had decided to take a risk by running the mill after the measures, and that the mill was no longer profitable after two years. The question is how the negative consequences of its investment decision to take that risk can be construed as an expropriation.\n\n313.\n\nMoreover, if the Claimant's argument were to prevail, claims under Chapter Eleven could be pursued, many years after the event, as 'new' expropriations, with all the problems of causality that might raise. This would drive a coach and horses through the time-limits for action under NAFTA.\n\n314.\n\nOn the other hand, the *Oil Platforms* argument was not raised by the Respondent in its written pleadings, and only at the oral stage in reply to questioning from the Tribunal. On balance, the Tribunal considers that the Article 1110 claim, despite the questions it raises, should not be dismissed at this preliminary stage but should be left to the merits.\n\n**F. THE TAXATION MEASURES OBJECTION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n315.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction insofar as the Claimant's expropriation claim encompasses 'taxation measures'. This results from the restriction imposed by NAFTA Article 2103. Relevantly, Article 2103(6) provides:\n\nArticle 1110 (Expropriation and Compensation) shall apply to taxation measures except that no investor may invoke that Article as the basis for a claim under Article 1116 (Claim by an Investor of a Party on its Own Behalf) or 1117 (Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise), where it has been determined pursuant to this paragraph that the measure is not an expropriation. The investor shall refer the issue of whether the measure is not an expropriation for a determination to the appropriate competent authorities set out in Annex 2103.6 at the time that it gives notice under Article 1119 (Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration). If the competent authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six months of such referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 1120 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration).\n\n316.\n\nThe Respondent argues that under Article 2103(6) the Claimant was required to refer the claim relating to 'taxation measures' to the appropriate tax authorities before being able to submit such a claim to NAFTA arbitration. The Claimant, however, submits that the taxation measures to which it refers do not independently amount to an expropriation, but are part of a series of measures that amount to the alleged expropriation, and so do not need to be referred to the authorities under Article 2103(6).\n\n**2. The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe Respondent submits that any claims relating to the Property Tax Agreement between PWCC, Richmond County and NPPH are precluded by Article 2103. In the Respondent's view, Article 2103(1) provides a broad carve-out in respect of taxation measures: 'except as set out in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation measures.'491 The Respondent relies on the decision in *Canfor* and *Tembec*492 as well as the claimant's withdrawal of its claim in *UPS* to support its submission that this broad carve-out excludes the Claimant's minimum standard of treatment claim under Article 1105 insofar as it relates to the property tax measures.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 130.\n\n*Canfor and Tembec*, Decision, para 259.\n\n318.\n\nIn respect of the Claimant's expropriation claim under Article 1110, the Respondent acknowledges that Article 2103(6) permits such a claim relating to taxation measures so long as the Claimant follows the procedure set out therein.\n\n319.\n\nThe Respondent refers this Tribunal to *Gottlieb Investments Group v Canada* where the claimant followed the Article 2103(6) procedure, obtained a determination from the competent US and Canadian authorities that the measure was not an expropriation, and accordingly abandoned its expropriation claims.493\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 135.\n\n320.\n\nThe Respondent asks this Tribunal to reject the Claimant's assertion that the current approach to Article 2103 'distort[s] the exception's intent' and that its real purpose is 'to deny claims that taxes might have been used as a tool to expropriate', not instances where tax relief, as part of a suite of measures, gives a third party a competitive advantage over the claimant.494 The Respondent submits that such approach has no textual basis in NAFTA and would permit claimants to circumvent the exception in Article 2103(6) by grouping taxation measures with other measures.495 The Respondent refers to *EnCana v Ecuador* which concerned Article VII of the Canada-Ecuador BIT, almost identically worded to Article 2103 of NAFTA. In that case, the claimant followed the procedure set out in Article VII notwithstanding the fact that the taxation measures were one part of the government conduct that allegedly constituted expropriation.496 The Respondent submits that such an approach should have been followed by the Claimant in this case. The Respondent recalls the statement of the *Feldman* tribunal that 'Chapter 11 jurisdiction over tax matters is carefully circumscribed by Article 2103' and that 'this Tribunal would be derelict in its duties if it either expanded or reduced that jurisdiction.'497\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 136.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 137; Respondent's Reply Memorial, paras 163-165; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 249:3-22.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 138.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 139, citing *Feldman*, Award, para 188.\n\n**3. The Claimant's Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its reference to the property tax discount provided by Nova Scotia is admissible since it does not claim that this taxation measure amounts in itself to an expropriation covered by Article 2103(6).498 Rather, this measure is merely one of many that 'contributed to the constructive expropriation of Resolute's Laurentide mill.'499\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 213; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, 35:3-10.\n\nClaimant's Counter Memorial, para 213.\n\n**4. The Non-Disputing NAFTA Parties' Comments**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nThe United States submits that Article 2103 'generally excludes taxation measures from the NAFTA's provisions' and so are 'not subject to any Chapter Eleven obligations' unless 'expressly identified as exceptions' to that general exclusion.500 Article 2103 applies equally to all 'taxation measures', whether they are imposed on the investment or the investor or apply to a domestic investment or investor as a means of expropriating the foreign claimant's investment.501 The United States further submits that Article 2103(6) 'imposes a jurisdictional requirement' that the investor must refer its complaint to the competent tax authorities before it can raise an Article 1110 claim before a NAFTA arbitration.502\n\nUnited States Submission, para 18.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 19.\n\nUnited States Submission, para 20; see also Mexico Submission, para 14.\n\n323.\n\nThe Respondent observes that all three NAFTA Parties agree that, pursuant to Article 2103, taxation measures may not be contested as a breach of Article 1105 and accordingly, the Claimant's argument about the Property Tax Agreement between Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Richmond County as a breach of Article 1105 must fail.503 The Respondent also notes that the NAFTA Parties agree that a taxation measure may only be contested as a breach of Article 1110 if a claimant has first sought a determination from the NAFTA Parties that the measure is an expropriation, a procedural step which Resolute has not followed here.504\n\nCanada's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, para 29.\n\nCanada's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, para 30-31.\n\n324.\n\nThe Claimant considers that the United States calls for the adoption of an overly expansive interpretation of 'taxation measures' such that it would include a taxation 'practice' for the enforcement or failure to enforce a tax. By contrast, the Claimant submits that the referral obligation in Article 2103(6) consists of affirmative taxation measures burdening an investor to the point of expropriation. Tax breaks favouring a competitor without affirmatively burdening an investor are not, according to the Claimant, 'taxation measures' requiring referral.505\n\nClaimant's Reply to Art. 1128 Submissions, paras 30-31, also citing *Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v Russian Federation,* PCA Case No. AA226, Final Award, July 18, 2014, para 1407, as an example of a similar finding in the context of claims under the Energy Charter Treaty.\n\n**5. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nArticle 2103(1) of NAFTA provides that 'except as set out in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation measures.' Article 2103(6) provides a limited exception for claims that a tax measure constitutes an expropriation contrary to Article 1110: this requires prior submission of the claim to 'the appropriate competent authorities set out in Annex 2103.6', a procedure not followed by the Claimant in this case. This raises two issues: first, are the two measures invoked by the Claimant 'taxation measures' as referred to in Article 2103(1); and second, if so, can the Claimant invoke them here as an aspect of its Article 1110 claim, given that it does not rely on the measures as *per se* amounting to an expropriation but only as contributory to it.\n\n326.\n\nThe term 'taxation measure' was considered by the tribunal in *EnCana v Ecuador*. That was a claim for expropriation under the Ecuador-United States BIT, but the relevant provisions were not materially different from NAFTA's. The *EnCana* tribunal adopted a broad interpretation of the term, observing that...\n\nAll those aspects of the tax regime which go to determine how much tax is payable or refundable are part of the notion of 'taxation measures'. Thus tax deductions, allowances or rebates are caught by the term [...] [A] measure is a taxation measure if it is part of the regime for the imposition of a tax. A measure providing relief from taxation is a taxation measure just as much as a measure imposing the tax in the first place.506\n\n*EnCana Corporation v Republic of Ecuador*, Award, February 6, 2006, para 142(3)-(4) (**RL-066**).\n\n327.\n\nThe tribunal did not need to consider a taxation measure dealing with taxation of a third party; indeed, an expropriation effected by conferring a tax benefit on a competitor of the claimant was probably not contemplated by the drafters. But the exception for taxation measures under Article 2103(1) is a general exception, and there is no reason to limit it to taxation measures imposed on the claimant or its investment. To do so would be to add words not in the text. Moreover, it would be anomalous if a tribunal could evaluate a third-party taxation measure under Chapter Eleven but not a measure imposing a tax directly on the claimant.\n\n328.\n\nFor similar reasons, the fact that the expropriation claim only relies on Nova Scotia's property tax discount as one among several circumstances leading to a claim for expropriation does not bring the claim under the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Taxation measures are simply not covered by NAFTA except as provided in Article 2103, and there is no relevant exception here.507\n\nArbitrator Cass takes a narrower view of what qualifies as a 'taxation measure' under Article 2103. Because he does not read that provision as covering exemptions from taxation for reasons unrelated to framing and application of tax laws and regulations, he would not find measures complained of in this proceeding excluded under Article 2103.\n\n329.\n\nFor these reasons, even if the present claim fell within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and was otherwise admissible, it could not include any aspect of Nova Scotia's conduct covered by the taxation measures exemption in Article 2103.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n330.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction to decide the Claimant's claims concerning the Nova Scotia Measures, with the exception of the interim measures taken to keep the Port Hawkesbury mill in operation prior to its sale in September 2012 and the claims concerning taxation measures, and that the claims are admissible.\n\n331.\n\nQuestions of costs and expenses are reserved to the final decision on the merits."}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2022-07-25T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nI join the Award of the Tribunal (\"**Award**\") in all respects except as indicated in this statement. I do not recount matters of fact or arguments of the Parties addressed in the Award except as essential to points of disagreement with the Award.\n\n2.\n\nI generally concur with the Tribunal's conclusions on attribution and State responsibility, with one exception discussed below.\n\n3.\n\nI also concur in the Tribunal's conclusion that Canada has not violated its obligation under NAFTA Article 1105 to provide a minimum standard of treatment to investors of other NAFTA Parties and investments of other NAFTA Parties in Canada.\n\n4.\n\nI dissent, however, from parts of the Tribunal's conclusions respecting Articles 1108(7) and 1102 and from parts of the Tribunal's discussion of the standards used to address potential violations of these Articles and evaluation of some of the evidence presented in respect of these Articles during the course of this arbitration.\n\n5.\n\nAlthough I would have reached different results on aspects of the merits indicated above\u2014 and therefore different outcomes on the award of damages and allocation of costs between the Parties\u2014I concur in the allocation of costs based on the conclusions reached by the Tribunal.\n\n**II. ATTRIBUTION**\n-------------------\n\n6.\n\nI concur with the basic standard set out by the Tribunal for determining whether specific acts are attributable to a NAFTA Party. This includes the Tribunal Award's determination that each act must be considered separately in assessing whether it can be attributed to the State party, regardless of how the acts will be treated in evaluating whether they constitute a breach of NAFTA obligations.1\n\nSee Award, at paras 293 *et seq*.\n\n7.\n\nThe standards followed by the Tribunal's Award also, rightly in my view, reject the arguments that only consistent acts that form part of a unified whole or that are taken by one level or division of the government should be considered as attributable to the State in assessing challenges under NAFTA.2\n\nSee Award, at paras 298 *et seq*.\n\n8.\n\nI do not, however, agree with the manner in which the Tribunal's Award applies this standard to the NSUARB's approval of the electricity rate requested by and on behalf of PWCC. The Tribunal's Award states:\n\nIf the electricity contract or price itself were attributable to the State, it would mean many run-of-the-mill private conduct (e.g. the purchase of real property) would be rendered State acts simply because it is rubberstamped by the State (e.g. the registration in the land register). The same principle would apply to government approvals done for instance under competition laws, utility laws, or bankruptcy laws (which are closer in nature to the NSUARB's determination).3\n\nAward, at para 303.\n\n9.\n\nI agree with the Tribunal majority that the fact of State approval of a private arrangement is not always enough to make the conduct approved attributable to the State for purposes of applying NAFTA's strictures. For example, where the authority granted to State officers or agencies is limited to assuring that certain technical requirements have been met, as is generally the case for recording land purchases, the prospect of finding a violation of NAFTA from the State's action is negligible.4 The State is responsible for carrying out the recording function in that case in an even-handed manner, but it is not responsible for the substantive nature of the transaction recorded. A complaint about the substance of the transaction rather than about discriminatory conduct in recording land purchases, thus, would not be cognizable as a challenge to State action.\n\nCases where the State nonetheless could be subject to NAFTA strictures would include, for example, circumstances in which officers of such a tribunal have not applied technical requirements equally to domestic investors and to investors of another NAFTA Party. The word \"negligible\" in the text above both allows for such circumstances and acknowledges that these are highly unlikely.\n\n10.\n\nThe issue before this Tribunal, however, does not turn on a mere ministerial act similar to recording a land deed. Unlike that setting, NSUARB is empowered to exercise judgment on the propriety of rates and to reject rate packages it concludes are not in the best interest of ratepayers.5 There is no mechanical formula for this decision. That is why the Award recognizes that other approvals requiring judgment exercised under authority granting officials a substantial degree of discretion are closer to the NSUARB's determination at issue here than to a ministerial act such as recording land purchases. Indeed, in the instant case the Parties have referenced earlier instances of the NSUARB's rejection of requested rates and the NSUARB's refusal to accept a rate proposal agreed to by PWCC and NSPI in the absence of substantive changes that the NSUARB deemed desirable.6 Thus, any implication that acts of the NSUARB can be treated as a \"rubberstamp\" of private agreements\u2014or as any other characterization of an act whose consequences are not attributable to the approving officials because of the severely limited ambit of official authority\u2014would be unsupportable. Neither I nor the Tribunal's Award take the position that this arbitration involves an act of severely limited, rubberstamp-like authority.\n\n*Public Utilities Act*, RSNS 1989, c.380 (**C-101**; **R-164**); Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 188; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 202:23\u2013203:4.\n\nSee, e.g, Claimant's Memorial, at paras 83\u201385, 125\u201326. This event is cited by the Tribunal majority in discussing the attribution of responsibility to NSUARB. Award, at para 297.\n\n11.\n\nIn the absence of a conclusion that the NSUARB decision is merely a mechanical \"rubberstamp,\" however, the NSUARB's decision respecting PWCC's application for approving a new LRR for Port Hawkesbury constitutes a State act that must be assessed with respect to its implications for potential violations of legal undertakings by the State. A limitation of State acts to a mere rubberstamp-like process, consisting only of a nearly automatic acceptance of filings regardless of the agency's substantive concurrence, might suffice to circumscribe the conduct's attribution to the State. The Award rejects that description of the NSUARB's act; but its further conclusions are at odds with that determination. In my view, treating NSUARB approval as more in the nature of a ministerial act would provide the only reasonable basis for providing attribution to the State of an approval shorn of any State responsibility for the approval's effects. Once an act such as the approval at issue here is attributed to the State, the Tribunal must consider the approval's contribution to any conduct that may have violated NAFTA, including Article 1102's national treatment requirements.7\n\nThat requirement also includes analysis of violation of the minimum standard of treatment guaranteed under Article 1105.\n\n12.\n\nFor that reason, I do not subscribe to the distinction drawn in the Tribunal's Award between attribution of the conduct of NSUARB (including its *approval* of the LRR) to the State, on the one hand, and the absence of potential liability connected to the *rate arrangement* (referred to in the Award as the \"the rate itself, or the price paid for electricity by PHP\") that the NSUARB approved, on the other hand. In my view, the approval of a rate arrangement by NSUARB necessarily carries with it State responsibility for its reasonably foreseeable consequences, including here those associated with facilitating the restart of operations at the PHP mill.8 Any contrary implication in the Tribunal's Award is, in my judgment, improper.9\n\nSee discussion *infra*, at Paragraphs 67\u2013198 (discussing appropriate analysis of asserted violations, including the standard for finding a violation and the conduct to be addressed in evaluating whether there has been a violation of State obligations).\n\nAs noted above, see Footnote 7, *supra*, my disagreement with the Award's treatment of the effects of NSUARB's decision extends to its implications for the analysis of violation of both NAFTA Article 1102(3) and Article 1105. See Award, at para 743 (excepting effects of NSUARB approval of the LRR from analysis of potential violation of Article 1105). I do not, however, believe that the Award's limitation on consideration of the effects of NSUARB approval affects the Award's conclusions respecting Article 1105 and, thus, do not disagree with the Award's ultimate treatment of the Article 1105 claim.\n\n13.\n\nI do not address here whether the LRR approved by the NSUARB (and the NSUARB's approval of it) constitutes a violation of NAFTA obligations on its own. That is a question that should not be addressed separately from, and antecedent to, analysis of the substantive requirements for decision on specific NAFTA Articles. As discussed below, I also do not believe that such a separate inquiry into the LRR and its approval presents the legally correct question to ask in a case where multiple, related acts are challenged.10\n\nSee discussion *infra*, at Paragraphs 68\u201383 (discussing the analysis of asserted violations based on related acts attributable to the State).\n\n14.\n\nIn addition, in my view, the Tribunal Award's emphasis on the limited nature of the assignment given by Canada to the NSUARB wrongly grants domestic law final scope over the degree to which conduct of a State actor, such as NSUARB, can trigger obligations under international law, including NAFTA. Each State, of course, is free to tailor the authority granted to any State agency. International agreements cannot preclude this exercise of state sovereignty. And any State is free to enter into or withhold its consent to any international agreement. Yet, once a State has granted authority to an agency to employ its discretion in making decisions, the State must be responsible for the agency's acts performing that function, including acts that engender liability under international accords entered into by the State.11\n\nSee, e.g, Ronald A. Cass, \"Trade and Sovereignty: What You Can See by Looking\", (2022) 45 Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy 17 (discussing relationship between state sovereignty and international trade regimes).\n\n15.\n\nFor these reasons, saying that a State agency such as the NSUARB has merely concluded that the rate offered served the interest of provincial ratepayers\u2014as the Respondent asserts12 and the Tribunal's Award accepts13\u2014is insufficient to shield its exercise of discretionary authority from review under NAFTA's provisions.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 40; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 201:19\u2013203:4.\n\nSee Award, at paras 303\u2013304.\n\n16.\n\nSaying this much, however, does not require a conclusion that the approval by the NSUARB constituted or contributed to a violation of the Respondent's NAFTA obligations. The question whether NSUARB conduct violated NAFTA calls for our judgment on the merits of the claims before this tribunal. As with other elements of the complaint respecting violation of substantive protections of NAFTA Chapter 11, disposition of this question properly turns on the specific meaning of those provisions, not on a decision respecting the assignment of attribution to the Respondent. The Tribunal's Award accepts this understanding,14 and I concur in that judgment.\n\nSee Award, at para 304.\n\n**III. LIABILITY UNDER ARTICLE 1102**\n-------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe cornerstone of many international trade agreements is the promise to accord \"national treatment\"\u2014that is, treatment of other contracting parties' investors and investments that is \"no less favorable\" than treatment accorded to similarly situated investors and investments of the State whose conduct is at issue.15 This is the commitment that is incorporated in NAFTA Article 1102.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 191; *Corn Products International Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/01, Decision on Responsibility, January 15, 2008, at para 109 (**CL-107**).\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award, first, takes a very narrow view of what constitutes \"treatment;\" second, analyzes individually a small portion of the accused measures with respect to conduct attributed to the Respondent so far as possible violation of the national treatment undertaking is concerned;16 and, third, concludes that there is no violation of Article 1102 because (a) the Claimant is not in like circumstances with the relevant domestic investor (PWCC); (b) the Claimant has been treated equally to the relevant domestic investor; or (c) the Respondent had valid purposes for any differences in treatment between the Claimant and the domestic investor.17 As explained below, I disagree with aspects of each of these elements of the majority's opinion.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award does, in passing at the conclusion of its discussion of liability under Article 1102, briefly provide the Tribunal majority's analysis of how that would be addressed if the Tribunal accepted the Claimant's request to treat the accused measures as an \"ensemble\" rather than analyzing them on a disaggregated basis. See Award, at paras 601\u2013602. This analysis is discussed *infra*, at Paragraphs 67\u201384 (and, particularly, at Paragraphs 79\u201380).\n\nSee Award, at paras 540\u2013603.\n\n**A. Treatment of Investors and Investments**/b>\n------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nAt the outset of its Article 1102 analysis, the Tribunal's Award analyzes the question of what constitutes \"treatment\" in order to determine whether the Claimant has received \"treatment\" from the Respondent, limiting its focus to the behavior of the Government of Nova Scotia (\"**GNS**\").18 The Award, disagreeing expressly with the approach to identifying treatment taken by the Claimant, appears to determine that the Claimant did not receive treatment from GNS, making this conclusion explicit (or, at least, reasonably so) with respect to pensions and tax measures19 and leaving the conclusion implicit with respect to aspects of the complaint respecting other matters, including FULA payments and aspects of electricity regulation.20 As explained below, the Tribunal's Award does not address the question with respect to most other actions of the Respondent included in the complaint.\n\nSee Award, at paras 551\u2013557.\n\nSee Award, at paras 595, 598\u2013599.\n\nSee Award, at paras 584\u2013585, 590\u2013591. The more general statement of the Tribunal Award's position on \"treatment\" appears at para 555.\n\n20.\n\nIn evaluating the question of treatment, after its initial discussion of the topic and statement of its disagreement with the Claimant's approach, the Tribunal's Award combines that question with the question whether the Claimant was in \"like circumstances\" to the investor and investment asserted to have received more favorable treatment.21 The Award also in spots conflates the treatment question with the question of the appropriateness of the Respondent's actions.22\n\nSee Award, at para 558.\n\nSee Award, at paras 555\u2013567, 575\u2013576. The same combination of these analytical strands also is seen in para 555, fn. 1195's distinction of other cases on the basis that those cases \"recognized that nationality-based discrimination was present\"\u2014implying that the ultimate conclusion on this matter should be read backward into a decision on \"treatment\". Because I believe that a decision on treatment is both logically and legally prior to a decision on the merits, I do not share this approach to decision on treatment nor the Tribunal majority's reading of the relationship between this case and the cases cited in fn. 1195 of the Tribunal's Award.\n\n21.\n\nCombination of the different questions is understandable, given the relationship among the issues and the frequency with which other tribunals have found it difficult to separate the considerations apposite to the various inquiries.23 I find it more helpful, however, to separate these issues. Despite their relationship, the issues are analytically distinguishable, and the discussion below proceeds by addressing the relevant issues separately.\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, First Partial Award, November 13, 2000, at para 246 (**RL-059**); *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001, at paras 78\u201379 (**CL-114**).\n\n**1. Standard for Assessing \"Treatment\"**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nAs to \"treatment\", the appropriate standard is not an unwavering requirement of direct regulatory imposition on a claimant. Instead, as the Claimant urges24 and as found in other decisions, such as *Corn Products International*,25 treatment also occurs when a natural and foreseeable consequence of a State action includes an effect on an investor or investment of another NAFTA Party located within the respondent State.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 244 *et seq*.\n\n*Corn Products International, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/01, Decision on Responsibility, January 15, 2008, at para 119 (**CL-107**).\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award rightly says that the consequential effect cannot be merely incidental and unforeseen by the Respondent to a NAFTA Article 11 proceeding.26 That certainly is an appropriate line to be drawn, and it is consistent with the positions taken in this proceeding by both the Claimant and the Respondent.27\n\nSee Award, at paras 549, 554.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 134:23\u201325; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 385:24\u2013386:7; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 47.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award, however, suggests that the Claimant in the instant case stands in a different position from the claimants in *Corn Products* and related cases involving efforts by Mexico to improve the financial condition of the Mexican sweeteners industry, especially with respect to sugar producers.28 In particular, the Award states that *Corn Products* and other \"Mexican sweeteners\" cases recognized that the impugned tax measure was designed to put pressure on U.S.-based producers of high fructose corn syrup (\"**HFCS**\") which competed with Mexican sugar and that the international panels addressing complaints from U.S. HFCS producers succeeded in establishing violations of NAFTA's national treatment guarantee.29 The Award notes as well that *Corn Products* observed that the Mexican tax measure at issue was defended by Mexico, among other things, as a countermeasure against U.S. violations of WTO and NAFTA obligations.30\n\nSee Award, at para 555, fn. 1195.\n\nSee Award, at para 555, fn. 1195.\n\nSee Award, at para 555, fn. 1195.\n\n25.\n\nThese distinctions noted in the Tribunal's Award certainly are based on correct statements of fact about Mexican sweeteners cases such as *Corn Products*. Yet, the statements miss the critical similarity of those cases to the case before us for purposes of identifying whether \"treatment\" exists within the meaning of Article 1102. As the *Corn Products* decision makes clear, it sufficed for purposes of treatment that the understood and intended effect of the measure at issue there was through consequences for the U.S. HFCS producers, even though these producers were not the entities directly acted upon by the impugned measure.31\n\nSee *Corn Products International Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/01, Decision on Responsibility, January 15, 2008, at para 119 (**CL-107**).\n\n26.\n\nThe *Corn Products* decision first observes that \"the tax was [\u2026] intended [\u2026] to assist the Mexican sugar industry at a time of crisis and to respond to what Mexico considered was a U.S. violation of other NAFTA provisions\".32 The decision, after making clear that its reasoning applied to *either* of the purposes of the tax at issue\u2014assisting Mexican sugar producers or responding to an alleged U.S. violation of NAFTA\u2014adds that \"it would be a triumph of form over substance to hold that the fact that the tax was structured as a tax on the bottlers, rather than the suppliers of the sweeteners, precluded it from amounting to treatment of the latter for the purposes of Article 1102\".33\n\nSee *Corn Products International Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/01, Decision on Responsibility, January 15, 2008, at para 119 (**CL-107**).\n\nSee *Corn Products International Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/01, Decision on Responsibility, January 15, 2008, at para 119 (**CL-107**).\n\n27.\n\nThat is, despite the arguments advanced by the Respondent and accepted by the Tribunal's majority, the *Corn Products* decision stands for the proposition that, to find treatment under Article 1102, it is not necessary to conclude that the State's impugned measures acted directly on the Claimant or were undertaken because of a State purpose to harm the Claimant.34\n\nMoreover, given the disjunction in the decision's statement of reasons for Mexico's acts, it also is not necessary to conclude that the State is acting in response to another NAFTA Party's conduct.\n\n28.\n\nIn the instant case, there is no allegation by the Claimant that harm to the Claimant as a U.S. investor was the purpose of the Respondent's acts in support of PWCC. But, in keeping with *Corn Products*, neither the Respondent nor the Claimant asserts that such a purpose would be necessary to find a *violation* of Article 1102.35 (As discussed below, however, the Respondent's argument, while admitting that intent is not a necessary ingredient to violation of Article 1102, reintroduces something equivalent\u2014or nearly equivalent\u2014to that requirement in asserting that nationality-based discriminatory reasons are needed.)36\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 226\u2013231; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 92.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 92; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 494:3\u2013496:9.\n\n29.\n\nIn the absence of a construction of Article 1102 that requires intent for violation of the Article, it also should not be necessary to require intent for a conclusion that the impugned actions constituted *treatment* of the Claimant and its investment. Making the threshold requirement of treatment more onerous than the ultimate determination of violation of Article 1102 would seem to put the emphasis on the wrong part of the legal test.\n\n30.\n\nWhat remains, then, is a requirement of something that is more than a minor and incidental effect on the Claimant and its investment but less than a purpose to harm the Claimant and its investment.\n\n31.\n\nThat intermediate requirement for treatment is a *knowledge* or *expectation* of significant consequences for the Claimant and its investment, or, in the absence of that, a prospect of significant consequences that are so likely, viewed at the time the impugned acts were taken, as to make it unreasonable for the State actor not to have foreseen the effects on the investor or investment at issue. (This might be termed a *reasonable foreseeability* test, which is at the least an easier term than the more grammatically accurate \"unreasonable lack of foresight\" to describe the concept).\n\n32.\n\nDespite the Claimant's references to actual knowledge, this reasonable foreseeability test is the test for \"treatment\" that is most consistent with what is advocated by the Claimant.37 Moreover\u2014and, obviously, more important to our decision in this matter\u2014I believe that it is the correct test, as it is the test most consistent with the text and purpose of NAFTA Article 1102 and authorities implementing that Article.38\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, at para 207; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 137:4\u2013 10; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 64:1\u20133, 79:23\u201380:6. See also discussion *infra*, at Paragraph 45 *et seq* (respecting evidence introduced by the Claimant respecting reasonable foreseeability of adverse effects).\n\nSee *Corn Products International Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/01, Decision on Responsibility, January 15, 2008, at para 109 (**CL-107**) (discussing the importance of NAFTA's protection of national treatment and its role in trade agreements more generally).\n\n**2. Applying the Test for \"Treatment\"**\n----------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nDuring the course of the arbitration, there has been considerable discussion of [REDACTED]39\n\nSee, e.g, Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 66:1\u201367:22. See also Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 3\u20137, 23, 103\u2013104.\n\n34.\n\nAs set out above, however, just as I do not find in Article 1102 a requirement for intent, I also do not find in that Article a requirement of actual knowledge of effects. There is, in other words, no need for claimants to provide evidence in the form of a \"smoking gun\" or similar level of proof respecting knowledge of a measure's effect. As set out above, this would overstate the requirements for claims under Article 1102.\n\n35.\n\nFor that reason, while adverting to the \"smoking gun\" arguments, I will focus my discussion here on whether the evidence is consistent with a showing that significant consequences for the Claimant were so likely, viewed at the time the impugned acts were taken, as to make it unreasonable for State officials\u2014especially responsible officials of GNS\u2014not to have foreseen significant adverse effects on the Claimant and its investments.\n\n36.\n\nIn this proceeding, ample evidence has been introduced that there was both (a) a sufficient likelihood that the impugned measures would have significant effects on the Claimant and its investments that it would not be reasonable for officials to have been unaware of their prospect and (b) an understanding by GNS officials that this would be the likely consequence of these measures. I discuss the relevant considerations in that order.\n\n**(a) Reasonable Expectation of Adverse Consequences**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe starting point for evaluating likely consequences is the nature of the industry and the place of the Claimant's investments in it.\n\n38.\n\nIn the time frame relevant to this case, the SC paper industry in North America\u2014and more particularly in Canada\u2014had only a handful of producers.40 Moreover, at the time preceding and leading up to the relevant decisions, the Claimant was one of the two top producers of SC paper in North America and, after the idling of the Port Hawkesbury (\"**PHP**\") mill, [REDACTED] as well as the only American firm producing in Canada.41\n\nExpert Witness Report of Seth T.

The critical decision for SC mills is whether to operate a mill or a machine, rather than the proportion of capacity at which to produce. This also means that SC businesses are more affected than ordinary businesses by the decisions of competing businesses to enter or exit the relevant market.47\n\nExpert Witness Report of Seth T.

Prior to NewPage's decision to shut down the PHP mill, that mill had the largest production capacity in North America (considering its two lines together) and one of the largest if considering only the line associated with its higher quality machine.

The restart of the PHP mill, even reduced to operating a single SC paper machine, would add between [REDACTED] more production to the North American market above the pre-restart level.58\n\nThis figure is based on the expected increase in production if the PHP mill restarted with [REDACTED] See [REDACTED] at RFP0011573 (**C-215**) (providing figures for North American producers as of that time). The figure in text, above, is for the percent *added*; the resulting percent of the *total* market (including what was added) would equal approximately 20\u201325 percent of the expanded market. See Expert Report of Seth Kaplan, at December 28, 2018, at para 11. For purposes of analyzing the *impact of the added product*, the relevant figure is that used in text above.\n\n51.\n\nThis magnitude of additional product in the North American market naturally would exert downward pressure on prices for SC paper in this market. The impact of this price pressure would be felt by competing producers, including notably the Claimant, no matter what other changes took place simultaneously in the SC paper market.59\n\nReply Expert Witness Report of Seth T.

Kaplan, Ph.D., December 6, 2019, at paras 5 *et seq*.\n\n53.\n\nThis understanding of the natural, predictable effect of restarting the PHP mill is sufficient under the conditions of this case to conclude that GNS's impugned acts *did* provide treatment to the Claimant and its investments in Canada.\n\n54.\n\nOf course, the nature of competition in the industry and the size and composition of production at different mills, understood through basic precepts of economic analysis, could not guarantee perfect predictions of the magnitude of effects on other competitors from the contemplated restart of the PHP mill.62 Perfect predictability, however, is not the relevant legal standard in any area of law I know, including under Article 1102.63 The appropriate standard, as discussed above, is reasonable foreseeability, and the nature of the industry together with an understanding of basic economic functions made it reasonably foreseeable that restarting the PHP mill would result in significant harm to the Claimant and its investments in Canada.64\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 109.\n\nFor example, criminal law determinations resting on recklessness and negligence turn on evaluations of predictable harm from certain conduct, (see, e.g., *State v. Thomas*, 211 A.3d 274, 293 (2019) (\"the standard for criminal gross negligence requires the State to demonstrate a higher 'probability of harm'\"); *People v. Hall*, 999 P.2d 207, 218 (2000) (\"in order to determine whether a risk is substantial, the court must consider the likelihood that the harm will occur and the magnitude of potential harm\"); *People v.

M & J Corp.,* 424 A.2d 103, 105 (1980) (\"Foreseeability is a key element in establishing a landlord's duty to use reasonable care to keep safe those common areas of building retained under his control\"); *Sloan on behalf of Est. of Sloan v. Providence Health System-Oregon,* 364. Or. 635, 643 (2019) (\"In ordinary negligence claims, foreseeability plays a role in determining whether a defendant's conduct is negligent\"); *T. and P. Ry. Co. v. Bigham*, 38 S.W. 162 (1896) (\"It is usually laid down, in cases of negligence, that, in order to constitute the proximate cause of an injury, the injury must be the natural and probable result of the of the negligent act or omission\").) In the context of defamation, see *Van-Go Transport Co., Inc. v. New York City Board of Education,* 971 F.Supp. 90 (1997); *Churchey v. Adolph Coors Co.,* 759 P.2d 1336 (1988); *Lewis v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States* 389 N.W.2d 876 (1986).) The same is true for determinations under antitrust and competition law. (*Procaps S.A. v. Patheon Inc.,* 141 F. Supp. 3d 1246 (S.D. Fla. 2015), aff'd, 845 F.3d 1072 (11th Cir. 2016) (\"plaintiff alleging violation of Sherman Act's restraint of trade provision may either prove that defendants' behavior had actual detrimental effect on competition, or that behavior had potential for genuine adverse effects on competition\"); *Federal Trade Commission v.

Mo. 2020) (\"The FTC has satisfied its burden of showing a \"reasonable probability\" that a JV between the two largest SPRB coal suppliers would harm competition in the SPRB coal market\").) All of these rules of law turn on reasonable prediction based on facts, often interpolated through economic understandings, see, e.g., *Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp*., 509 U.S. 209 (1993); *Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. v.

I note that Professor Hausman's Expert Report and Reply Report attempt to estimate the magnitude of harm to the Claimant and its investments from the restart of the PHP mill induced by (or, at a minimum, made possible by) the Respondent's impugned acts. (Expert Witness Report of Jerry Hausman, Ph.D., December 28, 2018, at para 15; Reply Expert Witness Report of Jerry Hausman, Ph.D., December 6, 2019, at paras 3\u20135.) Professor Hausman's calculations of damages have been challenged by the Respondent. (Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 325\u2013328; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 202\u2013207; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1298:13 *et seq.*) The criticisms by the Respondent may have some validity respecting precise calculation of damages\u2014a matter no longer relevant in light of the Tribunal's Award and, hence, not one on which I will offer an opinion (although I do note Professor Hausman's excellent reputation and standing in the academic community, which suggest that criticisms should not be accepted lightly). Whatever their merit, these criticisms do not affect the basic understandings articulated by Professor Hausman as well as by Dr. Kaplan of the interactions of production decisions by the few firms participating in the North American SC market and the price effects and consequent harm to other firms in the market.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes this approach to analysis of \"treatment\".65 The Tribunal's Award takes a similar view, criticizing the Claimant's argument as relying \"on an economic approach to define 'treatment' more so than a legal one\".66 Like the Respondent, the Tribunal's Award also criticizes the Claimant for focusing on the effect on the Claimant of the restart of the PHP mill, rather than focusing more narrowly on the relation between specific, individual impugned measures and discriminatory treatment of the Claimant's relevant investments.67\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 109.\n\nAward, at para 551.\n\nAward, at paras 551\u2013553.\n\n56.\n\nFor reasons given above respecting the proper approach to determination whether there has been treatment within the meaning of Article 1102 as well as those discussed below respecting the conduct to be addressed,68 I believe that these criticisms are misplaced.\n\nSee discussion *infra*, at Paragraphs 68\u201383.\n\n**(b) Actual Expectation of Adverse Consequences**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nIn addition to the evidence respecting the reasonably predictable effects restarting the PHP mill would have on the Claimant and its investments in Canada, the Claimant introduced evidence arguably demonstrating the Respondent officials' understanding of these effects.69\n\nSee text and notes, *infra*, at Paragraphs 58\u201361.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimant's evidence shows that [REDACTED]70 Mr. Duff Montgomerie, Deputy Minister of Natural Resources for GNS during the time decisions were being made respecting GNS support for restart of the PHP mill, [REDACTED]7172 [REDACTED].73 On re-direct examination, Mr. Montgomerie [REDACTED]74\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 103\u2013104; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 140:3\u2013141:1.

Conduct to be Addressed**\n------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimant repeatedly has argued that the case before the Tribunal must be understood by considering the entire panoply of impugned acts.84 These measures are described in the Tribunal's Award, along with a summary description of the Claimant's position respecting them.85 The Tribunal's Award also notes that the Respondent, in contrast, has urged the Tribunal to consider only a small subset of these measures.86\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 155\u2013161; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 8\u201311; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 25:24\u201327:19; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 22:16\u201325.\n\nSee Award, at paras 114\u2013142, 170\u2013173.

Selecting the Appropriate Scope of Conduct: General View**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nAs noted in the Tribunal's Award, several arbitral decisions invoked by the Claimant as authorities support the Claimant's argument that various aspects of determining whether violations of international obligations have occurred are better examined by reference to the entire course of conduct of the State, rather than by focusing on individual acts disaggregated from the whole.87 For example, the Claimant quotes from the award in *GAMI Investments, Inc. v. Mexico*, that it is preferable to consider \"the record as a whole\u2014not dramatic incidents in isolation\u2014[to] determine whether a breach of international law has occurred\".88\n\nSee Award, at para 292.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 157, quoting *GAMI Investments Inc. (U.S.) v. Mexico*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, November 15, 2004, at para 103 (**CL-100**).\n\n69.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimant refers to the views expressed by Professors Michael Reisman and Robert Sloane, speaking of violations of international law through expropriation.89 Reisman and Sloane declare:\n\nDiscrete acts, analyzed in isolation rather than in the context of the overall flow of events, may, whether legal or not in themselves, seem innocuous vis-\u00e0-vis a potential expropriation. Some may not be expropriatory in themselves. Only in retrospect will it become evident that those acts comprised part of an accretion of deleterious acts and omissions, which in the aggregate expropriated the foreign investor's property rights.90\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 157, fn. 240.\n\nW. Michael Reisman & Robert D. Sloane, \"Indirect Expropriation and Its Valuation in the BIT Generation\", (2004) 115 British Yearbook of International Law, at 123\u201324 (**CL-103**).\n\n70.\n\nAlthough Reisman and Sloane were discussing difficulties in identifying \"creeping expropriation,\" the point they make, taken up by the Claimant, is that excessive focus on the effects of individual State acts\u2014disaggregated and considered as independent events\u2014risks missing the important effect of a collection of related acts.91 That is the point made in *GAMI Investments* and the other authorities that the Claimant cites.92\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 153\u2013161.\n\nIn addition to *GAMI Investments* and the article by Professors Reisman and Sloane, the Claimant specifically points to arbitration decisions in *Merrill & Ring Forestry L. P. v. Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/07/1, Award, March 31, 2010, at para 144 (**CL-101**), and *S.D. Myers, Inc. (U.S.) v. Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, November 13, 2000, at para 161 (**CL-102**). See Claimant's Memorial, at para 157, fn. 240.\n\n71.\n\nThe fact that the point has been made in different settings, addressing disparate asserted violations of international accords or elements of international law, does not diminish the force of the observation that too narrow a focus can obscure truths that would be apparent from a more capacious vantage. To the contrary, the generality of the point made in these different contexts reinforces its importance. Nor is the observation respecting focusing too narrowly to appreciate what one is seeing confined to specific aspects of international law: it perhaps is most often identified with the well-known parable of the blind men and the elephant.93\n\nThe parable was famously retold in the poem of John Godfrey Saxe. Each blind man feels the elephant to see what it is like, but each feels only one part, coming away convinced, variously, that an elephant is like a wall (having felt its side), a spear (tusk), a snake (trunk), a tree (leg), a fan (ear), or a rope (tail).\n\n72.\n\nIn its first discussion of the point, the Tribunal's Award is not dismissive of the argument that it is appropriate to consider the entire array of impugned conduct as a potentially worthwhile (lawful) approach to assessing whether a NAFTA Article has been violated. After reviewing some of the arguments advanced by the Claimant and the counter-arguments made by the Respondent, the Tribunal's Award states: \"Overall, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant's arguments to the effect of treating the impugned measures as an ensemble may well inform the question whether these measures, considered as a whole, amounted to a breach of the Respondent's obligations under NAFTA\".94\n\nSee Award, at para 297.\n\n73.\n\nThis statement appears during the Award's discussion of attribution, rather than violation, and rightly leads on to a statement of the difference between evaluation of violations and decisions on attribution. I agree with the statement's importance with respect to determining whether there has been a violation of NAFTA and agree as well with the Tribunal Award's distinction of this method from the approach that is proper in addressing questions of attribution. In my view, the apparent endorsement of looking at a set of measures, taken as a whole rather than broken into individual acts, captures an appropriate manner of treating claimed *violations* of international undertakings.95 Insofar as that is what the Tribunal's Award is saying, I concur.\n\nSee also *Merrill & Ring Forestry L. P. v. Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/07/1, Award, March 31, 2010, at para 144 (**CL-101**); *GAMI Investments Inc. (U.S.) v.

The Bigger Picture: All the Elephant's Parts**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nDespite its salutary recognition of the benefits of considering together related aspects of an asserted violation, later in the Tribunal's Award\u2014when the Tribunal majority addresses the question of whether the Respondent has violated Article 1102\u2014the majority follows a different approach. At that point, when discussing the decision to which aggregation rather than disaggregation has been said to be appropriate, at least putatively, the majority disaggregates the various impugned measures and analyzes each one separately.96\n\nSee Award, at paras 543 *et seq*, 557, 577\u2013600.\n\n75.\n\nThis decision by the Tribunal majority may have been a natural analytical derivative of the inversion of the Award's analysis of possible *violation* of Article 1102 (which the Tribunal's Award addresses second) and potential *exceptions* to liability for violation of that Article (which the Tribunal's Award addresses first). Understandably, having decided that certain acts are excepted under Article 1108(7), the Tribunal majority was reluctant to analyze those acts' effects on the Claimant and its investments and to discuss whether those acts violate the Respondent's national treatment obligation under NAFTA.\n\n76.\n\nTo be clear, the Tribunal's Award does address the broader set of impugned measures in passing at the conclusion of its discussion of the asserted violation of Article 1102, briskly noting that considering the impugned measures as an ensemble would have made no difference to the Tribunal majority's conclusions.97 Yet, the Award's summary discussion of why, even considered as an ensemble, the Tribunal majority concludes that the acts challenged by the Claimant do not amount to a violation of Article 1102, in my view, does not reach the right conclusion respecting \"like circumstances\".\n\nSee Award, at paras 601\u2013603.\n\n77.\n\nAs discussed more fully below respecting the meaning of \"like circumstances,\" this demonstrates that even starting with the same predicates respecting what the correct issues are does not guarantee agreement on a decision. That is to be expected in settings such as this\u2014after all, arbitration decisions at bottom are matters of judgment respecting the weight of evidence and differing constructions of the law.\n\n78.\n\nYet, to a considerable degree, my difference with the Tribunal's Award follows from the Tribunal majority's choice of predicates. That is, the Award's analysis of whether the Respondent's acts violate undertakings embodied in Article 1102 is framed by its focus on narrow factors of regulatory design for specific features of the State conduct at issue.98 The analysis in the Tribunal's Award largely puts aside consideration of the various impugned acts in the broader context of what those acts were *collectively* designed to accomplish and what their *collective effects* were\u2014even though that is the heart of the Claimant's complaint.99\n\nSee Award, at paras 563, 575\u2013600.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal's Award recognizes that this is \"[t]he heart of the Claimant's case\". See Award, at para 541.\n\n79.\n\nIn my judgment, as explained below, for the reasons articulated by Professors Reisman and Sloane, by the Final Award in *GAMI Investments*, and by others, looking at the full array of related measures produces a different picture from taking the impugned measures one by one. This is especially true because, as is clear from the record in this proceeding, the ensemble of measures that is challenged here was put together precisely with one overarching goal: to assure that PWCC would agree to take on a restart of the PHP mill, that it would carry through with that undertaking, and that the restart would be successful for far longer than the term discussed between government officials and private businesses in other instances.100\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 8\u201311, 335\u2013340; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 25:24\u201329:2, 173:8\u2013175:13; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 165:24\u2013 167:14.\n\n80.\n\nSaying that the measures were put together with the goal of securing a restart (and longer-term operation) of the PHP mill does not mean that every official who played a role in the process shared that goal or was motivated in his or her actions by that goal.101 It does, however, anchor analysis in the fact that the GNS officials who were leading the effort to restart the PHP mill consciously sought to address each aspect of mill operation that was of concern to PWCC.102\n\nThis is evident, for example, in the action of the CRA disapproving requested tax treatment of a proposed joint venture between PWCC and NPSI. See Claimant's Memorial, at paras 77, 100.\n\nExpert Witness Report of Seth T. Kaplan, Ph.D., December 28, 2018, at paras 25\u201333.\n\n81.\n\nFurther, when difficulties were encountered in securing any element of the package of support items, regulatory accommodations, or other government actions sought by PWCC, GNS officials were instrumental in making adjustments to (or securing adjustments for) the package (the \"ensemble\") of provisions and undertakings that PWCC wanted in order to proceed. GNS officials' conduct was critical to maintaining PWCC's interest in and commitment to the project.103 For example, the CRA denied requested treatment of the proposed joint venture between NSPI and PWCC,104 and the NSUARB signaled concern about additional aspects of PWCC's application for approval of its LRR and other aspects of its energy plan.105 After each potential stumbling block to completing arrangements with PWCC to restart the PHP mill, GNS renegotiated parts of its agreement with PWCC to ensure that the deal would go forward.106\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, at paras 62\u2013112.\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, at paras 77, 100.\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, at paras 82\u201388.\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, at paras 77\u2013113. See also Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 480:25\u2013481:7 (speaking of an amendment to the assistance provisions, Ms. Chow said: \"You can't take [provisions or amendments] in isolation. I think you really have to view it as a package\").\n\n82.\n\nThe impugned measures were considered by GNS officials as parts of a collective set of measures needed to ensure that PWCC would complete the purchase of the PHP mill and would restart and operate the mill rather than dismantle it and sell what parts it could.107 Even measures subject to approval by government officials who did not share the same level of commitment to that goal as was shown by the Premier of Nova Scotia and Minister of Natural Resources for GNS should be included in this ensemble, as each measure needed to be approved at a level within the capability and commitment of the State to ensure its goal of a PWCC restart of the PHP mill.\n\nSee, e.g [REDACTED] (**C-139**)[REDACTED] (**C-182**); Witness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, April 17, 2019, at paras 6\u20138.\n\n83.\n\nThe sole exception to a consideration of all parts of the package of impugned measures, in my view, is the accusation that GNS arranged for PWCC to be relieved of responsibility for pension payments incurred by the PHP mill's former owner.108 The evidence provided by the Claimant in support of this accusation, in my estimation, does not demonstrate that measures were undertaken by GNS or other State officials in this regard. This matter is addressed by the Tribunal's Award.109\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 49; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 310:24\u2013 312:10.\n\nSee Award, at paras 592\u2013595.\n\n84.\n\nTo the extent that analysis in the Tribunal's Award diverges from the analysis of treatment in this Statement, I dissent from that part of the Tribunal's Award.\n\n**C. Analyzing Claimed Violation of Article 1102(3)**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nI turn next to differences with the Tribunal Award's determination respecting violation of Article 1102, both as to the analytical framework and to its application to the collection of impugned acts of the Respondent, with the exception just noted.\n\n**1. Standard for Violation of Article 1102(3)**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nAs noted above and in the Tribunal's Award, violation of Article 1102 requires a showing that a claimant (or its investment) (1) has received treatment from a NAFTA Party (2) that is less favorable than that which is accorded to a domestic investor or investment (of the accused NAFTA Party) (3) in like circumstances.\n\n87.\n\nWith respect to Article 1102(3), respecting conduct by a state or province (i.e., governmental sub-jurisdictions within a State that is a NAFTA Party), the language used in the NAFTA differs slightly from that used in other sections of Article 1102. It requires that the treatment received by the foreign investor or investment be \"no less favorable than *the most favorable* treatment\" received by an investor or investment of the NAFTA Party of which the state or province \"forms a part\".110\n\nSee NAFTA Article 1102(3). See also *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, at para 83 (**CL-113**) (expounding three-part test for violation of Article 1102(3)).\n\n88.\n\nAs the Tribunal's Award recounts, this wording difference gave rise to disagreement between the Parties on two grounds: *first*, whether something more needs to be shown than merely differential treatment in like circumstances; *second*, whether an investor can ever be in like circumstances if it does not have an investment in the province whose actions are at issue.111\n\nSee Award, at paras 544\u2013546, 548\u2013550.\n\n**(a) Beyond Differential Treatment?**\n--------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Parties' arguments on the meaning of Article 1102(3) are starkly different. Relevant parts are described below before turning to the approach taken in the Tribunal's Award.\n\ni. The Parties' Approaches to Construing Article 1102(3)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimant urges a construction that hews to the wording of the Article, requiring only that a claimant show that there has been less favorable treatment to a foreign investor or investment than that received by the most favored domestic investor or investment, whether or not that investor or investment is located within the state or province and without regard for the reason behind the differential treatment.112 Underscoring its argument, the Claimant states: \"Had the NAFTA Parties wanted to limit the scope of the prohibited conduct in Article 1102(3) to nationality-based discrimination, they could have chosen to add the criterion 'by reason of nationality' in Article 1102(3) as they did in Article 1102(4)\".113\n\nSee, e.g, Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 214\u2013225.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 225.\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent, in opposition, stakes out the position that a requirement of nationality-based discrimination is implicit in Article 1102(3).114 The Respondent particularly relies, first, on its reading of submissions of NAFTA Parties in other Chapter 11 NAFTA arbitrations.115 Second, it invokes the language of the *Pope & Talbot* decision, quoting its statement that \"the treatment of states and provinces in Article 1102(3) is expressly an elucidation of the requirement placed on the NAFTA Parties by Article 1102(1) and (2)\" and also that the meaning of 1102(3) is identical to that of the other two sections \"save for the limitations to states and provinces\".116\n\nSee, e.g, Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 94\u2013102.\n\nSee Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 250, fns. 523\u2013525; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 95.\n\nSee Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 95, quoting *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001, at paras 41\u201342 (**RL-058**).\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's reading of the NAFTA Parties' submissions.117 It also disagrees with the weight to be given to them.118\n\nSee Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 240.\n\nSee Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 241\u2013243.\n\n93.\n\nBoth Parties agree that Article 1102(3) can be violated by a NAFTA Party, through conduct of a state or province, without any requirement that the relevant state or provincial officials intend to harm an investor or investment of another NAFTA Party.119\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, at para 190; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 92; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 45:18\u201325, 111:3\u2013114:2, 236:7\u201322; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 384:25\u2013384:4.\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent, however, states that there must be *nationality-based* discrimination against a claimant\u2014that is, the less favorable treatment of a claimant must be due to claimant's nationality, even if harm to the claimant is not the motivation for the discrimination.120 Moreover, in the Respondent's view, public policy choices by a state or province can provide justification for any differences in treatment and, so long as there is a rational connection of the policy to the treatment given, these considerations overcome complaints over differences in treatment.121\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 96\u201398.\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 267\u2013270, 272.\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant takes the opposite position with respect to what is necessary to state a claim under Article 1102(3).122 The Tribunal's Award characterizes the Claimant as merely arguing that no nationality-based reason is required for its case in chief\u2014what a claimant must show in order to shift the evidentiary burden to a respondent.123 I do not believe that this sufficiently captures the strength of the position advocated by the Claimant.\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Memorial, at para 226; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 214\u2013215, 226\u2013237.\n\nSee Award, at paras 466, 468.\n\n96.\n\nUnlike the Tribunal's Award, I read the Claimant's submissions in this case as stating the stronger proposition that under Article 1102(3) no nationality-based reason for less favorable treatment is necessary to recover against the State. In other words, the Claimant's position is that: (i) it is not necessary for a claimant stating a claim under Article 1102(3) to show nationality-based treatment as a part of its case, and (ii) a demonstration by a respondent that there were other reasons for disparate treatment and no nationality-based treatment would not overcome a showing of less favorable treatment.124\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 214\u2013237.\n\n97.\n\nTo that end, the Claimant declares that a state or province must treat a foreign NAFTA investor as well as the most well-treated investor, regardless of the treatment given to other domestic investors or even other state or provincial investors.125 The Claimant pointedly adds that, if a respondent fails that test, \"[t]he motive for the difference in treatment does not matter, whether from nationality, provincial considerations, or something else\".126\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 222.\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 222.\n\nii. The Tribunal Award's Construction of Article 1102(3)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award takes the position advocated by the Respondent, with one qualification. The Award states that a claimant, though bearing the *legal* burden of demonstrating differential treatment under like circumstances on the basis of nationality, does not have the *evidential* (I will use the term \"evidentiary\") burden of providing evidence that nationality constituted the reason for differential treatment.127\n\nSee Award, at paras 570, 573\u2013576.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award elaborates on the precise meaning of this, saying that \"a tribunal will conclude the less favorable treatment proven *prima facie* by the Claimant was not provided 'in like circumstances' where the Respondent can provide evidence that the differences in treatment have a 'reasonable nexus to rational government policies' that do not distinguish on their face or de facto between foreign and domestic investors or investments\".128 If a respondent cannot demonstrate a non-nationality-based reason for the difference in treatment, however, a tribunal should conclude that the reason for the difference was nationality-based.129\n\nAward, at para 575.\n\nSee Award, at para 575.\n\n100.\n\nI agree with the Tribunal's Award that there is a difference between the legal burden and the evidentiary burden. I agree as well that once a claimant shows that less favorable treatment has been given to a foreign investor or investment (of another NAFTA Party) in like circumstances, the evidentiary burden shifts to the respondent. I also agree that, at that point, a respondent must make a convincing demonstration that the difference in treatment of domestic and foreign investors or investments was not based on nationality, but on a public purpose of some kind unrelated to nationality-based discrimination.\n\n101.\n\nI part company with my colleagues, however, on the question whether *any* \"rational government policy\" suffices to insulate differential treatment from liability under Article 1102(3) and whether a merely \"reasonable nexus\" to that policy ends the inquiry respecting the legitimacy of differential treatment.\n\n102.\n\nThe formula advocated by the Respondent and accepted by the Tribunal's Award would provide scope for any NAFTA Party to undermine the important protections provided by Article 1102\u2014and, if accepted more generally as a mode for interpretation of national treatment obligations, would deprive investors of one of the most important safeguards in trade and investment treaties. Simply put, the use of a mere \"rationality plus reasonable nexus\" approach makes protection turn almost entirely on preferences of the State rather than the terms it agreed to in the NAFTA accord.\n\n103.\n\nThis approach is at odds with the commitment undertaken in NAFTA. In my view, it is not an acceptable test for compliance with Article 1102(3)\u2014neither with respect to the text of that Article nor to the purpose served by it in the context of a free trade agreement.\n\n104.\n\nAs I wrote in a previous NAFTA arbitration responding to a similar formula urged by Canada, \"There must be limits to the reach of policy justifications offered to support national treatment discriminations\u2014that is, of justifications offered to establish the unlikeness of circumstances under Article 1102\".130\n\nNAFTA Article 1102(3). See also *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at para 120 (**CL-113**).\n\n105.\n\nThese limits should not require arbitral tribunals' intrusion into the domain of domestic policy committed to national governments' discretion and, secondarily, to subnational units of government.131 Yet, some measure of consideration must be given to claimants' arguments that an asserted policy does not justify discrimination against a foreign investor or its investment.\n\nNAFTA Article 1102(3). See also *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at para 120 (**CL-113**).\n\n106.\n\nIt cannot suffice for a NAFTA Party or its subnational unit of government to assert that differential treatment\u2014treatment that, as the Claimant urges, contravenes the text of Article 1102(3) so long as the compared domestic and foreign entities are in like circumstances\u2014is justified simply by the government's assertion that circumstances are not \"like\" if the government declares them to be different on policy grounds.132 This construction of Article 1102(3) gives almost conclusive weight to a State's assertion of the scope of its policy-based justification for preferential treatment of a domestic investor or investment over a foreign competitor. A NAFTA Party cannot plausibly be entitled, under the terms and purposes of NAFTA, to decide whether it wants to be subject to Article 1102(3)'s strictures in any given case.\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 222.\n\n107.\n\nThis consideration may explain why the *Pope & Talbot* tribunal added a purpose-related requirement to its base test of rationality-plus-reasonable nexus in construing Article 1102(2)\u2014a provision textually less restrictive than 1102(3).133 It may explain as well the contention advanced by the Claimant that more must be considered than rationality and nexus, including specifically the purpose of NAFTA to support cross-border investment by protecting against discriminatory treatment\u2014which is the point of the Claimant's argument that the *Pope & Talbot* formula constitutes a two-part test that sets the proper parameters for assessing alleged violations of Article 1102(3).134\n\nSee Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 272, quoting *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001, at para 78 (**CL-058**).\n\nSee Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 272, quoting *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001, at para 78 (**CL-058**).\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award rejects the second part of the *Pope & Talbot* formula focusing on underlying purposes of NAFTA.135 It observes that other tribunals that have accepted that formula, notably in the *Feldman* and *Bilcon* cases, could have disposed of the matters before them without reliance on the second part of the *Pope & Talbot* test, having separately determined that respondents in those cases failed to satisfy requirements to defend against liability under the first part of the test.136 The Tribunal, then, reasonably concludes that the second part of the *Pope & Talbot* test should not stand on its own as an independent standard for assessing whether there has been a violation of Article 1102(3). I concur with this assessment.\n\nSee Award, at para 546\u2013547.\n\nSee Award, at para 547, fn. 1179, citing *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. The United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, December 16, 2002, at paras 182\u2013184 (**RL-021**); *William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v. Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, March 17, 2015, at para 724 (**RL-025**).\n\n109.\n\nAt the same time, I do not believe that the second part of this test should be ignored. It recognizes an important element in interpreting the text of NAFTA provisions, including Article 1102(3). As with other legal documents, the text of NAFTA provisions should be interpreted in light of the context in which the provisions appear and the goals to be served by the language used in the various NAFTA Articles.137\n\nSee VCLT Article 31(1). See also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, *Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts* (Thomson/West Pub. Co., 2012) at 56\u201358, 63\u201366.\n\n110.\n\nIn my judgment, having sensibly put the second part of the *Pope & Talbot* test aside as a *separate and independent* test, the Tribunal's Award then errs in failing to interpret the provisions at issue with due regard for the investment-protecting purposes of NAFTA.\n\niii. Relating the Award to the Claimant's Arguments\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nIn this section, I address issues raised by two other arguments by the Claimant respecting the standard for application of Article 1102(3), issues on which the Claimant's position and the approach followed in the Tribunal's Award diverge. I do not similarly address differences between the Tribunal's Award and arguments of the Respondent because, in respect of the standards for application of Article 1102(3), the Tribunal's Award very largely accords with positions advocated by the Respondent.\n\n112.\n\nIn this case, the Claimant argues alternatively: first, that government policy reasons cannot justify differential treatment of foreign investors and investments under Article 1102(3) (no matter how rational the policy and how reasonable the nexus); and, second, that, even if reasonable government policies do insulate NAFTA Parties against judgments based on differential treatment\u2014by supporting findings that foreign and domestic investors or investments are not in like circumstances\u2014the policies at issue here \"are unreasonable and undermine NAFTA's core value of fair competition\".138\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 213.\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimant has presented strong arguments based on the text of Article 1102(3). It explains that by requiring in this part of Article 1102 that foreign investors or investments receive treatment comparable to the most favorable treatment accorded to a domestic investor or investment, Article 1102(3) assumes that it applies (or may apply) in settings where not all domestic investors or investments are treated the same.139 The Claimant elaborates that this assumption necessarily means that the provision assumes a case where nationality-based discrimination does not explain all differences in treatment of investors or investments\u2014 otherwise, there would not be differences in treatment given to domestic investors or investments.140\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 218\u2013219.\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 218.\n\n114.\n\nAlthough there is considerable force to this argument, it raises the question why NAFTA includes Article 1102(3) within the broader Article 1102 framework, dealing with \"National Treatment\". Perhaps the answer is that differential treatment, even if not based on *reasons* tied to nationality, nonetheless can constitute *a departure from the obligation of national treatment*. This seems the best reading of Article 1102(3), giving it the meaning that is most consistent with the text while keeping the meaning within the ambit of concerns about differential treatment to investors or investments of other NAFTA Parties.\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimant's textual argument also raises the question why the requirements of Article 1102(3) are prefaced with the statement, \"The treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 [of Article 1102] means [\u2026]\". Perhaps the answer to this question is that drafters, contemplating situations in which a state or province discriminates in favor of a state or provincial investor or investment, wanted to make clear that the national treatment requirement did not permit less favorable treatment of a foreign investor or investment simply because a state or province permissibly discriminates among domestic investors and investments.\n\n116.\n\nIn either case, giving the Claimant's textual argument its due requires concluding that a violation of Article 1102(3) is possible without a strong form of nationality-based discrimination. Consider, for example, an industry composed of five firms (within the relevant market), two of which are considerably larger than the others. In this example, one of these large firms is domestic, the other foreign. All other firms are domestic. A state or province could not seek to benefit the large domestic firm at the expense of all other firms, even if that would injure domestic firms as well as the foreign firm.141 If that were permitted, a state or province could effectively promote what it considered to be the most important domestic firm at the expense of a foreign firm that was its principal competitor\u2014what would seem to be an obvious violation of national treatment. This approach logically would include a setting in which the favored domestic firm is the sole firm located in the state or province whose actions are challenged under Article 1102(3).\n\nNAFTA Article 1102(3). See also *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at para 60 (**CL-113**).\n\n117.\n\nThus, although explicit or clearly intended nationality-based discrimination strengthens the case for a violation of Article 1102(3), a purpose to distinguish among investors or investments on the basis of nationality is not required to make out a violation of this provision. Moreover, the logic of this understanding of Article 1102(3) also means that the location of an investor or investment within or outside the state or province that takes the impugned actions cannot conclusively establish the legitimacy of those actions against a charge of violating Article 1102(3).\n\n**(b) Location and the Standard for Like Circumstances**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nGiven the reasoning above respecting the construction of Article 1102(3) and the significance of the location of investors and investments within or outside of the state or province taking the impugned actions, it also follows that location alone cannot be dispositive for the inquiry into \"like circumstances\". The Respondent has asserted throughout this arbitration that location should be dispositive with respect to that inquiry.142\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at paras 2, 20.\n\n119.\n\nIn part, this argument has turned on the stated inability of a state or provincial government (in this case, GNS) to provide the same treatment to investments located outside of that jurisdiction as to investments within that jurisdiction. For example, as the Respondent observes, a jurisdiction can grant exemptions from certain regulations such as land use restrictions or relief from provincial taxes on items or activities taking place within the jurisdiction but cannot grant the same benefits to activities located outside of its domain.143\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 20.\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award follows this same line of analysis, asserting that the Claimant is not subject to regulatory regimes under the control of GNS because its mills producing SC paper are not located in Nova Scotia.144 Having decided to look at specific impugned actions one by one, the Tribunal's Award seeks to identify how particular regulatory measures work and, unless those measures directly are imposed on the Claimant, the Award deems their effects on the Claimant insufficient to constitute either treatment or differential treatment of investors and investments in like circumstances to PWCC and the PHP mill.145\n\nSee, e.g, Award, at paras 590, 598 (explaining that the Claimant could not be in like circumstances with PWCC respecting payments for stumpage and silviculture under FULA or respecting tax relief via reassessments because its SC paper mills are not located in Nova Scotia).\n\nSee, e.g, Award, at paras 546, 555, 573\u2013591, 596\u2013598.\n\n121.\n\nI believe that this approach cannot help but overlook the actual work being done by the GNS measures as a collective and the effects those measures had on PWCC's major competing producer of SC paper\u2014effects that were both reasonably foreseeable and expected at the time the relevant official actions were taken. Those effects are what produced the harms complained of by the Claimant by diminishing the ability of the Claimant and its investments to compete on an equal footing in Canada with a favored domestic investor and investment.\n\n122.\n\nBecause the claim is that those effects were produced by conferring special benefits on PWCC rather than by directly imposing special burdens on the Claimant,146 the proper question to ask was not whether the Claimant was subject to exactly the same regulatory frameworks as PWCC and the PHP mill. That question addresses whether the specific regulatory frameworks functioned in a discriminatory manner. This, however, is not the claim that has been advanced. Answering that question cannot resolve the contention advanced in this case; it cannot meet the objection based on Article 1102(3).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 244\u2013254.\n\n123.\n\nInstead, the proper approach to the \"like circumstances\" inquiry, in my view, has two parts. The first is whether the nature of the competition between the Claimant's mills in Canada was such that, as a *prima facie* matter, those mills were in like circumstances to the PHP mill and the Claimant was in like circumstances to PWCC. The second part of this inquiry asks whether a neutrally selected and applied legal framework\u2014one not designed to advantage a domestic firm at the expense of a foreign firm (a firm that operates under the umbrella of NAFTA's regime)\u2014required (or justified) the acts that disadvantaged and harmed the Claimant and its Canadian investments.\n\n124.\n\nAlthough this approach is similar in some respects to that taken by the Tribunal's Award, I believe that its differences are both important and better correspond to the text and purpose of Article 1102(3).\n\n**2. Applying the Test: Less Favorable Treatment and Nationality**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nDuring negotiations over PWCC's potential purchase of the PHP mill, GNS offered a package of measures to PWCC. These included, as the Claimant recounts:\n\na $24 million forgivable loan\n\na $40 million credit facility\n\na $1.5 million workforce training grant\n\na $1 million marketing grant\n\na $38 million Outreach Grant [under the Outreach Agreement]\n\n$1.5 million in additional funding to prepare for the restart of the mill\n\n$20 million to purchase land from the mill\n\nthe ability to use [approximately $1 billion in] tax losses to offset gains from PWCC investments outside of Nova Scotia\n\na 50% reduction on [annual] property taxes, from $2.6 million to $1.3 million\n\na 20-year forest license [FULA] that: (1) permitted PHP to harvest fiber for paper and biomass for fuel; and (2) reimbursed PHP for silviculture payments\n\nindemnification of costs [in the event that] [\u2026] PWCC [were] not to complete purchase of the mill\n\npension liability relief\n\nstatutory rights to run the Biomass Plant 24/7\n\nregulatory protection from the costs and obligations of renewable energy standards.147\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 219.\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimant also includes among the benefits given to PWCC advantageous electricity terms, which were supported by GNS and which the Claimant asserts GNS was instrumental in securing.148\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Memorial, at para 219; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 34.\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimant has maintained throughout these proceedings that these benefits were both designed as inducements for PWCC to restart the PHP mill and as cost-reducing measures to make the PHP mill the lowest-cost SC paper producer in North America.149 The Claimant also maintains that this strategy was responsive to PWCC's insistence that government subventions and regulatory changes in combination have the effect of lowering its costs in order to make the PHP mill (if not *the* lowest-cost SC paper producer) sufficiently profitable that it would remain in operation as the industry continued to contract and marginally successful mills\u2014those that are making less profit or amassing larger deficits\u2014are forced to close.150\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Memorial, at paras 252\u2013253; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 32, 38, 104, 112, 132.\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Memorial, at paras 86\u201387; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 36, 209.\n\n128.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant's principal message has not been that the Respondent provided benefits to PWCC that were of a *type* not made available to other SC paper producers in Canada. Instead, it has been that the benefits made available to PWCC, primarily by GNS, were of a *magnitude* that substantially exceeds what the Respondent or GNS provided to other firms with Canadian investments in financial distress.151 The Claimant's witness, Mr. Alexander Morrison of Ernst & Young, Inc., testified that he had reviewed a large data set respecting assistance to firms that had filed for protection under the CCAA over a ten-year period and found that no other firm had received assistance from government comparable to that granted to PWCC with respect to its purchase of the PHP mill.152\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Memorial, at paras 156, 161; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 335, 395; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 11:19\u201325; 25:24\u201326:15; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 140:7\u201318; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 24:22\u2013 25:23.\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 11, 2020, at 560:16-561:14. See also Expert Witness Statement of Ernst & Young Inc., December 6, 2019, at para 89.\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent takes a contrary position, claiming that there was nothing unusual about the assistance granted to PWCC by GNS.153 In this regard, the Respondent emphasizes the similarity of relief granted to PWCC in respect of its purchase of the PHP mill and relief offered to the Claimant by GNS in respect of financial difficulties at its Bowater Mersey mill.154\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 16.\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 37 *et seq*; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 166 *et seq*; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 178:24\u2013179:8.\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts that much of the assistance provided to PWCC actually served interests of the citizens of Nova Scotia (by protecting against lost tax revenues needed to fund government services in Nova Scotia),155 of ratepayers of NSPI (by preventing a loss of contributions from the PHP mill to defray joint costs of energy provision),156 or of broader sets of interested persons (through forest preservation, protection against harm to climate, and other publicly beneficial goals).157\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 116; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 113.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 157; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 113.\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 110, 115\u2013136, 304; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 113; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 173:8\u201321; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, 165:24\u2013166:11.\n\n131.\n\nIn addition, for some of the items listed by the Claimant, the Respondent disputes whether in fact any benefit was conferred on PWCC.158 For example, the Respondent states that there was no pension relief provided to PWCC, although there were steps taken to protect the PHP mill's workers from loss of pension benefits.159 Whatever the strength of this argument in respect to other matters, given the state of the record evidence on the issue of pension relief, I believe it is proper to remove this item from the list of benefits that GNS and the Respondent provided as assistance to PWCC.\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 133\u2013135 (arguing that no benefit was conferred by the reduction in annual municipal property tax from $2.6 million to $1.3 million because the reduction reflected reduced production at the PHP mill and, without special negotiation of the rate, would have been even lower (by 50 percent)).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 138; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 184.\n\n132.\n\nThe questions remain, however, as to whether the magnitude of assistance given to PWCC was different from that provided by GNS to entities such as Bowater Mersey and, if so, what follows from that conclusion.\n\n**(a) Comparison to Bowater Mersey Episode**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nNotwithstanding the similarity of many of the items of assistance for PWCC's investment in the PHP mill and the Claimant's investment in the Bowater Mersey mill, I find the evidence clearly demonstrates that the magnitude of assistance given to PWCC and the PHP mill greatly exceeds that offered to the Claimant with regard to Bowater Mersey or to any comparable investment.\n\n134.\n\nSimply at the most basic level of evidentiary showings, it is apparent on the face of the items offered to the two investors in respect of these investments that the assistance offered was both broader and a great deal more substantial in the case of PWCC and the PHP mill than in the case of the Claimant and the Bowater Mersey mill. In contrast to the long list of assistance measures set out above,160 the offer to Bowater Mersey consisted of five specific components: [REDACTED]161 [REDACTED]162\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraph 125.\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 313:10\u2013328:15 (testimony of Mr. Richard Garneau, former Chief Executive Officer of Resolute Forest Products, Inc., formerly AbitibiBowater, Inc.)\n\nSee [REDACTED] (**R-149**).\n\n135.\n\nExclusive of land purchases, which the Respondent characterizes as purchases-for-value rather than as assistance measures,163 the package of assistance measures for Bowater Mersey amounted to [REDACTED]164 This compares to a value for the package of assistance measures given to PWCC in respect of the PHP mill of at least [REDACTED] (excluding land purchases, excluding pension relief, and counting only items that do not require (contested) estimates of value\u2014thus, reducing the list of items counted with respect to impugned measures of assistance to PWCC by more than half).165 The Claimant places the total expected value of the assistance measures to PWCC\u2014and the value of assistance actually received166\u2014 considerably higher than this figure.167 Even without adding amounts reflecting the assistance that was not readily quantified, the amount of assistance provided to PWCC for the PHP mill dwarfs the amount given to the Claimant for Bowater Mersey.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 184.\n\nThis figure includes [REDACTED]\n\nThis figure includes the benefit of the $1.3 million annual reduction in municipal taxes for a 5-year period. I recognize that the Respondent argues that the benefit listed for municipal taxes was both justified and, ultimately, worth less than the assigned figure, as the Respondent claims the reduction actually set a figure above what might have been owed by PWCC. See Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 134\u2013135; see also *supra* at Paragraph 131, fn. 158. It is included in the items that do not have contested value estimates because, as with the similar figure on tax relief for Bowater Mersey, it is based on a specific, assigned numerical statement of the amount of tax reduction negotiated or offered.\n\nFor example, see Claimant's Memorial, at paras 117\u2013120 (estimating the value of the energy savings to PWCC from the LRR at more than [REDACTED]for the period 2013 to 2015).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 91.\n\n136.\n\nThe obvious difference in the magnitude of assistance offered by GNS to the Claimant's Bowater Mersey mill and PWCC for its purchase of the PHP mill suggests that, so far as the Respondent urges comparison of those two incidents as relevant, the comparison demonstrates considerably less favorable treatment for the Claimant's investment. The difference appears even starker when results are taken into account. While the PHP mill continues to operate, the package of measures for Bowater Mersey was insufficient to prevent the Claimant from announcing that mill's closure a mere six months later.168\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 339.\n\n137.\n\nBeyond the specific comparison of the treatment of the Claimant's Bowater Mersey mill and PWCC's negotiations over its purchase of the PHP mill, I credit the evidence submitted in the Witness Statement and testimony of Mr. Morrison and Ernst & Young that the package of assistance measures provided to PWCC exceeds State assistance provided to any comparable firm or investment for a firm seeking to emerge from CCAA proceedings.169 Although one can argue over selection of the precise parameters for the Ernst & Young study,170 the basic information of the study is persuasive that the package of assistance measures provided to PWCC is of considerably larger magnitude than the support (if any) normally made available in comparable circumstances.171 This information adds to the picture of disparate treatment presented by comparing the Bowater Mersey and PWCC/PHP episodes.\n\nSee discussion *supra*, at Paragraph 128.\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 187\u2013200. Much of the criticism of the report's parameters by the Respondent is directed to the report's utility to the Claimant's contention that the Respondent violated Article 1105's guarantee of respect for a minimum standard of treatment that accords with international law. Indeed, the Respondent's critique of the Ernst & Young report in its Rejoinder Memorial appears under the heading \"The EY Report is of No Value in Establishing a Breach of the Minimum Standard of Treatment of Aliens in Customary International Law\". Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial at part IV.H. Insofar as the criticisms relate to the report's failure to look outside of Canada or outside the context of companies in sufficient economic distress to invoke CCAA processes, I do not find that they contradict the central conclusion of the Ernst & Young report respecting the unusually generous support provided to PWCC in comparison to norms for similarly situated firms in Canada.\n\nExpert Witness Statement of Ernst & Young Inc., December 6, 2019, at para 89.\n\n138.\n\nThe differences between the treatment of PWCC and the PHP mill, on the one hand, and the Claimant and the Bowater Mersey mill, on the other hand, while establishing less favorable treatment, do not establish that this differential treatment occurred with respect to investors or investments in like circumstances. Before turning to that issue, I address the less favorable treatment issue with respect to the Claimant's other relevant investments.\n\n**(b) Comparison to the Claimant's Other SC Investments**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nAs noted in the Tribunal's Award, the Claimant had investments in other mills that produced SC paper that were more closely competitive with the PHP mill, notably mills at Dolbeau, K\u00e9nogami, and Laurentide.172 The comparative treatment of these investments and PWCC's investment in the PHP mill also demonstrates the less favorable treatment accorded to the Claimant and its investments.\n\nAward, at paras 71 *et seq*.\n\n140.\n\nAs discussed above, the evidence produced in this proceeding is clear that the Claimant's other SC investments did not receive from GNS treatment in any way comparable to that accorded PWCC and the PHP mill. The disparity in treatment goes beyond what is explicable on the obvious observation, much underscored by the Respondent,173 that some forms of assistance GNS could make available for the PHP mill\u2014for example, municipal tax relief\u2014 could not be made available by GNS to operations outside of Nova Scotia.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 275.\n\n141.\n\nThe critical point for assessment of the disparity in treatment\u2014the \"less favorable treatment\" part of the test enunciated in the *United Parcel Service* (*UPS*) arbitration174 and accepted by both Parties here175\u2014is that the differential treatment was not merely the grant of extraordinarily generous benefits to PWCC that were not made available in equal measure to the Claimant. Rather, it was the decision to make this package of assistance available in circumstances where it was reasonably foreseeable (and, in fact, foreseen) that the result would be substantial harm to the Claimant and its Canadian investments that constitutes the treatment of the Claimant and its investments.176\n\nSee *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, at para 83 (**CL-113**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 189; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 246.\n\nSee discussion *supra,* at Paragraphs 22\u201365.\n\n142.\n\nIn this context, detailed comparison of the manner in which assistance to PWCC and the PHP mill was provided and of the regulatory purposes associated with the form particular parts of the assistance took is neither necessary nor relevant to the disparate treatment part of the *UPS* test.177\n\nIn this regard, the instant case presents a question that is markedly different from the disparate treatment question presented in the context of *UPS*, where domestic and foreign firms were subject to regulatory provisions that gave disparate treatment by virtue of the provisions' own terms. See *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, at paras 80 *et seq* (**CL-113**). See also discussion *supra*, at Paragraphs 118\u2013122.\n\n143.\n\nThe separate question of whether the less favorable treatment was provided in \"like circumstances\"\u2014including what role regulatory programs and governmental goals play in that determination\u2014remains to be answered. I turn to that question next.\n\n**3. Applying the Like Circumstances Test**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe like circumstances test generally requires the claimant to show that the less favorable treatment accorded to the claimant or its investments discriminated among investors or investments that compete with one another. If the differential treatment occurs between investors and investments that are not in competition, like circumstances as a rule will not exist. Where an investor and its investments are in competition\u2014and specifically where the competitive relationship is such that products are direct substitutes\u2014a *prima facie* case of like circumstances generally will be found.178\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 210\u2013211; *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, May 24, 2007, at para 17 (**CL-113**).\n\n**(a) Competition and** ***Prima Facie*** **Showing of Like Circumstances**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nIn this case, the Claimant has demonstrated that (at the time of the relevant acts) its products competed directly with those of NewPage's PHP mill and, afterward, continued to compete with those of PWCC's PHP mill.179 Among other things, its expert, Dr. Seth Kaplan, explained in his reports and testimony the degree of competition among different grades of SC paper, looking at cross-price elasticities and industry reports.180 He drew as well on the evidence gathered in the U.S. investigation of allegations of subsidies that were not compliant with Canada's international undertakings and potentially were dutiable under U.S. countervailing duty law.181\n\nSee, e.g., Claimant's Memorial, at paras 116, 127\u2013130; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 255\u2013256; Expert Witness Report of Seth T.

The question before the US ITC was how to define a \"like product\" class for purposes of addressing issues respecting potential violation of anti-subsidy/countervailing duty law.188 The question before the Tribunal in the instant proceeding is whether the Claimant and its investments were in \"like circumstances\" with PWCC and the PHP mill.\n\nSee *In re Supercalendered Paper from Canada*, Inv. No. 701-TA-530, Final Determination, Commission Opinion, United States International Trade Commission, December 2015, at 1\u20132 (**C-237**).\n\n150.\n\nInsofar as that is the gravamen of the Respondent's argument, I would agree with the Respondent that these two questions are not identical\u2014in part, for reasons I address below.189 But the argument advanced by the Respondent does not differentiate these questions along the lines I find apposite.\n\nWhile the issue is addressed below, it is worth noting here that the difference between the US ITC findings and the Respondent's argument goes beyond a distinction between \"like product\" and \"like circumstances,\" as the US ITC reached conclusions on the nature of product competition and product markets that overlap with but go beyond a narrow focus on products' comparability. See also discussion *supra*, at Paragraphs 86, 144.\n\n151.\n\nInstead, as relevant to this part of the analysis, the Respondent argues that the different grades of SC paper are not sufficiently competitive to constitute a single market190\u2014a conclusion directly opposite the US ITC's finding. The Respondent also urges that grades of paper routinely treated as of lesser quality than SC paper should be combined with lower SC grades in one market while higher rated grades (including some coated mechanical paper) should be combined with higher grades of SC paper in another market191\u2014again, a conclusion diametrically at odds with the US ITC's determination.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 147\u2013151; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 238\u2013245; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 264:22\u2013267:24; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 275:14\u2013277:14.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 347; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 176.\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award declares that \"the Tribunal does not have much difficulty concluding that at least one of Resolute's mills and the PHP Mill were in a competitive relationship (to a more or less high degree)\".192 Ultimately, however, the Tribunal majority does not feel required (in order to resolve this dispute) to assess how close the competitive relationship is, how broadly it applies to the Claimant's investments, or what it means for the case at hand.193 I disagree with that approach.\n\nAward, at para 558.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award does not draw a conclusion on this issue, finding it unnecessary given its approach to determining whether \"like circumstances\" exist. See Award, at para 558, fn. 1198.\n\n153.\n\nThe arguments of the Respondent on this score do not convince me that the analysis and conclusions of the US ITC or those articulated by Dr. Kaplan are in error. And, although the Respondent and the Tribunal's Award note aspects of the US ITC decision that are contrary to the conclusions drawn by a WTO dispute settlement panel,194 those differences are not on matters affecting definition of the relevant product market (which essentially is the equivalent of identifying a \"like product,\" the term used in \"unfair trade\" law implementation by the US ITC).\n\nSee Award, at paras 200\u2013207, 337\u2013338; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 238; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 83 (\"Canada and Nova Scotia's positions before the United States Department of Commerce (\"DOC\"), as well as before the NAFTA Chapter Nineteen and WTO panels, have been consistent [\u2026] As for the subsequent NAFTA Chapter Nineteen and WTO proceedings, they dealt with a narrower range of issues, namely the electricity rate negotiated by NSPI and PWCC, the provision of stumpage and biomass to PHP and payments made by the GNS under the Outreach Agreement).\n\n154.\n\nAfter considering the evidence and arguments on both sides, along with the views of my colleagues, my view is that the Claimant has made a convincing showing respecting the competitive equivalence of its investments and the PHP Mill\u2014based on evidence and logical\n\nrelationships among products, bolstered by common usage in the industry of the market definition advanced by the Claimant and its experts and accepted elsewhere by the very company at issue in this proceeding as having received preferred treatment. Therefore, I conclude that the Claimant has satisfied the basic requirements for a *prima facie* showing that it is in like circumstances with its comparator.\n\n**(b) Other Considerations: Regulatory Regime and Location**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nAt this point, the evidentiary burden shifts to the Respondent to demonstrate that the less favorable treatment of the Claimant and its investments is justified. The Respondent's arguments on this matter are reviewed in the Tribunal's Award.195 Rather than reprise those arguments, I turn to the reasoning of the Tribunal's Award respecting its determination that the Respondent had adequately rebutted the Claimant's *prima facie* case.\n\nAward, at paras 526\u2013527.\n\n156.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal's Award, following the argument of the Respondent, looks at only a few of the impugned actions: protection from renewable energy standards (\"**RES issue**\"); the requirement that the Biomass plant run continuously (which it combines with the RES issue); stumpage fees under the FULA; pension relief; and municipal property tax relief.196 Four of these five measures are described in the Tribunal's Award by reference to a regulatory framework, excepting only the description of municipal property taxation.197\n\nSee Award, at paras 540, 578\u2013603.\n\nSee Award, at paras 540, 578\u2013595.\n\n157.\n\nThe Award concludes that all five measures are both reasonable under the terms of the relevant legal framework\u2014the regulatory frameworks and the rules respecting property taxation\u2014 and, because the regulatory and tax frameworks apply only within Nova Scotia, demonstrate that the Claimant's investments and the PHP mill are not in like circumstances.198 I turn first to the Tribunal Award's assessment of the importance of an identity of regulatory supervision to define \"like circumstances\".\n\nSee Award, at paras 578\u2013603. The Award also emphasizes the Claimant's decision not to bid to acquire the PHP mill, which, in the Tribunal majority's view, would have brought the Claimant within the ambit of the regulatory and tax frameworks relevant to this dispute. See Award, at para 565. This argument is discussed *infra*, at Paragraphs 179 *et seq*.\n\n158.\n\nResting on its reading of other arbitration awards, the Tribunal's Award finds \"'the identity of the legal regime(s) applicable to a claimant and its purported comparators to be a compelling factor in assessing whether like is indeed being compared to like for purposes of Article[] 1102.'\"199 This statement quotes the tribunal award in *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd. v. United States*200 a decision the Tribunal's Award here invokes for support.\n\nAward, at para 559.\n\nSee Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America, UNCITRAL, Award, January 12, 2011, at para 167 (**RL-019**).\n\n159.\n\nYet, *Grand River* presents almost exactly the opposite situation from the instant case. Far from being a situation where the argument is that like circumstances cannot exist where investors and investments are not subject to identical regulatory regimes, a \"core element\" of the claimant's case in *Grand River*, according to the award in that case, was that \"he and his distribution companies should *not* have been subject to the disputed measures applicable to other similarly situated investors and investments\".201 That is, the \"core\" argument in *Grand River* was not whether investors and investments needed to have been (but were not) subject to the same regulatory regime in order to satisfy the requirements for \"like circumstances\". Instead, it was whether the claimant and his investments should have been *relieved* from being subject to the generally applicable regulatory regime.\n\nSee *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award, January 12, 2011, at para 169 (**RL-019**) [emphasis added].\n\n160.\n\nOf course, as the Tribunal's Award states, regulatory regimes and location can be relevant to assessing whether a particular comparator is in like circumstances with the entity or individual asserted to have received different treatment that violates Article 1102. That point is accepted by both Parties here.202\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 213; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 267\u2013268.\n\n161.\n\nThe importance of regulatory regimes, like the importance of location, however, is not an abstract need for investors and investments to be located in the same place and subject to exactly the same regulatory strictures in order to be in like circumstances. Instead, the requisite consideration is entirely contextual: the question arbitral tribunals must address is whether differences in regulatory regimes or location matter in the evaluation of the particular claim asserted in each case.203 If the claim advanced asserting a specific violation of Article 1102 cannot be evaluated apart from recognition of similarities or differences based on location and regulatory regimes, then those factors become relevant for the like circumstances determination.\n\nSee, e.g., *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001, at para 75 (**CL-114**) (\"[T]he meaning of the term [\"like circumstances\"] will vary according to the facts of a given case. [\u2026] '[C]ircumstances' are context dependent and have no unalterable meaning across the spectrum of fact situations\"). Although I do not endorse the entirety of *Pope & Talbot*'s construction and application of Article 1102, I find its recognition of the contextual nature of \"like circumstances\" inquiries both apt and well-stated.\n\n162.\n\nThe claim asserted in this case, at its core, does not turn on challenges to details respecting the application of one or more regulatory regimes. The Claimant has not filed a complaint asserting simply that Canada and GNS applied one or another particular program\u2014for example, the FULA or renewable energy rules\u2014in a discriminatory manner. If that had been the essence of the Claimant's complaint, it would be reasonable to respond that the specific program or programs existed prior to PWCC's selection as the preferred bidder for the PHP mill and had been used generally in a similar manner in other circumstances.\n\n163.\n\nInstead, as discussed above204 and recognized by the Tribunal's Award,205 the essence of the Claimant's case is: first, that GNS officials chose to utilize various measures to construct a package of benefits to PWCC and the PHP mill that was much greater than the Respondent (and, specifically, GNS) had bestowed on other entities; and, second, that, in light of the conditions of the market, it was more than reasonably foreseeable that granting PWCC and the PHP mill this package of benefits would do significant harm to the Claimant and its competing investments in Canada.206\n\nSee discussion *supra*, at Paragraphs 67\u201382.\n\nSee, e.g, Award, at para 541.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 1\u201314; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 1; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 10:1\u20137; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 7:8\u2013 22:2.\n\n164.\n\nThe issue presented, thus, is not whether one or another specific program was designed or applied in a manner that violates Article 1102(3) but whether the *combination* of all of the various measures together violates Article 1102(3). In my judgment, in focusing primarily not on that question but on narrower, program-by-program analysis,207 the Tribunal Award's analysis of the \"like circumstances\" inquiry largely addresses differences in the Claimant's and its investments' circumstances that are factually accurate and obvious but beside the point for the case before us.208\n\nSee Award, at paras 540, 557.\n\nAs noted earlier, see discussion *supra,* at Paragraphs 67\u201384 (and, particularly, at Paragraphs 79\u201380), in my judgment, the Tribunal Award's summary treatment of the \"ensemble\" approach at the end of its like circumstances analysis, see Award, at paras 601\u2013602 (even considered together with its earlier statements at paras 542\u2013543), does not engage sufficiently with the Claimant's arguments on this score.\n\n**(c) Significance of Bowater Mersey's Treatment**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Respondent places considerable significance on the treatment given by GNS to the Claimant's Bowater Mersey mill,209 as does the Tribunal's Award.210 The Respondent, the Claimant, and the Tribunal's Award all agree that Bowater Mersey does not constitute the appropriate investment comparator to the PHP mill, given the absence of the sort of direct competition that exists between the PHP mill and the Claimant's other mills.211 Yet, the Respondent and the Tribunal's Award find it instructive that GNS was willing to provide support to the Claimant and its Bowater Mersey mill.212\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 37 *et seq*; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 166 *et seq*; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 182:4\u2013187:2; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 16:18\u2013161:1.\n\nAward, at paras 562\u2013563.\n\nSee, e.g., Award, at para 563; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 60; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 271; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, 90:25\u201391:6.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 37 *et seq*; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 166 *et seq*; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 182:4\u2013187:2; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 16:18\u2013161:1; Award, at paras 562\u2013563.\n\n166.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues that the support provided to Bowater Mersey was comparable to that provided to PWCC in respect of the PHP mill.213 Indeed, the Respondent suggests that [REDACTED]214 As discussed below in the section immediately following, the Respondent also relies on the asserted comparability of GNS support for Bowater Mersey and the PHP mill in urging the Tribunal to find that the Claimant's decision not to bid on the PHP mill cannot be ascribed in any way to issues related to nationality.215\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 253.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 433:15\u201324.\n\nSee also discussion *infra*, at Paragraphs 176\u2013177.\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondent's arguments about Bowater Mersey's treatment complement its arguments that the Claimant's mills located *outside* Nova Scotia cannot be compared to the PHP mill because the measures used to support PWCC and the PHP mill are not entirely available to investments outside the province.216 Indeed, the logic of that argument by the Respondent is that we should look only at a comparison of the treatment afforded to PWCC and the PHP mill and to the Claimant and its Bowater Mersey mill.\n\nSee, e.g., Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 259.\n\n168.\n\nAgain, even recognizing that neither the Respondent nor the Claimant has urged us to use Bowater Mersey as the proper comparator, the comparison of the Bowater Mersey experience with the PHP mill experience does have utility in judging some of the arguments that have been put forward.\n\n169.\n\nDespite the Respondent's assertions about the similarity of GNS's willingness to support both the Claimant's Bowater Mersey mill and PWCC's PHP mill, it should be clear, as already noted,217 that the commitment of GNS to these two situations, and to the investors in these two situations, was far from comparable.\n\nSee discussion *supra*, at Paragraphs 133\u2013138.\n\n170.\n\nAs set forth above, the package of support for Bowater Mersey (apart from the land acquisitions, which the Respondent argues are simply ordinary purchases for value)218 was [REDACTED] the size of the package provided for PWCC and the PHP mill.219 It was intended to provide merely transitional assistance, allowing the Bowater Mersey mill to survive a short additional time as opposed to providing for its long-term survival and success.220 [REDACTED]221\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 184. Mr. Garneau's testimony states that the [REDACTED]. See Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 321:17\u2013322:24.

See also discussion *supra,* at Paragraph 170, and *infra*, at Paragraphs 185\u2013186.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 333; CBC, News Release, \"Bowater mill postpones upgrades\", June 14, 2012 (**C-331**).\n\n173.\n\nCircumstances are not identical for PHP and Bowater Mersey, but they are \"like\" in some relevant ways. The Respondent cannot reasonably argue, on the one hand, that firms must be entirely subject to the same regulatory regimes and enjoy the same opportunities for specific assistance measures by virtue of their location and, on the other hand, that differences in the degree of competition among their products makes the situations for the two mills unlike.\n\n174.\n\nThe appropriate question for analysis in this case is not whether the mills that are being compared for differences in State treatment produce *products* that are fully equivalent or are sufficiently alike to be very close substitutes. That is the question for \"like product\" analysis in ordinary trade cases, to be sure, where the competitive effects of changes in pricing of one product can be evaluated with respect to products of the complaining party.226 For purposes of NAFTA Article 1102(3), however, the question is only whether the equivalence among products is sufficient to assess the similarity or difference in the *treatment* received by the entities producing them.\n\nWon-Mog Choi, *'Like Products' in International Trade Law: Towards a Consistent GATT/WTO Jurisprudence* (Oxford University Press, 2003). See cases such as *Japan*\u2014*Alcoholic Beverages II*, WTO Doc WT/DS8/AB/R, Review of the Appellate Body, 4 October 1996; *Korea*\u2014*Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages*, WTO Doc WT/DS75, Review of the Appellate Body, 18 January 1999; *Chile*\u2014*Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages*, WTO Doc WT/DS87/R, Review of the Appellate Body, 15 June 1999. See also, Won-Mog Choi and Freya Baetens, Max Planck Encylcopedias of Public International Law\u2014'Like Products'.\n\n175.\n\nThe Respondent advances, and the Tribunal's Award accepts, the argument that this inquiry should not focus on the *effects* of a State's impugned measures on a claimant and the comparison of actions that produce those effects with the treatment of other, competing entities.227 The Respondent's argument is that analysis instead should focus on certain similarities or differences in the investors' and the investments' circumstances with respect to the impugned government actions.228 The analysis that follows from this approach then considers differences along those margins as bases for differential treatment.229 Yet, without deeming the Bowater Mersey mill and the PHP mill in like circumstances for evaluation of the application of Article 1102(3), the Respondent casts the overall treatment of PHP and Bowater Mersey as comparable, given the investments' circumstances.230\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 260; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, 243:15\u201322; Award, at paras 557\u2013559.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 265 [the Respondent's emphasis removed]. See also Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at fn. 553; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 244:19\u201323; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 246:13\u201322.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 268.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 319.\n\n176.\n\nEven if that approach frames the analytical posture for this proceeding, however, I do not find the Respondent's arguments regarding the lessons to be drawn from the Bowater Mersey experience persuasive. Instead of concluding that the treatment of the Claimant and Bowater Mersey and of PWCC and the PHP mill are so similar as to support a conclusion that nationality cannot have played any role, I believe that the differences in treatment are so substantial and so obviously oriented to producing different outcomes as to support the Claimant's position that these do violate the national treatment obligation.\n\n177.\n\nThis is not a statement that differences were solely the product of nationality or were based primarily on nationality\u2014and certainly is not a statement that the differences flowed from animus toward the Claimant.\n\n178.\n\nThe record before the Tribunal, however, including the obviously preferential treatment given to PWCC, in my view does not provide a basis for concluding that the Bowater Mersey story contradicts the Claimant's arguments respecting liability under Article 1102(3).\n\n**(d) Claimant's Decision Not to Bid on the PHP Mill**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nA final part of the Respondent's position on violation of Article 1102(3), also repeated in the Tribunal's Award, declares that the Claimant's decision not to bid to purchase the PHP Mill precludes a finding that the Claimant was in like circumstances to PWCC respecting treatment given in the package of measures provided to PWCC for the PHP Mill's purchase.231\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 278; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 117; Award, at paras 564\u2013567.\n\n180.\n\nThe Award emphasizes that Sanabe & Associates LLC (\"**Sanabe**\"), the firm hired to assist with the sale of the PHP mill, had contacted the Claimant, among the 110 parties formally approached respecting the submission of bids, to inquire whether the Claimant would want to submit a bid.232 Although the Claimant considered that possibility, [REDACTED]233\n\nSee Award, at para 565. See also [REDACTED] at RFP0005610 (**C-107**).\n\nSee Award, at para 565. See also [REDACTED] at RFP0011526 (**C-119**).\n\n181.\n\nThe essence of the position taken by the Respondent and adopted by the Tribunal's Award is: (1) that the Claimant willingly and independently decided not to bid for the PHP mill, which was tantamount to deciding not to seek the same benefits that were provided to PWCC (to the Claimant's detriment); (2) therefore, the Claimant should not be permitted to complain that providing those benefits to PWCC constituted more favorable treatment than the Claimant received in like circumstances.234\n\nSee Award, at para 567.\n\n182.\n\nIn my view, however, this argument should not carry the day with respect to the like circumstances analysis, as it suffers from two flaws. First, it makes factual assumptions that go beyond the evidence before us, relying on inferences from the evidence that are not the ones most compatible with the evidence. Second, it rests on a construction of \"like circumstances\" that is justified only by importing questionable conclusions respecting national treatment into analysis of what should be a predicate to the conclusion rather than a derivative of it.\n\ni. Fact Inferences Respecting Claimant's Decision Not to Bid\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe first error is that the evidence does not comport with the Claimant deciding not to seek benefits comparable to those accorded to PWCC and the PHP mill, as if the Claimant turned down an invitation to enter an open contest for those benefits. [REDACTED]235 Indeed, it was so difficult that the mill's owners faced bankruptcy despite having the most efficient, most advanced SC-paper machine in North America.236\n\n[REDACTED]September 26, 2011, at RFP0011526, 2, 5, 9 (**C- 119**).\n\nCBC News, News Release, \"NewPage Port Hawkesbury mill to be sold\" (Sept. 7, 2011) (**C-115**); Novia Scotia Premier's Office, News Release, \"Province Invests in Jobs, Training and Renewing the Forestry Sector\", August 20, 2012 (**C-183**).

But a very different picture emerges from looking at the relative paucity of support for Bowater Mersey, its insufficiency to produce a substantial change in the economic viability of that mill, and the vast disparity in the treatment of Resolute's Bowater Mersey mill and of PWCC respecting the PHP mill. The combination of these factors underscores the absence of a factual basis for the Claimant to have expected that GNS would provide an assistance package to the Claimant comparable to what GNS provided to PWCC. This highlights the reasonableness of Mr. Garneau's expectation that sufficient assistance would not be made available to the Claimant.\n\n189.\n\nFurther, even in stating his views regarding GNS's likely support for a possible bid by the Claimant, Mr. Montgomerie's position was far from unqualified. Stating that, based on the Bowater Mersey experience, Mr. Garneau could have expected similar support for a PHP bid247 did not convey a commitment of support remotely close to what was provided to PWCC. So, too, stating that GNS would have been \"willing to engage constructively\" on \"reasonable requests\"248 did not express a commitment of support comparable to what GNS provided to PWCC.\n\nWitness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, April 17, 2019, at para 24.\n\nWitness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, April 17, 2019, at para 24.\n\n190.\n\nIn my judgment, the record does not demonstrate a simple choice by the Claimant to forego the opportunity to receive support of the kind and magnitude provided to PWCC for its acquisition and operation of the PHP mill. Inferences based on that assumption, thus, are not well grounded.\n\nii. Fit with \"Like Circumstances\" Determination\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe second flaw in the argument advanced by the Respondent and accepted by the Tribunal's Award in respect of the Claimant's decision not to bid to acquire the PHP mill is its supposition that no firm could be in like circumstances unless it participated in the bidding process. That supposition rests on two analytical assumptions. One is that a State\u2014or, for Article 1102(3), a sub-national government for a state or province\u2014has unlimited ability to decide how to structure its support for industry; the other is that whatever choice is made conclusively frames the like circumstances determination.\n\n192.\n\nThe first assumption is largely correct. NAFTA generally does not direct States and their subnational units to adopt any particular organization of industry. In this respect, GNS was free to decide to support employment in Nova Scotia through a broad-based program of business development, wage support, tax reduction, or other mechanisms, or, as it did, through provision of more concentrated benefits to specific firms.249\n\nAward, at para 576.\n\n193.\n\nThe second assumption, however, does not follow inexorably from the first. A decision to invest massive support in one project does not mean that the decision's effects on other firms are immune from consideration under NAFTA's provisions. It does not, in other words, mean that competing investors and investments cannot be in like circumstances. If that were true, NAFTA Parties would be free to elide the constraints of Article 1102.250\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 223.\n\n194.\n\nPutting the point in more concrete terms, the choice of the *form* for distributing benefits to businesses cannot conclude the inquiry into whether it provides disparate treatment to investors and investments that diminishes the terms of competition protected in NAFTA.251 Likewise, the decision respecting the *magnitude* of benefits granted to a business cannot foreclose analysis of the fit of a state or province's decision with Article 1102(3). The analysis here exactly parallels the obvious conclusion that a state's or province's decision to impose a specific *burden* on a foreign investor or investment would not be rendered immune by its fit with the state or province's preferences, as the grant of a benefit of substantial proportions to a competitor in circumstances such as those presented here is effectively identical to the imposition of a burden on the affected competiting party.252\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraph 128.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 208.\n\n195.\n\nBecause I find that the Claimant and its investments are in a directly competitive relationship to PWCC and the PHP mill, that the Claimant has not chosen to forego a clearly available set of benefits, and that the regulatory provisions relied on by the Respondent to distinguish between the Claimant and its investments and PWCC and the PHP mill are not themselves in issue\u2014as opposed to a decision narrowly focused on the award of benefits utilizing those regulatory provisions\u2014I conclude that the Claimant and its investments are in like circumstances with the PWCC and the PHP mill.\n\n**4. Conclusion Respecting Article 1102(3)**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nAs noted previously, while a state or province is free to choose from among a variety of mechanisms for accomplishing its goals, it is not free to violate the commitment to treat investors and investments of other NAFTA Parties equally.253 GNS made a conscious decision to select one firm to receive extremely generous benefits to reduce its costs of operation in a market where the primary competitor among a small set of firms was an investor of another NAFTA Party operating other investments in Canada and where the reasonably foreseeable result of the Respondent's decision would be to harm significantly the Claimant by depressing prices for its competitive products.\n\nSee discussion *supra*, at Paragraphs 98\u2013117.\n\n197.\n\nAs also explained above, this is the same approach as that taken by Mexico that led to the *Corn Products* case and related cases.254 This decision, in each instance, preferenced a domestic investor and investment at the expense of a foreign competitor and its investments. And it did so in a manner that was not incidental and minor but in a manner that produced substantial adverse consequences as a direct, foreseeable effect of the government's decision.255\n\nSee discussion *supra*, at Paragraphs 25\u201328.\n\nSee discussion *supra*, at Paragraphs 37\u201366, 141.\n\n198.\n\nAs also noted, under Article 1102(3) an intention to advantage one investor or investment (and to burden another) on grounds of nationality is not required.256 Given this understanding, accepted by both Parties,257 a reasonably foreseeable, substantial injury to the foreign (other NAFTA Party's) investor or investment from a choice to manifestly advantage a domestic investor and investment satisfies the requisites for a claim under Article 1102(3).258 In my judgment, the evidence produced in this case fulfils that requirement.\n\nSee discussion *supra*, at Paragraphs 85\u2013117.\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, at para 190; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 92; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 45:18\u201325, 111:3\u2013114:2, 236:7\u201322; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 384:25\u2013384:4.\n\n*Corn Products International Inc. v.

EXCEPTIONS TO RESPONSIBILITY UNDER ARTICLE 1108(7)**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nHaving found that the impugned acts of the Respondent violated Article 1102(3), it is necessary to consider whether impugned acts are excepted from liability under Article 1102(3) by virtue of Article 1108(7).\n\n**A. Interpretive Issues**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Approach and Scope**\n-------------------------\n\n201.\n\nAt the outset, I agree with the Tribunal's Award that the proper interpretive guidance is contained in VCLT Article 31, which directs that \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the *ordinary meaning* to be given to the terms of the treaty *in their context and in the light of its object and purpose*\" (emphasis supplied).259 Although I disagree with the Award's conclusions on the meaning to be attributed to the terms, I agree that this is the formula that should guide our interpretation of NAFTA Article 1108(7).260\n\nVCLT Article 31(1).\n\nSee, e.g., Award, at para 373.\n\n202.\n\nI also agree with the Tribunal Award's conclusion that application of the interpretive approach laid out in VCLT Article 31 coheres with the decision that each impugned act must be examined individually to determine whether it is excluded from liability under NAFTA Article 1102(3).261 As discussed above, NAFTA Article 1102, by its terms directly prohibits States\u2014and in 1102(3), subnational states and provinces\u2014from *according treatment* of a specific nature.262 It does not, by its terms, speak to individual acts of the States or subnational units whose behavior is at issue.\n\nSee Award, at para 372.\n\nSee discussion *supra,* at Paragraphs 83\u2013117.\n\n203.\n\nIn contrast, the language of Article 1108(7) speaks to *specific acts*. It says:\n\nArticles 1102, 1103 and 1107 do not apply to:\n\n(a) procurement by a Party or a state enterprise; or\n\n(b) subsidies or grants provided by a Party or a state enterprise, including government supported loans, guarantees, and insurance.263\n\nNAFTA Article 1108(7).\n\n204.\n\nThis language, on its face, requires attention to the particular acts taken by the Respondent. I view the implication of that direction to require inquiry into the acts individually, not collectively, unlike the proper interpretation of Article 1102(3) in cases such as this.\n\n**2. Interpretive Predicate: Considerations**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nBefore turning to the definition of the two subsections of Article 1108(7), I take up another predicate issue: whether a tribunal interpreting those provisions should begin with a presupposition that, so far as the terms do not have precise, unambiguous meanings, the language should be given a broad or a restrictive meaning.\n\n206.\n\nAlthough both the Claimant and the Respondent purport to offer accurate interpretations of the critical terms of Article 1108(7) based on the ordinary meaning and context of the provisions, they plainly shade their readings in divergent directions.\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, looking to the ordinary meaning of the terms, the word \"procurement\" in Article 1108(7)(a) broadly covers payments in exchange for a good or service, without any restrictive requirements to meet the relevant definition264 and that the term \"subsidies\" in Article 1108(7)(b) (and its associated terms, including \"grants\" and \"loans\") similarly should be given a broad reading extending to government provision of funds to underwrite activities or of valuable benefits for commercial enterprises, again without clear restrictive requirements as to their form.265 The Respondent, thus, characterizes all of the measures impugned in the Complaint, with the lone exception of the electricity measures, as excepted by Article 1108(7) from the Tribunal's consideration respecting the Claimant's allegations that these measures violate Article 1102's guarantees pertaining to national treatment.266\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 230, fn. 486; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1251:16\u20131255:3 and particularly 1254:19\u20131255:3 (\"In the context of 1108(7), it's a broad meaning. It's procurement by a party. It's not covered by other chapters in the NAFTA which deal with procurement or WTO rules on procurement and so on. In the case of 1108(7), the exception is broad. It's procurement by a party, and anything that falls into that, the ordinary rules of interpretation qualifies. And we think, in this case, it's straightforward\".)\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 225.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 224; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 64.\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimant, in contrast, looking to the relation of Article 1108(7) to Article 1102 and to the object and purpose of NAFTA to facilitate trade among the nations of North America, argues that Article 1108(7) should not be construed broadly to insulate the NAFTA Parties from liability under Chapter 11's provisions, as an overbroad reading of the terms used in Article 1108(7) would interfere with accomplishment of NAFTA's purpose.267 The Claimant further urges that, because the provisions in Article 1108(7) constitute exceptions to general rules of liability contained in NAFTA Chapter 11, the excepting provisions of Article 1108(7) should be construed narrowly.268\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 228, referring to Respondent's Statement of Defence, at para 88; Claimant's Reply Memorial, para 276; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1206:4\u20131211:15.\n\nSee Award, at para 372.\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award declares that the Award takes neither a broad nor a narrow reading of the terms of Article 1108(7) except as required to give a faithful interpretation of them.269 Nonetheless, it adopts readings of both Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(7)(b) that broadly exclude State actions\u2014and, as respects application of Article 1102(3), state and provincial actions\u2014from liability under Article 1102.270\n\nSee Award, at paras 373 *et seq.*\n\nSee Award, at paras 381, 417.\n\n210.\n\nAlthough I do not disagree with much of the discussion in the Tribunal's Award respecting the definition and application of the terms in Article 1108(7), I depart sufficiently from the Award's approach to feel impelled to explain my different views.\n\n211.\n\nTwo competing considerations inform my construction of the terms' meanings below. First, while the critical terms used in Article 1108(7), which are not defined in NAFTA, have potentially broad meanings in ordinary discourse, their use in the context of a free trade agreement cannot be thought to invoke the most expansive versions of those meanings where those meanings are not consistent with the operation of NAFTA as a free trade agreement. Legal texts do not simply encapsulate the broadest possible version of ordinary usages where narrower meanings also exist and constitute equally valid definitions of those terms.\n\n212.\n\nFurther, arguments in favor of broad meanings for the terms at issue should be questioned where accepting those meanings would confer expansive discretion on Parties to the treaty to characterize actions in ways that minimize protection for other Parties' investors and reduce the treaty's ability to expand trade and investment within North America.\n\n213.\n\nOf course, although the terms chosen by the Parties should not be artificially narrowed or broadened to avoid consequences that seem unfortunate, neither should they be expanded unnecessarily where equally valid renditions of their meaning better suit the framework of the document in which they appear. That is the essence of the argument for looking to the context and purpose of NAFTA urged by the Claimant here and the meaning of the second phrase from VCLT Article 31 italicized in the quotation of it above.271\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraph 201.\n\n214.\n\nSecond, and perhaps militating in the opposite direction, while the terms' use in the context of a free trade agreement with trade- and investment-expanding purposes should inform their construction, the terms should not be given meanings that conflict with the understanding that NAFTA's goals of expanding trade and investment are encapsulated in a treaty that permits Parties to limit their obligations in specific ways. In other words, consideration of the purposes of the treaty should not emphasize positive goals of the treaty to the exclusion of a recognition that the treaty also reserves the right of Parties to adopt exceptions.\n\n215.\n\nStill, a tribunal reading the terms of NAFTA provisions in light of their context and purpose, as VCLT Article 31 (along with commonly accepted rules of interpretation) directs, must take care not to leap from one evidentiary fragment respecting the purpose of a provision to a vision of the complete picture of the treaty's broader mosaic. In my view, as explained below, that is the mistake made by the Tribunal's Award in its construction of NAFTA Article 1108(7).\n\n**B. Procurement by a Party**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. Article 1108(7)(a)'s Meaning**\n-----------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nDrawing primarily on four prior decisions by NAFTA arbitral tribunals (three of them challenging actions of Canada, its subnational units, or its state enterprises),272 the Tribunal's Award asserts that procurement, as used in Article 1108(7)(a), has a broad meaning covering any acquisition of goods or services.273 It rejects limitations on the term \"procurement by a Party\" that would bring it more in line with the scope of Chapter 10's regulation of procurement,274 in part because Article 1108(7)(a) does not explicitly reference or rely on that chapter275 and in part because limitations would conflict with the ability of NAFTA Parties \"to exercise nationality-based preferences in cases of procurement\".276\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018 (**RL-122**); *Mesa Power Group v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Award, March 24, 2016 (**CL-005**); *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v.

United States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, January 4, 2003 (**CL-130**).\n\nSee Award, at paras 376\u2013390.\n\nSee Award, at paras 383\u2013387.\n\nSee Award, at paras 384\u2013385.\n\nSee Award, at para 386, citing *Mesa Power Group v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Award, March 24, 2016, at para 419 (**CL-005**).\n\n217.\n\nI disagree with the Award's reasoning on three grounds.\n\n218.\n\nFirst, although \"procurement\" can have a broad meaning in common usage, \"procurement by a Party\"\u2014meaning *government* procurement\u2014generally has a more limited connotation. This point is addressed further below.\n\n219.\n\nSecond, the failure of the text of Article 1108(7) specifically to refer to Chapter 10, and expressly to make its treatment of \"procurement by a Party\" coextensive with Article 1108(7)(a)'s use of the term, should be no more dispositive of the term's definition than the text's failure specifically to state that the term does *not* relate to Chapter 10's treatment of procurement by NAFTA Parties. That is, NAFTA's drafters could have chosen to explicitly include *or* exclude that meaning of \"procurement by a Party\", but did neither. Emphasizing one side of that choice, in my view, does not answer any question about Article 1108(7)(a)'s meaning.\n\n220.\n\nThird, the cases cited by the Tribunal's Award, while accurately quoted in the Award respecting their view on interpretation of the provision's meaning, generally do not turn on the interpretive issue relevant to this arbitration. A brief review of the precedents follows before turning to other means of resolving the interpretive dispute.\n\n**(a) Precedents Respecting \"Procurement\"**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nConsider, for example, the decision in *Mesa Power Group*.277 This addresses the question of Article 1108(7)(a)'s interpretation, including the meaning of \"procurement\", in the context of answering whether the term covers government purchases that are not entirely consumed by the purchasing entity or are subsequently paid for in whole or in part by private consumers.278 In other words, the critical questions respecting procurement in *Mesa* were *who* and *how* questions, rather than the *what* question that is central here.279\n\n*Mesa Power Group v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Award, March 24, 2016 (**CL-005**).\n\nSee *Mesa Power Group v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Award, March 24, 2016, at paras 403, 406-421 (**CL-005**).\n\nThe *Mesa* decision also notes the importance of formality to other decisions on the meaning of \"procurement\", while observing that there is no conclusive basis for deciding the level of formality required solely on a definitional basis. See *Mesa Power Group v. Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Award, March 24, 2016, at paras 413\u2013415 (**CL-005**).\n\n222.\n\n*ADF*280 also presented *who* and *how* questions. *ADF* addressed whether Article 1108(7)(a)'s exception applied to purchases made in connection with a highway building project jointly funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"**USDOT**\") and the Commonwealth of Virginia. The question turned on which of the entities in the joint project could be said to have made the purchases at issue: the United States federal government (through the USDOT), the government of Virginia, or the private entities engaged in supervising and carrying out the construction project.281 The question whether the underlying contracting activity constituted \"procurement\" was not in dispute, as the claimant in *ADF* acknowledged that fact subject only to the question of whether the acting party was a government covered by the procurement exception.282 Moreover, as discussed further below, the specific conduct at issue in *ADF* fits a more exacting definition of \"procurement\" that is in keeping with the understood meaning of the term in other contexts, including other parts of NAFTA.283\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v. United States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, January 4, 2003 (**CL-130**).\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v. United States*, Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, January 4, 2003, at paras 160\u2013168 (**CL-130**).\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v. United States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, January 4, 2003, at para 171 (**CL-130**).\n\nSee discussion *infra*, at Paragraphs 233\u2013234. See also *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, paras 68\u201370 (**CL-113**).\n\n223.\n\nSo, too, in *Mercer*,284 the question for the arbitration tribunal did not hinge on the scope of the term \"procurement by a Party\" but on the facts relevant to its application. The parties to the arbitration agreed on the definition of procurement and on its application to BC Hydro and Power Authority (BC Hydro), \"a British Columbia state-owned electricity utility and state enterprise\".285 Their disagreement was whether a particular impugned term in an arrangement setting terms of purchases and sales of energy by a mill owned by Mercer should be regarded as part of a contract for procurement or as a separate measure derived from regulatory initiatives.286 The *Mercer* tribunal's resolution of that issue, thus, determined its disposition of the application of Article 1108(7)(a).287\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at paras 6.40\u20136.41 (**RL-122**).\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v.

Canada.*288 The majority decision in *UPS* found an agreement between Canada and Canada Post Corporation (a Crown corporation with special privileges and responsibilities with respect to mail and parcel delivery, among other matters) also fell within the scope of the procurement exclusion under Article 1108(7)(a).289 The tribunal decision relied on the language from *ADF* as well as on a decision from a domestic Canadian court, *Dussault v. Canada (Customs and Revenue Agency) and Canada Post Corporation*.290 *Dussault* discussed terms of the agreement between Canada and Canada Post at issue in *UPS*, stating that it required services to be performed by Canada Post and payments to be made by Canada.291 Based on its readings of *ADF* and *Dussault* and the test it deemed appropriate to the application of Article 1108(7)(a), the *UPS* majority concluded that the agreement constituted a procurement. One member of the tribunal disagreed with the test used, the relevance of *ADF* and *Dussault*, and the conclusion reached in *UPS*.292\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. v.

At the same time, it is fair to say that the cases dealing with the meaning of Article 1108(7)(a) also do not make a strong case for resting a narrow reading of the provision on the ground of arbitral precedent.\n\n226.\n\nInterpreting Article 1108(7)(a), thus, must rest more on direct construction of the terms in that provision than on what others have said. This is the task taken up next.\n\n**(b) Interpreting \"Procurement by a Party\" to Fit Context and Purpose**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nAlthough there is no definition of \"procurement\" in NAFTA, the treaty does include a chapter on \"Procurement\".293 That chapter, Chapter 10, also does not define \"procurement\", and, as already noted, Article 1108(7)(a) does not expressly incorporate or reference Chapter 10, but that chapter's provisions offer additional information that can illuminate the term's meaning in Article 1108(7). Notably, Chapter 10 includes rules on tendering procedures,294 qualification of suppliers,295 advertising and invitations to potential suppliers to participate in government procurement programs,296 and detailed provisions respecting timing,297 procedures,298 contract awards,299 and bid protests.300\n\nNAFTA Chapter 10.\n\nNAFTA Articles 1008, 1011\u20131012.\n\nNAFTA Article 1009.\n\nNAFTA Article 1010.\n\nNAFTA Article 1012.\n\nNAFTA Articles 1011, 1013, 1016.\n\nNAFTA Article 1015.\n\nNAFTA Article 1017.\n\n228.\n\nGiven its intense focus on the processes generally apposite to government procurement, the term \"procurement\" as used in Chapter 10 is most sensibly read as referring to a more formal and regularized process of government acquisition of goods and services rather than covering any acquisition of any item in any manner so long as payment in some form was made by the government.301\n\nSee *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at paras 71\u201374 (**CL-113**). See also *Canada\u2014Certain Measures Affecting the Renewable Energy Generation Sector,* WT/DS412/R, *Canada\u2014Measures Relating to the Feed*\u2010*In Tariff Program*, WT/DS426/AB/R, Reports of the Appellate Body, May 6, 2013, at para 5.59 (reversing the Dispute Resolution Panel's conclusion respecting the equivalence of \"government purchase\" and \"government procurement\" under Article III:8(a) of the GATT).\n\n229.\n\nFurther, when governments follow more formal and regularized processes for purchasing goods and services, there is likely to be a far more certain basis for valuation of the goods or services provided as well as greater precision in the description of what the government is purchasing. That is why governments routinely follow these procedures.\n\n230.\n\nFocusing more directly on the conflict before us, requirements of regularity and formality\u2014 the procedures commonly associated with government procurement\u2014as predicates for government procurement can serve to reduce the scope for manipulation of characterizations of government actions as falling inside or outside the ambit of provisions protecting against violations of obligations, including national treatment.302 In other words, a more grounded, less open-ended meaning for this term serves better not only to construe procurement's meaning in Chapter 10 but also to facilitate implementation of the term's use in other parts of the treaty.\n\nSee *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at paras 71\u201374 (**CL-113**).\n\n231.\n\nThis reading of the term \"procurement\", thus, should apply to the term's meaning in Article 1108(7)(a). The limitations on liability in Article 1108 are specific exceptions to general obligations under NAFTA. The meaning of a term that appears in more than one part of a legal document, specifically (but not exclusively) a treaty, should not vary unless there is a direction to alter the term's meaning or clear reason for giving the term different interpretations in different parts of the document.\n\n232.\n\nThe Parties to the arbitration have not provided reasons why the meaning of the term \"procurement\" (or its equivalents in other authentic languages for NAFTA) should differ in distinct provisions of the treaty. Repetition of the phrase that one provision (Article 1108(7)) constitutes a \"carve-out\" while the other provisions (of Chapter 10) constitute a \"carve-in\" does not, for me, amount to more than a semantic juxtaposition of the appearance of \"procurement\" within the treaty; the opposed characterizations of the provisions are not, in my view, accompanied by the sort of substantial analysis needed to support giving different meanings to the term in its appearances within a single treaty.\n\n233.\n\nAs already noted, it also is the case that many of the arbitral decisions that are invoked for the proposition that \"procurement\" in Article 1108(7)(a) must have a broad meaning would fit comfortably within an interpretation of that term that is narrowed to fit the requirement of more formal procedures as provided in Chapter 10.303 For example, the *ADF* arbitration, which did much to set the pattern for later interpretations of the term \"procurement\" in Article 1108(7)(a), involved precisely the sort of formal and regularized process of government acquisition of goods and services that is comprehended by Chapter 10.304\n\nSee *supra,* at Paragraphs 220\u2013223.\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v. United States*, Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, January 4, 2003, at paras 145\u2013159 (**CL-130**).\n\n234.\n\nMoreover, for any procurement subject to Chapter 10's requirements, NAFTA imposes a separate \"national treatment\" obligation that essentially serves as a stand-in, or replacement, for the national treatment requirements of Article 1102.305 Given that Article 1108(7)(a) defines an exception to otherwise applicable obligations, it seems most plausible that the exception would apply where the treaty incorporated separate but similar obligations. This approach would minimize potential conflict between two similar provisions and also would minimize the extent of departures from important trade- and investment-protective provisions in the treaty. Although this is not a conclusive basis for construing Article 1108(7)(a)'s meaning, I believe that it is a better basis than offered by other proposed interpretations.\n\nNAFTA Article 1003.\n\n235.\n\nFinally, in this instance, the burden lies on the Respondent to establish the exception just as it lies on the Claimant to establish the affirmative case of a violation of the treaty. The allocation of burdens of persuasion logically extends as well to persuasion regarding the meaning of relevant treaty language. I conclude that the Respondent, which bears that burden in respect of Article 1108(7), has not provided a convincing reason to expand the interpretation of \"procurement by a Party\" in Article 1108(7)(a) to encompass acts not covered by Chapter 10, nor has the Respondent, in my judgment, adequately articulated a reason to treat the term as departing from acquisition of goods and services through the sort of formal and regularized processes that generally are associated with government procurement.\n\n**2. Applying 1108(7)(a)**\n--------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent claims that three measures\u2014(a) the $20 million Land Purchase Agreement, (b) the Outreach Agreement, and (c) payments made for silviculture under the FULA\u2014 constitute procurement.306 In the Respondent's submission, each of these measures involved an exchange whereby GNS \"paid money and received [something of value] in return\".307 As discussed below, in response to the Claimant's arguments, the Respondent also submits that, to the extent PWCC and PHP received payments from GNS that were in excess of the value of goods and services provided, these measures constituted subsidies or grants which also would be excluded from liability under Article 1102.308\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 230\u2013234.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 230\u2013232, 234; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 68, 87.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 232\u2013234, 236; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 65\u2013 68, 87. See discussion *infra*, at Paragraph 243.\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimant disputes these claims, arguing that none of these measures falls within Article 1108(7)'s scope *either* as procurement by a Party within the meaning of Article 1108(7)(a) or as a subsidy or grant appropriately excluded under the terms of Article 1108(7)(b).309\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 228; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 276. The Claimant also asserts that the Respondent's failure to provide specific information on expenditures under parts of its package provided for PWCC in respect of its acquisition of the PHP Mill precludes determination whether the matter should be analyzed under procurement or subsidies considerations. See Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 309\u2013310.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award concludes that all three measures claimed by the Respondent should be excluded under the terms of Article 1108(7)(a),310 although it excepts payments for stumpage under the FULA from this decision.311\n\nSee Award, at paras 392\u2013410.\n\nSee Award, at para 411.\n\n239.\n\nI agree that that each of these measures has some attributes necessary to invocation of the exception under Article 1108(7)(a)\u2014notably, each of the measures asserted by the Respondent to fall within the procurement exception does involve both a payment from the government and receipt of some item of value, whether a tangible good (as in the Land Purchase Agreement) or services (as in the Outreach Agreement and FULA).312 Only one of these measures, however, meets the requirements I conclude are needed to qualify for Article 1108(7)(a)'s exclusion from liability.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras 230\u2013232, 234; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 68, 87.\n\n240.\n\nI concur in the Tribunal Award's discussion respecting the Land Purchase Agreement's relation to the exception for procurement. Although land purchases are not typically thought of as government procurement, as the Award explains, the purchases at issue here fall within the scope of the Award's interpretation of the meaning of Article 1108(7)(a) and also constitute acquisition of a good in exchange for a fixed payment that meets the terms of both formality and regularity consistent with the interpretation of \"procurement by a Party\" that I advanced in the *UPS* decision and restated above in this Separate Statement.313\n\nSee Award, at paras 383\u2013390. See also *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at paras 159\u2013160 (**CL-113**), and discussion *supra,* at Paragraphs 227\u2013235.\n\n241.\n\nI do not, however, find that the other measures\u2014the Outreach Agreement and parts of the FULA accepted by the Tribunal's Award as constituting \"procurement by a Party\"\u2014meet the requirements of Article 1108(7)(a). Neither of these measures has the combination of regular procedures for procurement of specifically defined services for set prices nor the requisite formality of decision-making to constitute activities that would fall within the exclusion from liability represented by Article 1108(7)(a).\n\n242.\n\nIn this regard, consider the difficulty the record before us presents in fixing what has been bought by GNS in more than general terms. The Claimant and the Respondent have offered differing views of the value of each of the features addressed in the Outreach Agreement and the FULA.314 Statements from both parties (including witness statements) respecting the valuation of specific items are of a conclusory nature. None of the assessments of the value of goods or services is supported by specific, critically detailed evaluation of the components of value.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 94\u201398, 219; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 309\u2013310; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 232\u2013234; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 66\u201368; Witness Statement of Julie Towers, April 17, 2019; Rejoinder Witness Statement of Julie Towers, March 4, 2020.\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimant, for example, notes that under the Outreach Agreement, [REDACTED]315 but the Claimant also states that [REDACTED]316 The Respondent contests these claims, [REDACTED]317 [REDACTED]318 The Claimant asserted that payments by GNS to PHP under the Outreach Agreement for [REDACTED]\" fall outside the scope of procurement and protested that it had sought information from the Respondent to facilitate better calculation of amounts attributable to specific activities.319 Even if the information sought by the Claimant could have led to a more reliable calculation of the value of individual parts of the Outreach Agreement, it is unlikely that those calculations would have resolved arguments over these values.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 94, referring to [REDACTED]**(C-206**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 94.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 131, citing [REDACTED] (**C-206**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 131; Rejoinder Witness Statement of Julie Towers, March 4, 2020, at paras 5\u20138.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 310.\n\n244.\n\nFurther underscoring the lack of clear, formal, regularized procurement processes in connection with these measures, submissions from both the Claimant and the Respondent posit *either* that the activities and tangible items provided by PHP and PWCC pursuant to impugned arrangements with GNS are worth what is being given by the Government as payment *or* that the Government is providing funds in excess of those values.320 Whether these positions reflect strategic choices by the parties or sincere difficulties with concrete valuations, they are at odds with the sort of characterizations that should be readily provided with respect to routine government procurements. This difference between the situation that obtains here and, in contrast, with the formality and regularity of routine government procurements reinforces the practical importance of a clearer definition of procurement by a Party than is advocated by the Respondent and accepted in the Award.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 228; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 276; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 232\u2013234, 236; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 65\u201368, 87.\n\n**C. Subsidies or Grants Provided by a Party**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nIn my judgment, similar considerations respecting the requisites for exclusion from liability\u2014 related to both clarity and consistency\u2014should apply to interpretation of Article 1108(7)(b). The following sections address, first, that provision's interpretation and, subsequently, its application.\n\n**1. Interpreting Article 1108(7)(b)**\n--------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nI agree with the Tribunal's Award taking as its starting point the understanding that, as with consideration of the meaning of NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a)'s exception for state procurement, consideration of Article 1108(7)(b)'s exception for state \"subsidies or grants\" is guided by VCLT Article 31 (although, as noted below, I do not subscribe to all of the inferences drawn from this understanding). Article 31 directs that interpretation of treaty terms must be based on *both* the ordinary meaning of the terms *and* their use in the context of NAFTA along with its understood purposes to expand trade and investment within North America. I depart from the Award, however, in my reading of what the term \"subsides or grants\" means as used in Article 1108(7)(b).\n\n**(a) Interpreting \"Subsidies or Grants\"**\n------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nAs with \"procurement\", NAFTA does not expressly define the terms \"subsidies\" or \"grants\". Article 1108(7)(b) does declare that these terms include \"government supported loans, guarantees and insurance\". Those terms, likewise, are not specifically defined, either in the general definitions provided in Chapter 2, the specific provision on export subsidies for agricultural products in Article 705, or in Article 1108(7)(b) itself.\n\n248.\n\nThe Award considers that the absence of a more precise definition of these terms along with the absence of an explicit reference to other provisions of NAFTA or to other treaties indicates that the terms of Article 1108(7)(b) confirm its view that the provision is intended to comprehend broad meanings and not to incorporate limitations on those meanings associated with provisions defining or implementing regulations of the items mentioned in Article 1108(7).321 I disagree with the Award's discussion on this point.\n\nSee Award, at paras 415-417.\n\n**(b) Context and Purpose: One Purpose or More?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nMuch of the Award's reasoning respecting the meaning of the term \"subsidies or grants\" in Article 1108(7)(b) rests on the assumption that this provision must be interpreted by reference to the NAFTA Parties' purpose of exempting subsidies from disciplines such as national treatment that are otherwise applicable under NAFTA.322 The Award first declares: \"NAFTA specifically does not include disciplines on subsidies, and the derogation at Article 1108(7)(b) should be interpreted in that light\".323 Then, after discussing dictionary definitions and other evidence that is at best ambiguous respecting the precise meaning of Article 1108(7)(b)'s exclusion, the Award states that: \"the object and purpose of Article 1108(7)(b), as discussed above, is to permit nationality-based preferences in relation to subsidies and grants; which is the opposite of seeking to discipline subsidies\".324\n\nSee Award, at paras 416, 420.\n\nSee Award, at para 416.\n\nSee Award, at para 420.\n\n250.\n\nIn effect, the Tribunal's Award begins with the predicate that the purpose of Article 1108(7)(b) was to create a broad exemption of subsidies from NAFTA discipline, and\u2014 having found that to be its purpose\u2014the Award concludes that the exemption must be construed broadly to give that purpose its effect.325 This circular reasoning, in my view, hardly constitutes a basis on which to resolve a difficult issue of interpretation. If the reasoning is based on the fact that Article 1108(7)(b) excepts *some* governmental actions from liability, that thought does not axiomatically require that this exception apply broadly to a large array of governmental actions. Article 1108(7)(b) may create exceptions to what is prohibited by other NAFTA provisions, but that fact is not equivalent to a bold directive that those other provisions should be severely limited in scope\u2014which would be the effect of creating a broad exception to them.\n\nSee Award, at para 420.\n\ni. Relation to Other Provisions and Agreements\n----------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nIn addition to the decisive weight given to this broad construction of Article 1108(7)(b)'s purpose, the Tribunal's Award makes two other declarations that are relied on to determine the clause's meaning. First, the Award determines that the NAFTA Parties knew that the term would be interpreted through VCLT Article 31, so they must have assumed that any relation to other parts of NAFTA or to other agreements would not be relied on for interpretation of NAFTA in the absence of express statements to that effect in the document.326 Second, the Award states that other international agreements, such as the WTO ASCM, \"come[] with \"baggage\" [\u2026] that cannot properly be imported into the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1108(7)(b)\".327\n\nSee Award, at para 415.\n\nSee Award, at para 420.\n\n252.\n\nAs explained above with respect to the definition of \"procurement by a Party\", neither VCLT Article 31 nor other accepted bases for interpretation of legal texts requires every related provision or every element of a legal rule to be expressly stated in order for it to be understood as part of a provision's meaning.328 Where the relation among provisions helps clarify a provision's meaning, it is preferable to rely on that as a basis for interpretation than to lean on a circular derivation of assumed meaning from an assumed\u2014and textually unstated\u2014 purpose.\n\nSee *supra,* at Paragraphs 201\u2013202, 213\u2013215, 227\u2013234.\n\n253.\n\nIn other words, the Award reads as if the purpose it assigns to Article 1108(7) is stated in the text, while the relation of the Article to other NAFTA and related provisions is not. Certainly, the first part of that assumption is not correct. The understanding that Article 1108(7) was intended to permit *some* acts by NAFTA Parties that are at odds with a strong version of the national treatment norm is undeniable. But that understanding also is *not* expressly stated in the text. In this respect, it is entirely on par with implications respecting the relation of this provision to other parts of NAFTA and other international agreements that might be implicated in NAFTA's terms.\n\n254.\n\nFurther, NAFTA Article 1902 specifically provides that each NAFTA Party retains the right to apply its own antidumping and countervailing duty laws to goods of the other Parties:\n\nEach Party reserves the right to apply its antidumping law and countervailing duty law to goods imported from the territory of any other Party. Antidumping law and countervailing duty law include, as appropriate for each Party, relevant statutes, legislative history, regulations, administrative practice and judicial precedents.329\n\nNAFTA Article 1902(1).\n\n255.\n\nThis reservation is at odds with the notion that NAFTA comprehended an open field for a State to provide whatever preference it chose for subsidies to its own investors and investments. The entire point of reserving the prospect of the NAFTA Parties' application of countervailing duty (anti-subsidy) law is to provide a mechanism for penalizing certain subsidies of just that sort.330\n\nSee WTO, *Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures* (**RL-193**). See also Bruce A. Blonigen, The Effects of NAFTA on Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Activity, (2005) 19 *World Bank Economic Review* 407 (explaining the continued vitality of domestic antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings in the NAFTA region).\n\n256.\n\nIn addition, this reservation also implicates the definitions respecting subsidies contained in the WTO ASCM, which provides the background rules implemented by national countervailing duty laws.331 With respect to the \"baggage\" that accompanies other NAFTA provisions and agreements on related matters, such as the WTO's subsidies regime, that characterization is simply a way of saying that each internationally agreed regulation of a practice has definitional requisites and rules for what is permitted or prohibited. Those, of course, are the essential attributes of the agreements and give context to the terms at issue.\n\nFor example, the United States changed its rule on injury from subsidies to make domestic countervailing duty law more congruent with GATT (later WTO) rules. See Trade Agreements Act of 1979, Pub. L. 96-39, \u00a7701(a), 98 Stat. 144, 151 (July 26, 1979). The relation between domestic and international law is illustrated as well by the fact that nations signatory to the WTO ASCM (including the US and Canada) engage in dispute resolution under the WTO with respect to terms and application of domestic CVD laws. See Francois-Charles Lapr\u00e9vote & Sungjin Kang, Subsidies Issues in the WTO\u2014An Update, (2011) 10 *European State Aid Law Quarterly* 445.\n\n257.\n\nNothing about that observation precludes one agreement from relying on the understanding that, because another agreement will regulate something (such as the extent to which a government subsidy is permitted), the *already regulated* matter does not need to be separately regulated in *each* international accord. If the regulated practices were merely identified in an *ipse dixit* declaring them to be prohibited, that would hardly constitute a regime that could be relied on to assess which practices merit what sort of treatment under which specific conditions. \"Baggage\", thus, is far more appropriately treated as *qualifying* than disqualifying another accord as a matter to be depended on as a substitute for establishing another regulatory mechanism.\n\nii. Reading Text: Terms and Context\n-----------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nTo be sure, the Tribunal's Award accurately observes that \"subsidies\" and \"grants\" are listed in Article 1108(7)(b) as separate items, while \"grants\" could be subsumed under the term \"subsidies\" in the ASCM.332 I agree with the Tribunal's Award that, if these are understood in NAFTA as separate types of State activity, that would suggest that \"subsidies\" has a broader scope in the WTO regulatory regime than in NAFTA.\n\nSee Award, at para 421.\n\n259.\n\nAt the same time, however, the phrasing of the provision obscures whether the terms \"subsidies\" and \"grants\" in fact are given distinctive meanings, as the qualifying list of examples is not divided between them but appended to both, referring to \"subsidies or grants provided by a Party or a state enterprise, including government-supported loans, guarantees and insurance\".333 A list of examples for two terms suggests that they were understood by the drafters as overlapping or coextensive, rather than distinct.\n\nNAFTA Article 1108(7)(b).\n\n260.\n\nFurther diminishing a distinction between NAFTA and the ASCM, two widely accepted canons of interpretation\u2014*noscitur a sociis* and *ejustem generis*\u2014suggest that the terms used in Article 1108(7)(b) all have similar meanings and present related means of providing direct financial benefit from government to another party.334 *Noscitur a sociis* suggests that any ambiguity in the meaning of \"subsidies\" should be resolved by interpreting it as of similar kind to the other terms in the same list.335 *Ejustem generis* suggests that so far as other terms in the list have more precise meanings, \"subsidies\" should be interpreted in light of those precise meanings to have similar character.336 Both canons help resolve the difficulty that the Award supposes exists if the meaning of Article 1108(7)(a) is interpreted as related to that of the ASCM. Given this construction, it is entirely reasonable to read Article 1108(7)(a) in that light as a limited, not an expansive, exception to Article 1102 liability, with the list of included items giving greater clarity and more limited definition to the meaning of \"subsidies\" in this context.\n\nSee Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, *Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts* (Thomson/West Pub. Co. 2012) at 195\u2013213.\n\nSee Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, *Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts* (Thomson/West Pub. Co. 2012) at 195\u2013198.\n\nSee Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, *Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts* (Thomson/West Pub. Co. 2012) at 199\u2013213.\n\n261.\n\nThat understanding is implicit in the passage from my Separate Statement in *UPS* that is cited by the Claimant in its Pre-Hearing Memorial, which in turn is quoted by the Tribunal's Award.337 After stating that \"the scope of government activity that has the effect of increasing returns to a particular business is too vast for that of itself to bring all such activity within the ambit of Article 1108(7)\",338 the Statement referenced by the Claimant states:\n\nArticle 1108(7)(b) does not appear intended to cover the entire, broad sweep of government activity that might reduce the costs or increase the benefits of a particular business\u2014what might in more colloquial terms be referred to as a \"subsidy.\" Instead, the Article appears intended more narrowly to reach only self-conscious and overt decisions by government to expressly convey cash benefits to a particular business, enterprise, or activity. The list of government actions that come within the scope of the provision is not exclusive, but it is certainly suggestive.339\n\nSee Award, at para 417; *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at paras 158\u2013160 (**CL-113**); Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at paras 71\u201372.\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at para 158 (**CL-113**).\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at para 159 (**CL-113**).\n\n262.\n\nAlthough the word \"cash\" in the quoted excerpt might better have been rendered as \"direct financial benefits\", nothing in the Tribunal's Award persuades me that the position taken in that Statement was ill-considered. Some grounding for the meaning of \"subsidies or grants\" is required if the error of overly expanding the meaning of those terms is to be avoided.\n\n263.\n\nIn addition to the explanation based on the language of the exception itself, the *UPS* Statement explains the logic behind the limited exception in Article 1108(7)(b):\n\nDecisions to provide direct, clear subsidies of the sort averted to in Article 1108(7)(b) typically have substantial political costs and, thus, are commonly subjects of intense debate. The evident belief in drafting the subsidies exception to NAFTA was that the political processes for evaluating considerations relevant to such decisions would guarantee public scrutiny and, if appropriate, discipline under WTO provisions for addressing trade-distorting subsidies.340\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at para 160 (**CL-113**).\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award detours from its discussion of the meaning of Article 1108(7)(b) to disagree with that part of the *UPS* Statement. It declares that \"references to 'overt decisions' and the 'express' conveying of financial contributions that are subject to political processes as well as public debate and scrutiny do not match the reality of the many methods that different levels of government use to provide financial support to enterprises, which methods meet the ordinary meaning of 'subsidies'\".341\n\nSee Award, at para 420.\n\n265.\n\nYet, the reality of governments using many methods to provide financial support to enterprises does not mean that NAFTA's exception for \"subsidies or grants\" of the sort listed in Article 1108(7)(b) excepts all of those means from NAFTA disciplines such as national treatment. As discussed above, the emphasis in the Tribunal's Award on the purpose of NAFTA Parties in retaining flexibility to provide advantages to domestic investors and investments free from the disciplines of NAFTA seems to me to lay excessive stress on the importance of that goal while diminishing the importance of other NAFTA goals such as promoting increased cross-border investment by protecting investors against certain distortions of economic competition.342\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraphs 247\u2013250.\n\n266.\n\nI conclude that the approach taken in the Separate Statement in *UPS* and further explained here better interprets the understanding encapsulated in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(b) than the approach taken by the Tribunal's Award in this case. In my judgment, the Award's approach builds its edifice on only one piece of the interpretive puzzle: the States' interest in limiting liability under NAFTA for national treatment violations committed through government subsidies. That approach ignores\u2014or, at best, dramatically minimizes\u2014contrary interests in limiting the scope of exceptions from certain disciplines and in coordinating the scope of those limitations with the operation of related international agreements.\n\n267.\n\nFor the reasons stated in this section, I dissent from the portion of the Tribunal's Award addressing the interpretation of Article 1108(7)(b).\n\n**2. Applying 1108(7)(b)**\n--------------------------\n\n268.\n\nDespite disagreement with the Tribunal Award's analysis of the proper interpretation of the term \"subsidies or grants\" in Article 1108(7)(b), I do not dissent from the Award's treatment of several individual items defended as excludable by the Respondent. Specifically, measures that fit both parties' descriptions of items that are within Article 1108(7)(b) and also fall within the Tribunal's reading of the exclusion for \"subsidies or grants\" are: (1) the $40 million working capital loan; (2) the $24 million productivity loan; (3) the $1.5 million training grant; (4) the $1 million marketing grant; and (5) [REDACTED].343\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 92\u2013104, 219, 252\u2013253; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 111, 225, 227; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 64.\n\n269.\n\nEach of these measures meets the requisites of being self-conscious and overt decisions by the Respondent expressly to convey direct financial benefits to a particular business (PWCC) in respect of its operation of a specific enterprise (the PHP mill). Each would qualify under either the interpretation of Article 1108(7)(b) set out above or the approach taken in the Tribunal's Award.344\n\nSee Award, at paras 424\u2013432. See also *supra*, at Paragraphs 251\u2013261\n\n270.\n\n[REDACTED] (\"**Indemnity Agreement**\") was not characterized by the Respondent as a subsidy, nor clearly characterized by the Claimant in that language, but it was plainly regarded by the Claimant as an effective subsidy to PWCC.345 Although the Respondent asserted that the Indemnity Agreement was of no real value to PWCC,346 [REDACTED]347\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, paras 42, 229\u2013230, 276\u2013280; Claimant's Reply Memorial, para 181, Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paras 136, 222\u2013234, 238.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para 136.\n\nSee Claimant's Reply, para 181.\n\n271.\n\nDespite a lack of clarity in the Parties' descriptions of the Indemnity Agreement, the [REDACTED] The clear nature of the guarantee in the Indemnity Agreement and the inclusion of \"insurance\" as an example of what falls within the subsidies exception, in my view, satisfy the requirements of Article 1108(7)(b). For that reason, I also agree with the Award's treatment of this provision.\n\n272.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award notes that the Claimant has argued that PWCC received $1 billion in GNS's grant of authority for it to use tax losses to offset taxes on gains outside Nova Scotia.348 It notes as well that the Respondent, although contesting the assertion that PWCC received a benefit from the ability to use tax losses to offset taxes, also characterized this as falling within the scope of Article 1108(7)(b)'s exception from liability.349 The Award did not state a separate conclusion on this matter with respect to its inclusion or exclusion from Article 1108(7)(b), but the assimilation of this matter to the Award's discussion of government-supported loans more generally suggests the Award's conclusion that tax losses are excluded from liability.350\n\nSee Award, at paras 426-427, fn. 892.\n\nSee Award, at para 426, citing Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 226, 318; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 22, fn. 74; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 459:14\u2013 25.\n\nSee Award, at para 427, citing Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 415:19\u201325.\n\n273.\n\nI do not view PWCC's ability to use tax losses to offset taxes as falling within the scope of the 1108(7)(b) exclusion\u2014at least, not without further explication of its relation to the attributes required for this exception.351 I do not find it necessary in the current posture of the case to examine further the details of the arguments respecting the magnitude of benefit to PWCC, but I would not treat it as excepted from liability to the extent that it is part of the ensemble of measures considered in their effect on the Claimant and its investments that are in like circumstances to PWCC's PHP mill.\n\nSee *supra,* at Paragraph 235 (discussing the evidentiary burden on the Respondent respecting this determination).\n\n274.\n\nIn contrast, the municipal tax reduction for the PHP mill that was part of the agreement between PWCC and GNS,352 subsequently confirmed by legislation,353 in my view could fall within the scope of Article 1108(7)(b). Unlike the more ambiguous opportunity to benefit from tax loss offsets, the municipal measure has the attributes of express provision of direct financial benefit to PWCC. Although the record before us does not clearly resolve some issues respecting the actual implementation of this accord, its availability\u2014akin to the Indemnity Agreement\u2014should qualify as a subsidy or grant within the meaning of Article 1108(7)(b).354\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, at paras 115, 219.\n\nSee Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 176.\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraphs 235 (discussing the evidentiary burden on the Respondent respecting this determination).\n\n**3. Equitable Considerations: Estoppel and Self-Contradiction**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nBefore leaving Article 1108(7), it is necessary to address the argument advanced by the Claimant, and rejected by the Tribunal's Award, that equitable considerations militate against acceptance of the Respondent's invocation of Article 1108(7)(b)'s exclusion of \"subsidies and grants\".\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimant's principal argument against the assertion that Article 1108(7) operates to insulate most of the impugned measures as subsidies (including some measures first claimed by the Respondent as procurements) is that the Respondent should not be heard to raise this argument after having made assertions in other fora that conflict with it. The Respondent should not, in the Claimant's words, \"be permitted to 'blow hot and cold'\u2014claiming in one forum that GNS provided no subsidies while, in another forum, asserting [that] subsidies were provided\".355\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 278.\n\n277.\n\nThe Respondent states that it has not denied that GNS' measures constituted subsidies and also states that, even if it had, it would not be prevented from claiming insulation against liability for the impugned measures by reason of Article 1108(7)(b).356 The Respondent declares that the answers it gave and positions it took in other fora cannot be judged in this proceeding and urges that the only relevant bar to its reliance on Article 1108(7)(b) would be the doctrine of estoppel, which it claims can only be invoked when there is detrimental reliance on prior statements.357\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 14, 236\u2013239; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 77, fn. 137.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 15, 240\u2013244; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 72\u2013 80.\n\n278.\n\nAlthough the Claimant does assert harm from Canada's embrace of inconsistent positions in proceedings before different tribunals,358 the point raised by the Claimant is not focused primarily on that harm. Instead, it is focused on principles of equity that require fair dealing. The Claimant frames this argument in these terms:\n\nCanada is not free, under the norms of good faith and self- contradiction in international law, to deny certain measures as subsidies so as to avoid proceedings against subsidies in two forums (an effort in which Canada failed), and then to claim the identical measures are subsidies in order to escape consequences of those measures.359\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 280.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 280.\n\n279.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties on the question of equitable limits on Canada's ability to avail itself of the protections of Article 1108(7) revolves around three questions: (1) did the Respondent's statements in the WTO proceedings and the United States' countervailing duty proceedings contradict its statements in this arbitration proceeding? (2) if so, is there an equitable principle that prohibits such self-contradiction? (3) would any such principle prevent the Respondent's invocation of exclusions under Article 1108(7)?\n\n280.\n\nAlthough rejecting the majority of the Respondent's arguments on this score, the Tribunal's Award finds that there has not been any contradiction by Canada respecting its characterization of its (and its province's) actions.360 Understandably, having rejected the argument that the Respondent *in fact* took contradictory positions, it did not reach the other questions respecting the effect of taking contradictory positions.\n\nSee Award, at paras 436\u2013460.\n\n281.\n\nI agree with much of the Award's reasoning explaining why the Respondent's arguments respecting statements made by the Respondent in other fora are unavailing, but I disagree with the Award's ultimate conclusion on the Respondent's denials that conduct challenged here constituted subsidies.\n\n**(a) Statements about Subsidies**\n----------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimant states that the Respondent's positions in two other fora contradicted its position with respect to subsidies in this proceeding. First, the Claimant states that, in its reporting to the WTO Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement Committee for the period July 2011 to July 2013, Canada reported \"nil\" to the existence of GNS subsidies.361 (Indeed, the Claimant notes that the Respondent reported \"nil\" to GNS subsidies over a longer period that extended from 2010 to 2016 in reports filed in 2013, 2015, and 2017.)362 Second, the Claimant further states that in the countervailing duty investigation (\"**CVD Proceeding**\") before the United States Department of Commerce (\"**US DOC**\") and US ITC, the Respondent defended itself against \"any and all subsidy allegations\".363\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 229; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 277, fn. 418, referring to World Trade Organization, New and Full Notification Pursuant to Article XIV:1 of the GATT 1994 and Article 25 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures\u2013Canada, WTO Doc. G/SCM/N/253/CAN, July 1, 2013, section 12 (**C-021**). See also Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 283\u2013285, fns. 426\u2013428.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 285.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 229. The Claimant also refers to this proceeding in noting that the Respondent did not raise its Article 1108(7) defense in this arbitration until after the US DOC proceeding was closed. Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 277.\n\n283.\n\nWith respect to its reports to the WTO, the Respondent asserts that its report of \"*nil*\" subsidies by GNS should not be construed as a denial that GNS was providing subsidies to PHP and PWCC.364 The Respondent also says that it fully informed the WTO about the subsidies GNS has provided to PHP and PWCC.365 Finally, the Respondent urges that reports to the WTO on subsidies are not conclusive as to the legal status of reported measures and therefore are not relevant to the meaning of \"subsidies\" in other proceedings.366\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1243:10\u20131248:11.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 239; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 85; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1244:2\u20135.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 239; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 84, citing WTO, *Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures* (**RL-193**).\n\n284.\n\nUnlike the Tribunal, I am not persuaded by the Respondent's argument that a report of \"*nil*\" to a request to list any subsidies by GNS had no meaning. The Respondent urged that it had not denied the existence of the subsidy because no \"such inference can be read from a simple reporting of the word 'nil'\".367 The Respondent also argued that the Tribunal cannot set aside its reading of Article 1108(7)(b) \"for the sake of [\u2026] three letters in a separate agreement\".368 The Respondent further emphasized that the reports of subsidies that the Respondent makes to the WTO in respect of the SCM Agreement are products of a complicated process of compiling information from its provinces.369\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1246:7\u201313.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1246:15\u201320.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 85; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1247:16\u20131248:9.\n\n285.\n\nI do not question the sincerity of the Respondent's answers in this proceeding, nor do I doubt the complexity of governmental processes that generate reports to other international bodies. Nonetheless, I conclude that the Respondent should be accountable for its clear denial that GNS did provide subsidies to PHP and PWCC.\n\n286.\n\nThe Respondent's denials were repeated over a period of years and were advanced to the very forum focused on and dedicated to addressing disputes respecting subsidies. The meaning of the \"*nil*\" reports is clear, and, contrary to the Respondent's arguments in this case and the Award's characterization of them,370 I cannot read them as mere technical statements respecting a small subset of the measures at issue here.\n\nSee Award, at paras 456\u2013457.\n\n287.\n\nAccepting the Respondent's assertions, the Tribunal's Award suggests that the Respondent has been consistent in its acceptance that the GNS measures were subsidies.371 The Award declares that the Respondent's statements respecting whether the GNS measures were subsidies were \"uncontradicted,\" quoting the Respondent's assertions that it \"did not dispute a number of the elements that led to the DOC's Final Determination that some of the measures at issue in this case were countervailable subsidies under U.S. domestic law\" and that \"NAFTA Chapter Nineteen and WTO Proceedings [\u2026] dealt with a narrower range of issues\" than are involved in the proceedings here.372\n\nSee Award, at paras 456\u2013458.\n\nAward, at para 457, citing Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 83.\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent's statements, however, even if uncontradicted in the narrow sense of not being precisely refuted for what they say, elide the central question at issue here. The Respondent says that it \"did not dispute a number of the elements\" that led the US DOC to conclude that Canada was providing, through its province Nova Scotia, subsidies that violate US law and Canada's international obligations. That does not say that it admitted those elements to be subsidies, much less that it did not dispute *any* of the contested elements. Similarly, the Respondent's statement that proceedings before WTO dispute resolution tribunals dealt with a subset of subsidy issues does not state that Canada did not deny that other measures were subsidies.\n\n289.\n\nAs befits good lawyering, the Respondent's statements are carefully framed. But they do not directly refute the Claimant's assertion that Canada denied its provision of subsidies to PWCC in respect of its purchase and operation of the PHP mill.\n\n290.\n\nFurther, looking at the proceedings where other nations contested the \"nil\" declaration respecting subsidies provided during the time period at issue here produces a different picture than that painted by the Respondent and the Tribunal's Award. The minutes of the first meeting of the WTO ASCM Committee addressing Canada's \"nil\" declaration contains the following entry:\n\n61. The US raised concern the provincial government of Nova Scotia in Canada intended to provide significant government assistance to Port Hawkesbury Paper, a manufacturer of supercalendered paper located in Nova Scotia, because of the commercial impact that such assistance would have on the depressed market for printing paper in North America. This Mill had been shut down by its previous owner and was being restarted under new ownership with the help of a substantial provincial government assistance package. Many of the measures taken by the provincial government might constitute actionable subsidies. The assistance package was particularly disturbing because it would keep uneconomic capacity on line. The US invited Canada to provide details regarding each of the elements of the assistance package that had been or would be provided to this company.\n\n62. The EU shared the US concerns.\n\n63. Canada stated that it was working with the provincial government on replies to the questions that the US had sent regarding this issue and expected to provide such replies in November 2012. Canada was ready to have further dialogue on this matter with interested Members.373\n\nWTO, Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Minutes of the Regular Meeting held on 23 October 2012, January 10, 2013, WTO Doc. G/SCM/M/83, at paras 61\u201363 (**R-078**).\n\n291.\n\nThe minutes of the meeting do not in any way indicate that Canada acknowledged that it was providing subsidies or even that it was providing assistance that might be considered to be subsidies. The minutes do not show that Canada retracted or qualified its \"nil\" statement respecting provision of subsidies.\n\n292.\n\nSimilarly, the minutes of the next meeting to take up this matter provide evidence of continued US and EU concern, but not evidence that Canada acknowledged its provision of subsidies or qualified its \"nil\" statement in any way:\n\nCertain possible government assistance provided to a pulp and paper mill in Nova Scotia, Canada - Item requested by the US and EU\n\n128. The US noted its continued serious concern over a provincial government assistance package given to a paper mill in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, Canada. The assistance package at issue was given after the paper mill went bankrupt and was sold to a new owner. In the press, the new owner made it clear that, absent a certain level of government assistance, the plant was not economically viable and would not be re-opened. Negotiations with the Provincial Government resulted in what appeared to be a very generous assistance package that led to the re-opening of the plant and the start-up of production, sales and exports.\n\n129. As had been feared at the Committee's previous meeting, the production and sales of this plant had begun to have serious negative consequences in the market for U.S. paper producers. [\u2026] All of this had happened after the receipt of a government assistance package that the new owner admitted in the press was needed for the plant to survive. But for the receipt of the government assistance package, it appeared that the plant at Port Hawkesbury would not be in production. The US urged the Canadian Government and the Provincial Government of Nova Scotia to re-consider this generous support package [\u2026]\n\n130. The EU requested information from Canada on the aid package reportedly given to the Port Hawkesbury paper mill by the provincial government of Nova Scotia. The EU presumed that this scheme would be notified in Canada's 2013 new and full subsidy notification.\n\n131. Canada stated that it took the concerns seriously and reiterated that the circumstances of the sale of the Port Hawkesbury mill and its re-opening were a matter of public record in the context of court-sanctioned creditor protection proceedings in which US creditors and other stakeholders had figured prominently in the decision-making. Canada indicated that the Federal Government and the Government of Nova Scotia had worked with the US and the EU to resolve this issue and had already provided responses to the US government's first set of questions in November, and to a second set of questions in February. It had provided as much information as possible while respecting the business confidentiality of the information.374\n\nWTO, Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Minutes of the Regular Meeting held on 22 April 2013, August 5, 2013, WTO Doc. G/SCM/M/85, at paras 128\u2013131 (**C-353; R-079**).\n\n293.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, whatever meaning would attach to its \"nil\" reports to the WTO standing alone, in context they should not be considered to be denials that the GNS measures were subsidies. That is, the Respondent says, because the Respondent engaged in discussions with trade partners, including the United States, respecting the GNS measures at issue and revealed the nature of the measures to trade partners, those steps should erase its plain denial that these measures were subsidies.375 I do not find this argument persuasive.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 239; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 84; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1243:23\u20131244:5.\n\n294.\n\nWhat the record shows is some (very slight) degree of engagement by the Respondent after trade partners questioned the measures taken by GNS, with those partners strongly expressing concerns that the measures constituted subsidies that violated SCM Agreement undertakings. In my judgment, this in no way reverses the Respondent's clear declaration in the WTO-ASCM forum that GNS had *not* given subsidies. As is evident from the passages quoted above, the materials the Respondent cites to primarily consist of its trading partners' expressions of displeasure at the Respondent's apparent violation of WTO subsidy strictures and at least one request from a major trading partner that the Respondent correct its report denying the subsidy.376\n\nWTO, Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Minutes of the Regular Meeting held on 22 April 2013, August 5, 2013, WTO Doc. G/SCM/M/85, at paras 128\u2013131 (**C-353; R-079**); WTO, Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Minutes of the Regular Meeting held on 23 October 2012, January 10, 2013, WTO Doc. G/SCM/M/83, at paras 61\u201363 (**R-078**).\n\n295.\n\nNor does the fact that the Respondent, on such inquiries, provided a description of *some* of the GNS measures constitute an admission that the GNS measures constitute subsidies or a retraction of its \"nil\" statements to WTO-SCM.377 Indeed, the Respondent's filing disclosing terms of GNS measures, responding to USTR questions, emphasizes the value of the measures to GNS as an investment rather than an admission that the measures constitute subsidies.378\n\nWTO, Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Minutes of the Regular Meeting held on 22 April 2013, August 5, 2013, WTO Doc. G/SCM/M/85, at para 131 (**C-353; R-079**); WTO, Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Minutes of the Regular Meeting held on 23 October 2012, January 10, 2013, WTO Doc. G/SCM/M/83, at para 63 (**R-078**).\n\n[REDACTED](**C-212**).\n\n296.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that its position respecting subsidies in WTO-ASCM processes are not to be taken as conclusive respecting the legal status of reported measures and that any position taken in that forum is not relevant to the meaning of \"subsidies\" in other proceedings.379 The Respondent quotes from Article 25.7 of the WTO's SCM Agreement: \"Members recognize that notification of a measure does not prejudge either its legal status under GATT 1994 and this Agreement, the effects under this Agreement, or the nature of the measure itself\".380 In the Respondent's view, \"[i]f the notification of a measure does not prejudge its nature, the lack of notification cannot have that effect either\".381\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 239; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 84, citing WTO, *Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures* (**RL-193**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 239; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 84, citing WTO, *Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures* (**RL-193**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 239.\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal's Award rightly states that this argument is not persuasive, noting moreover that the provision quoted by the Respondent does not serve its argument. Instead, it undercuts the Respondent's argument. The language of the SCM Agreement Article 25.7 prompts parties to the SCM Agreement to disclose subsidies without being bound to any inference that the subsidies violate ASCM strictures, which proscribe only some subsidies. In other words, the quoted language should encourage broader, not narrower, disclosure of subsidies. The Respondent's denial of subsidies in that forum, thus, should be taken especially seriously.\n\n298.\n\nThe Claimant also asserts that the Respondent denied that impugned GNS measures were subsidies when those measures were challenged in U.S. CVD Proceedings before the US DOC and US ITC.382 Given the clarity of the denial in the context of the Respondent's ASCM filings, I do not find it necessary to address that additional assertion of contradiction.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 229. See also Claimant's Memorial, at para 149 (describing Joint Defense Agreement between Canada and companies implicated in investigation, excluding Resolute).\n\n**(b) Self-Contradiction**\n--------------------------\n\n299.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent, having previously denied that impugned GNS measures constitute subsidies, is prevented by the principle against self-contradiction, from asserting the opposite in this proceeding.383 The Claimant further declares that this principle is part of the long-accepted obligation of good faith.384 In the Claimant's view, this principle against self-contradiction applies even where a narrower application of estoppel rules would not, specifically by not requiring a showing of detrimental reliance.385\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 230; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 278\u2013280.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 280, 292, 301, 302.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 279\u2013280, 291\u2013301.\n\n300.\n\nThe Respondent argues to the contrary that the Claimant's proposed test is incorrect.386 The Respondent asserts that the estoppel doctrine requires detrimental reliance as a condition for its operation.387 The Respondent asserts that there is no separate principle against self-contradiction in international law.388\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 240.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 240, referring to James Crawford, *Brownlie's Principles of International Law* (Oxford University Press, 8th ed., 2012) at 420 (**RL-124**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 240; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 79.\n\n301.\n\nThere is some merit to each contention. As the Respondent argues, there is a line of cases applying a rule for estoppel that requires several conditions including either that the complainant relied on a prior, contrary position to its detriment or that the entity that has changed positions has received a benefit from its inconsistency.389 Many of these cases concern matters that raise questions within the special competence of State determination on relations between States. In such matters, it may be more critical to limit review by others, whether for consistency or other grounds, though even these judgments are contested390 and may differ depending on the length of time over which a determination has been in place.391\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 240, referring to *Cambodia Power Company v.

For example, in *Chevron Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador*, the tribunal stated:\n\n7.106. Applying Article 26 of the VCLT and customary international law, the Tribunal decides that the Parties are bound to act in good faith in the exercise of their rights and the performance of their respective obligations under the Arbitration Agreement [\u2026]. That duty of good faith precludes clearly inconsistent statements, deliberately made for one party's material advantage or to the other's material prejudice [\u2026] to affirm a thing at one time and to deny that same thing at another time according to the mere exigencies of the moment.\n\n7.107. The Tribunal here bases its decision on the general principle of good faith under international law applied to the Parties' obligations under their Arbitration Agreement, rather than upon any specific doctrine derived from the Anglo-Saxon concept of equitable estoppel by conduct or representation. [\u2026] [A]lthough estoppel is consistent with the general principle of good faith, it is a different doctrine under international law. As Lord McNair wrote in regard to *The Fur Seal Arbitration* [395], that decision did not involve \"*estoppel eo nominee*\", but a broader principle precluding a State, in his words, from 'blowing hot and cold'; i.e. the principle of good faith.396\n\n*Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v.

Too broad an application of requirements of good faith can interfere with the functioning of States in making important decisions on matters of public policy. But State freedom to frame, and to change, positions on matters of public policy is distinguishable from a requirement that States adhere to consistent positions taken in legal proceedings. In such proceedings, it is reasonable to insist on a measure of consistency rather than to permit States to take positions of convenience even if contradictory.\n\n304.\n\nA requirement of good faith dealing in matters that are subjects of formal proceedings is a central feature of numerous legal principles, including due process of law.397 It provides a basis for taking seriously the representations of States, and also for limiting the scope of judgments that are made during legal proceedings, when unbiased information may be especially difficult to obtain.398\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 293, citing *Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand)*, Separate Concurring Opinion of Vice-President Alfaro, June 15, 1962, ICJ Reports 1962, 39, at 39 (**CL-136**); Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 296, referring to *Arbitral Award Made by the King of Spain on 23 December 1906 (Honduras v.

Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, at para 163 (**CL-113**).\n\n305.\n\nI conclude that the Claimant has properly identified a basis in international law for requiring consistency sufficient to indicate good faith in dealing with formally undertaken international obligations.\n\n**(c) Application of Principle Against Self-Contradiction**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe question remains whether the Respondent should be barred from pressing its contentions respecting exclusion of impugned measures under NAFTA Article 1108(7)(b). Even if there is a general principle against self-contradiction, the Respondent urges that it is not applicable where the inconsistency derives from representations to a different entity in a different forum concerned with enforcement of obligations under a different international instrument.399\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 239; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 71.\n\n307.\n\nThe Respondent's arguments on this score largely consist of reprising its denial of inconsistent representations or of urging a very limited concept of the principle against self-contradiction. The Respondent's one additional argument is that the principle against self-contradiction should not be applied to statements to different tribunals under different legal instruments.400 That argument proves too much. It essentially eliminates the restriction against self-contradiction in all but the most extreme cases of conscious misleading of international legal process in a proceeding before a single tribunal.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 239; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 71.\n\n308.\n\nI conclude that the Respondent, having made contrary representations over a period of years respecting the GNS measures in other proceedings, should not be heard to invoke Article 1108(7)(b)'s exclusion of subsidies here.\n\n309.\n\nTo the extent that analysis in the Tribunal's Award diverges from the analysis in this Statement of Article 1108(7) exceptions to the Respondent's responsibility under Article 1102, I dissent from that part of the Tribunal's Award.\n\n**V. CONCLUSION**\n-----------------\n\n310.\n\nBecause I conclude that the Respondent cannot avail itself of exceptions for much of the set of impugned measures that otherwise might be excepted as subsidies or grants, I reaffirm my conclusion that the Respondent did violate its obligations under NAFTA Article 1102(3) and, in my judgment, should be required to compensate the Claimant for that violation. Given the opposite conclusion in the Tribunal's Award, however, I will not address issues of causation and damages.\n\n311.\n\nApart from the matters addressed above, I join the Tribunal's Award.\n\nDate: July 25, 2022"}], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**L****ist of** **D****efined** **T****erms**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **[REDACTED]** | [REDACTED] (Exhibit R-161) |\n| **2020 Hearing** | Hearing on the Merits and Damages held from November 9-14, 2020 |\n| **2021 Hearing** | Hearing on the Merits and Damages held from October 18-19, 2021 |\n| **Arbitration Costs** | The costs for this arbitration, fixed in accordance with Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules |\n| **Assistance Measures** | The series of measures implemented by Nova Scotia in 2012 |\n| **ATR** | Advance tax ruling from the CRA |\n| **[REDACTED]** | [REDACTED] (Exhibit C-182) |\n| **Biomass Plant Issue** | Issue pertaining to the operation of the Biomass Plant at the PHP Mill raised in relation to PWCC and NSPI's application for approval of an LRR |\n| **Bowater Mersey** | The Bowater Mersey paper mill in Nova Scotia owned by Resolute |\n| **Canada** | The Government of Canada (or \"the Respondent\") |\n| **CCAA** | *Companies' Creditor Arrangement Act*, R.S.C. 1985, c-36 (Exhibit R-025) |\n| **Catalyst** | Catalyst Paper Corporation |\n| **Claimant's Memorial** | Memorial on Merits and Damages filed by the Claimant on December 28, 2018 |\n| **Claimant's Pre- Hearing Memorial** | Resolute's pre-hearing memorial submission of October 14, 2021 |\n| **Claimant's Reply Memorial** | Reply Memorial on Merits and Damages filed by the Claimant on December 6, 2019 |\n| **Claimant's Reply to Article 1128 Submissions** | The Claimant's submissions in reply to the Non-Disputing Parties' Article 1128 Submissions, filed by the Claimant on May 8, 2020 |\n| **Claimant's Revised Cost Submission** | The Claimant's revised submission on costs, filed on December 15, 2021 |\n| **Claimant's Statement of Claim** | Statement of Claim filed by the Claimant on December 30, 2015 |\n| **Confidentiality Order** | Confidentiality Order dated October 27, 2016 |\n| **Court** | The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia |\n| **CRA** | Canada Revenue Agency |\n| **CVD Investigation** | Countervailing duty investigation initiated by the US Department of Commerce |\n| **EBITDA** | Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization |\n| **EGSPA** | *Environmental Goals and Sustainable Prosperity Act*, SNS 2007, c.7 (Exhibit R-194) |\n| **ERDT** | Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism of the Government of Nova Scotia |\n| **EY** | Ernst & Young, in their capacity as expert witness to the Claimant |\n| **FIF** | Forestry Infrastructure Fund |\n| **Four Exhibits** | Respondent's four exhibits pursuant to which the Claimant sought a re-designation from Restricted Access to Confidential Information during the document production phase of this arbitration |\n| **FTC** | NAFTA Free Trade Commission |\n| **FULA** | Forest Utilization License Agreement |\n| **GDP** | Gross Domestic Product |\n| **GNS** | The Government of Nova Scotia |\n| **HFCS** | High fructose corn syrup, as mentioned in *Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v.

The Claimant's address is 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, United States of America.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant brings this arbitration as an investor on its own behalf and on behalf of Resolute FP Canada Inc., a corporation incorporated in Canada that is directly owned and controlled by the Claimant. The address of Resolute FP Canada Inc. is 1010 Rue De La Gaucheti\u00e8re O Suite 400, Montr\u00e9al, QC H3B 2N2, Canada.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in these proceedings by:\n\nMr. Elliot J.

O****verview of the** **D****ispute**\n------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nA dispute has arisen between the Claimant and Canada in respect of which the Claimant commenced arbitration pursuant to Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\").\n\n6.\n\nThis dispute concerns the Claimant's investment in the following supercalendered paper (\"**SC Paper**\") mills in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada: the Laurentide mill, the Dolbeau Mill, and the K\u00e9nogami Mill. The Claimant argues that the Government of Nova Scotia (\"**GNS**\") granted Pacific West Commercial Corporation (\"**PWCC**\") (the new owner of the Port Hawkesbury mill (the \"**PHP Mill**\"), following a court-sanctioned process of arrangement with creditors) a package of assistance measures in 2012 (the \"**Nova Scotia Measures**\" or \"**Assistance Measures**\") \"to assure the reopening of PHP as '*the* lowest cost producer' in North America\".1 According to the Claimant, the Assistance Measures are attributable to GNS (and, therefore, to Canada) under international law and constitute a violation of the national treatment standard (NAFTA Article 1102) and the minimum standard of treatment (NAFTA Article 1105).2 The Claimant argues that, with the benefit of the Assistance Measures, the PHP Mill was able to restart operations and add significant capacity to an SC Paper market in secular decline, which had negative effects on Resolute's prices and shipments.3 According to the Claimant, GNS thereby knowingly caused Resolute \"substantial, accelerated economic damages\".4\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 2 [emphasis in original].\n\nA claim for breach of Article 1110 (Expropriation and Compensation) was abandoned by the Claimant in its Memorial at para. 14. See also Jurisdiction Decision, at paras 312-314.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 92.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 1.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant claims compensation in the amount of at least US$121.4 million for profits lost due to price erosion (the Claimant arrives at US$126 million using a forecasting approach and US$121.4 million using a price-elasticity approach, and asks to be awarded the lower sum, \"consistent with Resolute's overall conservative approach to damages\").5 It also requests an award \"for its costs and fees of this arbitration\".6\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 109. The Claimant's original request was for US$163,695,000 (Claimant's Memorial, at para 310), modified to US$ 103,967,000 in its Reply (Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 397).\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, Claimant's Opening Argument, at 104.\n\n8.\n\nIn the first phase of this arbitration, the Respondent argued that the Claimant's allegations in respect of the measures taken by GNS were time-barred under NAFTA Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) (the \"**Time-Bar Objection**\"). Alternatively, the Respondent argued that the Nova Scotia-related claims fell outside the scope of application of NAFTA under Article 1101(1) (the \"**Scope Objection**\") and that the Claimant's national treatment claims were inadmissible under NAFTA Article 1102(3) (the \"**Provincial Treatment Objection**\"). The Tribunal also considered whether it had jurisdiction over the Article 1110 claim of expropriation of the Laurentide Mill under the *Oil Platforms* test. Finally, the Respondent also submitted that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction in respect of the Nova Scotia Measures insofar as they relate to taxation measures implemented by GNS (the \"**Taxation Measures Objection**\").\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on January 30, 2018 (the \"**Jurisdiction Decision**\"). In the Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal rejected the Time-Bar Objection.7 The Tribunal also rejected the Scope Objection, except with respect to interim measures taken by the Respondent to keep the PHP Mill in operation prior to its sale in September 2012, which the Tribunal found it had no jurisdiction over.8 The Tribunal rejected the Provincial Treatment Objection based on Article 1102(3), while at the same time noting that in the first phase of the proceedings the Tribunal was not called upon to discuss the application of the \"like circumstances\" test, nor the meaning of \"treatment\" in Article 1102.9 In the Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal expressed the view that the Claimant's Article 1110 claim for expropriation of the Laurentide Mill faced \"considerable difficulties, even assuming the facts as pleaded\", but nevertheless considered that the claim should not be dismissed at the preliminary stage.10 The Article 1110 claim was later abandoned by the Claimant.11 Finally, with respect to the Taxation Measures Objection, the Tribunal found that taxation measures are \"simply not covered by NAFTA except as provided in Article 2103, and there is no relevant exception here\".12 Thus, even if the present claim fell within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and was otherwise admissible, \"it could not include any aspect of Nova Scotia's conduct covered by the taxation measures exemption in Article 2103\".13\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 179.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at paras 243-248, 330.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at paras 290-292.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 312-314.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 14.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 328.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 329.\n\n10.\n\nIn addition to the arguments on jurisdiction and admissibility dealt with in the first phase of the arbitration, the Respondent has also raised objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction relating to the measures taken by Canada in respect to the investigation by the United States Department of Commerce (\"**US DOC**\") in relation to the Canadian SC Paper industry. The Parties had agreed that those objections would be dealt with in this merits phase of the arbitration.14 The Claimant has abandoned this claim at the merits phase of this arbitration.15\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 10.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 152.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n11.\n\nPart II of the Jurisdiction Decision recounts in detail the procedural history of this arbitration up until January 30, 2018. The Procedural History in the present Award recalls only the key details from the first phase of the case and sets out relevant procedural developments since the issuance of the Jurisdiction Decision.\n\n**A. S****ummary of the** **F****irst** **P****hase of the** **A****rbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn December 30, 2015, the Claimant served on Canada its Notice of Arbitration (\"**Notice of Arbitration**\") and Statement of Claim (\"**Statement of Claim**\") under NAFTA Chapter 11. Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1120(1)(c), the Claimant also indicated its election to proceed with the arbitration pursuant to Article 3 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules of 1976 (\"**UNCITRAL Rules**\").\n\n13.\n\nPursuant to UNCITRAL Rules Article 7 and NAFTA Article 1123, the Tribunal was constituted in May 2016. The Tribunal was originally composed of Dean Ronald A. Cass, Dean Emeritus of Boston University School of Law and a national of the United States of America, appointed by the Claimant in December 2015; Professor C\u00e9line L\u00e9vesque, Full Professor, Faculty of Law, Civil Law Section, at the University of Ottawa and a national of Canada, appointed by the Respondent in March 2016; and H.E. Judge James R. Crawford, AC, a judge of the International Court of Justice (\"**ICJ**\") and a national of Australia, appointed as the presiding arbitrator by mutual agreement of the Parties in May 2016.\n\n14.\n\nOn June 29, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, recording the Parties' confirmation that the Tribunal had been duly constituted in accordance with NAFTA Article 1123, and their agreement that the 1976 version of the UNCITRAL Rules would apply to this arbitration; that the place of arbitration would be Toronto, Ontario; that the languages of the arbitration would be English and French; and that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"**PCA**\") would act as registry in relation to this arbitration. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out procedural rules and a date for Canada to file its Statement of Defence (\"**Statement of Defence**\").\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule set in Procedural Order No. 1, on September 1, 2016, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence and accompanying documents, followed by a request for bifurcation on September 29, 2016.\n\n16.\n\nOn October 14, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 dealing with document production. On the same date, the Tribunal issued a Confidentiality Order (\"**Confidentiality Order**\"), which the Parties signed on October 27, 2016. The Confidentiality Order established a procedure by which a Party could designate as Restricted Access Information and Confidential Information documents exchanged in document production, written submissions, transcripts, orders, and awards.\n\n17.\n\nOn November 3, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, setting out alternative schedules for submissions with respect to the Respondent's motion for bifurcation and subsequent pleadings, with Schedule A reflecting bifurcated proceedings and Schedule B reflecting non-bifurcated proceedings. The Tribunal set an oral hearing on bifurcation by teleconference for November 7, 2016.\n\n18.\n\nOn November 18, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, by which the Tribunal decided to bifurcate these proceedings for the purpose of hearing the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility under NAFTA Articles 1116(2), 1117(2), 1101(1), 1102(3) and 2103(6) as preliminary questions. Having decided to bifurcate the proceedings, the Tribunal also adopted Schedule A of Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n19.\n\nOn December 12, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 setting out a revised schedule for the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nFrom December 2016 to May 2017, the Parties exchanged written memorials on jurisdiction and admissibility. The Respondent submitted the Memorial on Jurisdiction on December 22, 2016, and the Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction on March 29, 2017. The Claimant submitted the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on February 22, 2017 and the Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction on May 3, 2017.\n\n21.\n\nThe United States of America (\"**United States**\") and the United Mexican States (\"**Mexico**\") submitted Non-Disputing Party Submissions on June 14, 2017, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128, as to which both Parties filed comments.\n\n22.\n\nOn June 29, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 rejecting an *amici curiae* application.\n\n23.\n\nPursuant to Paragraph 22.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, on July 21, 2017, the Tribunal provided a number of questions in writing for the Parties to address in their oral submissions during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.\n\n24.\n\nThe Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility was held at Arbitration Place in Toronto, Canada from August 15 to August 17, 2017. As agreed by the Parties, it was live-streamed on the PCA's website. No post-hearing briefs were deemed necessary.\n\n25.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal issued its Jurisdiction Decision on January 30, 2018.\n\n**B. M****erits** **P****hase**\n-------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 3 and the Jurisdiction Decision,16 the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer regarding a schedule for the merits phase.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 330.\n\n27.\n\nOn March 16, 2018, the Parties communicated to the Tribunal that they had agreed on a schedule for the merits and damages phase incorporating two rounds of simultaneous document production. The Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to this procedure with the understanding that the second document production should be narrow and tailored. They further agreed that each request should be the consequence of the pleadings and should identify with precision a statement, claim, or argument in the other Party's pleading that warrants further discovery or additional documents.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal agreed to the schedule proposed by the Parties in Procedural Order No. 7 of March 23, 2018. On the joint proposal of the Parties submitted on July 24, 2018, the Tribunal approved a revised procedural schedule in Procedural Order No. 8 of August 15, 2018.

The Redfern Schedules included 17 disputed requests of the Claimant and 30 disputed requests of the Respondent.\n\n31.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 9 of August 21, 2018, the Tribunal granted 8 requests made by the Claimant17 and 8 requests made by the Respondent18 for disclosure of certain documents and information, ordering the Parties to produce the indicated documents to the other Party by September 28, 2018. The Tribunal also rejected on various grounds 8 document requests of the Claimant19 and 7 on the part of the Respondent.20 These requests and objections were rejected for being insufficiently specific. The Tribunal clarified that, in the following round of document production, the Parties could amend and resubmit these requests to meet the specificity requirements.\n\nProcedural Order No. 9, Claimant's Redfern Schedule, Documents No. 7, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19, 21, 31.\n\nProcedural Order No. 9, Respondent's Redfern Schedule, Documents No. 2(b), 2(c), 6, 17, 30, 31, 32, 33.\n\nProcedural Order No. 9, Claimant's Redfern Schedule, Documents No. 4, 12, 13, 14, 17, 22, 25, 33.\n\nProcedural Order No. 9, Respondent's Redfern Schedule, Documents No. 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 16(b), 16(c).\n\n32.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 9, the Tribunal also noted that the Respondent had indicated possible objections to the production of certain documents the Claimant could ultimately request on the ground of cabinet privilege or institutional sensitivity, as protected under Article 9.2 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration. The Tribunal did not make any findings as to these possible objections, determining that it would assess such requests individually should they manifest.\n\n**D.

However, the Parties agreed and received authorization by the Tribunal to extend this deadline by one month. The Claimant submitted its Memorial (\"**Claimant's Memorial**\") on December 28, 2018.\n\n34.\n\nThereafter, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consult on a revised schedule for submission of subsequent pleadings and for document production. On February 14, 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement on a revised schedule for the remainder of the proceedings. On February 19, 2019, the Tribunal approved the revised schedule in Procedural Order No. 10.\n\n35.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule set in Procedural Order No. 10, on April 17, 2019, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Damages (\"**Respondent's Counter-Memorial**\").\n\n36.\n\nFollowing this submission, on April 30, 2019, the Parties exchanged additional requests for document production. In accordance with the Tribunal's order in Procedural Order No. 10, the Parties were permitted only to submit requests arising directly out of statements or claims presented in the submitted pleadings. In the months that followed, the Parties filed their objections and exchanged undisputed documents.\n\n37.\n\nOn June 18, 2019, the Parties submitted their Redfern Schedules for disputed document requests, in accordance with the schedule set in Procedural Order No. 10.\n\n38.\n\nOn July 9, 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, directing the Parties to produce certain requested documents or information by July 31, 2019. The Tribunal denied 5,21 partially granted 2,22 and granted 5 requests by the Claimant,23 but for some24 permitted the Respondent to redact information that it could show required protection. The Tribunal denied 1 request by the Respondent.25 The Tribunal reserved its decision on 2 document requests by the Claimant26 and 2 document requests by the Respondent until July 17, 2019.27 Additionally, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to amend 1 request28 and the Respondent to amend 1 request29 by July 17, 2019, as it considered these overbroad.\n\nProcedural Order No. 11, Claimant's Redfern Schedule, Documents No. 16, 17, 18, 21, 22.\n\nProcedural Order No. 11, Claimant's Redfern Schedule, Documents No. 24, 28.\n\nProcedural Order No. 11, Claimant's Redfern Schedule, Documents No. 5, 23, 25, 26, 27.\n\nProcedural Order No. 11, Claimant's Redfern Schedule, Documents No. 5, 26, 27.\n\nProcedural Order No. 11, Respondent's Redfern Schedule, Document No. 14.\n\nProcedural Order No. 11, Claimant's Redfern Schedule, Documents No. 1, 2.\n\nProcedural Order No. 11, Respondent's Redfern Schedule, Documents No. 15, 19.\n\nProcedural Order No. 11, Claimant's Redfern Schedule, Document No. 14.\n\nProcedural Order No. 11, Respondent's Redfern Schedule, Document No. 10.\n\n39.\n\nOn December 6, 2019, the Claimant filed its Reply Memorial on Merits and Damages (\"**Claimant's Reply Memorial**\"). On the same date, by letter to the Respondent, the Claimant raised objections to the Respondent's determination of numerous documents as Restricted Access Information pursuant to the mechanism provided in the Confidentiality Order. The Restricted Access designation permits only the Parties' counsel, and not the Parties themselves, to see such documents, which, the Claimant contended, impeded its ability to direct or advise its counsel with respect to arguments before the Tribunal.\n\n40.\n\nOn January 17, 2020, by letter to the Tribunal, the Claimant sought a re-designation of exhibits C-182, C-195, R-146, and R-161 (the \"**Four Exhibits**\") as Confidential, rather than Restricted Access. On January 23, 2020, the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimant's objections, to which the Claimant further commented on January 28, 2020.\n\n41.\n\nOn February 17, 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, deciding not to amend the Restricted Access designation of the Four Exhibits. The Tribunal noted that the Claimant's application for the change was belated and determined that the Claimant's ability to direct the arguments of its case was not unduly impeded by the Restricted Access designation.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Rejoinder Memorial on the Merits and Damages (\"**Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial**\") on March 4, 2020.\n\n**E.

On April 23, 2020, the Government of Mexico filed its Second Article 1128 Submission (\"**Mexico Submission**\").\n\n46.\n\nOn May 8, 2020, the Parties filed their replies to the Non-Disputing Parties' Article 1128 Submissions (\"**Claimant's Reply to Article 1128 Submissions**\" and \"**Respondent's Reply to Article 1128 Submissions**\").\n\n**F. H****earing on the** **M****erits and** **D****amages**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their intention to reschedule the Hearing on the Merits and Damages (then scheduled for the week of May 18, 2020) in light of prevailing global health and travel restrictions. On April 9, 2020, the Tribunal proposed that the hearing take place from July 26-30, 2020. Upon being advised that the Claimant was unavailable on the proposed dates, on April 21, 2020, the Tribunal proposed that the hearing take place from November 2-6, 2020, the next window during which all Tribunal members were available. By letter dated April 24, 2020, the Respondent shared its reservations with the November 2020 dates. On April 30, 2020, the Tribunal sought the Parties' availability for a hearing during revised dates in July 2020. On April 30, 2020, the Claimant stated that it was unavailable in the entire month of July. On May 3, 2020, the Tribunal decided to hold the hearing from November 2-6, 2020. On May 7, 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 containing a Further Revised Schedule for Merits and Damages Phase. A Further Revised Schedule on the Merits and Damages Phase was issued again on August 24, 2020, in Procedural Order No. 15. In this order, the hearing dates were fixed as November 9-13, 2020 and it was noted that the Parties agreed that the hearing be held by video-conference on account of global health circumstances and restrictions on travel and gatherings.\n\n48.\n\nOn October 16, 2020, further to Paragraph 22.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a list of questions to address in oral submission at the hearing.\n\n49.\n\nOn October 21, 2020, a pre-hearing video-conference took place, in which representatives of each Party, the Tribunal, and representatives of Arbitration Place and the PCA participated.\n\n50.\n\nAt the instruction of the Tribunal and having consulted with the Parties, the PCA issued a Press Release on November 4, 2020 with information for the public live-streaming of the forthcoming hearing.\n\n51.\n\nA hearing was held from November 9-14, 2020 (the \"**2020 Hearing**\").

Forest Utilization License Agreement\n-----------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nContrary to what the Claimant suggests, the Respondent explains that the FULA was not concluded at PWCC's request or for PWCC's benefit.216 According to the Respondent, the FULA is the result of GNS's initiative to modernize the province's forest licensing system from the pre-existing Stora Act regime.217 It provides GNS with greater authority to manage forests on Crown land and aligns with its Natural Resources Strategy.218\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 130, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at paras 95-96.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 121; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 191:17-192:3; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 452:9-453:9.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 121, 129.

Land Purchase Agreement\n---------------------------\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with the Claimant's characterization of the Land Purchase Agreement, which allegedly \"reduced PWCC's effective price for the mill to $13 million\".223 The Respondent argues that the purchase aligned with the province's \"long-standing goal of increasing its share of forest ownership in the Province\",224 and [REDACTED]0 [REDACTED]225\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 118, citing Claimant's Memorial, at paras 93, 115.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 119; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, 181:11-182:6.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 119, referring to [REDACTED] (**R-149**).\n\n138.\n\nWith respect to [REDACTED] GNS agreed to pay PWCC in comparison to its previous agreement with NPPH for the same land,226 the Respondent specifies that [REDACTED]227 [REDACTED]228\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 120, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at para 98.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 120, referring to [REDACTED] (**R-216**).\n\n[REDACTED] (**C-209**).\n\nv. Relief from pension liabilities\n----------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nReferencing the Claimant's reliance on newspaper articles to allege that PWCC \"refused to assume the unfunded pension liability of over $100 million\",229 the Respondent argues that the Claimant's failure to plead with specificity is enough for the Tribunal to disregard this alleged measure.230 Later, the Respondent clarified that GNS never took on the pension liability, but proposed legislation \"in order to help the workers and pensioners avoid an immediate windup hit of up to 30 percent or more of their pensions\".231\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 138, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at para 49; Expert Witness Report of Seth T.

The first was the concern that other ratepayers would bear the cost of obtaining additional renewable energy to meet the standards set by the RES Regulations due to the PHP Mill returning to the grid (the \"**RES Regulations Issue**\").279 To recall, the RES Regulations required that in 2011-2012, 5% of NSPI's total sales of energy be renewable energy supplied by independent power producers.280 This requirement increased to 10% in 2013 and 25% in 2015, but allowed NSPI to acquire additional renewable energy from its own generation facilities as well.281\n\n*In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc*., Excerpts from Transcript of NSUARB Hearing, July 16, 2012 at 159-161 (**C-177**).\n\n*Renewable Energy Standard Regulations*, N.S.

Reg. 155/2010, at ss. 4-6 (**R-179**).\n\n160.\n\nThe second of the NSUARB's concerns related to the operation of a Biomass Plant (the \"**Biomass Plant Issue**\") at the PHP Mill.282 While the Mill was still under NPPH's ownership, NSPI negotiated an agreement with NPPH to build a cogeneration power plant around the biomass- fired boiler at the Mill.283 According to the project, NSPI would own the Biomass Plant and the renewable energy it produced, and NPPH would use the steam it generated for the Mill's operations.284 This agreement allowed NSPI \"to meet its RES commitments in a planned and cost-effective manner which is in the interests of NSPI customers and our Province\".285 The project was approved on October 14, 2010.286\n\n*In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc*., Decision, NSUARB, August 20, 2012, at paras 181-183 (**C-184; R-062**).\n\n*In re An Application by Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Application (Redacted) for Approval of Capital Work Order CI 39029, Port Hawkesbury Biomass Project, NSUARB, April 9, 2011, at 1 (**R-182**).\n\n*In re An Application by Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Decision, NSUARB, October 14, 2010, at para 9 (**R-184**).\n\n*In re An Application by Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Application (Redacted) for Approval of Capital Work Order CI 39029, Port Hawkesbury Biomass Project, NSUARB, April 9, 2011, at 35:21-22 (**R-182**).\n\n*In re An Application by Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Decision, NSUARB, October 14, 2010, at paras 112, 164 (**R-184**).\n\n161.\n\nWhen ownership of the Mill transferred to PWCC, NSPI negotiated an agreement with PWCC whereby NSPI would continue to own the Biomass Plant and deliver steam to PHP.287 The latter would also pay for the fuel necessary to generate the steam it needed.288\n\nRe Pacific West Commercial Corporation, Shared Services Agreement, M04862 P-8, at Preamble, para 5.2.2 (**R-412**); *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Decision, NSUARB, August 20, 2012, at paras 34(1), 156 (**C-184; R-062**).\n\nRe Pacific West Commercial Corporation, Shared Services Agreement, M04862 P-8, at para 7.1 and Schedules 9 & 10 (**R-412**); *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Decision, NSUARB, August 20, 2012, at paras 34(1), 156 (**C-184; R-062**).\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Biomass Plant would need to run full-time for the sole purpose of producing steam for PHP.289 The NSUARB stated that it would not approve the LRR without controls on additional costs to ratepayers arising from the Biomass Plant operations.290\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 84.\n\n*In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc*., Decision, NSUARB, August 20, 2012, at paras 181-183 (**C-184; R-062**).\n\n163.\n\nOn July 20, 2012, GNS sent a letter to the NSUARB (the \"**July 2012 Letter**\") addressing the two issues:\n\nIncremental RES issue\n\nGovernment Policy\n\nThe Government created the Renewable Electricity Standards to achieve a number of objectives: the obligation to meet a number of targets and the requirement that the provision of electricity come from specific technologies, and come from both Independent Power Producers as well as NSPI. Accordingly the Government has enabled the procurement of new sources to enable all of these objectives to be met. The Government is confident that there is enough RES supply coming on-line that the mill-load will not trigger an incremental RES cost over the term of the proposed mechanism.\n\nGovernment Commitment\n\nThe Government commits to ensuring that if the mill load does trigger an additional RES obligation during the term of the proposed mechanism, and if this results in incremental costs, then the Province guarantees that neither PWCC nor other ratepayers will be required to pay these incremental costs.291\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBiomass Plant issue\n\nGovernment Policy\n\nGovernment policy has always been supportive of using biomass for combined heat and power. In 2011, the Government conducted a public consultation on changes to the Renewable Energy Standard Regulations. One of the proposed amendments to the regulations creates a requirement that a portion of the renewable electricity purchased to meet the standards be firm. Firm renewable generation enhances system reliability and facilitates the balancing of non-firm intermittent wind generation. This requirement would result in the obligation to run the biomass plant to achieve this objective, whether the mill is in operation or not. The policy intention has not changed.\n\nGovernment Commitment\n\nThe Government commits to ensuring that PWCC receives the full benefit of the proposed arrangement it reached with Nova Scotia Power Inc. This will be accomplished as planned, through finalization of amendments to the Renewable Energy Standard Regulations so that the Port Hawkesbury CHP [sic] plant is operated as a base load and is deemed must run or we will address the issue through an equivalent solution that meets the objectives of the proposed arrangement.292\n\n*In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Government of Nova Scotia Letter Regarding PWCC Load Retention Tariff Hearing, NSUARB, July 20, 2012 (**C-179**); *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Decision, NSUARB, August 20, 2012, at para 178 (**C-184; R-062**).\n\n*In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Government of Nova Scotia Letter Regarding PWCC Load Retention Tariff Hearing, NSUARB, July 20, 2012 (**C-179**); *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Decision, NSUARB, August 20, 2012, at paras 178-179 (**C-184; R-062**).\n\n164.\n\nThe Parties' positions regarding the purpose and influence of this letter on the NSUARB's approval of the LRR are developed in forthcoming sections.293\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 84-85; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 217.\n\n165.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, the NSUARB approved the LRR, subject to receiving an ATR from the CRA.294\n\n*In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Decision, NSUARB, August 20, 2012, at para 133 (**C-184; R-062**).\n\n166.\n\nAs mentioned above,295 the CRA subsequently refused the ATR, denying the proposed dividend tax structure.296 Accordingly, on September 22, 2012, PWCC and NSPI filed an application to amend the NSUARB's order by removing NSPI's ownership interest and right to dividends.297\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraph 145 of this Award.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 100; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 168.\n\n*In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.,* Application for Amendments to the Order Approving the Load Retention Rate Mechanism, September 22, 2012 (**C-197**).\n\n167.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, the NSUARB approved the amended LRR mechanism, pursuant to which the PHP Mill would pay the variable incremental costs of service and contribute to NSPI's fixed costs.298 PHP would also pay its electricity invoices in advance, and NSPI acquired the right to interrupt PHP's entire load on a ten-minute notice.299 Lastly, PWCC assumed all of NSPI's risk of fuel cost fluctuations in relation to its provision of electricity to the Mill.300\n\n*In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Amended Decision, NSUARB, September 27, 2012 (**C-208; R-063**); *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Order, NSUARB, September 28, 2012, Appendix A, at 1-2 (**R-170**).\n\n*In re an Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Order, NSUARB, September 28, 2012, Appendix A, at 4 (**R-170**); United States \u2013 WTO Panel Report \u2013 *Supercalendered Paper*, July 5, 2018, at para 7.16 (**R-238**).\n\n*In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Order, NSUARB, September 28, 2012, Appendix A, at 2 (**R-170**); *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Pre-filed Evidence of Pacific West Commercial Corporation, April 27, 2012, at 2, 6 (**C-165**); *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Inc.*, NSPI Responses \u2013 Avon, May 30, 2012, at Request IR-2 1-2, Request IR-5 1-2 (**R-239**); *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Inc.*, NSPI Responses to Synapse Information Requests, May 30, 2012, at Request IR-6 1-2 (**R-240**).\n\n168.\n\nIn January 2013, GNS amended the RES Regulations to add provisions with respect to the generation of electricity using biomass.

The Claimant's position\n--------------------------\n\n170.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the LRR obtained by PWCC for the PHP Mill is a component of the ensemble of Assistance Measures GNS provided.302 It considers the LRR a \"package\" of measures itself, including the fix cost of service, a tax-efficient structure for payments to NSPI, incremental costs of service, favorable amendments to the province's RES Regulations, the Biomass Plant onsite at the Mill, and a long-term rate structure.303\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 71, 219.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 74.\n\na. The July 2012 Letter\n-----------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Claimant characterizes the July 2012 Letter as an \"intervention\" by GNS into the NSUARB proceedings,304 which ultimately led the NSUARB to approve the LRR.305 It claims that GNS \"changed the law for PWCC's benefit\"306 and [REDACTED]hat neither PWCC nor other ratepayers would need to absorb additional costs.307\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 82.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 82, referring to *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Decision, NSUARB, August 20, 2012, at paras 180-183 (**C-184; R-062**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 82.

The value of the LRR\n-----------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe Claimant believes that PWCC's LRR was \"worth millions\" in comparison to the standard tariff applicable to all large customers and the prior LRR granted to the Mill under NPPH's ownership.308 It states that in 2013, PHP's total expenditure pursuant to its LRR was [REDACTED]309 It argues that this figure represents approximately [REDACTED] in savings in comparison to the price of energy NPPH would have paid pursuant to its rate in the same year.310 According to the same calculations, the Claimant finds that PHP saved a further approximate [REDACTED] in 2014311 and [REDACTED] in 2015.312 The Claimant argues that it is irrelevant whether Resolute pays for less expensive hydropower in Qu\u00e9bec than PHP pays as a result of the GNS discount, noting that the electricity rate was only one part of a larger costs savings that PHP benefited from in Nova Scotia.313\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 117.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 118, referring to [REDACTED] at CAN000005\\_0003 (**C-222**).

The July 2012 Letter\n-----------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant exaggerates the significance of the July 2012 Letter319 and disputes the Claimant's characterization of it as a \"waiver\" by GNS of the RES obligations to enable the NSUARB's approval of the LRR.320\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 201.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 217.\n\n176.\n\nConcerning the amendments to the RES Regulations, the Respondent shows that the amendments were prepared and released for public consultation in June 2011,321 \"months before PWCC was even in the picture\".322 It claims that approval of the RES Regulations was delayed due to the risk of shutdown of both the Port Hawkesbury and Bowater Mersey mills, because the shutdowns would impact renewable energy policy more broadly.323 As mentioned above, the amendments were passed in January 2013, after it was clear to GNS in the summer of 2012 that NSPI had decided to finish construction of its Port Hawkesbury Biomass Plant and \"take a stake in the Port Hawkesbury mill under new ownership\".324 In the Respondent's view, the July 2012 Letter merely confirmed that \"because there was enough [renewable energy] supply coming on-line and the return of the mill-load would not otherwise increase the total system load from what had been planned for in prior years, the Port Hawkesbury mill returning to the grid would not trigger an incremental [renewable energy] cost over the term of the proposed LRR pricing mechanism\".325\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 211, referring to Proposed Amendments to *Renewable Energy Regulations*, June 27, 2011 (**R-185**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 211.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 211, citing Witness Statement of Murray Coolican, April 17, 2019, at para 38.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 211, citing Witness Statement of Murray Coolican, April 17, 2019, at para 38.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 217, citing Witness Statement of Murray Coolican, April 17, 2019, at para 26;

The value of the LRR\n-----------------------\n\n179.\n\nIn the Respondent's opinion, the LRR that PWCC obtained for operations at the PHP Mill was significantly higher than what it had originally sought from NSPI ($30/MWh).333 PWCC agreed for PHP to assume all of NSPI's fuel risk, which resulted in PHP's electricity price [REDACTED]334 This is attributable to the fact that \"PHP's hourly electricity costs are calculated based on PHP consuming the electricity generated from the conventional fuel with the highest cost used by NSPI in any given hour\".335 The Respondent contends that these higher electricity costs have prevented the Mill from operating at full capacity.336\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 170, Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 28, referring to [REDACTED] at 1 (**C-125**).\n\n[REDACTED] at 3 (**C-222**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 170.

ATTRIBUTION**\n------------------\n\n**A. I****ntroduction**\n-----------------------\n\n214.\n\nAs a matter of attribution, the main point of contention between the Parties concerns the LRR. The Claimant submits that the Tribunal should consider the LRR as part of the Assistance Measures that PWCC obtained from GNS because the LRR was necessary for PWCC's purchase of the Mill.403 The Claimant argues that GNS played an integral role in negotiating and obtaining the NSUARB's approval of the \"electricity deal\" from which PWCC allegedly benefited.404 On this basis, the Claimant contends that the negotiation of PWCC's LRR is attributable to Canada under NAFTA Article 1101(1), and Articles 4, 8, and 11 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (the \"**ILC Articles**\"), which brings it within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 161-163.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 168.\n\n215.\n\nILC Article 4 provides that \"[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercised legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State\".405 Under Article 4, a State organ is defined as \"any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State\".406\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 41, citing International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), at Article 4(1) (**CL-145**).\n\nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001), at Article 4(2) (**CL-145**).\n\n216.\n\nILC Article 8 states that \"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct\".407\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 176, citing International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), at Article 8 (**CL-145**).\n\n217.\n\nLastly, pursuant to ILC Article 11, \"[c]onduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own\".408\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 69, citing International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2001), at Article 11 (**CL-145**).\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the attribution of the LRR to GNS. According to the Respondent, the LRR was an agreement between two private companies, PWCC and NSPI, \"over which the GNS had no control or ability to instruct to do anything\".409 The Respondent proposes a different interpretation of ILC Articles 4, 8, and 11, which when applied to the facts, in the Respondent's view, fails to justify a finding of attribution of the LRR to GNS. As such, the Respondent argues that the LRR is not a measure that can form the basis of a claim under NAFTA Chapter 11.410\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 157.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 221.\n\n**B.

Whether GNS's Assistance Measures Should be Considered as a Whole**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimant notes that Canada does not contest that the remainder of the Assistance Measures, but for the LRR, are attributable to Canada.411 The Claimant argues that the Tribunal should consider GNS's Assistance Measures as a whole as being attributable to Canada, without singling out the LRR.412\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 29.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 157-159; Claimant's Reply Memorial, para 30; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 28:8-11, 29:3-9.\n\n220.\n\nThe Claimant's argument for considering the Assistance Measures as a single package is premised on the assertion that PWCC conditioned its purchase and operation of the Mill on receiving assistance that would make it the \"lowest cost producer\" in the market.413 According to the Claimant, GNS agreed to PWCC's purchase and operation conditions by providing a \"package of measures\" that \"jointly and severally, were intended to [\u2026] place the [Mill] in a competitively advantageous position in relation to other producers in the SC paper market\".414 In other words, but for the ensemble of measures as a whole, PWCC would not have purchased and reopened the Mill, which, in turn, would not have caused damage to the Claimant.415\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 154; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 31.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 153; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 32.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 159, 161.

Whether the Load Retention Rate is Attributable to Canada Pursuant to ILC Article 4**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimant argues that even if the LRR must be disaggregated from the remainder of the Assistance Measures, it should be regarded as \"adopted or maintained\" by the GNS under NAFTA Article 1101(1) through the actions of the NSUARB and the [REDACTED] and is attributable to Canada pursuant to ILC Article 4.426\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 27; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, 31:22- 31-12-1899 08:03:00\n\n225.\n\nIn accordance with the text of Article 4 set out above,427 the Claimant submits that attribution under Article 4 extends to government officials acting in their official capacity.428 The Claimant invokes the tribunal's words in *von Pezold v. Zimbabwe*, stating that \"organs of State include, for the purposes of attribution, the President, Ministers, provincial governments, legislature [\u2026]\" and that \"[r]esponsibility for the actions of these State organs is unlimited provided the act is performed in an official capacity\".429\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraph 215 of this Award.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 41.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 42, citing *Bernhard von Pezold and Others v.

Canada*, in which the NAFTA tribunal found that an independent regulatory body, such as the Joint Review Panel (\"**JRP**\") operating under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, \"that exercises impartial judgment [\u2026] can well be an organ of the state; [A]rticle 4 of the ILC Articles [\u2026] specifically includes those exercising 'judicial' functions\".430 With respect to the role of the Canadian federal government in *Bilcon*, the tribunal found that the disputed measures could be attributed to Canada because \"the JRP was *de jure* an organ of Canada, equipped with a clear statutory role that included making formal and public recommendations to state authorities which the latter were obliged by law to consider \u2013 and indeed ended up accepting\".431\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, para 50, citing *William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware Inc. v.

Whether Canada's Actions Attract State Responsibility under ILC Article 8**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nWith respect to ILC Article 8, the Claimant's position is that GNS \"instructed\" the approval of the LRR, which, pursuant to Article 8, triggers State responsibility.470\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 186; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 27:17-23.\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimant specifies that it need only demonstrate instructions, as the terms \"instructions\", \"directions\", and \"control\" are disjunctive;471 acting on \"instructions\" depends on factual circumstances and does not depend on control.472\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 176, citing James Crawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text, and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002) at 113, Commentary (7) of Article 8 (**CL-109**).

Pakistan* to argue that the demonstrable standard for instruction is \"clearance\" and \"guidance\" by the State in question.474 In *Bayindir*, the tribunal found that the illegal termination of a contract between the investor and the National Highway Authority (\"**NHA**\") were deemed attributable to the State because the State \"provided clearance and guidance\" to the NHA,475 over which it had control as an entity.476 The Government of Pakistan did not attract liability under ILC Article 5 because the NHA was not exercising its governmental authority when it wrongfully terminated the contract.477 However, the tribunal found that termination of the contract in that case could be attributed to Pakistan under ILC Article 8 because the government provided guidance and clearance to do so.478 The Claimant contests the Respondent's argument that distinguishes *Bayindir v. Pakistan* from the present 479 case.479\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 177-178.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 177.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 177.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 177, referring to *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v.

Zimbabwe*, *Electrabel v. Hungary*, and *Tulip Real Estate v. Turkey* \u2013 on the basis that the facts in those cases did not involve State instruction or direction sufficient to attribute the measure in question to State conduct.480\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 78.\n\n240.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the WTO Panel's ruling regarding whether GNS \"entrusted and directed\" the LRR cannot be applied to the present case because the WTO Panel was applying standards different from those applicable in this investor-State arbitration and the WTO Panel Report is not binding upon Resolute (a non-State, private party).481\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 79-80.\n\n241.\n\nApplying the aforementioned principles to the case, for the below reasons, the Claimant submits that GNS instructed NSPI, within the meaning of Article 8, to ensure an appropriate LRR.482\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 77.\n\n242.\n\nThe Claimant notes that GNS recognized the importance of the LRR once the Mill closed and requested that NSPI initiate discussions with PWCC soon after it was selected as the successful bidder.483\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 77; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1336:8-12.\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimant argues that GNS took an active role in negotiating the LRR by providing and reviewing work product associated with the negotiations.484 The Claimant further argues that the GNS retained Mr. Todd Williams \"to advocate for the approval of the electricity deal before the NSUARB\", under the instructions of the GNS Department of Energy.485 In the Claimant's words, \"Mr. Williams was an emissary of GNS and an indispensable architect of the energy agreement that made possible the resurrection of the PHP mill\".486\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 77; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 403:17-21.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 180; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 77; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1105:24-1106:1, 1336:12-15.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 181; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 53:1-54:23.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimant enumerates the particular instances in which GNS and Mr. Williams worked with PWCC and NSPI, namely:\n\n(1) delivering comments regarding 'the variable Capex (capital expenditure) figures'; (2) working with NSPI to develop a protocol for delivering energy to the mill; (3) reviewing feedback from the NSPI Board of Directors on the LRT; (4) reviewing computer simulations used to calculate the power rate; (5) participating in the scheduling and process for obtaining regulatory approval for the power rate with the NSUARB and (6) determining GNS's role in the NSUARB proceeding, including whether to sponsor Mr. Williams as a witness.487\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 181, referring to PWCC Meeting Notes, Redacted PWCC LRT Application NSPI (Avon) IR-1 Attachment 2, 2011-2012, at 78-80 (**C-147**); *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Government of Nova Scotia Letter Regarding Amended PWCC Load Retention Rate, NSUARB, September 27, 2012 (**C-205**).

Whether Canada's Actions Attract State Responsibility under ILC Article 11**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nLastly, the Claimant argues that if the Tribunal finds the LRR to be the result of private negotiations, GNS's actions are still impugned pursuant to ILC Article 11, noting that Article 11 is attracted by a State's mere acknowledgement of the factual existence of conduct or by its expression of approval of the conduct in question.497\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 70; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 36:10-17; November 14, 2020, at 1333:9-1334:13; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 27:17-13.\n\n252.\n\nThe Claimant relies on three authorities to this effect, beginning with the *Tehran Hostages* case, in which the ICJ concluded that governmental approval of a situation resulting from private acts could be established by the State's \"decision to perpetuate\" the situation.498 Additionally, it cites *Ampal-American Israel Corp. v. Egypt*499 and *Bilcon v. Canada*500 for the proposition that ministerial approval of a private entity's decision or findings could be attributable to the State under Article 11.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 70, citing *Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v.

Whether GNS's Assistance Measures Should be Considered as a Whole**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's suggestion that the LRR is inseparable from GNS's financial assistance to PWCC.503\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 23, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at para 159; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 30.\n\n255.\n\nThe Respondent argues that a tribunal constituted under NAFTA Chapter 11 must base its jurisdiction on impugned measures \"adopted or maintained by a Party relating to\" an investor and its investment.504 This requirement, the Respondent explains, cannot be avoided by taking the \"ensemble\" approach suggested by the Claimant.505\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 24.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 24-25.\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that the inquiry prescribed by ILC Article 2506 first requires a determination of whether an act or omission is attributable to the State, then whether the act or omission in question constitutes a breach of international law.507 The Respondent submits that \"the inquiries are distinct and cannot be conflated even if there are other measures over which the State does not contest attribution\".508 The Respondent concludes that the Claimant cannot circumvent the requirements of Article 2 by alleging that the PWCC's LRR is \"vicariously attributable\" to GNS on account of the other Assistance Measures.509\n\nILC Article 2 provides: \"There is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law; and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State\".

Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1357:13-1358:9.\n\n268.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the steps taken by GNS regarding the Biomass Plant were merely a continuation of GNS's long standing policies favoring the use of clean energy.543 The Respondent explains that NSPI saw biomass as an important hedge against overreliance on wind power, which was less reliable and had costly operational challenges.544 The NSPI, according to the Respondent, viewed biomass as crucial in meeting the province's renewable energy targets under the RES Regulations.545 Accordingly, the Respondent explains, NSPI diversified its renewable energy portfolio by negotiating an agreement with NPPH in 2010 to build the Biomass Plant at the Mill, with NSPI owning the plant and the renewable energy it produces and NPPH using the steam from the Biomass Plant.546 At the time that NPPH filed for creditor protection in September 2011, NSPI had already decided to take over the construction and operation of the Biomass Plant.547 After the Mill was sold to PWCC, NSPI wanted to continue operating the Biomass Plant and therefore PWCC and NSPI entered an agreement (later approved by the NSUARB) that NSPI would continue to own the Biomass Plant and deliver steam to PWCC, while PWCC would pay for the fuel necessary to generate the steam required for its paper operations.548\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 202;

Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 17.\n\n272.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the claim that the July 2012 Letter waived the RES obligations upon the LRR.561 According to the Respondent, GNS merely confirmed that the re-opening of the Mill would not result in incremental costs to meet RES requirements.562 The Respondent explains that this confirmation was reasonable given that the province had already planned its compliance with the RES Regulations up until 2015 by the time the Mill went into \"hot idle\" in September 2011.563 Moreover, there was a decrease in the overall system load because Resolute's Bowater Mersey mill had shut down in June 2012. PWCC also planned to close the Mill's newsprint line, which would reduce the overall load by approximately 450,000 MWh per year.564 Finally, GNS was planning to import renewable energy from the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador to help it meet its 2020 RES targets.565 The Respondent contends that GNS's conduct in \"clarifying its intent regarding RES-related eventualities is distinct from the negotiated commercial terms of how much NSPI would be paid for its electricity\".566\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 217.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 216; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 17.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 218, referring to Witness Statement of Murray Coolican, April 17, 2019, at paras 25-26; See also, *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Non-Confidential Government of Nova Scotia Amended Response to Consumer Advocate IR-41(a), NSUARB, July 18, 2012, at 8 (**R-177**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 218, referring to Witness Statement of Murray Coolican, April 17, 2019, paras 25-26; *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc*, Non-Confidential Government of Nova Scotia Amended Response to Consumer Advocate IR-41(a), NSUARB, July 18, 2012, at 8 (**R-177**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 218, referring to Witness Statement of Murray Coolican, April 17, 2019, at paras 25-26; See also, *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Non-Confidential Government of Nova Scotia Amended Response to Consumer Advocate IR-41(a), NSUARB, July 18, 2012, at 8 (**R-177**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 48.\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent underscores that the PHP Mill's load \"has never triggered an additional RES obligation and has never resulted in additional incremental costs\",567 thereby arguing that GNS's expectation was realized.568 According to the Respondent, the fact that the Claimant does not allege any benefit to PHP from not having to pay RES-related costs renders the RES Regulations Issue moot.569\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 220, citing Witness Statement of Murray Coolican, April 17, 2019, at para 31; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 450:34:451:5.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 220.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 48.\n\n**3. Whether Canada's Actions Attract State Responsibility under ILC Article 8**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that a measure is only \"adopted and maintained\" for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1101(1), if it is attributable to the State under international law, as described in the ILC Articles.570 The Respondent argues that the threshold for attributing conduct to a State under ILC Article 8 is one of \"effective control\" rather than one of \"clearance and guidance\" as suggested by the Claimant.571\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 172.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 178, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at paras 177-178.\n\n275.\n\nThe Respondent argues that State responsibility pursuant to Article 8 only arises \"where a state instructs a private person or entity to do something *on its behalf*\".572 The Respondent acknowledges that Article 8 refers to \"instructions\", \"direction\", and \"control\" disjunctively, but maintains that \"instructions, direction or control must relate to the conduct which is said to have amounted to an internationally wrongful act\".573 Therefore, the Respondent submits that an abstract argument that a State gave an instruction is necessarily incomplete.574\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 174, citing James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (Cambridge University Press, 2013) at 144 (**CL-111**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 175, citing International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries* (2001), at 48 (**RL-032**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 175.\n\n276.\n\nFurther, relying on the ICJ's decision in the *Bosnian Genocide* case, the Respondent argues that the instructions given by a State must have been \"in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations\".575 According to the Respondent, the threshold for State attribution is high because of the dual requirement of \"general control of the State over the person or entity and specific control of the State over the act the attribution of which is in question\".576\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 176, citing *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

The Respondent argues that GNS did not instruct PWCC and NSPI in any way, nor was the independent consultant advocating on GNS's behalf.583 Accordingly, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to establish that Canada meets the Article 8 standard with respect to the LRR.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 183; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 197:25-198:3.\n\n280.\n\nThe Respondent draws a distinction between the present case and other international cases in which State-owned entities allegedly terminated contracts through the State's voting shares or board of director appointees.584 The Respondent argues that GNS did not own shares in either PWCC or NSPI, nor did it appoint any members of their boards.585 The Respondent contends that the LRR was the result of negotiations between two private parties, PWCC and NSPI, over which GNS had no control.586\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 184, referring to Claimant's Memorial at paras 176-178 and footnotes 263-270, referring to *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v.

Whether Canada's Actions Attract State Responsibility under ILC Article 11**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's reliance on ILC Article 11 to attribute the LRR to GNS does not support its position613 because none of GNS's conduct with respect to the LRR constitutes \"an express or implied acknowledgment and adoption of the impugned conduct as its own\".614\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 55.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 58.\n\n287.\n\nFirst, the Respondent advances that the NSUARB did not seek to make the conduct of PWCC or NSPI its own and that its role was limited to determining whether the proposed LRR satisfied the statutory requirement that all other ratepayers be better off than they would be without PHP's LRR.615 Therefore, it claims that Resolute is incorrect to suggest that \"a State organ that adjudicates a regulatory process to review a proposed private transaction [\u2026] acknowledges and adopts the conduct of the private parties appearing before it\".616\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 59.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 59.\n\n288.\n\nSecond, the Respondent denies that GNS adopted the LRR as its own through the loan agreement.617 Rather, GNS assessed the LRR and \"believed it to be sufficiently sound to justify making a loan\".618 Consequently, the Respondent asserts that \"Resolute's suggestion that a State organ lending money to a private party automatically means that under international law the State has 'adopted as its own' that private party's contractual rights and obligations vis-\u00e0-vis third parties is untenable\".619\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 60.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 60, referring to Rejoinder Witness Statement of Jeannie Chow, March 4, 2020, at paras 2-4.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 60.\n\n289.\n\nThird, the Respondent refers back to GNS's \"long-standing and pre-existing governmental policies\" with regard to transitioning to renewable energy as the explanation for its regulatory behavior with respect to the RES Regulations and Biomass Plant Issues.620 As such, the regulatory actions lack the \"requisite nexus\" to the LRR for them to constitute \"acknowledgment and adoption\" of the LRR by GNS pursuant to ILC Article 11.621 Once again, contrary to *Bilcon*, the Respondent emphasizes that GNS did not acknowledge or adopt the LRR (as the alleged wrongful conduct) as its own, which is what a claim of attribution under ILC Article 11 requires.622\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 61.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 61-62.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 62-63.\n\n**D.

Whether GNS's Assistance Measures Should be Considered as a Whole**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nAs the Claimant notes, the Respondent does not contest that the Assistance Measures, but for the LRR, can be attributed to Canada.623 However, this does not suffice to render the LRR attributable to Canada, too. It may well be correct that, absent the ensemble of measures as a whole, PWCC would not have purchased and reopened the Mill, which, in turn, arguably would not have caused damage to the Claimant.624 This consideration may be relevant for the determination of a breach of Canada's international obligations under NAFTA but it cannot affect the determination whether the conduct\u2014allegedly in breach of Canada's international obligations\u2014is attributable to Canada. While attribution and breach are both required for the establishment of an internationally wrongful act, they constitute separate enquiries: \"[a]s a normative operation, attribution must be clearly distinguished from the characterization of conduct as internationally wrongful\".625 The rules of attribution, in turn, are founded on \"the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: [that] a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf\".626\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 29.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 159, 161.

Serbia and Montenegro)*, Judgment, February 26, 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, 43, at 210, at para 406 (**RL-115**).\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal will now assess whether there are any grounds why factually distinguishable conduct must be treated \"as an ensemble\" for the purposes of attribution, as the Claimant contends.\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal notes from the outset that a significant part of the authority relied on by the Claimant has treated distinct instances of conduct as elements of a whole for the purposes of establishing a breach but not for the purposes of attribution. For example, the tribunal in *GAMI* explained that \"[i]t is the record [of measures] as a whole\u2014not dramatic incidents in isolation\u2014which determines whether *a breach* of international law has occurred\".627 The tribunal in *S.D. Myers* \"examin[ed] the record of the evidence as a whole\" for the purpose of \"characteriz[ing] CANADA's motivation or intent fairly\",628 namely for establishing whether conduct *already attributed to Canada* amounted to a breach of its obligations\u2014not for the purpose of attribution. Furthermore, the tribunal in *Merrill & Ring* held that \"the business of the investor has to be considered as a whole and not necessarily with respect to an individual or separate aspect\"629 with a view to examining whether State conduct amounted to indirect expropriation; this, too, is a rather distinct issue which does not concern allegedly wrongful conduct being considered \"as a whole\" for the purposes of attribution.630 Consequently, such instances are not helpful in determining whether allegedly wrongful conduct should be considered \"as a whole\" for the purpose of its attribution to a State\u2014in this case, Canada.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 157, citing *GAMI Investments, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, November 15, 2004, at para 103 [emphasis added].\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, November 12, 2000, at para 161 (**CL-102)**.\n\n*Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/07/1, Award, March 31, 2010, at para 144 (**CL-101)** [emphasis added].\n\nThe same is true for W. Michael Reisman and Robert D. Sloane, \"Indirect Expropriation and its Valuation in the BIT Generation\", (2003) 75 British Yearbook of International Law 115 (**CL-103**), which is also relied on by the Claimant.\n\n293.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimant's arguments as to why the measures should be attributed to the Respondent \"as a whole\". In this regard, whether measures are to be considered as a whole, in the Tribunal's view, does not depend on whether the Claimant regarded them as such. Equally, whether the amount of benefits offered was unprecedented or not,631 does not affect a decision as to whether attribution should be examined in individual instances or in aggregate. Securing an LRR that was allegedly more beneficial than the level necessary to operate competitively may well have been crucial to the ensemble of measures (this will be further assessed in the examination of the claims on the merits below),632 but again, it is not determinative for attribution.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 156.\n\nSee *infra*, from Paragraph 307 of this Award.\n\n294.\n\nSimilar to the Tribunal's finding in Paragraph 290 of this Award, it may well be that PWCC only accepted the revised electricity measures (after the CRA denial) because amendments favorable to it were made to other parts of GNS's finance plan,633 but this merely demonstrates that the Assistance Measures were interconnected, not that they are to be regarded as such as a matter of law.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 37.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that there need not be a direct link between the total value of the GNS's Assistance Measures, nor of the value of any single Measure, and the harm allegedly sustained by Resolute.634 But even if the cause of the alleged damages to the Claimant was the Mill's re-entry onto the market on such advantageous terms, facilitated by GNS's assistance,635 this is not decisive for the question as to whether GNS's Assistance Measures should be considered in their entirety for the purpose of attribution.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 161.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 161.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that a tribunal constituted under NAFTA Chapter 11 must base its jurisdiction on impugned measures \"adopted or maintained by a Party relating to\" an investor and its investment.636 This does not necessarily mean that taking an \"ensemble\" approach contravenes this requirement. Attribution is to be assessed separately from breach: finding attribution does not imply finding a breach. The Claimant would seem to be conflating the two by seeking to transpose a question relevant for breach (whether measures, taken together, violated the Respondent's obligations or imposed harm on the investor) to the enquiry about attribution (whether the measures in questions were taken on the State's behalf or not).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 24.\n\n297.\n\nOverall, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant's arguments to the effect of treating the impugned measures as an ensemble may well inform the question whether these measures, considered as a whole, amounted to a breach of the Respondent's obligations under NAFTA. This, however, does not dispense of the question whether these measures amount to State conduct in the first place. The Tribunal must therefore rely on the principles of attribution, as reflected in the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, to determine whether the measures in question, and in particular the electricity benefits, constitute conduct on behalf of the State.\n\n**2. Whether Canada's Actions Attract State Responsibility under ILC Article 4**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nIt is undisputed that the conduct of GNS proper (including the Premier and Cabinet, Ministries and Ministers) is attributable to Canada under ILC Article 4. It is also undisputed that the NSUARB is a State organ and that its conduct is attributable to Canada.637 In this manner, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that \"provincial subdivisions\" and \"judicial independence\" are irrelevant to state attribution under ILC Article 4.638\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 39.\n\nSee Claimant's Closing Argument on State Attribution of the Electricity Benefits, November 14, 2020, at 2-5.\n\n299.\n\nOne question that arises in this case is whether actions of State organs must be coherent (or in line with each other) to be attributable to the State. The Tribunal finds that they do not. Finding State responsibility is a black-or-white decision, but attributable conduct is not: State organs, whose conduct is equally attributable, may well act in contradiction (or at cross purposes) with each other. For example, in the present case, when the partnership and tax formula negotiated between PWCC and NSPI was denied by one State organ, the CRA, GNS stepped in to adjust its financial support package as a result.639 Another example is presented by the refusal of the NSUARB to approve the LRR negotiated between PWCC and NSPI without GNS providing certain assurances related to the potential RES and biomass costs.640\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 100-1; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 256.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 83-85, 125-26.\n\n300.\n\nIn sum, what is needed for the purpose of attribution is that conduct can be identified that is attributable to the State; in this regard, consistency between the conduct in question and other conduct attributable to the State is irrelevant. Similarly, prior consultation with other State organs, or a concerted plan or policy among State organs, may well be relevant for the determination of a breach of an international obligation, depending on the content of such obligation, but is irrelevant for the purposes of attribution under ILC Article 4.\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore turns to the question whether the acts complained of in relation to the electricity benefits are attributable to the Respondent (as the other measures are not contested). At the 2020 Hearing, the Claimant made clear its argument that GNS brought the electricity benefits into existence by actions of many state actors: the Premier and Cabinet, the Department of Natural Resources & the Department of Energy, [REDACTED] and the NSUARB.641 At one level, the conduct of these State actors does not have to be disaggregated, as the State is responsible for them all as a matter of attribution.\n\nSee Claimant's Closing Argument on State Attribution of the Electricity Benefits, November 14, 2020, at 9, 13-14; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1326:24-1337:7.\n\n302.\n\nYet, a specific question arises regarding the role of the NSUARB and its approval of the LRR negotiated between PWCC and NSPI. Ultimately, the NSUARB approval of electricity rates or subsequent adjustments, were acts of State. In other words, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant642 that decisions concerning electricity rates are attributable to the Respondent. The State conduct in question consisted of the approval of the rate as part of the package of actions that allowed PHP to operate.\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraph 224 of this Award, referring to Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 27.\n\n303.\n\nThis conclusion, however, does not mean that the rate itself, or the price paid for electricity by PHP, is attributable to the Respondent. Indeed, the electricity contract itself and the price it includes were negotiated for months between two private parties.643 The NSUARB's task was essentially to determine whether other ratepayers would be better off with the proposed LRR than if PHP left the electricity system.644 If the electricity contract or price itself were attributable to the State, it would mean many run-of-the-mill private conduct (e.g. the purchase of real property) would be rendered State acts simply because it is rubberstamped by the State (e.g. the registration in the land register). The same principle would apply to government approvals done for instance under competition laws, utility laws, or bankruptcy laws (which are closer in nature to the NSUARB's determination).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 157; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, para 41; United States \u2013 WTO Panel Report \u2013 *Supercalendered Paper*, July 5, 2018, at para 7.77 (**R-238**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 43.\n\n304.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that since the Claimant has not alleged any wrongdoing related to the conduct of the NSUARB in the approval of the LRR, that it means its case must fail on this ground. In other words, the Respondent argues that all the NSUARB was doing is fulfilling its statutory duty.645 In response, the Claimant has argued notably at the 2020 Hearing that \"lawfulness under national law is irrelevant\" basing itself on ILC Article 3.646 The Tribunal notes, however, that this article relates to wrongfulness of State action and not attribution. As such, whether anything in the conduct of the NSUARB constituted a breach of NAFTA Article 1102 or 1105 vis-a-vis the Claimant is a question for the merits.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 40; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 201:19-203:4.\n\nClaimant's Closing Argument on State Attribution of the Electricity Benefits, November 14, 2020, at 6-7; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 35:16-36:9; November 14, 2020, at 1348:16-1349:25.\n\n305.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal also mentions that [REDACTED]647 [REDACTED]648 Arguments relating to the amendments of the RES Regulations and the Biomass Plant Issue suffer the same fate. While the actions of GNS related to these matters are attributable to the Respondent, they did not have a direct effect on the rate or the price of electricity paid by PHP as such. Indeed, the RES regulations were changed in 2016 without the need to change the LRR.649 As for the risk of future incremental RES costs, it never materialized (as the GNS predicted). Again, this question was independent of the negotiation of the LRR itself.650\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 49; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1325:21-1326:2, 1329:23-1330:10.\n\nRespondent's Closing Argument, November 14, 2020, at 88; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 473:5-15, 473:24-474:7.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 49.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 220; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 209:8-210:11.\n\n306.\n\nHaving determined that all acts in question by GNS organs can individually be attributed to Canada under ILC Article 4, the Tribunal does not need to further analyse the Claimant's argument with regard to Article 8 or Article 11. Ultimately, the Tribunal is of the opinion that all measures were offered or signed off by a State organ, so they can be attributed to the State, bearing in mind that this attribution as such does not imply any wrongfulness. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal's conclusion regarding the non-attribution to Respondent of the LRR itself (at Paragraph 303) would not have been different whether considered under ILC Article 8 or 11.\n\n**VI. LIABILITY**\n-----------------\n\n**A. NAFTA A****rticle** **1108(7)**\n------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n307.\n\nNAFTA Article 1108(7) provides that Article 1102 does not apply to:\n\n(a) procurement by a Party or a state enterprise; or\n\n(b) subsidies or grants provided by a Party or a state enterprise, including government supported loans, guarantees and insurance.651\n\nNAFTA Article 1108(7).\n\n308.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether the Respondent can avail of the above provision pertaining to procurement, subsidies and grants.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal should assess the application of Article 1108(7) before entering the Article 1102 analysis.652 The Respondent submits that Article 1108(7) operates as a \"carve-out\" rule that excludes all procurement activity and subsidies from the scope of some obligations in Chapter 11.653 For its position, the Respondent relies on *Mesa, Mercer*, and *UPS* in which cases the Article 1102 analysis was not conducted after it was found that the measures in question were procurements under Article 1108(7).654\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 227:3-6; November 14, 2020, at 1242:17-19; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 38.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 227:4-9.\n\nRespondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at paras 38-40, referring to *Mesa Power Group LLC v.

See also Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 227:10-228:7.\n\n310.\n\nThe Respondent's primary argument is that, by the Claimant's own characterization, all the Assistance Measures (with the exception of the LRR) are either procurement, subsidies, or grants within the meaning of Article 1108(7).655 Given that there are no qualifications to the text of Article 1108, the Respondent submits that \"if a measure falls within the ordinary meaning of its terms, the exclusion from the national treatment obligation in Article 1102 is decisive\".656 The Respondent contests the Claimant's argument that the Assistance Measures comprise \"a single non-exempted measure\", noting that the Assistance Measures should be assessed individually against the language of Article 1108(7).657\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 224; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 64; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 227:23-228:19; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 41.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 236; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 42.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1250:21-1251:12; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 232:3-18.\n\n311.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the *Mercer* tribunal stated that the ordinary meaning of \"procurement\" is \"the general act of buying goods and services\".658 It notes that the *Mesa* tribunal referred to \"procurement\" as being a \"broad notion\" \"commonly understood to refer to a formal acquisition, without a requirement that the acquisition be for the government's own use [\u2026] it would make no difference at all whether such goods and services, once purchased, are used solely by the Government, or by any other entity\".659 The Respondent submits that, as confirmed in *Mesa*, the definition of procurement from NAFTA Chapter 10 cannot be used in NAFTA Chapter 11.660\n\nRespondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 40, citing *Mercer International Inc. v.

and the potential for reliance on a substitute system of rules for dealing with unfair transborder pricing practices and government subsidization\".668 The Respondent highlights that the *Mesa* tribunal held that the purpose of Article 1108(7) is for the NAFTA parties to protect their ability to exercise nationality-based preferences, in a manner that yields maximum benefit for the local economy.669 The Respondent submits that when considering the objectives of NAFTA, the object and purpose of each chapter and each provision must be considered; it was the NAFTA parties' intention in NAFTA Chapter 11 that subsidies not be disciplined by NAFTA.670\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 475:15-476:3.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 476:8-477:23.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 229:25-230:10;

a gift or assignment of money, etc. by the act of an administrative body or of a person in control of a fund of the like\".\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 225, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at para 64.\n\n324.\n\nThe $1.5 million workforce training grant and the $1 million marketing grant: The Respondent identifies these measures as \"grants\" because \"GNS transferred these funds to PHP for training and marketing purposes and they are non-repayable\".697 It also points out that the Claimant has itself qualified these two measures as grants.698\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 227;

GNS negotiated arrangements directly with the workers without PHP's involvement.707 The Respondent explains that GNS proposed legislation that would directly help the workers and pensioners avoid an \"immediate windup hit of up to 30 percent or more of their pensions\".708\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 446:14-447:15, 460:4-5.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 447:1-4.\n\n330.\n\nThe LRR: The Respondent submits that the LRR is a private transaction at a market rate that cannot be attributed to Canada.709\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 458:13-21.\n\n331.\n\nBiomass Plant savings: The Respondent explains that any Biomass Plant savings (which the Respondent denies were in the range of $6-8 million) were the result of a private deal and that the rate PHP pays for steam was not subsidized by other ratepayers.710\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 458:22-459:11.\n\n332.\n\nRenewable energy savings: The Respondent reiterates that GNS never paid any money that resulted in renewable energy savings for PHP.711\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 450:24-25.\n\n333.\n\nProperty Tax Relief: The Respondent explains that the property tax relief that PHP received was commensurate with the change in its property holdings and therefore there was no beneficial measure provided pertaining to property tax.712 In the event that \"the Claimant maintains this argument or the Tribunal finds that the tax agreement provided a benefit to PWCC or PHP, Canada submits that the measure would fall within the scope of the exclusion for subsidies and grants set out in Article 1108(7)(b)\".713\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 463:17-464:18.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 224, fn. 472.\n\n334.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the \"debtor in possession finances hot idle and forestry infrastructure\" were ruled by the Tribunal as being outside its jurisdiction.714\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 460:8-11.\n\n335.\n\nIn response to the Claimant's first prong of argumentation, the Respondent denies that its current stance in this Arbitration with respect to subsidies contradicts the position it took previously in other fora.715\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 238; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 230:2-10; November 14, 2020, at 1243:15-1244:20.\n\n336.\n\nWith respect to the CVD Investigation, the Respondent recalls that Canada and GNS did not dispute some elements that the US DOC ultimately determined as countervailable subsidies under US domestic law.716\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 238; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 83.\n\n337.\n\nAs for the subsequent NAFTA and WTO proceedings, the Respondent specifies that they dealt with select issues, such as the LRR, the provision of stumpage and biomass to PHP, and GNS's payments to PHP under the Outreach Agreement.717 The Respondent further recalls that by the time Canada submitted its 2013 Subsidies Notification to the WTO on July 1, 2013, the issue had already been brought up at two meetings of the WTO Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures in addition to [REDACTED]718 The Respondent points out that, at those proceedings, Canada never denied that GNS had provided subsidies to PHP.719 The Respondent explains that the declaration of \"nil\" subsidies is not a denial of subsidies.720 The Respondent further recalls Article 25.7 of the WTO's SCM Agreement, which states that \"[m]embers recognize that notification of a measure does not prejudge either its legal status under GATT 1994 and this Agreement, the effects under this Agreement, or the nature of the measure itself\".721 The Respondent argues that \"if the notification of a measure does not prejudge its nature, the lack of notification cannot have that effect either\".722\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 83, referring to Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 154- 155\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 85, referring to [REDACTED] (**C-037**);

Hungary* deal with situations in which a party attempted to deny the existence (or the legality) of a contract with the other party despite benefiting from the same contract.744\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 242, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at para 230, fn. 325.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para 242, citing *Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v.

The Respondent submits that \"while the principle of good faith is an overarching principle to be applied to the interpretation and application of a specific legal rule, it does not permit this Tribunal to refuse to apply an explicit provision of a treaty (namely NAFTA Article 1108(7)) because of the alleged non-compliance of Canada with a different provision of another treaty (namely Article 25 of the SCM Agreement)\".749\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 76.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 73, referring to *Case Concerning Border and Transborder Armed Actions (Nicaragua v.

The Claimant's Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimant's position as regards Article 1108(7) is two-fold: first, Canada cannot rely on Article 1108(7) because of its prior statements outside this Arbitration denying that the Assistance Measures are subsidies (the self-contradiction argument), and second, if Canada can rely on Article 1108(7), not all of the Assistance Measures are covered by Article 1108(7).753 Without prejudice to its primary arguments, the Claimant answered questions from the Tribunal at the 2021 Hearing seeking to clarify its positions on the application of Article 1108(7) to the Assistance Measures. Its submissions are also outlined below.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 228-230, referring to Respondent's Statement of Defence, at para 88; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 276-277; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 114:1-9.\n\n347.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Article 1108(7) is an exception, rather than a derogation, and should be turned to only after considering whether there has been a breach of Article 1102.754 The Claimant notes that Canada's position on this issue has been unclear, that both Parties have presented extensive arguments on Article 1102, and that the international community would benefit from a determination on the merits of Article 1102 (which is \"virtually identical[ly]\" reflected in Article 14.4 of the USMCA and similarly worded in many treaties).755\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 152:12-21.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 152:22-153:23.\n\n348.\n\nAs to its primary argument, the Claimant submits that Canada and GNS's current position that the Assistance Measures are covered by Article 1108(7) contradicts their earlier positions before the WTO during the period between July 14, 2011 and July 19, 2013, whereby Canada declared \"nil\" subsidies for the purposes of the *Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures*.756 The Claimant highlights that by \"nil\", Canada meant that it did not grant or maintain within its territory any subsidy within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the Agreement.757 The Claimant further notes that Canada did not characterize the Assistance Measures as subsidies during the CVD Investigation in the United States.758 The Claimant additionally highlights that Canada did not characterise the Assistance Measures as subsidies in [REDACTED]759 In all these instances, the Claimant submits, Canada denied providing subsidies to PWCC.760 The Claimant argues that Canada cannot now alter its stance on subsidies in order to benefit from the Article 1108(7) exception.761\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 229; Claimant's Reply Memorial, para 277, referring to World Trade Organization, New and Full Notification Pursuant to Article XIV:1 of the GATT 1994 and Article 25 of the *Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures* \u2013 Canada, WTO Doc.

Alfaro stated in his concurring opinion that \"a state party to an international litigation is bound by its previous acts or attitude when they are in contradiction with its claims in the litigation\".765\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 160:3-9; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 73; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 398:25-399:8.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 278; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 73.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 292, citing Iain C.

Ecuador*, in which it submits that the tribunal relied on \"the broad principle against self-contradiction\" to deny Ecuador's jurisdictional objection that Chevron had not made an investment in Ecuador on the basis that Ecuador's own courts had ruled that there was an investment.768\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 294, referring to *The S.S.

Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, 162:18-163:1.\n\n355.\n\nAt the outset the Claimant clarifies that it is not considering the Assistance Measures in isolation, but the cumulative effect of the measures, which would not be covered by Article 1108(7).778 The Claimant submits that Article 1108(7) does not exempt a \"broader government initiative\", even if its components may qualify as a subsidy or a procurement.779 The Claimant clarifies that the measure under examination in this Arbitration is GNS's decision to make PHP the lowest cost producer of SC Paper; the Assistance Measures cannot be studied in isolation.780\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1211:19-1212:14; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at paras 77-78; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 114:10-14.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 122:12-24;

The Claimant did not make a specific argument in relation to the Ramp-Up Agreement.\n\n365.\n\nThe Land Purchase Agreement: The Claimant notes that this agreement for the purchase of land was concluded with the other Assistance Measures, therefore, taken in context, the Land Purchase Agreement was \"a form of government assistance that would provide PWCC with cash to start up its operations\".796 Relying on the distinction between subsidies and procurement in Article 1001(5), the Claimant submits that the Land Purchase Agreement should be considered a subsidy.797 The Claimant adds that procurements can generally be challenged through a bid protest, which could not have been done in the case of the Land Purchase Agreement.798\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 413:15-414:9.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 414:10-16.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 414:17-24.\n\n366.\n\nThe Claimant explains that the FULA is a 20-year license for the purchase and harvest of timber.799 It argues that this is neither a procurement nor a subsidy, rather, it is a \"very generous beneficial agreement for PHP\" for the purchase of goods from the government and for the payment to PHP for silviculture activities.800\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 416:5-12.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 310-311, referring to [REDACTED] (**C-360**).\n\n367.\n\nThe Claimant submits that PHP's ability to harvest tax losses is not procurement, but a tax incentive that could be considered as a subsidy providing a financial contribution.801 The Claimant submits that the pension relief received by PHP was neither procurement nor a subsidy.802\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 415:12-18.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 416:1-4.\n\n368.\n\nThe Claimant did not make specific arguments about the Indemnity Agreement at the 2021 Hearing, but has previously noted that [REDACTED].803\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 181.\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it is agreed between the Parties that the LRR, Biomass Regulations, RES Regulations are not covered by Article 1108(7).804\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 124:6-20; October 19, 2021, at 415:6-11.\n\n**4. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis with the derogations (or exceptions) provided for in NAFTA Article 1108(7), before turning to Article 1102(3) in the next Section.\n\n371.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that nearly all the paragraphs of Article 1108 start with the same formulation, listing Chapter 11 Articles that \"do not apply\" to certain measures or treatment listed therein or provided in Annexes I to III to NAFTA. In the case of Article 1108(7), it means that if the Tribunal were to find that some of the Assistance Measures are \"procurement\", \"subsides\" or \"grants\", the obligations provided under NAFTA Article 1102 would \"not apply\" to them. As such, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to start with the analysis of Article 1108(7), before turning to the analysis under Article 1102(3) as applicable. This is also the approach adopted by other NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals, including in *Mesa* and *Mercer*.805\n\nSee *Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, March 24, 2016, at para 465 (**CL-005**); *Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at para 6.50 (**RL-122**).\n\n372.\n\nTwo issues of interpretation may be resolved as a preliminary matter. First, one of the Claimant's primary arguments relating to Article 1108 is that the exemption is limited to *individual* subsidies, grants, or loans: \"[t]hese provisions do not exempt a broader government initiative that is alleged to violate [Article] 1102 even if the broader initiative might include, among its components, measures that could qualify as a subsidy or a procurement if viewed in isolation\".806 While the Claimant does not complain of individual Assistance Measures separately, this does not relieve the Tribunal of its duty to proceed on the basis provided for in Article 1108(7). In this respect, the text is unambiguous: the parties to NAFTA explicitly provided that the discipline against nationality-based discrimination at Article 1102 would not apply to procurement by a party and to subsidies or grants provided by a party. There is no exception in case such measures are joined or used together. As a result, the Tribunal will assess each measure complained of individually. This approach is consistent with the approach taken by the Tribunal to attribution: such determinations cannot proceed on an \"ensemble\" basis but must be made on an individual basis.807\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 162:21-163:1; November 14, 2020, at 1211:19-1212:11.\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraph 297 of this Award.\n\n373.\n\nSecond, during the course of the proceedings, the Parties disagreed on the approach to the interpretation of exceptions provided at Article 1108(7). For the Respondent, \"the exception is broad\".808 It argues for the application of ordinary rules of interpretation: for instance, if something falls under the term \"procurement by a party\", then it qualifies for the exception. For its part, the Claimant argues that \"the [Article] 1108(7) exception should not be interpreted broadly. This is consistent with the object and purpose of Chapter 11, which is investment protection. And it's also consistent with basic cannons of construction, which suggest that exceptions should be construed narrowly\".809 As held by other NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals in relation to Article 1108 (including *Mobil* and *Mesa*), this Tribunal is of the view that exceptions and reservations should be interpreted like other provisions of the treaty: not restrictively as a matter of principle, but in accordance with their ordinary meaning under the VCLT.810 As a reminder, VCLT Article 31(1) provides that: \"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\".811\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1254:19-21; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 40.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1350:22-1351:2.\n\nSee e.g. *Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, March 24, 2016, at para 405 (**CL-005**); *Mobil Investments Canada Inc. and* *Murphy Oil Company v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/04, Decision on Liability and Principles of Quantum, May 22, 2012, at paras 251-255 (**RL-170**).\n\nVCLT Article 31(1).\n\n374.\n\nHaving set the stage, the Tribunal will first interpret the terms \"procurement by a Party\" used in Article 1108(7)(a) and the terms \"subsidies or grants provided by a Party\" used in Article 1108(7)(b) and apply them, respectively, to the facts of this case. Second, the Tribunal will rule on the Claimant's argument that the Respondent is prevented from relying on Article 1108(7) because of the doctrine of estoppel or the broader prohibition on self-contradiction.\n\n**(a) Interpretation and application of Article 1108(7)**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. Article 1108(7)(a): procurement\n----------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that NAFTA Chapter 11 does not provide a definition of \"procurement\"; neither does Chapter 2 under General Definitions, nor Chapter 10 \"Government Procurement\". As with other NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals faced with this issue, including *ADF*,812 *UPS*,813 *Mesa*,814 and *Mercer*,815 the Tribunal will have recourse to VCLT Article 31(1).\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, January 9, 2003 (**CL-130**).\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits and Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass, May 24, 2007 (**CL-113**).\n\n*Mesa Power Group LLC v.

Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018 (**RL-122**).\n\n376.\n\nIn *Mercer*, similar to prior tribunals, the majority of the tribunal held that the ordinary meaning of \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise\" was broad. In this case, the tribunal had to decide whether the claimant's claims relating to the 2009 Power Service Agreement brought under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 concerned \"procurement\" by a state enterprise (i.e. BC Hydro), such that they were precluded by NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a).816 In holding that the claims concerned procurement (at least in part), the majority of the tribunal held that:\n\n6.34 In the Tribunal's view, the English word \"procurement\", as a matter of ordinary English language, is the general act of buying goods and services. It is a broad term. The Tribunal does not consider that the Spanish (or French) wording cited by the Parties and Non-Disputing Parties introduces any materially different meaning. Nor, in the Tribunal's view, does the word \"procurement\" require a restricted meaning in NAFTA Article 1108(7), because it operates as an exception to the grant of protection to investors and investments under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103. To the contrary, its ordinary meaning is broad and not restrictive.\n\n6.35 As to its ordinary meaning in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a), the Tribunal decides that the phrase \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise\", in its context and in the light of NAFTA's object and purpose, signifies the buying of goods or services for or by a State or a state enterprise (as defined in NAFTA Annex 1505) owned or controlled through ownership interests by that State.817\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at para 6.27-6.31 (**RL-122**).\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at para 6.34-6.35 (**RL-122**).\n\n377.\n\nIn its analysis, the majority of the tribunal cited in support the ordinary, broad interpretation given in *ADF*818 and *UPS*819 as well as the definition of \"government procurement\" included in the US Model BIT.820\n\nAs a reminder, in *ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, January 9, 2003 (**CL-130**), the tribunal had to decide whether US measures that required that steel materials used in the construction of an interchange project be 100% produced and fabricated in the US constituted a breach of NAFTA (at para 155). In its analysis of Article 1108(7)(a), the tribunal found that: \"[i]n its ordinary or dictionary connotation, 'procurement' refers to the act of obtaining, as by effort, labor or purchase. To procure means to 'get; to gain; to come into possession of'. [\u2026] Thus, governmental procurement refers to the obtaining by purchase by a governmental agency or entity of title to or possession of, for instance, goods, supplies, materials and machinery\" (at para 161 [internal footnotes omitted]). Ultimately, the tribunal ruled that \"[p]rocurement by the Commonwealth of Virginia for, or in connection with, the Springfield Interchange Project, constitutes procurement by a Party within the meaning of Article 1108(7)(a). The Investor's claim concerning Article 1102 is, accordingly, denied\", para 199(3).\n\nAt issue in *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on Merits, 24 May, 2007 (**CL-113**) was whether the \"Postal Imports Agreement\" (PIA), under which Canada Customs procured three services (material handling, data entry, duty collection) from Canada Post for a fee fell under the Article 1108(7) exemption. The majority of the tribunal, after a brief analysis, concluded that: \"Having analysed the PIA and being informed by the decisions of the *ADF* and *Dussault* Tribunals [A domestic court decision having determined that the PIA was a commercial, fee-for-service contract], we are of the view that the PIA is clearly a procurement contract under which Canada Post performs services for Customs for a fee\" (at para 135). As such, the tribunal concluded that the PIA fell within Article 1108(7)(a).\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at para 6.39-6.41 (**RL-122**).\n\n378.\n\nThe majority of the tribunal in *Mesa* similarly held that the notion of procurement was broad: \"In its ordinary meaning, 'procure' [\u2026] means 'to get; to gain; to come into possession of.' The French and Spanish texts of the NAFTA use the generic term for 'purchases' in Article 1108\".821 In this case, the tribunal decided that the Ontario FIT program, under which power purchase agreements were awarded by the Ontario Power Authority, constituted \"procurement\" under NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a).822\n\n*Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, March 24, 2016, at para 407 (**CL-005**).\n\n*Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, March 24, 2016, at para 448 (**CL-005**).\n\n379.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant only provided a definition of the term \"procurement\" in its Pre-Hearing Memorial dated October 14, 2021, in response to questions from the Tribunal. After noting that the term was not defined in NAFTA, the Claimant provided the following dictionary definition of \"procurement\": \"the action of obtaining or procuring something\".823 The Claimant only engages with the case-law on Article 1108(7)(a) to a limited extent, for instance noting that the *Mesa* tribunal's caution against incorporating provisions from other NAFTA Chapters (here Chapter 10 on Government Procurement) into Chapter 11 was unwarranted.824\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 70, citing https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/procurement.\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 409:6-17.\n\n380.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent argues that the ordinary meaning of procurement in Article 1108(7)(a) is broad, citing in support past NAFTA Chapter 11 cases, including *ADF*, *Mercer*, and *Mesa.*825 Pressed by Dean Cass at the closing of the 2020 Hearing on the usually formal nature of procurement, the Respondent argued that the meaning of \"procurement\" in Article 1108(7) was broad: \"[i]t's procurement by a party. It's not covered by other chapters in the NAFTA which deal with procurement or WTO rules on procurement and so on\".826\n\nSee e.g. Respondent's Counter-Memorial, fn. 486; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at paras 38-42.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1254:19-24.\n\n381.\n\nThis Tribunal agrees with the Respondent and past tribunals that the ordinary meaning of procurement is broad. It will now turn to specific arguments by the Claimant related to the interaction between NAFTA Chapters 10 and 11 and its impact on interpretation. In particular, the Claimant submitted at the 2021 Hearing that Article 1001(5) of Chapter 10 should be relied upon by this Tribunal as guidance to differentiate between \"procurement\" at Article 1108(7)(a) and \"subsidies\" at Article 1108(7)(b).827 Article 1001(5) provides as follows:\n\n5. Procurement includes procurement by such methods as purchase, lease or rental, with or without an option to buy. Procurement does not include:\n\n(a) non-contractual agreements or any form of government assistance, including cooperative agreements, grants, loans, equity infusions, guarantees, fiscal incentives, and government provision of goods and services to persons or state, provincial and regional governments; and\n\n(b) the acquisition of fiscal agency or depository services, liquidation and management services for regulated financial institutions and sale and distribution services for government debt.828\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 407:17-409:5.\n\nNAFTA Article 1001(5).\n\n382.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant argued that \"any transaction with a subsidy element to it, a financial contribution from the government providing assistance to the recipient, couldn't be considered procurement. That exception in the language in [Article] 1001(5) says that if it looks like a subsidy, it would not be considered procurement here\".829 The Claimant then submits two arguments in support of its reliance on another NAFTA Chapter to interpret a provision of Chapter 11: (i) not sharing the *Mesa* tribunal's caution, it submits that other tribunals have done so (citing to *Canfor* in relation to NAFTA Chapter 19) and (ii) it further submits that in case of inconsistency between Chapter 11 and any other chapter, Article 1112(1) provides that the other chapter will prevail (to the extent of the inconsistency).830\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 408:24-409:5.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 409:6-409:17.\n\n383.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of the *Mesa* tribunal that concluded that other chapters of NAFTA provide only limited context and guidance to understand the meaning of the terms in Article 1108(7)(a). Specifically, the *Mesa* tribunal held that:\n\nFurther, in Chapters 11, 12 and 15, the term is used as a 'carve-out', precluding the application of substantive provisions, while in Chapter 10 the term is used as a 'carve-in', allowing for and regulating the application of substantive provisions. In other words, the term 'procurement' is used in different contexts in the NAFTA, serving different functions and for different purposes, and to regulate different subject areas.831\n\n*Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, March 24, 2016, para 417 [internal footnote omitted] (**CL-005**).\n\n384.\n\nOn Chapter 10, the *Mesa* tribunal added:\n\nIf the NAFTA Parties had intended to incorporate the limitations found in Article 1001(5) into Article 1108(7)(a), they could easily have done so. Indeed, other provisions of Article 1108 contain express references to provisions of other chapters of the NAFTA.832\n\n*Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, March 24, 2016, para 425 [internal footnote omitted] (**CL-005**).\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this reasoning apposite, even in the case of the narrower argument submitted by the Claimant, that does not seek to import (wholesale) into Chapter 11 the limitations of Chapter 10 (as the claimants in other cases had sought to do). The context and purposes of these provisions do differ.\n\n386.\n\nRelatedly, the Tribunal also agrees with the reasoning of the *Mesa* tribunal that when considering object and purpose under the VCLT, the Tribunal not only has to consider the overall objectives of NAFTA (which operate at a high level of generality), but must \"also focus on the objects and purposes of the particular provision in which the term appears. And for this, the Tribunal must consider the text of the provision itself (here Article 1108)\".833 On this point, the *Mesa* tribunal concluded that \"through the exception carved-out by Article 1108(7)(a), the NAFTA Contracting Parties sought to protect their ability to exercise nationality-based preferences in cases of procurement\".834\n\n*Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, March 24, 2016, para 418 (**CL-005**) citing *ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, January 9, 2003 (**CL-130**).\n\n*Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, March 24, 2016, at para 419 (**CL-005**).\n\n387.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal finds that there is no inconsistency between Chapter 11 and Chapter 10 that would make the latter prevail in defining procurement. Again, the Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of the tribunal in *Mesa*, which held that:\n\nsubparagraphs (a) and (b) of Article 1001(5) are not found in Article 1108(7)(a), and therefore, the question of inconsistency cannot arise. What the Claimant is seeking is not a finding of inconsistency between Articles 1001(5) and 1108(7)(a) but rather an importation of the limitations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 1001(5) into Article 1108(7)(a), for which there is no justification, [\u2026]835\n\n*Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, March 24, 2016, at para 439 (**CL-005**).\n\n388.\n\nThird, the Tribunal cannot accept the argument of the Claimant which implies that if a government program seeks to attain more than one objective in a single vehicle or transaction and one of those components meets the ordinary definition of procurement while another is a grant, the government could not avail itself of the exclusion provided at Article 1108(7)(a), but only of that under Article 1108(7)(b). In usual circumstances this differentiation would not matter, as both would be excluded under Article 1108(7). But in this case, the Claimant seeks to prevent the Tribunal from applying the Article 1108(7)(b) exclusion on the ground that the Respondent allegedly contradicted itself in other legal proceedings by claiming that GNS did not provide subsidies to PHP.836 Consistent with this position, the Claimant has submitted (when asked by the Tribunal at the 2021 Hearing) that the Outreach Agreement and the Land Purchase Agreement should be considered subsidies and not procurement under Article 1108(7).\n\nSee Paragraphs 349 *et seq.*\n\n389.\n\nAs a general matter, the Tribunal is of the view that nothing in the text of Article 1108(7) prevents it from applying the exclusion in a case where a government program serves more than one purpose and amalgamates different components. To hold otherwise would result in form prevailing over substance, as held by the tribunal in *Mercer*.837 Although in a different context, the tribunal in that case differentiated between components of a contract, holding some terms to fall within the procurement exception, but not others.838\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at para 6.45 (**RL-122**).\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at paras 6.45-6.47 (**RL-122**).\n\n390.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal will apply the ordinary meaning of the term procurement at Article 1108(7)(a) as formulated in *Mercer*: \"the phrase 'procurement by a Party or a state enterprise', in its context and in the light of NAFTA's object and purpose, signifies the buying of goods or services for or by a State or a state enterprise\".839\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at para 6.35 (**RL-122**).\n\n391.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the following measures fall within the scope of Article 1108(7)(a): the Land Purchase Agreement, the Outreach Agreement and the Forest Utilization Licence Agreement (or FULA).\n\na. Land Purchase Agreement\n--------------------------\n\n392.\n\nAs described earlier, [REDACTED] GNS purchased 51,500 acres of land from PWCC for $20 million dollars.840 This purchase took place in the context of the implementation of the Natural Resources Strategy, which sought to increase Crown ownership of land in the province.841 In order to meet the goal set in pre-existing legislation to protect 12% of Nova Scotia's land mass, GNS had recourse to two programs: the Large Land Purchase Program and the Forestry Transition Land Acquisition Program.842 The latter program stipulates a process that includes amongst others items: the review of letters of request which then get prioritized by a steering committee, the appraisal of land and its sale at fair market value. The evaluation covers both a DNR staff preliminary Integrated Resource Management (IRM) assessment and an appraisal by an accredited appraiser.843\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 230; Witness Statement of Julie Towers, April 17, 2019, at para 28.\n\nSee Witness Statement of Julie Towers, April 17, 2019, at paras 11-13.\n\nSee Witness Statement of Julie Towers, April 17, 2019, at paras 7, 14.\n\nSee Nova Scotia Natural Resources, \"Forestry Transition Land Acquisition Program: Guidelines for Applicants\", April 2008, at 1 (**R-207**).\n\n393.\n\nOver the years, GNS purchased land from several mills, including Northern Pulp and NPPH in 2010, Bowater Mersey in 2011, and PWCC in 2012.844\n\nSee Witness Statement of Julie Towers, April 17, 2019, at paras 23-30.\n\n394.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the Respondent argued that the land purchase in this case \"falls within the scope of the Article 1108(7)(a) exclusion for 'procurement': the GNS paid money and received land in return\".845\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 230.\n\n395.\n\nFor its part, at the 2021 Hearing following questions from the Tribunal, the Claimant submitted that the land purchase was a subsidy and not procurement because it \"was intended to be a form of government assistance that would provide PWCC with cash to start up its operations\".846 The Claimant tied the argument back to NAFTA Chapter 10: \"And so per the distinction in NAFTA Article 1001(5), and perhaps also Article 1112(1), that should be considered a subsidy because 1001(5), if you were to look to that for guidance, this would be financial assistance and that would tip the balance for it to be a subsidy rather than treated as procurement\".847\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 414:6-9.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 414:10-16.\n\n396.\n\nAs held above, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimant's argument related to NAFTA Chapter 10 and its impact on the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a). In any case, the fact that the money obtained from the sale of the land may have helped PWCC relaunch the activities of the Mill does not disqualify the transaction from being a procurement. Furthermore, it is uncontroverted that the land purchase was done at fair market value.848 On this point, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent: \"it was a fair market value transaction whereby the government bought a valuable asset for use for public purposes. It's not a subsidy\".849\n\nSee Witness Statement of Julie Towers, April 17, 2019, at para 30.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 182:21-25.\n\n397.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that the Land Purchase Agreement falls under the Article 1108(7)(a) exclusion as constituting \"the buying of goods [\u2026] by a State\".\n\n398.\n\nEven if the Tribunal had adopted a more formal definition of procurement (discussed further below), the Land Purchase Agreement in this case would still fall under the Article 1108(7)(a) exclusion. First, land, as real property, is typically not subject to open competitive bidding procedures when being purchased by governments. Chapter 10 itself reflects the limits of competitive bidding in certain cases by providing for limited tendering procedures at Article 1016.850 Second, the programs described above include their own procedures for GNS land purchases, such as requests, evaluations, appraisals, and award.\n\nIt is noteworthy that not all procurement covered by Chapter 10 is subject to competitive bidding. Indeed, Article 1016 allows for the use of limited tendering procedures in appropriate circumstances. This would be the case where e.g. \"for reasons connected with the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights, or [\u2026] where there is an absence of competition for technical reasons, the goods or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute exists\".\n\nb. Outreach Agreement\n---------------------\n\n399.\n\nThe Outreach Agreement was concluded between PHP and GNS on [REDACTED]851 As explained by Julie Towers in her witness statement: \"[REDACTED]\".852 GNS reimburses PHP for its costs under the agreement up to a cap of $3.8 million per year, for a duration of 10 years.\n\nSee [REDACTED] (**C-206**).\n\nSee Witness Statement of Julie Towers, April 17, 2019, at para 38.\n\n400.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant argued that the exception for procurement does not apply to all parts of the Outreach Agreement, [REDACTED]\".853 Julie Towers, in her Rejoinder witness statement, clarified that: \"all of the expenses that are reimbursed by the GNS under the Outreach Agreement (the 'eligible costs') are related to services provided to, and approved by, the GNS\".854\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 309-310.\n\nRejoinder Witness Statement of Julie Towers, March 4, 2020, at para 7.\n\n401.\n\nAlso in its Reply, the Claimant criticizes the Respondent for not producing documents that would have enabled it to determine whether GNS paid fair market value prices for different cost categories under the Outreach Agreement.855 The Respondent denied this claim in its Rejoinder, noting that relevant documents have been produced and that only the amounts for payments past October 15, 2014 have been redacted since they are not relevant to the dispute. For the Respondent, whether as a \"procurement\" or as a \"grant\" (the term used by the Claimant on occasion to refer to the program),856 the payments by GNS for activities performed would fall within Article 1108(7).857\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 310.\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, at paras 71, 219, 253.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, at para 69; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 457:13-20.\n\n402.\n\nAt the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant further argued that:\n\nThe government is not buying something, there is no price for services. The amount -- the way that the agreement works is that there's $3.8 million available for these reimbursements over a ten-year period. So what that agreement is doing is it's providing a fiscal incentive of reimbursement up to annual limits for PHP as it decides to undertake the types of activities that would be eligible as costs to be reimbursed within the amounts of the annual limits. I will note that the Department of Commerce found the outreach agreement to be a countervailing subsidy and Canada did not challenge that finding at the WTO, and you can see that in the panel report that they have provided at R-238.858\n\nIn sum, the Outreach Agreement was not procurement under Article 1108(7)(a).\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 412:22-413:14.\n\n403.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal, after reviewing the Outreach Agreement itself, that some of the provisions clearly meet the definition of \"buying services for or by a State\", for example, [REDACTED]859 Other provisions of the Outreach Agreement (e.g. [REDACTED] could alternatively be seen as grants.860\n\nSee [REDACTED] at CAN000001\\_0004- 0006 (**C-206**).\n\nSee [REDACTED] at CAN000001\\_0004, CAN000001\\_0007 (**C-206**).\n\n404.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to hold that the Outreach Agreement had a dual purpose, this would not prevent the Tribunal from concluding that parts of the agreement could be excluded as procurement under Article 1108(7)(a) and other parts as grants under Article 1108(7)(b). As discussed above, in the Tribunal's view, the question is one of substance and not form. As also held in *Mercer*, \"it is not possible to have one purpose extinguish the other\".861\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at para 6.45 (**RL-122**).\n\n405.\n\nOn the issue of formality, the Tribunal adds that while procurement may often be associated with formal procedures for the acquisition of goods and services by governments and is sometimes subject to disciplines under trade agreements, that does not mean that such limitations must be implied where the text does not provide so, such as in the case of NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a). As held by the tribunal in *Mesa*, the notion of procurement as a \"formal\" acquisition is neither confirmed nor contradicted by the context in which the term is used.862\n\n*Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, March 24, 2016, at para 415 (**CL-005**).\n\n406.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that the Outreach Agreement falls under the NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a) exclusion.\n\nc. Forest Utilization License Agreement\n---------------------------------------\n\n407.\n\nAs described earlier, the FULA binds PHP and GNS to a modernized forest management licencing regime and was executed on September 27, 2012. Julie Towers summarized two key elements of the FULA, alleged by the Claimant to provide \"benefits\" to PHP:863\n\n[T]he FULA is intended to contractually bind PHP to act in a manner consistent with the Province's Natural Resources Strategy. With respect to the timber it needs for its mill, PHP pays for all stumpage harvested from Crown lands at the price and quantity prescribed in the FULA. Separate from this, PHP has an obligation to undertake specific silviculture activities for which it incurs expenses. These silviculture expenses are audited annually, and reimbursement is capped at [REDACTED] In this regard, the Province compensates PHP for taking care of Crown lands. Without PHP or another licensee conducting those silviculture activities, it would fall to the Crown to pay contractors to do so.864\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 219, 253.\n\nRejoinder Witness Statement of Julie Towers, March 4, 2020, at para 3.\n\n408.\n\nAs with the Outreach Agreement, the Claimant argued in its Reply that the exception for procurement under Article 1108(7) does not apply to all parts of the FULA. The Claimant's case was limited to one sentence: \"GNS 'procures' nothing in these agreements\u2014it is not buying goods or services\u2014when PHP pays for stumpage under the FULA\".865 At the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant clarified its position that the FULA constituted neither procurement nor a subsidy \"because it's a purchase of goods from the government. It's not the government purchasing goods from the company\".866 Given that, on at least one occasion, PHP is alleged to have received more in silviculture fees than it paid in stumpage fees, the Claimant argued that this circumstance \"demonstrates a very generous beneficial agreement for PHP and a reduction of its fibre cost which is one of the four cost considerations for paper mills\".867\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 309.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 416:9-12.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 417:12-15.\n\n409.\n\nAt the 2021 Hearing, the Respondent also clarified its position that the silviculture work aspect of the FULA fell under the Article 1108(7)(a) exclusion as procurement, while the stumpage fees [REDACTED]868\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 454:5-17: \"Now, again, Resolute confuses the FULA's stumpage fees aspect and the silviculture payments as Ms. Towers explained and as is in the FULA, PHP pays for all Crown stumpage harvested at the rates prescribed in the FULA and [REDACTED]\n\n410.\n\nConsistent with its earlier finding that an agreement (or specifically, here, a license) could serve more than one purpose and have some parts only fall within Article 1108(7)(a), the Tribunal concludes that the silviculture work aspect of the FULA meets the definition of procurement as \"the buying of [\u2026] services for or by a State\". As such, it is excluded from the analysis under NAFTA Article 1102(3).\n\n411.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal finds that no exclusion under Article 1108(7) applies to the stumpage fee aspect of the FULA and as such it will be analyzed in particular under Article 1102(3) below.\n\nii. Article 1108(7)(b): subsidies or grants\n-------------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nNAFTA Article 1108(7)(b) provides that Article 1102 does not apply to \"subsidies or grants provided by a Party or a state enterprise, including government supported loans, guarantees and insurance\".\n\n413.\n\nAgain here, as with procurement, the Tribunal must interpret terms, including \"subsidies\", that have not been defined by the NAFTA parties in Chapter 11 or elsewhere in NAFTA. After being asked by the Tribunal to clarify their positions on the interpretation of subsidy,869 both Parties addressed it at the 2021 Hearing, using the Oxford dictionary definition as a starting point. The Claimant read the definition of subsidy as targeting a narrow category of government support,870 while the Respondent argued that the definition was broad.871\n\nSee E-mail from the Tribunal to the Parties dated September 13, 2021, which stated that \"[\u2026] the Tribunal would like the Parties to specifically address in more detail in their submissions and the [2021 Hearing] how the Tribunal should interpret the notions of 'treatment' & 'in like circumstances' (at NAFTA Art. 1102(3)), and 'procurement' & 'subsidies' (at Art. 1108(7))\".\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 110:5-8; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at paras 70-71.\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 471:10-473:8.\n\n414.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that some of the principles adopted to interpret the term procurement at Article 1108(7)(a) apply similarly to the definition of subsidies at Article 1108(7)(b).\n\n415.\n\nFirst, the NAFTA parties left the term subsidy undefined, presumably knowing that a NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunal would turn to VCLT Article 31 for its interpretation. It is not for the Tribunal to import limitations found in other chapters of NAFTA or, more relevant here, in other international agreements absent any indication to that effect in NAFTA. The NAFTA parties made explicit cross-references when they so intended, as seen in the reference in Article 1108 to other NAFTA Chapters (e.g. in Article 1108(5)), or in other parts of NAFTA to GATT provisions (e.g. in Article 2101).\n\n416.\n\nSecond, as to object and purpose, through the derogation (or exception carved-out) by Article 1108(7)(b), the NAFTA parties sought to protect their ability to exercise nationality-based preferences in relation to subsidies and grants. NAFTA specifically does not include disciplines on subsidies, and the derogation at Article 1108(7)(b) should be interpreted in that light.872\n\nUnder NAFTA Chapter 19, each party reserves the right to apply its own countervailing duty law but agrees to replace judicial review of final determinations with binational panel review. Article 1907(2) provides that \"The Parties further agree to consult on: (a) the potential to develop more effective rules and disciplines concerning the use of government subsidies\".\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the dictionary definitions of subsidy proposed by the Parties are not narrow on their face. The Claimant has submitted that a subsidy is \"a sum of money granted by the government or a public body to assist an industry or business so that the price of a commodity or service may remain low or competitive\".873 As noted by the Respondent, other definitions do not include the reference to keeping prices low.874 The Oxford English Dictionary (as compared to Lexico.com cited by the Claimant) includes the following, more comprehensive definition of subsidy: \"Money or a sum of money granted by the state or a public body to help keep down the price of a commodity or service, or to support something held to be in the public interest. Also: the granting of money for these purposes\".875 The Merriam Webster dictionary provides similarly that a subsidy is: \"a grant or gift of money: such as [\u2026] c: a grant by a government to a private person or company to assist an enterprise deemed advantageous to the public\".876\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 70, citing https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/subsidy; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 110:5-11.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 472:11-14.\n\nOxford English Dictionary.\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subsidy\n\n418.\n\nOne element of the definition of subsidy the Parties agree on is that there must be a financial contribution by the government. As stated by the Respondent, \"not every advantageous treatment of an enterprise of a party is a subsidy. There must be some kind of financial contribution\".877 The Tribunal agrees with this basic requirement. As noted by the Respondent, however, subsidies are not limited to direct transfers of funds. The inclusion at Article 1108(7)(b) of government-supported \"guarantees and insurance\" indicates that much.878\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 473:14-17. See also Claimant's Memorial, at para 230: \"subsidies require financial contributions, and whereas there are financial consequences in all the Nova Scotia Measures, they do not all involve financial contributions\"; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 72.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 473:2-8.\n\n419.\n\nTo support its narrow interpretation of the term subsidy, the Claimant draws on the WTO SCM Agreement and Dean Cass' Separate Statement in *UPS*. In particular, the Claimant submits that:\n\n[\u2026], it seems reasonable to interpret Article 1108(7) as being aimed at excluding from NAFTA scrutiny under Article 1102 those specific measures that the NAFTA Parties knew would be subject to WTO discipline and other trade remedies. Such exclusion would require the definition of \"subsidy\" under the WTO system to be consistent with the measures that fall within Article 1108(7), and it is. \"Subsidy\" is defined in Article 1 of the WTO ASCM and refers to narrow categories of overt decisions by government to expressly convey a \"financial contribution\" or \"income or price support\" to particular enterprises.879\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 72 [internal footnotes omitted]. See also Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 281, 311, which make reference to the SCM Agreement.\n\n420.\n\nAs already alluded to, this Tribunal does not find it appropriate to import limitations from a different international agreement without any indication to that effect from the NAFTA parties. In particular, the Tribunal does not find convincing the Claimant's reliance on the NAFTA preamble for this purpose.880 What may appear \"reasonable\" to the Claimant is not what the VCLT calls for as a matter of interpretation. The WTO SCM Agreement details what constitutes subsidies (including financial contribution by a government or any public body within the territory of a member which confers a benefit) and requirements as to specificity.881 In turn, concepts such as \"benefit\" and \"specificity\" have been interpreted by WTO panels and the Appellate Body considering the particular context and object and purpose of the agreement. In other words, the regulation of subsidies at the WTO comes with \"baggage\", one that cannot properly be imported into the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1108(7)(b). Further, references to \"overt decisions\" and the \"express\" conveying of financial contributions that are subject to political processes as well as public debate and scrutiny do not match the reality of the many methods that different levels of government use to provide financial support to enterprises, which methods meet the ordinary meaning of \"subsidies\". Furthermore, the object and purpose of Article 1108(7)(b), as discussed above, is to permit nationality-based preferences in relation to subsidies and grants; which is the opposite of seeking to discipline subsidies. Finally, it is unrealistic to require governments to label different programs as \"subsidies\" in advance of potential future litigation in which such measures are contested under international trade agreements. What definitions should a government use when labelling the measures in advance? Should governments use the definitions under the WTO SCM Agreement? This suggestion is neither appropriate nor practical.\n\nThe NAFTA preamble provides that its parties resolve to \"BUILD on their respective rights and obligations under the *General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade* and other multilateral and bilateral instruments of cooperation. See Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, fn. 66.\n\nSee World Trade Organization, *Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures*, at Articles 1-2(**C- 367**).\n\n421.\n\nTurning back to the wording of Article 1108(7)(b), the Tribunal notes that there are other elements that differentiate the text of NAFTA from that of the WTO SCM Agreement. As also noted by the Respondent, the NAFTA parties use subsidies *or* grants as distinct elements under Article 1108(7)(b), while under the SCM Agreement, a \"grant\" can fall under the definition of subsidies.882 As such, the Respondent provided a dictionary definition of the term \"grant\" as: \"[a]n authoritative bestowal or conferment of a privilege, right, or possession; a gift or assignment of money, etc. by the act of an administrative body or of a person in control of a fund or the like\".883\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, at fn. 156.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at fn. 476.\n\n422.\n\nAdditionally, Article 1108(7)(b) provides examples of government \"subsidies or grants\" that are excluded from the purview of Article 1102: \"including government-supported loans, guarantees and insurance\".884 While the use of \"including\" means the list is illustrative and not exhaustive, the Tribunal considers these examples to be very informative as to the kind of measures the NAFTA parties meant to cover. In the particular circumstances of this case, they also prove to be determinative.\n\nNAFTA Article 1108(7)(b).\n\n423.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will consider next the Parties' arguments related to \"government supported loans\" before ruling on whether the related Assistance Measures fall within the exclusion in Article 1108(7)(b) under subsidies or grants.\n\na. Government supported loans\n-----------------------------\n\n424.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of loan, as suggested by the Respondent, is: \"[a] thing lent: something the use of which is allowed for a time, on the understanding that it shall be returned or an equivalent given; *esp.* a sum of money lent on these conditions, and usually at interest\".885\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at fn. 473.\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the following measures are government supported loans:\n\n\u2022 the $40 million credit facility: as described earlier, [REDACTED]\n\n\u2022 the $24 million capital loan: [REDACTED]886 [REDACTED]\n\n\u2022 the Indemnity Agreement: as described earlier [REDACTED]887\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 111.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 136, 225, 228.\n\n426.\n\nWhile contesting that the \"harvesting\" of $1 billion in tax losses was a GNS measure providing a benefit to PHP,888 the Respondent also argues that it falls under the exclusion at Article 1108(7)(b) as [REDACTED]889\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 226, 318; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at fn. 74.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 459:14-25.\n\n427.\n\nThe Claimant was asked at the 2021 Hearing to clarify its position (without prejudice to its primary arguments) on whether different GNS Assistance Measures constituted procurement, subsidies or grants under Article 1108(7). The Claimant submitted that the $40 million forgivable credit facility and the $24 million forgivable loan, as loans, would seem to fit with the definition of subsidy.890 The Claimant did not mention the Indemnity Agreement at the time, but had earlier referred to it as [REDACTED]891 Regarding the harvesting of tax losses, the Claimant at the 2021 Hearing submitted that it was a tax incentive that could be considered a subsidy, as it provided a financial contribution. The Claimant further linked the harvesting of tax losses to the government loans,892 as the Respondent did.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 412:2-9. Before the 2021 Hearing the Claimant had not provided arguments as to whether the Assistance Measures fell under \"government supported loans\" under Article 1108(7)(b) but did refer to these programs as loans in its written memorials. See e.g. Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 264 (re $64 million in in forgivable loans).\n\nSee Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 181.\n\nThe Claimant highlighted that: \"And particularly is the way that it was restructured at the last minute because PHP had been disappointed about not getting the tax ruling from federal Canada the way that it wanted to, and so there were changes to allow them to apply those tax losses that were for the mill and carried over previously\". Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 415:19-25.\n\n428.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the $40 million credit facility, $24 million capital loan and the Indemnity Agreement are \"government supported loans\" that meet the basic definition of subsidy (or grant if forgiven) at NAFTA Article 1108(7)(b) because they provide some \"financial contribution\" to assist an enterprise.893 Whether seen through the Claimant's eyes as assistance that allowed PHP to dramatically reduce its costs, or through the Respondent's eyes as assistance in the public interest related to the economic impact of the Mill in the province of Nova Scotia, the result is the same. The Tribunal does not find it necessary to explore further the confines of the term subsidy to make its ruling: whether considered as subsidies (when repayable) or as grant (if/when forgiven), the government supported loans in this case fall under the Article 1108(7)(b) exclusion.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find it necessary to [REDACTED] See [REDACTED] , at 5-6 (**C-195**).\n\nb. (Other) Grants\n-----------------\n\n429.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Respondent proposed the following definition of \"grant\" as: \"[a]n authoritative bestowal or conferment of a privilege, right, or possession; a gift or assignment of money, etc. by the act of an administrative body or of a person in control of a fund or the like\".\n\n430.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the following Assistance Measures are grants:\n\n\u2022 the workforce training grant ($ 1.5 million): d[REDACTED]894\n\n\u2022 the marketing grant ($1 million): [REDACTED]895\n\n\u2022 the Ramp-Up Agreement (up to $1.5 million): a separate agreement between NPPH, PWCC and GNS dealing with activities necessary for the mill to restart its operations and qualify paper. Funds drawn from \"the Province's commitment with respect to marketing to PWCC\" ($300,000) and remaining funds, as of 24 July 2012, of the hot idle funding.896\n\nSee [REDACTED] at 4 (**C-182**).\n\nSee [REDACTED] at 4 (**C-182**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 137.\n\n431.\n\nAsked to clarify its position at the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant provided the following response (as before, without prejudice to its primary arguments): \"With respect to the two grants, the $1.5 million productivity grant and the $1 million marketing grant, as grants and the description of grants there falls under subsidies as well, that's where they would be\".897 The Claimant did not address the Ramp-Up Agreement.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 412:10-14.\n\n432.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the $1.5 million workforce training grant, the $1 million marketing grant and [REDACTED] Ramp-Up Agreement [REDACTED] conform to the ordinary meaning of \"grant\" in NAFTA Article 1108(7)(b), read in its context and in light of its object and purpose. As such, these measures are excluded from the purview of Article 1102. Since the term \"grant\" appears alongside \"subsidy\" at Article 1108(7)(b), the Tribunal finds there is no need to also conclude they are subsidies.\n\nc. Remaining measure: the municipal property tax reduction\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n433.\n\nThe Respondent's primary argument is that the new municipal tax rate did not constitute a \"benefit\" to PWCC. As described above, the Respondent submits that the readjustment accounted for reduced operations and asset use at the Mill.898 In support of its arguments, the Respondent referred to the U.S. DOC finding, as of October 2015, that \"the property tax that Port Hawkesbury paid during the POI under the amended tax agreement exceeds the property tax otherwise due. As a result, we find that there is no revenue forgone [\u2026] without forgone revenue, Port Hawkesbury did not receive a benefit\".899 However, the Respondent also submits as an alternative argument that: \"in the event that the Claimant maintains this argument or the Tribunal finds that the tax agreement provided a benefit to PWCC or PHP, Canada submits that the measure would fall within the scope of the exclusion for subsidies and grants set out in Article 1108(7)(b)\".900\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 134.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 135, referring to US DOC, Supercalendered Paper from Canada, Issues and Decision Memorandum, October 13, 2015, at 54 (**R-368**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at fn. 472; Respondent's Rejoinder, at fn. 361.\n\n434.\n\nThe Claimant has argued that GNS \"provided municipal tax breaks reducing Port Hawkesbury property taxes from $2.6 million annually to $1.3 million\"901 by way of targeted legislation.902 However, the municipal tax break does not appear in the Claimant's pre-hearing memorial, even where a list of the ensemble of contested measures is offered.903 Further, when asked by the Tribunal at the 2021 Hearing to qualify the measures at issue according to whether they constituted procurement or subsidies (or neither) under Article 1108(7), the Claimant failed to list the municipal tax measure.904\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 115, 219.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 176.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 22.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 411-417.\n\n435.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to decide whether the municipal tax reduction constituted a subsidy or grant under NAFTA Article 1108(7)(b). As such, the Tribunal will return to the municipal tax reduction under Article 1102(3) below.\n\n**(b) Claimant's argument that some of the Assistance Measures are not excluded by Article 1108(7) by virtue of the prohibition against self-contradiction**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the remaining primary argument submitted by the Claimant in relation to Article 1108(7)(b): that Canada should not be allowed to rely on the exclusion because it (allegedly) denied the existence of \"subsidies\" in other dispute settlement fora.\n\n437.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant's arguments were very brief (less than two pages) and focused on the fact that Canada allegedly reported to the WTO that Nova Scotia provided no subsidies between 2011 and 2013. It also alleged that Canada and Nova Scotia \"vigorously defended themselves and PHP against any and all subsidy allegations\" in the CVD Investigation.905 As to the legal standard to be applied, the Claimant argued that \"Canada should be estopped from reversing its position in order to obtain a benefit of the exception in Article 1108(7). Governments are not permitted to contradict themselves in search of defenses\".906\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 229.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 230.\n\n438.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent provided responses on the facts and the law, denying in particular the Claimant's argument regarding estoppel because of the absence of detrimental reliance on the part of the Claimant.907\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 235-244.\n\n439.\n\nIn its Reply, and faced with the Respondent's argument regarding the absence of detrimental reliance, the Claimant put new emphasis on the \"broader prohibition on self-contradiction\"908 and presented almost 17 pages of arguments (on the law and the facts).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 279.\n\n440.\n\nAs for investment treaty arbitration precedent, the Claimant relied on the decision of the tribunal in *Chevron*.909 In its Pre-Hearing Memorial and during the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant similarly emphasized the *Chevron* tribunal's holding on this point. At the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant cited the last two sentences of the following passage from *Chevron* at paragraph 7.106, which the Tribunal cites here is full:910\n\nApplying Article 26 of the VCLT and customary international law, the Tribunal decides that the Parties are bound to act in good faith in the exercise of their rights and the performance of their respective obligations under the Arbitration Agreement derived from Article VI of the Treaty. That duty of good faith precludes clearly inconsistent statements, deliberately made for one party's material advantage or to the other's material prejudice, that adversely affect the legitimacy of the arbitral process. In other words, no party to this arbitration can 'have it both ways' or 'blow hot and cold', to affirm a thing at one time and to deny that same thing at another time according to the mere exigencies of the moment.911\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 301.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 73; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 119:18-120:20; October 19, 2021, at 39:17-400:6.\n\n*Chevron Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador*, UNCITRAL, Second Partial Award on Track II, August 30, 2018, at para 7.106 (**CL-239**).\n\n441.\n\nThe *Chevron* tribunal, on the facts of that case, drew on the impossibility of reconciling the different statements made by the respondent, noting that the respondent's position in the arbitration was \"manifestly inconsistent\" with the \"unequivocal statements\" made by its own judicial branch.912 Ultimately, the tribunal ruled that it had jurisdiction over Chevron's claims, holding that the principle of good faith under international law and the underlying arbitration agreement required the respondent \"to treat Chevron as 'standing in the shoes' of TexPet (with Texaco), consistently with the statements made and acted upon by the [r]espondent's judicial branch in the Lago Agrio Litigation\".913 In other words, Ecuador could not successfully challenge the tribunal's jurisdiction for there being no investment, when its own courts had taken a contrary approach. As noted by the Respondent, *Chevron* is very different from the case at hand.914\n\n*Chevron Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador*, UNCITRAL, Second Partial Award on Track II, August 30, 2018, at para 7.111 (**CL-239**).\n\n*Chevron Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador*, UNCITRAL, Second Partial Award on Track II, August 30, 2018, at para 7.112 (**CL-239**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 80.\n\n442.\n\nIn the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal considers that *even if* it recognized as a matter of law the general principle against self-contradiction as argued by the Claimant, it would not find it applicable as a matter of fact. As a result, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to rule on the legal foundation that could justify the recognition of this principle in the current context. Thus, the Tribunal's analysis focuses on whether the Respondent denied the existence of \"subsidies\" in other dispute settlement fora, therefore making clearly or manifestly inconsistent statements to its advantage and to the prejudice of the Claimant in this case.\n\n443.\n\nDuring its closing argument at the 2020 Hearing and again at the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant put its best foot forward by providing three examples of \"direct evidence\" of the Respondent's alleged denial of subsidies in relation to PHP. The Respondent rebutted each example. The Tribunal addresses each example in turn.\n\ni. [REDACTED]\n-------------\n\n444.\n\nOn October 10, 2012 (shortly after the sale of the Mill came into effect), the USTR submitted a four-page list of detailed questions to Canada regarding the financial assistance provided to PHP. The questions covered a range of issues, including the loans, grants, land purchase, CRA ruling, LRR and property tax breaks.915 [REDACTED]916\n\nSee [REDACTED] **C-037**).\n\nSee [REDACTED] (**C-212**).\n\n445.\n\nThe Claimant argues that [REDACTED]917\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021; Claimant's Closing Argument, at 75; See also Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 115; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 73.\n\n446.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the USTR did not ask whether the Assistance Measures constituted subsidies; indeed, the questions do not even mention the word \"subsidy\". As such, Canada's responses cannot be equated to [REDACTED] Further, it would be surprising in this context (where the issue may be litigated) for a potential respondent to volunteer in advance which aspects of the assistance would fall under, say, the WTO SCM Agreement as prohibited \"subsidies\".\n\nii. [REDACTED]\n--------------\n\n447.\n\nThe minutes of a regular meeting of the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures dated August 5, 2013 relate exchanges notably between the US, EU, and Canada regarding the government assistance provided to PHP in Nova Scotia. The US noted its continued serious concern over the assistance package and urged Canada and GNS to re-consider their support. The EU requested information on the package. The minutes add that \"[t]he EU presumed that this scheme would be notified in Canada's 2013 new and full subsidy notification\".918\n\nSee WTO, Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Minutes of the Regular Meeting held on 22 April, 2013, August 5, 2013, WTO Doc. G/SCM/M/85, at 18 (**C-353**; **R-079**).\n\n448.\n\nIn response, Canada stated that it took the concerns seriously and referred to the public record regarding the sale of the Mill. It added that:\n\nthe Federal Government and the Government of Nova Scotia had worked with the US and the EU to resolve this issue and had already provided responses to the US government's first set of questions in November, and to a second set of questions in February. It had provided as much information as possible while respecting the business confidentiality of the information.919\n\nWTO, Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Minutes of the Regular Meeting held on 22 April, 2013, August 5, 2013, WTO Doc. G/SCM/M/85, at para 131 (**C-353**; **R-079**).\n\n449.\n\nThe Claimant characterizes Canada's above response as \"Canada's disagreement regarding the need to notify the PH measures\"920 during that meeting.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 283-284. See also Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 73.\n\n450.\n\nAgain here, the Tribunal finds that the minutes do not contain any denial by Canada regarding the provision of subsidies. Nor do the minutes include a direct answer to the EU's query. Whether the information provided by Canada constituted \"constructive notification\" as briefly alluded to by the Respondent at the 2021 Hearing does not need to be decided by the Tribunal.921 In the final analysis, compliance (or lack thereof) with an obligation to notify \"subsidies\" under a different international agreement cannot be taken as decisive under NAFTA Article 1108(7)(b).\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 489:19-20.\n\niii. Canada's WTO reporting of '*nil*' subsidies for GNS in 2013, 2015, and 2017\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nUnder Article 25 of the SCM Agreement, \"Members shall notify any subsidy as defined in paragraph 1 of Article 1, which is specific within the meaning of Article 2, granted or maintained within their territories\".922\n\nWorld Trade Organization, *Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures*, at Article 25.2(**C-367**).\n\n452.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Canada's Notifications in 2013, 2015, and 2017 indicate the word \"*nil*\" for Nova Scotia, which is an affirmative denial that subsidies were granted by GNS. The Claimant also questions the timing of Canada's submissions on the existence of subsidies in the present case (i.e. after the settlement that put an end to the US DOC proceedings).923\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 285-290.\n\n453.\n\nThe Respondent provides at least three responses, two of which are unconvincing or somewhat unsatisfactory.\n\n454.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal is not convinced by the argument that under the SCM Agreement rules notifications do not prejudge the legal status, effects or the nature of the measure under the Agreement.924 The point here is not that a notification made could be taken as an admission, but rather that a denial (i.e. \"*nil*\") could be considered as such.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 239; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 84.\n\n455.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal finds wanting the inability of the Respondent to answer questions regarding the reasons for the \"*nil*\" notification concerning Nova Scotia and the process followed to make such notifications. While the Tribunal has some sympathy for the difficulties presented by Federal States when complying with notification requirements under complex international agreements,925 the questions asked by the Tribunal at the 2020 Hearing (and followed up on at the 2021 Hearing) could not have come as a surprise to the Respondent.926\n\nAt the closing of the 2020 Hearing, the Respondent pointed the Tribunal to its Rejoinder, fn. 155 and to WTO, Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Subsidies - Replies to Questions Posed by The United States Regarding the New and Full Notification of Canada, G/SCM/Q2/CAN/62, October 31, 2014 (**R-433**).\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1245:17-1248:11; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 488:15-490:3, where the Respondent stated: \"The point is that 'nil' is not a denial of a subsidy. It's a complex procedure for a federal state to gather information from provinces and so on, and no one is saying that the reporting mechanism of the WTO is perfect by Canada or any other state\".\n\n456.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, however, the third argument presented by the Respondent suffices to undermine the impact of the \"*nil*\" notifications. As noted in the above-cited passage from Article 25 of the SCM Agreement, the notifications of subsidies are not made in the abstract. They are made in respect of definitions and requirements that are set out in detailed provisions of the SCM Agreement. A statement made by the Respondent at the 2020 Hearing encapsulates this point: \"what is said in other proceedings under different treaties, different domestic laws, different texts, different parties, different circumstances does not release the NAFTA Tribunal from its responsibility to apply the text as written\".927 The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent on this point.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 231:22-232:2.\n\n457.\n\nIn the final analysis, the following statements made by the Respondent remain uncontradicted:\n\nCanada and Nova Scotia's positions before the [DOC], as well as before the NAFTA Chapter Nineteen and WTO Panels, have been consistent. Canada and Nova Scotia did not dispute a number of the elements that led to the DOC's Final Determination that some of the measures at issue in this case were countervailable subsidies under U.S. domestic law. As for subsequent NAFTA Chapter Nineteen and WTO Proceedings, they dealt with a narrower range of issues, namely the electricity rate negotiated by NSPI and PWCC, the provision of stumpage and biomass to PHP and payments made by GNS under the Outreach Agreement. It is thus incorrect to allege that Canada's past positions are somehow contradictory to the arguments it is now making under Article 1108(7).928\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 83 [internal footnotes omitted]. See also Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 238; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 44.\n\n458.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant made a point at the 2021 Hearing that supports to some degree the Respondent's position. While discussing whether the Outreach Agreement could constitute procurement or a subsidy, the Claimant noted that: \"the Department of Commerce found the outreach agreement to be a countervailing subsidy and Canada did not challenge that finding at the WTO, and you can see that in the panel report that they have provided at R-238\".929 By implication, the Claimant appears to admit that in some instances Canada did not deny that subsidies were awarded, contrary to its own argument that the Respondent \"took every opportunity over a span of more than five years [\u2026] to expressly deny that these measures individually or collectively were a subsidy\".930\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 413:9-14.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 117-118. See also Claimant's Memorial, at para 229: \"[\u2026] but Canada and GNS vigorously defended themselves and PHP against any and all subsidies allegations, consistent with what Canada reported to the WTO\".\n\n459.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal finds that the arguments submitted by the Claimant regarding the delay in the Respondent's invocation of Article 1108(7) are also unavailing. Canada's Statement of Defence already signaled that it would claim the application of Article 1108(7) to some of the Assistance Measures: \"Any of the Nova Scotia Measures which fall within this exception (for example, the loans for working capital and productivity improvement, and the grants for worker training and marketing) are unimpeachable under Article 1102\".931 Also, there was no obligation upon the Tribunal to decide on issues relating to Article 1108(7) at the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration, as their resolution required the production of documents that had not been planned for that phase of proceedings.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defence, at paras 88-89.\n\n460.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is not persuaded, as a matter of fact and assuming *arguendo* the Claimant's \"best case\" on the law, that the Respondent made clearly or manifestly inconsistent statements regarding the existence of \"subsidies\" in other dispute settlement fora. Further, as noted above, such an analysis cannot be done in the abstract and must consider the specificities of the legal instruments under scrutiny. As a result, the Tribunal will apply the exclusion in Article 1108(7)(b) to the measures listed at Paragraphs 428 and 432 above.\n\n**B. NAFTA A****rticle** **1102(3)**\n------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n461.\n\nNAFTA Article 1102 provides that:\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.\n\n2. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.\n\n3. The treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that state or province to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.\n\n4. For greater certainty, no Party may:\n\n(a) impose on an investor of another Party a requirement that a minimum level of equity in an enterprise in the territory of the Party be held by its nationals, other than nominal qualifying shares for directors or incorporators of corporations; or\n\n(b) require an investor of another Party, by reason of its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment in the territory of the Party.932\n\nNAFTA Article 1102(1) and (2).\n\n462.\n\nNAFTA Article 1102(3) is most relevant to this case, which concerns the measures taken by a Canadian province, Nova Scotia.\n\n463.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the applicable standard of treatment under Article 1102(3), whether Canada, via GNS, breached its obligation to provide national treatment to Resolute and its investment.\n\n**2. The Claimant's Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Applicable Standard under Article 1102(3)**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n464.\n\nThe Claimant notes that *UPS v. Canada* found that a breach of Article 1102(3) is established when:\n\na. the foreign investor or its investment has been accorded treatment by a province with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments;\n\nb. the foreign investor or its investment is in like circumstances with the local investor or investment (*i.e.*, the investor or investment of the Party of which the province forms a part) that has been accorded the most favorable treatment by that province; and\n\nc. that province has treated the foreign investor or investment less favorably than it treats the investor or investment accorded the most favorable treatment.933\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 189; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 212, referring to *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits, May 24, 2007, at para 83 (**CL-113**).\n\n465.\n\nAccording to the *Pope & Talbot* tribunal:\n\n[d]ifferences in treatment will presumptively violate Article 1102(2) unless they have a reasonable nexus to rational government policies that (1) do not distinguish, on their face or *de facto*, between foreign-owned and domestic companies, and (2) do not otherwise unduly undermine the investment liberalizing objectives of NAFTA.934\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 224; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 272, citing *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001, at para 78 (**CL-114**).\n\n466.\n\nBased on the above, the Claimant submits that it is only required to establish that as a foreign national, it has received treatment less favourable that the most favourable treatment accorded to a domestic investor in like circumstances.935 It is then for the Respondent to show that the differential treatment was not nationality-based and that the measures do not undermine the objectives of NAFTA.936 The Claimant argues that the Respondent acknowledges its burden \"to justify the measures if Resolute satisfied the three-part test\".937\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 124:11-17.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 124:18-24; November 14, 2020, at 1158:15-25; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at paras 45-46; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 57:12-17, 60:11-61:6.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 60:6-10; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 370:8-13, citing Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 49.\n\n467.\n\nThe Claimant argues that NAFTA Article 1102 should be interpreted in light of NAFTA Article 102, which contains the overall purpose of the treaty, which includes the promotion of conditions of fair competition in the free trade area (as referred to in *Pope & Talbot*).938 The Claimant contests the Respondent's position that because Article 1108(7) is a carve-out to Article 1102, the latter provision cannot be interpreted in light of the general objectives of NAFTA as set out in Article 102.939\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 533:16-25.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 532:21-533:7.\n\n468.\n\nThe Claimant adds that although it has the burden of proving the three elements of the *UPS* test, it is not required to demonstrate discriminatory intent940 nor show nationality-based discrimination.941\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para 190, referring to *Bilcon v.

Relying again on *Pope & Talbot*, it adds that grounding a national treatment claim under Article 1102(3) on the foreign investor's nationality \"would tend to excuse discrimination that is not facially directed at foreign owned investments\".956 The Claimant submits that it is sufficient for it to demonstrate that GNS intended to favor its own investor, causing \"probable and foreseeable harm\" to the foreign investor; a demonstration of intent to disadvantage the foreign investment is not necessary.957\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 216.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 218; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 377:19- 24\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 228, referring to *S.D.

A provision that would allow relief for discrimination only on a nationality basis would imply that all domestic investors were treated equally.958 As the Claimant puts it, \"a province must accord to the foreign investor the 'most favorable treatment' that province has accorded to any domestic investor, regardless of how some other domestic investors may have been treated\".959 This interpretation, according to the Claimant, aligns with the object and purpose of NAFTA; if a different interpretation were adopted, there would be a \"loophole\" for sub-national protectionism adopted by a provincial or state government.960 Relying on *Pope & Talbot*, the Claimant emphasizes that \"the language of Article 1102(3) was intended simply to make clear that the obligation of a state or province was to provide investments of foreign investors with the best treatment it accords *any* investment of its country, not just the best treatment it accords to investments of *its* investors\".961\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 219.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 222.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 223.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 224, citing *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

NAFTA Article 1102(4) reads: \"For greater certainty, no Party may: (a) impose on an investor of another Party a requirement that a minimum level of equity in an enterprise in the territory of the Party be held by its nationals, other than nominal qualifying shares for directors or incorporators of corporations; or (b) require an investor of another Party, by reason of its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment in the territory of the Party\".\n\n475.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's focus on Articles 1102(1) and (2) is a distraction and is flawed.964 The Claimant disputes the Respondent's contention that the NAFTA parties \"have consistently agreed\" that Article 1102 is limited to nationality-based discrimination965 on the basis that the positions of Non-Disputing Parties presented in the context of litigation should not amount to state practice.966 The Claimant also denies the relevance of the Respondent's argument regarding subsequent practice pursuant to VCLT Article 31(3)(b),967 stating that subsequent practice, even if established, is not binding on a tribunal.968 In the Claimant's opinion, the Tribunal need not identify a subsequent practice to follow, but rather must determine how much weight to accord to any subsequent practice the NAFTA parties may have established.969 With this background, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal should disregard the Respondent's argument on subsequent practice because the NAFTA parties have not interpreted Article 1102(3) as to nationality-based discrimination970 and have not agreed to the content of the nationality-based discrimination requirement.971 The Tribunal, in the Claimant's view, should instead turn to the NAFTA Free Trade Commission (\"**FTC**\"), which is tasked with resolving any dispute that may arise with respect to the interpretation and application of NAFTA,972 as the binding authority.973\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 238-239.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 239, referring to Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 250.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 129:9-131:1; November 14, 2020, at 1165:22-1166:23.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 242, referring to Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 250; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 125:18-128:8.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 242.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 242, referring to *Mobil Investments Canada Inc. v.

The Claimant argues that *Corn Products* is unhelpful to the Respondent because the measures in that case originated from the Mexican federal government rather than a sub-national measure governed by Article 1102(3).1009\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 207.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 251.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 207.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 253, referring to Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 261.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 253, referring to Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 214-243.\n\n486.\n\nThe Claimant contests Canada's position that Resolute received no \"treatment\" under Canada's definition of \"treatment\" as being \"behavior in respect of an entity or person\".1010 According to the Claimant, the NAFTA parties chose not to define the term \"treatment\".1011 Referencing the tribunal in *UPS*,1012 the Claimant suggests that a financial gain or loss associated with a measure, such as is allegedly the case here, is sufficient to constitute treatment.1013\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 250.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 250.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 250, citing *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v.

Whether Resolute and its investments were accorded treatment in \"like circumstances\" to PWCC and PHP\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Resolute and its investments are in \"like circumstances\" to PHP because they are competitors in the same sector.1016 It argues that \"where a government measure aims squarely to discriminate in favor of one competitor in a particular economic or business sector over another, the competitors in that same sector are in 'like circumstances' for purposes of Article 1102\".1017\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 210, 215; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 255.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 210; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 256 citing *Corn Products International Inc. v.

Whether Resolute and its investments received less favorable treatment\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes its interpretation of the comparative treatment assessed under Article 1102(3), being the \"'most favorable treatment' accorded by GNS to any such competitor\" rather than treatment accorded to some competitors (which could amount to the same treatment received by Resolute).1038\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 218.\n\n497.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the most favorable treatment at issue was the Assistance Measures PWCC received from GNS, which included:\n\na $24 million forgivable loan\n\na $40 million credit facility\n\na $1.5 million workforce training grant\n\na $1 million marketing grant\n\na $38 million Outreach Grant [under the Outreach Agreement]\n\n$1.5 million in additional funding to prepare for the restart of the mill\n\n$20 million to purchase land from the mill\n\nthe ability to use tax losses to offset gains from PWCC investments outside of Nova Scotia\n\na 50% reduction on property taxes, from $2.6 million to $1.3 million\n\na 20-year forest license [FULA] that: (1) permitted PHP to harvest fiber for paper and biomass for fuel;

Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 271; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1159:9-17.\n\n502.\n\nThe Claimant submits that GNS's financial assistance to PHP was unreasonable, had a *de facto* effect on Resolute as a foreign investor and was counter-productive to NAFTA's core objective of promoting \"conditions of fair competition in the free trade area\".1051 The Claimant contends that the Respondent was \"heaping largesse\" on PHP knowing that they were creating a \"national champion\".1052 The Claimant contends that the Respondent \"ignores entirely\" the second leg of the *Pope & Talbot* test in its submissions.1053\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 226;

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent elaborates on this case further, stating that the tribunal found that \"[t]he national treatment obligation under Article 1102 is an application of the general prohibition of discrimination based on nationality, including both *de jure* and *de facto* discrimination\" and that \"Article 1102 prohibits treatment which discriminates on the basis of the foreign investor's nationality\".

The Respondent contends that the Claimant does not complain of \"actual\" treatment it received, either by GNS with respect to Bowater Mersey, or by the government of Qu\u00e9bec where its other mills are located.1088 The Respondent further argues that GNS was precluded from granting treatment to the Claimant when the latter decided not to bid on the Mill.1089 So too was NSPI, whose reach did not extend beyond Nova Scotia's jurisdiction, and Richmond County, who could not negotiate a tax rate with a company operating outside its territory.1090\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 258; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 47.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 259.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 259.\n\n515.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant at the 2021 Hearing appeared to be contesting anticompetitive effects, and argues that anticompetitive effects are not national treatment claims.1091\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 493:7-14.\n\n516.\n\nThe Respondent also disputes the Claimant's argument that NAFTA tribunals have considered practical effects of measures as treatment under Article 1102.1092 The Respondent notes that the cases cited by the Claimant involved treatment as defined by the Respondent, rather than simply adverse effects.1093 In particular, the Respondent notes that *Corn Products*, *ADM*, and *Cargill*, which are relied upon by the Claimant for its definition of treatment, can be distinguished because the claimants in those cases had made investments in Mexico, the jurisdiction that imposed the tax measures at issue.1094 The Respondent notes that, by contrast, the Claimant has no SC Paper investment in Nova Scotia.1095 As the Respondent puts it, \"[t]he Claimant has not cited a single case in which a national treatment claim was allowed when the investor or its investment was not in some way subject to the authority of the government 'according treatment' or the investor did not have an investment in the relevant jurisdiction\".1096\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 260; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, 243:15-22.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 260; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 106, referring to *United Parcel Service of America Inc. v.

Whether Resolute and its investments were accorded treatment in \"like circumstances\" to PWCC and PHP\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's analysis with respect to the term \"like circumstances\". The Respondent argues that rather than focusing on the circumstances of the Claimant and its investment, the analysis should instead center on the circumstances in which the treatment was accorded.1100 The Respondent supports its argument by citing *Mercer*, in which the tribunal found that the \"like circumstances\" consideration concerned the treatment, rather than the investors or investments.1101 The Respondent therefore argues that a competitive relationship is insufficient to satisfy the \"in like circumstances\" requirement; an investor must establish that the *treatment* accorded to those investments was \"in like circumstances\" such that all of the relevant context and circumstances in which the treatment is accorded are taken into account including public policy objectives.1102\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 265 [Respondent's emphasis removed].

According to the Respondent, public policy may justify differential treatment by demonstrating that the treatment in question bears a \"reasonable relationship to rational policies not motivated by preference of domestic over foreign owned investments\".1108 The Respondent opines that GNS's motives behind its financial assistance to PHP and PWCC were not protectionist in nature\u2014rather, they helped achieve \"a number of legitimate public policy objectives\".1109 The Respondent notes that international law usually extends a high level of deference to the rights of a domestic government to regulate matters within its borders.1110\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 269, citing *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Whether Resolute and its investments received less favorable treatment\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n523.\n\nShould the Tribunal find that GNS accorded Resolute \"treatment\" and that such treatment was accorded in \"like circumstances\" to those of PHP, the Respondent argues that Resolute and its investments were not accorded less favorable treatment than PHP.\n\n524.\n\nIn response to what the Claimant alleges,1115 the Respondent submits that Resolute did not receive similar financial assistance from GNS simply because its investments were outside the province. GNS has no Crown land in Qu\u00e9bec and it could not reimburse Resolute for services to maintain roads and forests on land owned by others in a different province. Further, GNS could not implement renewable energy regulations that apply to Resolute or offer Resolute relief from municipal taxes.1116 Moreover, the Respondent submits that NSPI (which GNS does not own or control) cannot supply electricity to the Claimant's mills in Qu\u00e9bec, noting in any event that Resolute's mills in Qu\u00e9bec pay less for electricity than PHP.1117\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 274, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at para 220.

The Non-Disputing Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Submissions of the United States and Mexico**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n528.\n\nThe Non-Disputing Parties agree with the Respondent's submission that Article 1102 in its entirety protects against discrimination based on nationality.1125\n\nUnited States Submission, at para 4; Mexico Submission, at para 3.\n\n529.\n\nWith respect to Article 1102(3), the Non-Disputing Parties agree that where a state or province accords different treatment to in-state or in-province investors or their investments as compared to domestic out-of-state or out-of-province investors or their investments, investors from another NAFTA party in like circumstances, or their investments, are entitled to receive the better of the treatment accorded by that state or province.1126 Mexico explains that the obligation of treatment in Article 1102(3) does not modify the purpose of Article 1102, which is to prohibit discrimination on the basis of nationality because nationality must still form the basis of the least favourable treatment for Article 1102 to be breached.1127 Mexico agrees with the Respondent that:\n\n[I]n a situation where a Canadian province (for instance, Nova Scotia) would treat more favorably investors from another Canadian province (for instance, British Columbia) than its own local investors, a foreign investor from another NAFTA Party could still bring a claim alleging a breach of Article 1102 based on the fact that it did not receive the treatment accorded by Nova Scotia to investors from British Columbia. There would still be a nationality element to such a claim.1128\n\nUnited States Submission, at para 11, referring to North American Free Trade Agreement, Implementation Act, Statement of Administrative Action, H.R.

The Claimant argues that governments' defenses are not the law itself.1151 The Claimant explains that even if the alleged consensus of the Non-Disputing Parties was probative, its weight would be limited because: (i) the NAFTA parties did not agree on the requirements of nationality-based discrimination specific to Article 1102(3) claims; and (ii) the NAFTA parties have not agreed on what constitutes nationality-based discrimination more broadly.1152 The Claimant concludes that even if the alleged consensus of the Non-Disputing Parties on the interpretation of Article 1102(3) constitutes subsequent practice pursuant to the VCLT, they would be \"but one factor\" under the VCLT.1153\n\nClaimant's Reply to Article 1128 Submissions, at para 9, referring to United States Submission, at para 5, and Mexico Submission, at paras 9-15.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n540.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's conclusions on attribution (especially the non-attribution to GNS of the LRR) and on Article 1108(7) derogations, the Tribunal proceeds to the Article 1102(3) analysis in relation to the following remaining measures:\n\n\u2022 The RES Regulations Issue and the Biomass Plant Issue\n\n\u2022 The stumpage (fee) regulation aspect of the FULA\n\n\u2022 The employee pension protection act and regulations\n\n\u2022 The municipal property taxation\n\n541.\n\nThe heart of the Claimant's case is that GNS adopted an \"indivisible ensemble of coordinated measures\" to the benefit of PHP that breached NAFTA Chapter 11.1166 The Claimant argues that PWCC asked for and got everything it wanted: \"Port Hawkesbury would not have emerged as North America's low-cost producer without all of [the measures]. They all played their part\".1167 As the Tribunal concluded earlier, however, determinations on matters of attribution and specific exclusions from NAFTA Chapter 11 disciplines (as in Article 1108(7)) have to proceed on a disaggregated basis.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 123:15-24; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 163:2-16.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 29:7-9.\n\n542.\n\nYet, when considering the breach of substantive obligations, it is open to the Tribunal to consider the impact of measures taken together (as noted at Paragraph 293 on attribution). Indeed, some international investment law concepts, such as \"creeping expropriation\", are by definition dependent on the existence of a series of measures that have an effect equivalent to that of a direct expropriation.\n\n543.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant's Article 1102(3) claim faces considerable difficulties in relation to its \"ensemble approach\" to breach and its arguments on the role of nationality to breach. Both elements in turn having an impact on the interpretation of \"treatment\" and treatment accorded \"in like circumstances\". The Tribunal will analyze these difficulties in the context of the NAFTA Article 1102 legal framework first, before turning to the application of the law to the remaining measures at issue.\n\n**(a) The Article 1102 framework and difficulties with the Claimant's arguments**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nFirst, the Claimant's case builds on a list (or ensemble) of at least 15 alleged GNS Assistance Measures constituting an extraordinary assistance package to PHP.1168 As a result of the Tribunal's analysis thus far, however, only a few, somewhat disparate measures remain to be analyzed under Article 1102(3). Asked by a member of the Tribunal at the 2021 Hearing what the impact on its claim would be if some of the alleged measures were excluded as a matter of attribution or under Article 1108(7) and, as a result, only one or two were to remain, the Claimant responded that its claim stood, undisturbed; that each measure was essential to the restart of Port Hawkesbury. The Claimant argued that:\n\nThe record is clear. That PWCC was going to walk away unless it got everything it wanted. And, therefore, we say the Article 1102 analysis precedes [sic] even with the remaining measures and it is essentially unaffected by it because our definition of treatment is the adoption of a policy by the government to favour its own investor in a way that can only be achieved with a foreseeable negative impact on the foreign investor. And we say that even with one or two remaining measures, the policy is still a fact.1169\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, Claimant's Opening Argument, at 81.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 402:14-25.\n\n545.\n\nPutting aside for now the issue of accuracy to the record and the definition of \"treatment\" under Article 1102(3), the Tribunal cannot accept that labelling individual measures as being part of a \"policy\" allows the analysis to proceed undisturbed. This would render meaningless the conclusions reached by the Tribunal on attribution and on the Article 1108(7) exclusions. Rather, the Tribunal will proceed to a measure-by-measure analysis. Of course, the Tribunal could recognize, after scrutinizing the remaining measures, a pattern of discrimination that would run afoul of Article 1102(3) (or a pattern of unfair and inequitable treatment that would breach Article 1105), but labels are no substitute for analysis.\n\n546.\n\nSecond, the affirmed and widely recognized aim of NAFTA Article 1102 is to prevent nationality-based discrimination. This aim has been consistently affirmed for many years by the three NAFTA parties, including in the current case.1170 Numerous NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals have also interpreted and applied Article 1102 as such.1171 It should be stressed, however, that a claimant does not have to provide proof positive of discriminatory intent to prevail in a claim under Article 1102. This is agreed to by the Parties to this case1172 as well as by the United States and Mexico.1173 As held by past tribunals, in some cases, short of a smoking-gun, such proof of discriminatory intent may be impossible to provide.1174 That being said, *nationality*-based discrimination is still at the heart of NAFTA Article 1102 (including its paragraph 3).1175 Thus, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimant when it asserts that: \"Even if Canada were to convince the Tribunal that the Nova Scotia Measures were neutral as to nationality, they cannot pass the second part of the *Pope & Talbot* test as 'not otherwise unduly undermin[ing] the investment liberalizing objectives of NAFTA'\".1176 Indeed, if the Tribunal were to find that the GNS \"policy decision was neutral from a nationality perspective\",1177 meaning that it had nothing to do with the nationality of the Claimant, then it could not conclude that there is a breach of NAFTA Article 1102(3).\n\nSee the list of submissions in Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 250; see United States Submission, at paras 4-5, Mexico Submission, at para 3.

In other cases, the tribunals were less direct in their statements, but still relied on the concept of nationality-based discrimination. For instance, see *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001, at para 79 (**CL-114**). There are also issues regarding the identification of a government's \"intent\". See e.g. *Corn Products International Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/01, Decision on Responsibility, January 15, 2008, at para 137 (**CL-107**).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the aim of Article 1102(3) is no different than the rest of the article: paragraph 3 confirms the meaning of the provision in the case a province or state is providing treatment. The explicit reference in paragraph 4(b) to requiring disposal of an investment by a foreign investor \"by reason of its nationality\" reinforces this interpretation as opposed to undermining it (as argued in the Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 221-222 & 225). The paragraph opens with the indication \"for greater clarity\", which leaves, in the Tribunal's view, no doubt.\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 66.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 108:8-12.\n\n547.\n\nThis Tribunal is of the view that the so-called \"second-part\" of the test cannot stand alone. The *Pope & Talbot* tribunal itself stated that the \"latter test will rarely apply and [that it did] not think it useful [\u2026] to speculate on the kind of fact situations that would bring it into play. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that the fundamental purposes of NAFTA, as expressed in Article 102, may need to supplement the former test\".1178 As a matter of fact, the two tribunals that refer to this dictum, in *Feldman* and *Bilcon*, did so without much or any analysis and in each case, the tribunal had concluded *first* that the respondent State had *not* provided sufficient justifications for the measures to account for the less favorable treatment of the foreign investor.1179 (Further analysis on the justification point is conducted by the Tribunal below under treatment accorded \"in like circumstances\").\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001, at para 78, fn. 74 (**CL-114**).\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. The United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, December 16, 2002, at paras 182-184 (**RL-021**); *Bilcon v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2009-04, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, March 17, 2015, at para 724 (**RL-025**).\n\n548.\n\nThird, and because of the first two difficulties, the definition provided by the Claimant of the concept of \"treatment\" in Article 1102(3) raises significant issues. In many NAFTA Chapter 11 cases, \"treatment\" of the investor by the government is not an issue and often tribunals dispense with its analysis (independently of \"in like circumstances\"). But in this case, a key question is whether GNS accorded \"treatment\" to Resolute and its investments in the province of Qu\u00e9bec. In its Jurisdiction Decision on, the Tribunal already analyzed aspects of this question under Article 1102(3), but also made relevant holdings under Article 1101(1).\n\n549.\n\nAs a reminder, in its Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal first had to determine whether GNS adopted or maintained \"measures\" \"relating to\" Resolute and its investments in Qu\u00e9bec under NAFTA Article 1101(1). Taking at face value the facts as argued by the Claimant (including the existence of a five-company, saturated SC Paper market), the Tribunal concluded that the GNS Assistance Measures were sufficiently proximate to the Claimant and its investments to satisfy the \"relating to\" requirement of Article 1101.1180 The Tribunal regarded the case as \"close to the line\", but on balance gave the benefit of the doubt to the Claimant.1181 In its analysis, the Tribunal noted that \"a measure which adversely affected the claimant in a tangential or merely consequential way will not suffice\"1182 to establish a relationship of apparent proximity under Article 1101(1).\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at paras 246-248.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 248.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 242.\n\n550.\n\nTurning to Article 1102(3) as a matter of admissibility, the Tribunal had to determine whether a NAFTA investor or its investment must already be present or intend to be present in the province for the Article to apply. The Tribunal decided in the negative, giving as an example two scenarios where an out-of-province investor (or its investment) could receive \"treatment\" by a province: one was the adoption of protective measures to the benefit of local investors while effectively keeping NAFTA investors (or their investments) out; another was a *Methanex*-type scenario where the out-of-province investor had been the specific target of a provincial campaign to cause it loss.1183 The Tribunal added: \"While the Claimant does not suggest that it was specifically targeted by the Nova Scotia measures, it is open to it to establish on the merits a breach of Article 1102 on some other basis\".1184 In its reasoning, the Tribunal stated that it agreed \"with the NAFTA Parties that Article 1102(3) should not be read so as to impose, vis-\u00e0-vis foreign investments, a requirement of uniformity of treatment by the different component units of the three federal States which are Parties to NAFTA\".1185 The Tribunal added that it agreed with the tribunal in *Merrill & Ring* that Article 1102(3) only applies to \"the same regulatory measures under the same jurisdictional authority\".1186 The latter holding will prove determinative in the present case.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 290.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 290.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 290.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 290; see *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/07/1, Award, March 31, 2010, at paras 26-28 (**CL-101**).\n\n551.\n\nOne of the difficulties with the Claimant's Article 1102(3) case on the merits is that it relies on an economic approach to define \"treatment\" more so than a legal one. This approach reflects the \"ensemble\" or policy-based approach used more generally. At the 2020 and 2021 Hearings, the Claimant provided the following definition of treatment: \"a government accords treatment to a foreign investor or its investment where it adopts a policy favouring its own investor or investment whose objectives can only be achieved when it produces an effect on the foreign investor or its investment\".1187\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1176:18-23; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, Claimant's Opening Argument, at 38; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 62:19-63:6; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 51.\n\n552.\n\nThe Claimant had previously built its \"treatment\" case on \"effect\", relying on the expert testimony of Dr. Kaplan,1188 an economist who employed a comparative static framework to compare market equilibria with and without PHP's re-entry.1189 Dr. Kaplan concluded that:\n\nThe Port Hawkesbury SCP mill was restarted only because it received a benefits package that assured the new owner it would be [REDACTED] The mill's full re-entry in 2013 added significant capacity to the North American SCP market. Given the conditions of competition for SCP \u2013 [\u2026] \u2013 the significant increase in SCP supply from PHP depressed SCP prices below the levels that would have otherwise occurred. As a consequence, and directly attributable to the benefits package that enabled PHP to fully re-enter the market, Resolute suffered lost profits through lower prices and lower shipments than it otherwise would have enjoyed. This is the simplest of economic stories: \"but for\" the increased SCP supply from PHP, Resolute's SCP operations would have experienced higher prices and shipments, and enjoyed a concomitant increase in profits.1190\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 194-203; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 244-250.\n\nExpert Witness Report of Seth T. Kaplan, Ph.D., December 28, 2018, at para 17; Reply Expert Witness Report of Seth T. Kaplan, Ph.D., December 6, 2019, at para 5.\n\nExpert Witness Report of Seth Kaplan, Ph.D., December 28, 2018, at para 17 [internal footnotes omitted].\n\n553.\n\nHaving relied on a \"but for\" framework of analysis focused on the Port Hawkesbury Mill's *re-entry* into the SC Paper market, and not on the GNS Assistance Measures themselves, the Claimant fails to address the legal question to be determined by the Tribunal at this juncture: whether GNS\u2014by adopting the remaining measures at issue\u2014accorded \"treatment\" to Resolute and its investments in the province of Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n554.\n\nWhile the Tribunal, taking the Claimant's case at face value, concluded at the jurisdictional phase that the assistance measures met the \"relating to\" requirement of Article 1101(1), it does not mean that the measures meet the \"treatment\" requirement of Article 1102(3).1191 To argue, as the Claimant does, that the facts relied upon by the Tribunal in its reasoning under Article 1101 are also evidence of treatment under Article 1102(3) falls short in this case.1192 Furthermore, as also noted by the Tribunal in its Jurisdiction Decision, \"a measure which adversely affected the claimant in a tangential or merely consequential way\" will not suffice to meet the requirement of Article 1101(1).1193 Therefore, such a measure would not meet the requirement of \"treatment\" at Article 1102(3) either. Reading Article 1102(3) informed by the gateway of Article 1101 and the definitions at Article 201 provides the right framework of analysis for the Tribunal. NAFTA Chapter 11 applies to \"measures\", defined broadly as including \"any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice\" adopted (or maintained) by a Party.1194 Thus, when Article 1102 obliges NAFTA parties to \"accord\" investors of another party (or their investments) \"treatment\" exempt from nationality-based discrimination, it disciplines the measures adopted.\n\nAs held in *Methanex Corp. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, August 3, 2005 (**RL-054**), a favorable finding under Article 1101 does not prejudge the outcome of the interpretation of \"treatment\" under Article 1102 (see Part IV, Ch B, p. 1, para 1).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 245-247.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 242.\n\nNAFTA Chapter 2, Article 201 (Definitions of General Application).\n\n555.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the definition of \"treatment\" provided by the Claimant, with its emphasis on a government policy to favor a domestic in-province investor and its effects outside the province, is at odds with the above framework of analysis.1195 As a general matter, arguments based on sole \"adverse effect\" or \"detrimental effect\" on a foreign investor operating in a different province than the one adopting the \"measures\" (and as a result not subject to that province's jurisdiction) cannot be accepted without more. Indeed, such arguments could lead to a breach of NAFTA Article 1102(3) without the relevant government even knowing that foreign investors are impacted. This goes against the aim of Article 1102 to prevent nationality-based discrimination and would make government regulation impossible without creating (unlimited) liability for damages. In other words, simply \"affecting adversely\" a foreign national (not subject to the province's jurisdiction), cannot be the standard for \"treatment\" under Article 1102(3).\n\nThe Claimant relied on the Mexican sweetener cases in support of the proposition that: \"In determining what constitutes 'treatment,' NAFTA Tribunals have looked beyond the individual impugned measures in order to assess the practical effect of those measures on affected competitors\". (e.g. Claimant's Memorial, at para 204) However, the *ADM*, *CPI* and *Cargill* awards were decided in circumstances much different than the current ones and as a result should be differentiated. In all cases, the tribunals recognized that nationality-based discrimination was present and that the very design of the IEPS Tax was to bring pressure on the United States government. *Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v. The United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/04/5, Award, November 21, 2007, at para 208 (**RL-092**); *Corn Products International Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/01, Decision on Responsibility, January 15, 2008, at para 137 (**CL-107**); *Cargill, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, September 18, 2009, at para 209 (**RL-050**). For instance, under the heading \"discriminatory treatment\", the *ADM* (**RL-092**, at para 209) tribunal noted \"In the present case, both the intent and effects of the Tax show the discriminatory nature of the measure\". The tribunal noted elsewhere that the Tax targeted the HFCS industry, largely owned by US investors (**RL-092**, at para 212). Under its analysis of \"treatment no less favorable\", the *Cargill* (**RL-050**, at para 220) tribunal similarly concluded that: \"the discrimination was based on nationality both in intent and effect\". The *CPI* (**CL-107**, at para 137) tribunal also held that because Mexico put forward a countermeasure defense, this fact amounted to a recognition that \"HFCS producers and suppliers were targeted, in part at least, because of the extent of their links to the United States\". This fact was also relevant to the \"less favorable treatment\" part of the rest, as the tribunal held: \"It demonstrates an intention on the part of Mexico to treat CPI differently because of its nationality\" (**CL-107**, at para 138). The Respondent has also noted that in the sweetener cases, all the investors had investments in Mexico, the jurisdiction responsible for the measures. See e.g. Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 261.\n\n556.\n\nIn this instance, the Claimant makes a more refined case, arguing first that \"treatment\" just requires probable and foreseeable harm to Resolute; and alternatively, that even if effects on Resolute had to be known to GNS, they were as a matter of fact. In sum, the Claimant argues the following:\n\nAgain, the test for treatment is not meant to capture mere incidental effects, but rather, probable and foreseeable harm. Here, we more than satisfy the test for treatment.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nTo break this down further, [REDACTED]1196\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 65:16-67:6.\n\n557.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal's focus in defining \"treatment\" is *not* on the alleged anti-competitive policy of GNS nor on its effects (probable and foreseeable or most likely to occur), but on the remaining measures at issue, which the Tribunal will turn to below.\n\n558.\n\nThe final difficulty facing the Claimant's case relates to the analysis of treatment \"in like circumstances\" in the framework of Article 1102(3). Relying on past cases, both Parties argued for an analysis of all relevant circumstances in which the treatment was accorded.1197 The Tribunal agrees with this approach. Under NAFTA Chapter 11, a claimant will typically first attempt to provide evidence that it is in the same business sector or in competition with a domestic investor of the defending party that benefits from more favorable treatment, i.e. the comparator. In the present case, the Tribunal does not have much difficulty concluding that at least one of Resolute's mills and the PHP Mill were in a competitive relationship (to a more or less high degree).1198 However, the analysis does not stop there. The Tribunal considers that the identity of the legal and regulatory framework applicable can be highly relevant, as held by many other NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals.\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, Claimant's Closing Argument on Article 1102, at p 7; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 59; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 266-269; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 110-112; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 246:15-22.\n\nMuch evidence was presented on the degree of competition that existed between Resolute and PHP: was it mostly direct or indirect (because of the grades and quality of SC Paper produced), how much grade substitution was there in the market and its impact, etc., but in the end, the Tribunal does not need to resolve these issues.\n\n559.\n\nCiting the tribunals in *ADF*, *Pope & Talbot*, *Feldman*, *Methanex* and *UPS*, the tribunal in *Grand River* held that \"[t]he reasoning of these cases shows the identity of the legal regime(s) applicable to a claimant and its purported comparators to be a compelling factor in assessing whether like is indeed being compared to like for purposes of Articles 1102 and 1103\".1199 Relying on this approach, the *Apotex* tribunal similarly found that in circumstances where the proposed comparators were in the same sector as the claimants, sold like products and were direct competitors, \"the question of whether the Claimants and their investments were subject to the same legal regime or regulatory requirements [\u2026] becomes an important potential differentiator\".1200\n\n*Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award, January 12, 2011, at paras 166-167 (**RL-019**).\n\n*Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, August 25, 2014, at paras 8.43, 8.53 (**RL-051**).\n\n560.\n\nFrom the beginning of the proceedings, the Claimant has contested the description or label that the present case is a \"regulatory\" one.1201 Yet, the Claimant has acknowledged the relevance of the \"jurisdictional factor\" as well as the \"implementation factor\" to the like circumstances analysis. At the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant listed relevant factors before providing its reading of the situation:\n\nAlso important is the jurisdictional factor. Is it relevant that the foreign and domestic investor are located in the same jurisdiction? This is important in certain cases, notably where a complainant is complaining about a regulatory measure of general application. [\u2026] And then, finally, this brings up the related implementation factor. [\u2026] Are the measures a law or regulation of general application in the territory, or are they measures targeted and specific in scope or effect?1202\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para 204; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 15, 2017, at 398:14-20; see also Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 260.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 89:18-90:13; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 59.\n\n561.\n\nFurther, the Claimant submitted that:\n\n[\u2026] it does not matter that the relevant Quebec mills were not in Nova Scotia. Since Nova Scotia's main policy goal was to ensure Port Hawkesbury's long-term success by making it a national champion in the SC market -- in the market for SC paper, a goal it achieved through a combination of targeted and specific regulatory and spending measures whose main objective was to make Port Hawkesbury the lowest-cost producer of the relevant products.1203\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 93:16-25; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 60.\n\n562.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimant's attempt to draw a strict distinction between, on the one hand, regulatory measures of \"general application\" and, on the other hand, \"targeted and specific\" regulatory measures is unconvincing. Resolute's own experience in the province of Nova Scotia, where it was operating the Bowater Mersey Mill and in particular when it received financial and other forms of assistance from the province to reduce its costs, demonstrates that the application of a general program, such as the Nova Scotia Jobs Fund or the Large Land Purchase Program, to a specific company does not change its nature. More to the point is the example of the FULA. [REDACTED]1204 In other words, the regulatory licensing regime required the signature of individual licences, but the regime itself was not \"targeted and specific\" to any one company. Thus, the Tribunal does not follow the Claimant's argument that each and every measure constituting the \"ensemble\" of measures complained of had a \"scope of application\" limited to \"PHP only\" and did not apply \"across Nova Scotia\".1205 Many of the measures could have applied and did apply to other companies, including Resolute's own Bowater Mersey.\n\n[REDACTED] (**R-149**).\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, Claimant's Opening Argument, at 70; see also Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 97:3-9.\n\n563.\n\nYet, the Tribunal is cognizant that the Claimant's case is not that Bowater Mersey and PHP received treatment \"in like circumstances\", but that Resolute's mills in Qu\u00e9bec producing SC Paper are the proper comparator.1206 As will be analyzed further in the next section, however, most of the measures that remain at issue under Article 1102(3) are of a regulatory nature and whether the Claimant was subjected to or could have benefited from (as the case may be) such measures is relevant to the comparison of circumstances in which the treatment was accorded. In sum, the Tribunal does not follow the Claimant's argument that \"it does not matter that the relevant Quebec mills were not in Nova Scotia\".1207\n\nClaimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 60; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 90:25-91:6.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 93:16-25; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 60.\n\n564.\n\nThis leads the Tribunal to the impact, on the treatment \"in like circumstances\" analysis, of Resolute's decision not to submit a bid for the Port Hawkesbury Mill. At the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant submitted the following: \"That Resolute was a potential bidder for Port Hawkesbury just reinforces the like circumstances analysis. It was a player in this market and in this product but because it was, it had no interest in being part of a scheme that would cannibalize its own sales through price erosion\".1208 The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument, as a matter of fact or law.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 94:10-16; to the same effect, see Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 355:2-356:1.\n\n565.\n\n[REDACTED]1209 [REDACTED]1210 [REDACTED].1211 [REDACTED]\".1212 In sum, as was confirmed by the Claimant at the 2021 Hearing, Resolute considered financial assistance by GNS as part of its decision on whether to bid for the Mill:\n\nAnd obviously if you're in this market, you understand that you could get some government support, [REDACTED]\n\nAnd this claim is all about the extent of the support. I mean that's the nature of our complaint. [\u2026] But I think the evidence from the bidders shows that most of the bidders, in thinking about what the government would likely do in a reasonable scenario, would simply not be sufficient. And so they walked away.1213\n\nSee [REDACTED] August 11, 2011, at RFP0004991 (**C-109**).\n\nSee [REDACTED] September 2011 (**R- 359**).\n\nSee [REDACTED] September 26, 2011 (**C-118**); [REDACTED] September 26, 2011 (**C-119**).\n\n[REDACTED] September 26, 2011 at RFP0011526 (**C-119**).\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 362:1-18.\n\n566.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n567.\n\nAs a matter of law, the fact that Resolute was a potential bidder for the Mill does not \"reinforce\" the like circumstances analysis, rather, it is to the contrary. In the Tribunal's view, what matters in the end is that Resolute was repeatedly encouraged to submit a bid but chose not to. In doing so, it closed itself from the possibility of purchasing the Mill and of negotiating with GNS for some assistance measures, financial or regulatory in nature. At the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant confirmed its claim was not about being excluded from bidding or from the province, but rather about the allegedly \"anti-competitive\" measures that GNS adopted.1214 But this is not what treatment in \"like circumstances\" is about \u2013 nor the Article 1102 discipline for that matter. The Claimant has not provided any evidence either that GNS would not have been open (as a matter of nationality or otherwise) to provide Resolute financial assistance if it had been the bid winner. On this point, the witness statement of Mr. Montgomery stands:\n\nHad Resolute submitted a bid to purchase the mill within the deadlines set by the Monitor (which I had encouraged Resolute to do) and had the Monitor selected Resolute as a qualified bidder, I can confirm that the GNS would have been ready to discuss reasonable requests for financial assistance, just as we did with PWCC and Paper Excellence once they were chosen by the Monitor. Resolute had direct access to me and other senior government officials at the time the Monitor was seeking bidders for the Port Hawkesbury mill and it could have made inquiries as to government support if it wanted. I believe the December 2011 financial support of Resolute's Bowater Mersey mill by the GNS demonstrates that the Province was willing to engage constructively and in good faith with respect to reasonable requests for financial assistance.1215\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 355:18-23.\n\nWitness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, April 17, 2019, at para 24.\n\n568.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider the question of treatment accorded \"in like circumstances\" further when analysing each of the remaining measures below.\n\n**(b) The Application of Article 1102 to the remaining measures at issue**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n569.\n\nHaving laid out several difficulties raised by the Claimant's arguments in general, the Tribunal now turns to the more specific application of Article 1102(3) to the remaining measures at issue. While both Parties generally agree on the three-part *UPS* test1216 and on the *Pope & Talbot* approach to the \"like circumstances\" analysis,1217 they disagree on the question of burden of proof and the role played by nationality. According to the Claimant, \"[t]he proper approach to Article 1102 proceeds through 2 stages: a. Has the claimant investor discharged its burden of establishing *prima facie* differential treatment in like circumstances? b. If so, has the respondent State discharged its burden of justifying the differential treatment?\"1218 For the Respondent, following the holding in *UPS*, the burden \"never shifts\".1219 The United States and Mexico agree with Canada on this point.1220 However, the Respondent seemed to admit that it is for governments to provide an explanation of reasons or evidence to establish a \"reasonable nexus to rational government policies\" if that is their case.1221\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 189-190; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 212; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 246.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 212, 224-226; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 272; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 269; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 112.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, Claimant's Opening Argument, at 35; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 45.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 248.\n\nMexico Submission, at fn. 4; United States Submission, at para 3.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1261:19-1263:16.\n\n570.\n\nOn this point, the Tribunal finds it is useful to draw the difference between \"legal burden of proof\" and \"evidential burden\". As held in *Mercer*, \"[t]he Tribunal agrees with these Article 1128 submissions [that the burden does not shift]. However, the Tribunal must also take account of the distinction between the legal burden of proof (which never shifts) and the evidential burden of proof (which can shift from one party to another, depending upon the state of the evidence). Moreover, every party bears the burden of proving its positive allegations, whether claimant or respondent\".1222\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at para 7.14 (**RL-122**). See also *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, August 25, 2014, at para 8.8 (citing to *Pulp Mills* and *Feldman*) (**RL-051**).\n\n571.\n\nIn response to a question from the Tribunal at the 2020 Hearing, the Respondent appeared to agree on this distinction, while qualifying its position:\n\n[\u2026] if there is, you know, a reasonable nexus to rational government policies, well, obviously, that is for the government to come forward and say there are reason -- there was a reasonable nexus to rational government policies. If the government doesn't want to put forward that kind of explanation, well, that's its choice. But the burden of proving that there has to be some kind of a nationality basis on which the discrimination is occurring, that has to be the burden on the claimant because then otherwise, again, any measure which impacts a foreign investor in more than a tangential way, negatively, will then presumptively violate the, violate the provision.1223\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1263:3-16.\n\n572.\n\nThe distinction (legal vs. evidential burden) is also in line with this Tribunal's holding in its Jurisdiction Decision:\n\nThe Tribunal would however add that too much importance should not be attached to the onus of proof in international arbitration. In the end, the question is whether one or the other party has done enough to persuade the tribunal of its case. It is relevant that the fact in question is one which is peculiarly within the knowledge of one or the other party.1224\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 86.\n\n573.\n\nThe Tribunal will take as a starting point that, to meet its burden of proving nationality-based discrimination, it is not sufficient for the Claimant to demonstrate that the GNS Assistance Measures had an adverse effect on Resolute's Mills in Qu\u00e9bec without more (as discussed above at Paragraph 546). Put differently, it is not enough that Resolute: \"just happened to be the only foreign participant with an investment in Canada, so [it] qualified for protection under NAFTA\".1225\n\nSee Hearing on Jurisdiction, August 15, 2017, at 88:19-89:4. The substance of this statement made during the jurisdiction phase of this arbitration was confirmed at the 2021 Hearing, see Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 373:25-374:16, 378:2-22. Similarly, see also Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, Claimant's Opening Argument, at 35.\n\n574.\n\nThus, since the Claimant has confirmed that its claim under Article 1102(3) stood even if only a limited number of measures are under scrutiny, the Tribunal will apply the test as suggested by the Claimant to the measures at issue, starting with the following question: Has Resolute discharged its burden of establishing *prima facie* differential treatment in like circumstances in this case?\n\n575.\n\nAs to the ultimate way to distinguish between *nationality*-based discrimination and other differences in treatment that do not relate to nationality, the Tribunal will follow the approach adopted by many other NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals which have relied on the concept of treatment accorded \"in like circumstances\" for this purpose. The tribunals had recourse to a proxy: for instance, the *Pope & Talbot* tribunal looked for \"a reasonable nexus to rational government policies\",1226 the *SD Myers* tribunal for \"legitimate public policy measures that are pursued in a reasonable manner\",1227 the *Feldman* tribunal for \"a rational justification\" or reasonable distinction,1228 the *GAMI* tribunal for \"a plausible connection with a legitimate goal of policy\",1229 the *Cargill* tribunal searched for a link between the alleged difference and the \"rationale and objective of the measure in question\".1230 While the tribunals have varied in their formulations, the bottom line is the same. Using the *Pope & Talbot* formulation as an illustration: a tribunal will conclude the less favorable treatment proven *prima facie* by the Claimant was not provided \"in like circumstances\" where the Respondent can provide evidence that the differences in treatment have a \"reasonable nexus to rational government policies\" that do not distinguish on their face or *de facto* between foreign and domestic investors or investments.1231 Conversely, if the Respondent cannot provide such evidence, the tribunal will assume that nationality was the reason for the differential treatment (see e.g. *Feldman*).1232\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001, at paras 78-79 (**CL-114**). See also *Mercer*, endorsing *Cargill* on this point: \"Thus, in both *GAMI* and *Pope & Talbot*, 'like circumstances' was determined by reference to the rationale for the measure that was being challenged. It was not a determination of 'like circumstances' in the abstract. The distinction between those affected by the measure and those who were not affected by the measure could be understood in light of the rationale for the measure and its policy objective. Indeed, it is possible that in respect of other, different measures, the mills in *GAMI* and the lumber producers in *Pope & Talbot* could have been found in 'like circumstances'\". *Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at para 7.20 (**RL-122**), citing *Cargill, Inc. v.

United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, December 16, 2002, at paras 180-182 (**RL-021**).\n\n576.\n\nIn this framework, the Tribunal wishes to stress that the point of the \"like circumstances\" analysis at Article 1102 is not to judge the substantive merit of the Respondent's measures (for instance, telling a Respondent the government could have provided different kinds of support to its industry, etc.). In *Mercer,* similarly looking into \"like circumstances\", the Tribunal stated that it \"accepts as a general legal principle, in the absence of bad faith that a measure of deference is owed to a State's regulatory policies\".1233 In sum, the point of the analysis is to allow the Tribunal to ascertain whether a less favorable treatment accorded to an investor/investment from another Party was provided by reason of the Claimant's nationality (or not). And that is why previous tribunals have focused on \"nexus\", \"connection\", or links between the differential treatment and the objectives that are rational or legitimate (and not on the policies in and of themselves).1234\n\n*Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018, at para 7.41-7.42 (**RL-122**).\n\nSee *Mercer International Inc. v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/3, Award, March 6, 2018 at para 7.20 (**RL-122**), citing *Cargill* in support (in turn making reference to *GAMI* and *Pope & Talbot* in its reasoning).\n\n577.\n\nThe Tribunal will now ascertain whether the Respondent breached its Article 1102(3) obligations in relation to the remaining measures at issue.\n\ni. The RES Regulations Issue and the Biomass Plant Issue\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n578.\n\nAs described earlier in this Award, in the process of approving the LRR for the PHP Mill, the NSUARB expressed concern over two issues. The first was the concern that other ratepayers would bear the cost of obtaining additional renewable energy to meet the standards set by the RES Regulations due to the Mill returning to the grid (previously defined as the \"RES Regulations Issue\"). The second concern related to the operation of a Biomass Plant at the PHP Mill, which eventually led GNS to amend its RES Regulations in 2013, in part designating the Biomass Plant at the PHP Mill as a \"must run\" (previously defined as the \"Biomass Plant Issue\"). In July 2012, GNS provided a comfort letter to the NSUARB related to these two concerns.1235\n\n*In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Government of Nova Scotia Letter Regarding PWCC Load Retention Tariff Hearing, NSUARB, July 20, 2012 (**C-179**).\n\n579.\n\nBoth Parties have described such interventions as regulatory in nature. For instance, at the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant, in reference to the measures related to electricity, stated that \"[\u2026] not all the measures could be construed to be subsidies or procurement. Critical measures were regulatory\".1236\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, 20:12-14; See also: \"Instead, Resolute is complaining about Nova Scotia's decision [\u2026] involved an indivisible ensemble of coordinated measures, some of which Canada does not even claim qualify under 1108(7), like the adoption of the load retention rate and the related regulatory measures for electricity\". (Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, 123:15-24); \"The government shifted the costs of the biomass plant to Nova Scotia ratepayers by a special regulation for PHP so the electricity package could be approved\". (Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 135:8-11). See also Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 310:7-15; 415:6-11. For its part, Respondent states that the Biomass Plant Issue and RES Regulations issue were \"all part of a regulatory plan that had been there for quite some time to be able to make sure that the biomass plant was designated as must run in order to fulfil renewable energy targets\". (Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 449:21-25.)\n\n580.\n\nIn the context of attribution, the Claimant argued that the actions taken by GNS with respect to the RES Regulations Issue and the Biomass Plant Issue were \"elements of the electricity deal between PWCC and NSPI\" as they were both \"necessary for passage and approval of the entire electricity deal\".1237 Further, the Claimant argued that GNS's July 2012 Letter resulted in the NSUARB's approval of the LRR, claiming that GNS \"changed the law for PWCC's benefit\".1238\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 175.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 82, 126; Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 67.\n\n581.\n\nAt Paragraph 303 of this Award, the Tribunal already determined that the LRR itself is not attributable to the Respondent and that the RES Regulations Issue and the Biomass Plant Issue did not have a direct effect on the rate or the price of electricity paid by PHP as such.\n\n582.\n\nYet, the question remains whether the conduct of GNS, when it provided comfort to the NSUARB or specifically when it later amended the RES Regulations, constitutes a breach of NAFTA Article 1102(3). Indeed, as submitted by the Claimant at the 2021 Hearing:\n\n[\u2026], even assuming a disaggregation of the ensemble were factually plausible and conceptually appropriate, some of the specific measures, each of which was indispensable to PWCC's plan, do not qualify for the exemption. These measures alone are sufficient to expose Canada to responsibility for a violation of 1102. These measures include the 24/7 must-run order for the biomass boiler and the protection from the application of the renewable energy standard.\n\nNo matter how broad Canada would like the definition of subsidy, grant or procurement to be, these measures do not qualify and Canada has not taken a contrary position.\n\nFor these reasons, members of the Tribunal, we submit that Resolute makes out a valid and compensable claim for breach of Article 1102.1239\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 124:6-24. See also Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 402:5-13: \"But even if the Tribunal decides to apply Article 1108 on a measure by measure basis, some will necessarily survive, in our submission. For example, the measures adopted to ensure that the electricity package could be implemented [\u2026] And the record shows that each measure was essential for the restart of Port Hawkesbury\".\n\n583.\n\nTurning to the facts, the record demonstrates that the amendments to the RES Regulations were prepared and released for public consultation in June 2011, \"months before PWCC was even in the picture\".1240 As such, the US or Canadian ownership of the Mill could not have been a factor. The Respondent explained that the approval of the RES Regulations was delayed due to the risk of shutdown of both the Port Hawkesbury and Bowater Mersey mills, because the shutdowns would impact renewable energy policy more broadly.1241 Ultimately, the confirmation from the Respondent to the NSUARB in July 2012 that the Port Hawkesbury Mill's return to the grid would not trigger additional RES obligations proved accurate. No costs had to be absorbed by GNS on this account.1242\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraph 176 of this Award; Proposed Amendments to Renewable Energy Regulations, June 27, 2011 (**R-185**).\n\nSee Paragraph 176 of this Award; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 211, citing Witness Statement of Murray Coolican, April 17, 2019, at para 38.\n\nSee e.g. Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 204:18-205:5; Witness Statement of Murray Coolican, April 17, 2019, at para 21 onwards.\n\n584.\n\nWith respect to the Biomass Plant, the arrangement in existence between NSPI and NPPH (a US owned company) was replaced by one between NSPI and PWCC, whereby NSPI would continue to own the Biomass Plant and deliver steam to PHP. When the NSUARB approved the latter agreement, it decided that the prices for the steam supply and shared services \"appeared reasonable and not subsidized by ratepayers\".1243 As mentioned above, in January 2013, GNS amended the RES Regulations in conformity with its July 2012 comfort letter.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para 208, referring to *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Decision, NSUARB, August 20, 2012, at para 158 (**C-148; R-062**).\n\n585.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant's argument that GNS \"changed the law for PWCC's benefit\" (under a policy by GNS to favour its own investor) is not matched by evidence that Resolute was accorded less favorable treatment by GNS. Indeed, Resolute could not receive treatment \"in like circumstances\", because Resolute's SC Paper mills are not located in the province of Nova Scotia, but in the province of Qu\u00e9bec where GNS does not have jurisdiction to regulate electricity matters. Further, the Tribunal notes that nothing on the record points to nationality having played any role in the RES Regulations Issue and the Biomass Plant Issue.\n\n586.\n\nThus, using the test as formulated by the Claimant, the Tribunal concludes that Resolute has not discharged its burden of establishing *prima facie* differential treatment in like circumstances as relates to the RES Regulations Issue and Biomass Plant Issue.\n\nii. The stumpage (fee) regulation aspect of the FULA\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nIn its decision on Article 1108(7), the Tribunal concluded that the silviculture work aspect of the FULA met the definition of procurement and as such is excluded from the analysis under NAFTA Article 1102(3). However, the Tribunal found that no exclusion under Article 1108(7) applies to the stumpage fee aspect of the FULA.\n\n588.\n\nIn her witness statement, Ms. Towers explained that under the FULA, PHP pays for all Crown stumpage harvested at the rates prescribed therein. [REDACTED]1244 The Tribunal accepts the Respondent's argument that the price for stumpage [REDACTED]1245\n\nWitness Statement of Julie Towers, April 17, 2019, at para 36.\n\n[REDACTED] (**R-192**).\n\n589.\n\n[REDACTED]1246 [REDACTED]1247 Also at the 2020 Hearing, Mr. Morrison acknowledged it was standard practice for forestry companies to enter into this type of licensing agreement for cutting timber on Crown Land.1248\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 330:6-331:10; See also [REDACTED] December 1, 2011, at 3 (**R-149**); Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 430:14-431:9.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 331:2-10.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 11, 2020, at 582:14-25.\n\n590.\n\nAt the 2021 Hearing, the Claimant argued that the FULA (encompassing both the stumpage and the silviculture payments) was a \"very generous beneficial agreement for PHP\".1249 However, Resolute did not provide evidence that it was accorded less favorable treatment by GNS regarding stumpage fees. First, Resolute could not receive treatment \"in like circumstances\", because Resolute's SC Paper mills are not located in the province of Nova Scotia, but in the province of Qu\u00e9bec where GNS does not have jurisdiction to regulate the price of stumpage on Crown Land. Second, since the stumpage fees [REDACTED] for the operators wanting to access timber on Crown Land, the \"less favorable treatment\" would have to be otherwise established. Third, the evidence on the record, including the fact that Bowater Mersey and other companies could be or are subject to the same licensing regime, indicates to the Tribunal that nationality was not a factor in the FULA.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 417:7-15; see also Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 309-311.\n\n591.\n\nThus, using the test as formulated by the Claimant, the Tribunal concludes that Resolute has not discharged its burden of establishing *prima facie* differential treatment in like circumstances as relates to the stumpage (fee) regulation aspect of the FULA.\n\niii. The employee pension protection act and regulations\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n592.\n\nOriginally, the Claimant argued that GNS provided PWCC with relief from all pension liabilities.1250 With time, and in response to questions from the Tribunal, the Parties clarified that (i) GNS did not assume pension liabilities for the employees of the Mill1251 and (ii) that PHP was not required by law to assume the pension liabilities.1252 Further, it was clarified that as of May 2012, GNS had \"tabled legislation to delay the windup of underfunded pension plans at the former NewPage Port Hawkesbury paper mill in Nova Scotia\".1253 Premier Darrell Dexter was reported saying that his government had \"decided to table legislation in order to help workers and pensioners avoid an immediate windup hit of up to 30 per cent or more to their pensions\".1254 The date for the windup and other matters would be set by regulations at a later time.\n\nSee e.g. Claimant's Memorial, at para 71.\n\nSee Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 311:9-11, where the Claimant stated \"[a]ccording to reports, no money was spent but the legislative fix helped pensioners [\u2026]\". See also Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 416:3-4: \"[t]here is no provision of money with respect to the handling of the pensions\"; the Respondent stated at Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 446:20-25: \"what Canada has always explained is that Premier Dexter had explained that the Port Hawkesbury pension liability cannot be transferred to the taxpayers and the province never took on any liability or topped up the pensions. That is Exhibit R-364\". See also Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1360:8-1362:23.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 311:2-3 (Claimant), 447:7-15 (Respondent).\n\nCanadian HRReporter, News Release, \"Legislation to delay N.S. paper mill pension windup\", May 10, 2012 (**R-466**). This is consistent with [REDACTED] submitted by the Claimant, see [REDACTED] (**C-329**).\n\nCanadian HRReporter, News Release, \"Legislation to delay N.S. paper mill pension windup\", May 10, 2012 (**R-466**). See the Claimant's statement at the 2021 Hearing: \"The Nova Scotia government enacted a legislative change permitting the pension windup to be delayed, thereby improving payouts over time to pensioners. According to reports, no money was spent but the legislative fix helped pensioners whom PWCC was not prepared to help\" (Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, at 2021, 311:6-11).\n\n593.\n\nAt the 2021 Hearing, the Respondent further explained that:\n\nNow, the legislation that had been proposed was in order to help the workers and pensioners avoid an immediate windup hit of up to 30 percent or more of their pensions.\n\nSo workers at the mill, they had [\u2026] negotiated a new contract with PWCC. There were obviously substantial job cuts. And the idea was that instead of having the workers suffer the impact of a new contract, the government just simply extended the time for the windup of the plan. So, as Canada has always said, there's no benefit to the mill. It was something that was for the workers specifically.1255\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 447:1-15.\n\n594.\n\nThe Claimant, for its part, never made a clear argument at the 2021 Hearing (or prior1256) as to the nature of its claim as relates to pensions. It did contrast the behavior of PWCC with that of Bowater Mersey in relation to honoring pensions in terms of what a \"good citizen letting go half its workforce when shutting down the newsprint machine might have done [\u2026]\".1257 The Respondent, in turn, challenged this assertion, stating that \"it's kind of paradoxical to, again, complain about pensions at Port Hawkesbury when it was the [GNS] that took over [REDACTED] of pension liability at Bowater Mersey\".1258\n\nFor instance, see Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 182: \"PWCC, through the CCAA process, did not inherit the mill's outstanding pension liability of approximately $130 million. That relief (which was predicated on 'Provincial support for legislative change to provide for time for a Plan wind up if requested by' various parties with an interest in the pension) was a necessary requirement to ensure that PHP would be the lowest-cost producer of SC Paper\" [internal footnotes omitted].\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 311:3-6.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 447:23-448:2.\n\n595.\n\nEither way, the Tribunal is not tasked with deciding which of the two private companies is a better corporate citizen, but with determining whether GNS breached its NAFTA Article 1102(3) obligations. As the record stands, the Claimant has not established that GNS accorded PWCC any \"treatment\" as relates to pensions, since the measures benefitted the pensioners and not the company itself. It follows that Resolute was not accorded any \"treatment\" vis-\u00e0-vis the pension's protection measures. In such circumstances, the Tribunal does not need to pursue its analysis any further, as there is no treatment to compare, and as a result, no possibility for the Claimant to prove it was accorded less favorable treatment by GNS as relates to the employee pension protection act and regulations.\n\niv. The municipal property taxation\n-----------------------------------\n\n596.\n\nIn its Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal held that taxation measures are not covered by NAFTA except as provided in Article 2103.1259 As a result, the claims under Article 1105 and Article 1110 (for lack of a reference to the competent authorities) did not fall within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. However, under Article 2103(4)(b) the disciplines of Article 1102 apply to certain taxation measures. The Claimant has submitted that the \"municipal tax portion of the package is only applicable to Resolute's claim under Article 1102\".1260\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 329.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at fn. 176.\n\n597.\n\nThe Respondent has not contested this point. Rather, as related above, it questioned whether the taxation measures provided a benefit to PWCC or PHP. Further, it noted that Bowater Mersey also negotiated a different municipal tax rate with the Region of Queens municipality as part of its efforts to reduce costs.1261\n\nRespondent Counter-Memorial, at para 135.\n\n598.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant did not provide evidence that it was accorded less favorable treatment by the Richmond County or by GNS. First, Resolute could not receive treatment \"in like circumstances\", because Resolute's SC Paper mills are not located in the province of Nova Scotia, but in the province of Qu\u00e9bec where neither GNS nor its municipalities have jurisdiction over property taxes. Second, since the reassessment of the property taxes is argued to have been a consequence of the reduced activities at the Mill, it is unclear what would be the source of the \"less favorable treatment\" of Resolute's Mills in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n599.\n\nThus, using the test as formulated by the Claimant, the Tribunal concludes that Resolute has not discharged its burden of establishing *prima facie* differential treatment in like circumstances as relates to the municipal property taxation measure at issue.\n\n600.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not discharged its burden to prove a breach of NAFTA Article 1102(3) as relates to: the RES Regulations Issue and the Biomass Plant Issue; the stumpage (fee) regulation aspect of the FULA; the employee pension protection act and regulations; and the municipal property taxation measure at issue.\n\n601.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal wishes to add that *even if* it had accepted the \"ensemble of measures\" argument submitted by the Claimant and *even if* it had concluded that the Claimant was accorded \"treatment\" by GNS in this case, the Tribunal would not have found a breach of NAFTA Article 1102(3) in any event, because it has not been established that GNS accorded Resolute treatment that was less favorable than accorded \"in like circumstances\" to PHP. As mentioned at Paragraph 575 above, in order to distinguish between *nationalit*y-based discrimination and other differences of treatment that do not relate to nationality, tribunals have recourse to the concept of \"like circumstances\". While it was not under a legal burden to do so, the Respondent provided much evidence of legitimate reasons for the GNS Assistance Measures that had nothing to do with nationality. For instance, the Respondent submitted that:\n\n[t]he GNS implemented those measures to further a number of legitimate public policy objectives: to avoid a potential [REDACTED] to the Province's economy, to avoid significant increases in electricity prices because of the loss of NSPI's largest customer, to support continued employment in a rural part of the Province with few alternative employment opportunities and to support the Province's sustainable forestry management goals, just to name a few.1262\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 113; See also Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 191:16-22.\n\n602.\n\nSpecifically, the Tribunal would have found that the difference in treatment had a reasonable nexus with the rational economic, environmental, and social policy of GNS and it had no element of discrimination against foreign investors or investments.\n\n603.\n\nThus, the Claimant's claim of breach of NAFTA Article 1102(3) is dismissed.\n\n**C. NAFTA A****rticle** **1105**\n---------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n604.\n\nNAFTA Article 1105(1) provides that \"[e]ach party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security\".1263\n\nNAFTA Article 1105(1).\n\n605.\n\nIn a 2001 Note on Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions, the FTC stated that:\n\nMinimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law\n\n1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.\n\n2. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\n\n3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).\n\n606.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, as well as to whether the Respondent breached its obligation under Article 1105.\n\n**2. The Claimant's Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Applicable Standard under Article 1105**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the content of the minimum standard of treatment under Article 1105 is shaped by the fair and equitable standard of treatment at customary international law.1264 It cites the FTC,1265 in its clarification of Article 1105(1) as explaining that \"Article 1105(1) does not require that the concepts of 'fair and equitable treatment' and 'full protection and security' be ignored, but rather that they be considered as part of the minimum standard of treatment that [it] prescribes\".1266\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 237-248; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 66:23-67:3.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 232, citing NAFTA Free Trade Commission, North American Free Trade Agreement, Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions, July 31, 2001 (**CL-120**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 234, referring to *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Relying on *Bilcon* and *Merrill & Ring*, the Claimant argues that:\n\n[T]he applicable minimum standard of treatment of investors is found in customary international law and [\u2026] except for cases of safety and due process, today's minimum standard is broader than that defined in the *Neer* case and its progeny. Specifically, this standard provides for the fair and equitable treatment of alien investors within the confines of reasonableness.1272\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at paras 238-240.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 238, citing *Bilcon v.

Canada* defined a breach of the minimum standard of treatment as \"[c]onduct which is unjust, arbitrary, unfair, discriminatory or in violation of due process\", observing that such conduct \"has also been noted by NAFTA tribunals as constituting a breach of fair and equitable treatment, even in the absence of bad faith or malicious intentions\".1296 The Claimant points to other NAFTA1297 and non-NAFTA1298 cases that reached the same conclusion.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 137, citing *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v.

It advances that parochial self-interest does not amount to a legitimate public interest, especially when that interest is prioritized at the expense of Resolute's operations outside the province and the forest industry beyond Nova Scotia (among other interests).1310 As the Claimant puts it, \"[r]obbing Resolute's SC Paper mills in Qu\u00e9bec to pay PHP's mill in Nova Scotia should not be considered policy in the public interest merely because such opportunistic behavior benefits GNS and its own constituents\".1311 The Claimant adds that in international law more broadly, a State cannot defend the interest of one of its constituent elements at the expense of the interests of the greater whole.1312\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 121.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 122.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 123.\n\n624.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, even if the Tribunal finds that the Assistance Measures were led by legitimate public interest, it should find that the means taken to accomplish those interests were unfair and inequitable.1313\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 91:6-9.\n\nii. Whether GNS knew that the Assistance Measures could cause Resolute harm\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n625.\n\nThe Claimant argues that GNS's actions were \"unfair\" and \"unjust\"1314 because of what GNS knew when it agreed to assist PWCC financially. For example, the Claimant alleges that GNS knew back in 2011 that the Mill, \"operating in an industry in secular decline\" was experiencing financial difficulty.1315 The Claimant notes that [REDACTED]1316 [REDACTED]1317 In light of this information, the Claimant argues that GNS knew about the potential effects of PHP's reopening on Resolute but nevertheless chose to provide the PHP Mill with the full and complete \"bailout package\".1318 Moreover, the Claimant suggests that [REDACTED]1319\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 263.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 260, citing Nova Scotia Legislature Proceedings, November 2, 2011, at 3009 (**C-123**); Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 99:3-15.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 103, referring to [REDACTED] (**R-161**); Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 99:16-25; 105:6-14.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 103, referring to [REDACTED] (**R-161**); Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 100:13-25; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at paras 82-83; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 132:19-133:6, 134:20-135:7.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 148.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 149.\n\n626.\n\nInformed by Mr. Peter Steger's analysis (the Respondent's damages expert),1320 the Claimant argues that GNS knew that but for the Assistance Measures, the PHP Mill would not reopen.1321 The Claimant argues that Mr. Steger's analysis shows that without the Assistance Measures, which Mr. Steger values at [REDACTED]1322 [REDACTED]1323\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 152, referring to Expert Report of Peter Steger, April 18, 2018, at paras 106-109.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 151; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 101:20-102:1.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 155.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 159.\n\n627.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that GNS knew that \"only the lowest cost producers of SC paper would survive\",1324 referring to [REDACTED]1325 The Claimant contends that GNS knew that the Mill produced SC Paper for a market beyond Nova Scotia,1326 and that the Assistance Measures it provided to PWCC \"[were] intended to give PHP a permanent competitive advantage over every other producer in a market that extended beyond the GNS borders\".1327\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 261.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 261, citing [REDACTED] at CAN0000087\\_0004 (**C- 158**); Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 407:19-411:18.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 264, referring to Expert Witness Report of Seth T.

Whether the Assistance Measures helped PHP allegedly become the \"lowest-cost producer\" of SC Paper\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n630.\n\nFirst, the Claimant recalls that PWCC's alleged intention was to make PHP \"the lowest-cost producer of SC paper\" and that GNS ensured that PWCC's wish would materialize.1330 For example, it points to statements of PWCC's CEO, indicating that the \"story to the regulator\" would be that \"Stern can turn this into a profitable mill\" if it is the \"lowest cost SC mill in North America\".1331\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 251.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 251, citing PWCC Meeting Notes, Redacted PWCC LRT Application NSPI (Avon) IR-1 Attachment 2, 2011-2012, at 135 (**C-147**).\n\n631.\n\nThe Claimant also mentions [REDACTED] which stated that \"[REDACTED].1332 [REDACTED]1333\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 251, citing [REDACTED] at CAN000121\\_0043 (**C-159**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 251, citing [REDACTED] at CAN000121\\_0059 (**C-159**).\n\n632.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that GNS assisted PHP in its ambition when it stated that its goal was \"to help the mill become the lowest cost and most competitive producer of super calendar paper\".1334 To do so, GNS allegedly offered PWCC the \"benefits and concessions\" listed in Paragraph 497 of this Award.1335\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 252, citing Nova Scotia Press Release, August 20, 2012 (**C-183**); Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 394:1-396:25.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 253.\n\n633.\n\nThe Claimant states that in return, PWCC disbursed $33 million (net $13 million) for assets it valued at $[REDACTED]1336\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 253.\n\n634.\n\nWith respect to the LRR, the Claimant submits that the rate PWCC negotiated with NSPI was an \"integrally connected\" set of its own measures, which PWCC insisted on receiving to restart the Mill.1337 The Claimant contends that PWCC's LRR ultimately saved it [REDACTED] from 2013- 2015, in comparison to what NPPH would have paid for the same period.1338 Moreover, it advances that GNS satisfied Mr. Stern's specific demand that PHP would never have to pay for any additional costs for renewable energy caused by PHP's return to the grid1339 by passing regulation to cover these additional costs.1340 The Claimant recalls that PHP needed the Biomass Plant to run at 24% of its capacity to generate steam for the Mill.1341 Accordingly, it alleges, \"GNS had to pick up the cost of the other 76 percent\".1342\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 254, referring to *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corporation and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Notice of Application for Approval Of A Load Retention Rate, NSUARB, April 27, 2012, at para 8 (**C-164**); Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 29:3-7.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 162, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at paras 118-120.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 255, referring to PWCC Meeting Notes, Redacted PWCC LRT Application NSPI (Avon) IR-1 Attachment 2, 2011-2012, at 91 (**C-147**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 255.

Whether GNS should have let the Mill fail\n---------------------------------------------\n\n636.\n\nThe Claimant argues that GNS's financial assistance to PWCC is all the more reprehensible because the PHP Mill was a non-profitable company that should have been allowed to fail.\n\n637.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Mill lost $50 million in the year before NPPH sought creditor protection, with $[REDACTED] 2009, $[REDACTED] in 2012, and [REDACTED] from January to August 2011.1346 In light of these numbers, the Claimant contends, \"GNS's intervention in the SC paper commercial marketplace altered the competitive field and made PHP the winner for reasons that inherently were not founded in competitive market principles\".1347 It alleges that GNS acted with sectional prejudice by \"subverting the competition of the SC paper market in order to put its own sectional interests ahead of all others\".1348 The Claimant contends that governments can protect their own interests, but cannot intentionally inflict damage on competitors beyond their borders.1349\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 259, referring to *In re A Plan of Compromise or Arrangement of NewPage Port Hawkesbury Corp.*, Affidavit of Thor E.

Whether GNS's conduct violated the principle of proportionality\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n642.\n\nFinally, the Claimant suggests that GNS's actions violate the customary international law principle of proportionality. In the Claimant's view, the principle of proportionality \"requires that actions taken by the host state that adversely affect a foreign investment must be reasonable, necessary, and not disproportionate in response to the state's necessity\".1361 It relies on several cases to support its position, such as *RREEF v. Spain*,1362 *Occidental v. Ecuador*,1363 *PL Holdings v. Poland*,1364 *Azurix v. Argentina*,1365 *Tecmed v. Mexico*,1366 *S.D.

Whether Resolute's decision to shut down Bowater Mersey despite accepting financial assistance from GNS affects its claim under Article 1105\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n644.\n\nThe Claimant argues that its decision to shut down Bowater Mersey despite receiving financial assistance from GNS has no bearing on whether Canada, through GNS, breached its obligation under Article 1105.1373 In other words, the Respondent cannot use the fact that it financially supported Bowater Mersey to defend itself against a claim of unfair and inequitable treatment against Resolute.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 318-340; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 141:14-18.\n\n645.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it was only a matter of time before Bowater Mersey would close because it was an old and inefficient newsprint mill.1374 Therefore, the Respondent cannot assert that it accorded Bowater Mersey and PHP similar treatment in like circumstances.1375 It notes that Mr. Duff Montgomerie confirmed at the 2020 Hearing that the objective behind GNS support offered to Bowater Mersey was \"to achieve a more orderly closure\" rather than long term success.1376\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 320, 326; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 147:11-22; November 10, 2020, at 390:24-393:13; November 14, 2020, at 1109:10-17.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 318; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 147:11-22, November 14, 2020, at 1109:10-17.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1201:10-1203:10; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 26.\n\n646.\n\nFirst, the Claimant points out that Bowater Mersey and the PHP Mill produced different grades of paper, with Bowater Mersey producing newsprint rather than SC Paper.1377 It claims that newsprint paper was and is still suffering from \"an even steeper secular decline than SC Paper\".1378 According to the Claimant, Bowater Mersey suffered from additional impediments, such as \"the old age of the facility, high production costs, distance from markets, and sensitivity to foreign currency fluctuations\",1379 which all guaranteed that the mill would eventually close.1380\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 318; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 14, 2020, at 1124:5-20.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 320.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 320.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 320.\n\n647.\n\nSecond, the Claimant contends that GNS was made aware of the declining state of the newsprint industry through [REDACTED]1381 [REDACTED]1382 It was also allegedly cognizant of Bowater Mersey's sensitivity to overseas currency fluctuations, a characteristic of newsprint manufacturers like Resolute.1383 According to the Claimant, GNS Premier Dexter confirmed that GNS was aware of the difficulties Resolute was facing when he stated: \"[T]hey're dealing with increased fibre costs, increased electricity costs, labour costs that are not consistent with what they're getting in other places. All of these things completely through the supply chain are creating a problem for the mill\".1384\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 321, referring to [REDACTED] (**R-146**).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 322, referring to [REDACTED] (**R-147**).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 323, referring to [REDACTED] (**R-146**).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 325, citing Nova Scotia Legislature House of Assembly Debates and Proceedings, Third Session, November 2, 2011, at 3009 (**C-123**).\n\n648.\n\nThird, the Claimant pleads that GNS took months to make Resolute an offer of financial assistance once it learned that Resolute planned to permanently shut down Bowater Mersey.1385 Resolute had allegedly determined that its newsprint operations were no longer financially feasible in the spring of 2011,1386 and planned to announce the permanent closure of Bowater Mersey in August 2011.1387 According to the Claimant, Bowater Mersey delayed announcing the closure at GNS's request, \"so that GNS would have an opportunity to consider how the mill might remain open\". Yet, the Claimant states that GNS took months to confirm financial support for Bowater Mersey, with GNS and Resolute concluding an agreement on December 1, 2011.1388\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 326-329.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 326, referring to Witness Statement of Richard Garneau, December 6, 2019, at para 6.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 326, referring to Montgomerie Witness Statement, at para 9.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 327-329, referring to Witness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, April 17, 2019, at para 12; [REDACTED] (**R-149**); Witness Statement of Richard Garneau, December 6, 2019, at para 11.\n\n649.\n\nTo recall, the terms of the financial support for Bowater Mersey consisted of a $25 million loan, $23.75 million (which Resolute needed to spend at Bowater Mersey) for the purchase of 25,000 acres of land, and a $1.5 million workforce training grant.1389 The Claimant takes issue with the terms of the agreement, describing it not as an agreement that would keep Resolute in business in Nova Scotia, but that would rather \"return coveted land to the province\".1390 Its position is informed by a statement by Mr. Duff Montgomerie, GNS's former Deputy Minister of Natural Resources, who stated that GNS made a \"good deal\" because the province paid approximately $200 less per acre than it had in a similar purchase of land from Resolute in 2007,1391 and that the value of the 25,000 acres it bought would be higher than the $900 per acre it paid.1392 In the Claimant's opinion, the fact that the mill was idled four times during the period starting immediately after the agreement was concluded in December 2011 until June 2012 is further evidence that the financial assistance was insufficient to keep Bowater Mersey running for long.1393 It also specifies that even if the loan and land purchase had been sufficient to sustain Bowater Mersey's full operations, it would only have enabled the mill to run for approximately five more years, a timeframe to which Resolute did not commit.1394\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial at para 329, referring to [REDACTED] (**R-149**).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 330; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 328:4-23; November 14, 2020, at 1133:9-18.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 330.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 330, referring to Nova Scotia House of Assembly, Committee on Public Accounts, October 3, 2012, at 7-9 (**R-152**).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 331, referring to Bridgewater, NS, Canada, News Release, \"Breaking: Shut Down at Bowater Mersey Extended\", January 6, 2012 (**C-327**); Bridgewater, NS, Canada, News Release, \"More Downtime Expected at Bowater Mersey\", April 25, 2012 (**C-330**).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 332, referring to Witness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, at paras 12-13; [REDACTED] (**R-149**); *In re An Application by NewPage Port Hawkesbury Corp. and Bowater Mersey Paper Co.*, Redacted Bowater Mersey Responses to Information Requests from the Avon Group, NSUARB, August 2, 2011, at 12 (**R-144**).\n\n650.\n\nThe Claimant also singles out GNS's lack of assistance in obtaining a favorable LRR for Resolute, in comparison to the help it allegedly offered PWCC in the same endeavour (including providing a witness such as Mr. Todd Williams at the NSUARB hearing).1395 It emphasizes that Resolute obtained a three-year term LRR despite having requested an LRR for five years, whereas PWCC obtained a seven-year term LRR at more favorable rates.1396 The Claimant also recalls GNS's \"additional rate support\" amounting to a \"$7 million per year benefit to PHP\" between July 2013 and April 2016 as the result of the \"must-run\" Biomass Plant regulations, which it claims GNS amended in PHP's interest.1397\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 335, referring to Claimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 30-38, 54-67; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 530:4-533:16; Claimant's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 27.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 336-337.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 337; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 519:16-552:7.\n\n651.\n\nFinally, the Claimant recalls that Resolute announced Bowater Mersey's permanent closure in June 2012, emphasizing that it had not spent GNS's $25 million loan (which was later returned to GNS) because \"[w]e have not been able to identify a project within the assigned budget which would help sustain [the mill] long term [\u2026] especially considering today's export market conditions\".1398\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 333, citing CBC, News Release, \"Bowater mill postpones upgrades\", June 14, 2012 (**C-331**). The Claimant also notes that GNS's loan had been returned to the province. See Claimant's Reply Memorial, at para 333, referring to [REDACTED] (**R-149**).\n\n652.\n\nIn essence, the Claimant contends that GNS did not do everything in its power to make Bowater Mersey the lowest cost producer of newsprint, as it did with PHP.1399\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 417:24-419:5.\n\nvii. Whether Resolute's decision not to bid on the Mill affects its claim under Article 1105\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n653.\n\nThe Claimant pleads that its decision not to bid on the Mill does not diminish its claim of unfair and inequitable treatment under Article 1105.1400 The Claimant argues that the Respondent cannot use the fact that Resolute did not bid on the Mill as a defense to the Claimant's Article 1105 arguments.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 341.\n\n654.\n\n[REDACTED]1401 [REDACTED]1402 [REDACTED]1403 [REDACTED]1404 [REDACTED]1405 [REDACTED]1406\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 345.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 345.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 345.

lowest cost and most competitive producer of super calendar [sic] paper\".1430 It refutes the Respondent's proposition that Resolute's failure to anticipate the measures1431 GNS would offer PWCC was a business decision.1432 The Claimant posits that nothing or no one indicated that GNS would provide \"anything close\"1433 to the Assistance Measures PWCC received.1434 In the Claimant's opinion, its argument is supported by the fact that only one bidder ultimately manifested interest in purchasing the Mill.1435\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 359, referring to Nova Scotia Press Release,

Claimant suggests that its own experience with GNS with respect to Bowater Mersey informed its expectations of the scale of the assistance GNS would have provided Resolute had it decided to bid on the Mill.1436 For example, the Claimant submits [REDACTED]1437 1438\u00a0In contrast, as the Claimant points out, \"once Bowater Mersey was no longer in play, however, GNS acted to ensure PWCC would receive a much more favorable electricity rate, exclusively for PHP\".1439 In sum, the Claimant contends that Resolute had no reason to expect that GNS would provide adequate assistance to Resolute if it were to purchase the Mill.1440 [REDACTED] \"Resolute, [REDACTED] a choice it was not willing to make\".1441\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 359.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 362,

RFP0011524 (**C-119**).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at paras 360-361.\n\n662.\n\nThe Claimant suggests that the asymmetry between the assistance provided to Bowater Mersey and the assistance PHP accepted contradicts Canada's argument that the Claimant accepted GNS assistance and therefore received fair and equitable treatment when compared to PHP. The Claimant places particular emphasis on GNS's alleged lack of assistance during Bowater Mersey's proceedings before the NSUARB for the approval of its electricity rate: \"it did not make a statement in support of an electricity rate, hire a consultant, present an expert witness, introduce evidence, answer information requests, make representations to the NSUARB regarding Government action, or enact legislation to ensure passage of an LRR\".1442 The Claimant reports that the NSUARB only approved a three-year term, in contrast to PHP's approved seven-year term,1443 and that the rates were approximately $2-5/MWh higher than the rates it had initially sought.1444 These rates were also higher than what PHP obtained, and did not include additional GNS support, like the \"$7 million per year benefit PHP received from July 2013 \u2013 April 2016 through the 'must-run' Biomass Plant regulations that GNS instituted for PHP's steam requirements\".1445 According to the Claimant, GNS claimed it passed these regulations to ensure PHP \"receive[d] the full benefit of the proposed arrangement it reached with\" NSPI.1446\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 335, referring to *In re An Application by NewPage Port Hawkesbury Corp. and Bowater Mersey Paper Co.*, Exhibit List, NSUARB, November 4, 2011 (**C-320**).\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at paras 118-120.\n\nClaimant's Reply Memorial, at para 336.

The Respondent adds that \"[i]nterpreting 'fair and equitable treatment' in Article 1105(1) as if it were an autonomous standard of treatment is not appropriate in the NAFTA context where the FTC firmly established that customary international law is the standard to be applied. This is now beyond debate in light of the position of the NAFTA Parties and NAFTA tribunal decisions. See *Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award, June 8, 2009, at para 608 (**CL-025**); *Cargill, Inc. v.

See Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at fn. 583.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 284.\n\n669.\n\nContrary to the Claimant's position,1463 the Respondent advances that the threshold for a violation of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law requires \"an act that is sufficiently egregious and shocking \u2013 a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons \u2013 so as to fall below accepted international standards\".1464 The Respondent references the tribunal in *Cargill* which stated that \"[i]f the conduct of the government toward the investment amounts to gross misconduct, manifest injustice, or, in the classic words of the *Neer* claim, bad faith or the willful neglect of duty, [\u2026] then such conduct will be a violation of the customary obligation of fair and equitable treatment\".1465 The Respondent suggests that the Claimant has accepted this standard.1466 The Respondent adds that the Claimant's own reliance on *Cargill*1467 is mistaken because the impugned measures in that case were expressly intended by Mexico to damage the claimants' investments \"to the greatest extent possible\",1468 whereas it claims there is no evidence in this case to suggest that GNS expressly intended to impair Resolute's investment.1469 The Respondent argues that the Claimant conceded at the jurisdictional hearing that it was \"not saying necessarily that Nova Scotia had in mind to support Port Hawkesbury because it wanted to impact Resolute as a foreign investor only [\u2026] We just happened to be the only foreign participant with an investment in Canada, so we qualified for protection under NAFTA\".1470 As a result, it argues that this \"admission\" dismisses any contention that Canada breached the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.1471\n\nClaimant's Memorial, at para 239.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 285, citing *Glamis Gold Ltd. v.

[\u2026] It is wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety\".1479 The Respondent argues that the Claimant makes no effort to demonstrate that GNS's actions were arbitrary.1480 According to the Respondent, the term \"sectional prejudice\"1481 relates to discriminatory behavior against a foreign litigant in the national courts of the host State,1482 which is not an issue here. The Respondent notes that two Canadian SC Paper producers were also impacted by the Mill's reopening, which shows that Resolute's foreign nationality was not a factor in GNS's decision making.1483 Finally, in response to the Claimant's use of the term \"parochial self-interest\"1484 when describing GNS's behaviour, the Respondent reports that the Claimant has not cited any authority to support its underlying claim that the minimum standard of treatment of aliens in customary international law \"requires a sub-national government to put the interests of foreign investors located in a different province or state above those of the investors located on its territory\".1485\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 293, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at paras 249, 263, 265, 270, 272.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 294.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 294, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at para 241.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 294, citing *Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.

Whether GNS's conduct merits deference\n-----------------------------------------\n\n680.\n\nThe Respondent submits that under international law, States' policy decisions within their own territories are owed deference.1505 According to the Respondent, the *Mercer* tribunal accepted that \"as a general legal principle, in the absence of bad faith, a measure of deference is owed to a State's regulatory policies\".1506 In this case, the Respondent urges the Tribunal to consider the factors leading GNS to offer PWCC assistance, such as the fact that GNS also provided Resolute assistance for Bowater Mersey to become \"a low-cost mill\", that Resolute was invited to bid on the Mill, that PWCC presented innovative and cost-friendly solutions for the Mill (and that its Canadian nationality was a \"coincidence\"), and the possible \"devastating\" impacts of the Mill's closure on the provincial economy.1507 Borrowing words from the *Electrabel* tribunal, the Respondent suggests that \"the host State is not required to elevate unconditionally the interests of the foreign investor above all other considerations in every circumstance\".1508 Neither may the Claimant substitute the Tribunal's objective assessment of the reasonableness of GNS's conduct for its own \"subjective beliefs as to what would have been the 'better' decision when faced with the choice of letting Port Hawkesbury close or giving it a chance to re-enter the market\".1509\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 287, referring to *S.D.

Whether GNS's conduct violated the principle of proportionality\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n710.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant's proportionality argument is unsound with respect to the law. At law, the Respondent submits that in the context of an Article 1105 analysis, the minimum standard of treatment of aliens in customary international law does not include a proportionality test. The Respondent observes that \"[t]he proportionality test presupposes that the objective behind a consented measure taken by a State is legitimate\".1605 As such, in the Respondent's opinion, it is inconceivable that measures accused of being \"sufficiently egregious or shocking\" could be simultaneously deemed legitimate. Therefore, it concludes, \"[w]hen faced with an egregious and shocking measure, a NAFTA tribunal need not apply the proportionality test\".1606 The Respondent notes that, in any case, the Claimant has not provided any State practice and *opinio juris* nor any relevant NAFTA award in support of its contention respecting the nature and application of a proportionality test.1607\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 134, citing Patrick Dumberry, *The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: A Guide to NAFTA Case Law on Article 1105* (Kluwer, 2013) at 264 [Respondent's emphasis] (**CL-141**); Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 214:23-215:21; November 14, 2020, at 1237:18-24.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 134, citing Patrick Dumberry, *The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: A Guide to NAFTA Case Law on Article 1105* (Kluwer, 2013) at 264 [Respondent's emphasis] (**CL-141**); Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 28.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 134.\n\n711.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent disputes the relevance of the cases cited by the Claimant.1608 For example, in *ADM*, the tribunal applied the proportionality test to countermeasures, an area of law in which proportionality is a requirement at customary international law.1609 In *S.D. Myers*, the proportionality analysis was not applied in the context of an Article 1105 claim.1610 Lastly, the Respondent denies the relevance of the other cases cited by the Claimant1611 because those tribunals applied fair and equitable treatment provisions from different treaties, which differ from the minimum standard of treatment in customary international law pursuant to Article 1105(1).1612\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 135.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 135, referring to *Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v.

See also Jurisdictional Hearing Transcript, Day 1, at 372:3-13.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 142.\n\n713.\n\nThe Respondent explains why, in any case, it views the Claimant's claims of disproportionality as flawed with respect to the facts: first, this Tribunal would be misplaced to evaluate the underlying merits of GNS's policy,1615 including how much assistance to offer and for how long;1616 second, the motives underlying GNS's assistance to Bowater Mersey are the same as they were for PWCC and the Mill, which were to keep it open and lower its production costs;1617 third, factual differences between the two mills, like Bowater Mersey being smaller and producing different grades of paper, explain why the actual assistance provided to each one differed;1618 fourth, contrary to what the Claimant alleges, GNS did not give in to PWCC's alleged demands, evidenced in part by PWCC's LRR which was not as economically advantageous as PWCC had hoped;1619 fifth, the fact that the Claimant withdrew its allegation that GNS enabled PHP to engage in predatory pricing due to an alleged lack of evidence discredits the disproportionality argument;1620 and sixth, [REDACTED]1621\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 140, 142.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 143.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 144, referring to [REDACTED] December 1, 2011, at 2 (**R-149**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 145.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 146, referring to *In re An Application by Pacific West Commercial Corp. and Nova Scotia Power Inc.*, Amended Decision, NSUARB, September 27, 2012, at para 19 (**R-063**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 148, referring to Claimant's Statement of Claim, at paras 55, 96.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 149, referring to Expert Witness Report of Peter Steger, April 17, 2019, at para 116 and Schedule 29.\n\n714.\n\nIn light of the above, the Respondent maintains that there is no legal or factual basis to entertain a claim of disproportionate assistance in international law.1622\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 150.\n\nvi. Whether Resolute's decision to shut down Bowater Mersey despite accepting financial assistance from GNS affects its claim under Article 1105\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n715.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it is \"disingenuous\" for the Claimant to denounce GNS's financial support to PHP when it contemporaneously accepted a $50 million financial package from GNS ([REDACTED] under similar circumstances.1623 In the Respondent's words, \"Resolute's own actions confirm that the GNS' assistance to Port Hawkesbury was not a breach of Article 1105(1)\".1624 The Respondent underlines that GNS's offer was made to Resolute even though \"market prospects were bleaker for newsprint than SC paper, and even though Bowater Mersey was a smaller operation than Port Hawkesbury\".1625\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 302, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at para 241; Witness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, April 17, 2019, at paras 9-12; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 320:18-331:10; Respondent's Pre-Hearing Memorial, at para 30; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 19, 2021, at 421:14-24, 428:16-429:8, 423:12-428:11, 434:4-436:14.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 303.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 319.\n\n716.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, this argument is especially significant given the motivations driving Resolute to accept financial assistance from GNS, which were no different from those of PWCC (and were not affected by its decision to shut down Bowater Mersey),1626 and GNS's motivations for offering this financial assistance to Resolute,1627 which provide \"critical context\" on GNS's \"good faith decision-making [\u2026], essential to an Article 1105 analysis\".1628 Just like PWCC, the Respondent suggests that Resolute wanted to \"lower its cost structure and remain a viable economic enterprise\".1629\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 303.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 302, referring to Witness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, April 17, 2019, at paras 4-8, 14, 17, 22 and 29.

Whether Resolute's decision not to bid on the Mill affects its claim under Article 1105\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n719.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's Article 1105 claim is unconvincing because it was invited and encouraged to bid on the Mill but ultimately chose not to do so.1636\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 297, referring to Claimant's Statement of Claim, at para 26; Claimant's Memorial, at para 220.\n\n720.\n\nIn response to the Claimant's complaint of not being offered any benefits and financial assistance when it was invited to participate in the bidding process, the Respondent specifies that no potential bidders were offered benefits when they were contacted by the Monitor and Sanabe in September 2011.1637 All negotiations happened after the Claimant decided not to partake in the bidding process and after PWCC was selected as one of two going-concern bidders.1638 However, the Respondent claims that Resolute was aware of this possibility because [REDACTED]1639 In any case, it states that the Claimant never *asked* for GNS's assistance because it did not engage in the bidding process.1640\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 298, referring to Witness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, April 17, 2019, at para 23.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 165.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 298; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 162, referring to [REDACTED] June 2011, at 50 (**C-107**); NewPage Port Hawkesbury Mill Confidential Information Memorandum, September 2011, at 50 (**R-361**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 160 [Respondent's emphasis]; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 339:12-348:20.\n\n721.\n\nFurther to this point, the Respondent states that [REDACTED]1641 So too, was [REDACTED]1642 and t[REDACTED]1643\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 299, citing Port Hawkesbury Bidding Proposal With Notes, September 26, 2011, at 11 (**C-119**); Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 349:3-23.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 161.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 299.\n\n722.\n\nThe Respondent argues that PWCC, unlike Resolute, [REDACTED]1644 The Respondent explains that [REDACTED]1645\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, 2020, at 350:23-352:17; November 14, 2020, at 1277:23-1278:10.\n\nHearing on the Merits and Damages, November 10, at 2020, 352:23-353-23; November 14, 2020, at 1279:12-1285:6; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, October 18, 2021, at 179:17-180:18.\n\n723.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Respondent argues that there is no customary international law protection for foreign investors from \"the consequences of their own business decisions\".1646 Furthermore, it contends that the fact that GNS encouraged Resolute to bid on the Mill and provided financial assistance to Bowater Mersey \"demonstrates that there was no animus against Resolute, nationality-based or otherwise\".1647 As such, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant's Article 1105 claim must fail.1648\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 300.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 300.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 300.\n\n**4. The Non-Disputing Parties' Comments**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Submissions of the United States and Mexico**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n724.\n\nRelying on the FTC's interpretation of NAFTA, the United States submits that the standard of treatment under Article 1105 is the minimum standard of treatment at customary international law.1649 Accordingly, it submits that the obligations of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment beyond what is prescribed in the customary international law minimum standard of treatment,1650 nor does a breach of another NAFTA provision or of a different international agreement establish a breach of Article 1105(1).1651 The United States also recalls the binding nature of the FTC's interpretation.1652\n\nUnited States Submission, at para 14, citing NAFTA Free Trade Commission, Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions, July 31, 2001, at para B.1.\n\nUnited States Submission, at para 14, citing NAFTA Free Trade Commission, Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions, July 31, 2001, at para B.2.\n\nUnited States Submission, at para 14, citing NAFTA Free Trade Commission, Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions, July 31, 2001, at para B.3.\n\nUnited States Submission, at para 14, referring to NAFTA Article 1131(2).\n\n725.\n\nThe United States argues that customary international law is created by consistent State practice and *opinio juris*.1653 It contends that current customary international law has crystallized to establish the minimum standard of treatment as a \"floor below which treatment of foreign investors must not fall\".1654 The United States demonstrates how the concepts of good faith, proportionality and non-discrimination have not crystallized into customary international law as components of the fair and equitable treatment obligation.1655\n\nUnited States Submission, at paras 17-18.\n\nUnited States Submission, at para 15.\n\nUnited States Submission, at para 20.\n\n726.\n\nWith respect to good faith, the United States acknowledges that the performance of binding treaty obligations in good faith is part of customary international law, but argues that claims alleging breach of the good faith principle are not within the limited jurisdictional grant of Section B of NAFTA Chapter 11.1656 The United States notes that good faith does not impose a \"free-standing, substantive obligation [\u2026] that, if breached, can result in State liability\".1657 Seeing as Section A of NAFTA Chapter 11 does not comprise such an obligation, the United States concludes that reliance on good faith alone cannot support an Article 1105 claim.1658\n\nUnited States Submission, at para 21, referring to VCLT Article 26.\n\nUnited States Submission, at paras 21-22, referring to *Mesa Power Group LLC v.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Applicable Standard under Article 1105**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n736.\n\nUnder NAFTA Article 1105, the fair and equitable treatment standard is restricted to the minimum standard of treatment as recognized under customary international law. This was explicitly affirmed by the FTC in its 2001 Note of Interpretation which as cited earlier provided, among others, that:\n\n1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.\n\n2. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\n\n3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).1689\n\nNAFTA Free Trade Commission, \"Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter Eleven Provisions\", July 31, 2001 (**RL-001**).\n\n737.\n\nAs has been recognized by multiple arbitral tribunals constituted under Chapter 11,1690 the interpretation by the FTC is legally binding on this Tribunal pursuant to NAFTA Article 1131(2), which reads: \"An interpretation by the [Free Trade] Commission of a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section\" and must be followed by this Tribunal.\n\nSee, among others, *ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, January 9, 2003, at para 176; *Methanex Corp. v. United States of America*, Final Award, August 3, 2005, Part IV, Chapter C, para 20; *Cargill, Inc. v.

Government of Canada*, Case No UNCT/14/2, Final Award, March 16, 2017, at para 105.\n\n738.\n\nMultiple tribunals under NAFTA Chapter 11 have confirmed that the minimum standard of treatment of aliens must take into account the dynamic character of customary international law.1691 As a result, evolution of that standard has to be confirmed by customary international law developments. As the tribunal in the *ADF* case affirmed, \"both customary international law and the minimum standard of treatment of aliens it incorporates, are constantly in a process of development\".1692\n\nSee, e.g., *Mondev International Ltd v. United States of America*, Case No ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, October 11, 2002, at para 125; *ADF Group Inc. v.

Even before the FTC Note of Interpretation, the tribunal in *S.D. Myers* had interpreted Article 1105 as violated only when the claimant \"has been treated in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective\".1693 In the context of a claim concerning denial of justice, the tribunal in *Mondev* held that the applicable standard \"is not whether a particular result is surprising, but whether the shock or surprise occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome\".1694 As the tribunal in *Waste Management (II)* explained,\n\nthe minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\u2014as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.1695\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, November 13, 2000 (**CL-102**), at para 263.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, October 11, 2002, at para 127; *The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No ARB(F)/98/3, Award, June 26, 2003, at para 133.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States [II]*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, at para 98.\n\n740.\n\nArticle 1105 entails a \"basic obligation of the State [\u2026] to act in good faith and form, and not deliberately to set out to destroy or frustrate the investment by improper means\".1696 Even if measures are shown to be 'ultra vires' under domestic law, that \"by itself does not necessarily render the measures grossly unfair or inequitable under the customary international law standard of treatment embodies in Article 1105(1)\".1697 Something \"more than simple illegality or lack of authority under the domestic law of a State is necessary to render an act or measure inconsistent with the customary international law requirements of Article 1105(1)\".1698 Relying on *Waste Management II*, the *GAMI* tribunal stated that:\n\nA claim of maladministration would likely violate Article 1105 if it amounted to an 'outright and unjustified repudiation' of the relevant regulations. There may be situations where even lesser failures would suffice to trigger Article 1105. It is the record as a whole\u2013not dramatic incidents in isolation\u2013which determines whether a breach of international law has occurred.1699\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States [II]*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, at para 138.\n\n*ADF Group Inc v.

Mexico*, UNCITRAL Final Award, November 15, 2004, at para 103.\n\n741.\n\nSimilarly, relying on *S.D. Myers*, the *Cargill* tribunal found that: \"arbitrariness may lead to a violation of a State's duties under Article 1105, but only when the State's actions move beyond a merely inconsistent or questionable application of administrative or legal policy or procedure to the point where the action constitutes an unexpected and shocking repudiation of a policy's very purpose and goals, or otherwise grossly subverts a domestic law or policy for an ulterior motive\".1700\n\n*Cargill, Inc. v. Mexico*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/02, September 18, 2009, at paras 293, 293 (summation of standard).\n\n742.\n\nFurther, the fair and equitable treatment standard is not part of the non-discrimination standards of investment law, such as MFN or national treatment clauses \u2013 it does not hinge on a comparison between the investor and third parties but \"is an absolute standard that provides a fixed reference point\".1701 This reference point is not domestic law or the treatment of third parties, but the minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law.1702\n\n*Garanti Koza LLP v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/20, Award, December 19, 2016, at para 380, citing Christoph Schreuer, \"Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice\", (2005) Journal of World Investment and Trade 6, at 367.\n\n*Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. The Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award, June 25, 2001, at para 367.\n\n**(b) Whether Canada Breached its Obligation under Article 1105**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n743.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal restates that it does not have jurisdiction to rule on the claim for breach of Article 1105 in relation to the LRR, as it held earlier that the LRR was not attributable to the Respondent.1703 As a reminder, the alleged municipal \"property tax relief\" is excluded as well by virtue of the Tribunal's Jurisdiction Decision regarding taxation measures.1704 That being said, the Tribunal will proceed to the analysis of the remaining measures.\n\nSee *supra*, at Paragraph 303 of this Award.\n\nSee Jurisdiction Decision, at para 325 *et seq*.\n\ni. Whether GNS's conduct merits deference\n-----------------------------------------\n\n744.\n\nArbitral tribunals adjudicating fair and equitable treatment claims, whether under Article 1105 or under similar investment treaty provisions, have consistently exercised caution in approaching claims of violation of minimum treatment standards, especially in respect of State actions on matters of domestic policy that generally are treated with deference. For example, the tribunal in *S.D. Myers* explained that the determination whether there is a breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment \"must be made in the light of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders\";1705 this approach was affirmed by the *Saluka* tribunal.1706 As a result, the Respondent's actions fall within the present Tribunal's purview but to establish a breach of the minimum standard of treatment requires finding grossly unfair or unreasonable treatment, precisely because this claim concerns actions that generally merit deference.\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, November 13, 2000, at para 263 (**CL-102**).\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, March 17, 2006, at para 305.\n\n745.\n\nThe evidence on record does demonstrate that, to some extent, GNS sought to support the continued operation of the Mill's SC Paper machine, as its closure would have negatively affected the public interest at large. As demonstrated by the Respondent (and not contradicted by the Claimant), the permanent closure of the Mill would have had a serious impact on the Nova Scotia economy, including job losses in a rural part of the province and a significant reduction of Nova Scotia's GDP. It would seem credible that the financial support provided to PWCC at least partly helped the company preserve an efficient and relatively new and local SC Paper machine, which continued operation arguably had positive spill-over effects through the economy. Further, the closure of the Mill would have resulted in NSPI losing its largest customer, entailing the risk of a negative impact on ratepayers.1707\n\nSee Respondent's Counter-Memorial, at paras 306-309; Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at paras 153-154; Hearing on the Merits and Damages, November 9, 2020, at 173:8-175:25.\n\n746.\n\nIn sum, States' policy decisions within their own jurisdiction merit deference. They do not, solely for that reason, gain immunity from international obligations. In order to find a breach of the State's obligations under the international minimum standard of treatment, a positive showing must be made that the purpose or character of the challenged actions violated this standard of treatment. On the basis of the evidence presented to the Tribunal, it cannot be established that GNS acted on anything but rational and legitimate policy goals through measures falling within the scope of government prerogatives. Equally, it has not been demonstrated that the Respondent has conducted itself in a manner that exceeded the ambit of decisions that ought to receive deference insofar as the minimum standard of treatment is concerned.\n\nii. Whether GNS knew that the Assistance Measures could cause Resolute harm\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n747.\n\nThe Parties disagreed whether GNS knew that its Assistance Measures would harm the Claimant's investment in Qu\u00e9bec. Fair and equitable treatment is an 'objective' standard. For example, a violation of Article 1105 does not require proof of bad faith: \"a State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith\".1708 The subjective standard of knowledge\u2014just like bad faith\u2014is not required to establish a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, October 11, 2002, at para 116.\n\n748.\n\nNevertheless, a showing of bad faith constitutes strong evidence of a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.1709 The same cannot be said of knowledge: in contrast to bad faith, mere knowledge is a neutral state of mind. Whether or not the Respondent knew that the Assistance Measures could cause harm to the Claimant is immaterial as long as the Respondent did not violate the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. Furthermore, as the Tribunal is of the opinion that GNS's conduct merited deference, the alleged knowledge of the likely harm caused by PHP's re-entry into the market did not, by itself, make the Respondent's conduct manifestly unfair or unreasonable.\n\n*Cargill, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, September 18, 2009, at para 296.\n\n749.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal does not need to determine for application of this standard whether the Respondent knew about the detrimental effects its Assistance Measures could cause to the Claimant.\n\niii. Whether the Assistance Measures helped PHP allegedly become the \"lowest-cost producer\" of SC Paper\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n750.\n\nThe Claimant stressed that the Assistance Measures made PHP the lowest-cost producer of SC Paper. Whether or not this was the case, putting a third party in an advantageous position does not *per se* give rise to a breach of Article 1105, which provides for an absolute standard. Thus, the reference point to appraise fair and equitable treatment cannot be the treatment PWCC received, but the minimum standard of treatment afforded to aliens under customary international law.\n\n751.\n\nThe tribunal in *Methanex* dealt with the question whether Article 1105 barred a host State from differential treatment of nationals and aliens and found that customary international law\u2014and thus Article 1105\u2014did not prohibit such differentiation.1710 The Claimant failed to convince this Tribunal that it should come to a different conclusion than the *Methanex* tribunal. More specifically, the Claimant did not prove that customary international law prohibits a State from assisting a third party in cutting its costs to become one of the most competitive businesses in the industry. In the absence of such a prohibition under customary international law, the alleged \"better treatment\" of PWCC is not *per se* a violation of Article 1105.\n\n*Methanex Corp. v. United States of America*, Final Award, August 3, 2005, Part IV, Chapter C, at para 25.\n\n752.\n\nThus, for the purpose of Article 1105, the Tribunal does not need to compare the treatment of the Claimant to the treatment of PWCC. As a result, the Tribunal does not need to enter into the discussion as to the specific value of the Assistance Measures provided to PHP by GNS, nor the question as to the Claimant's contentions regarding the benefits PWCC received or the impact of the Mill's reopening on its Qu\u00e9bec mills.\n\niv. Whether GNS was under an obligation to let the Mill fail\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n753.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the EY Report is not necessarily flawed in its focus on Canada, as this is the relevant jurisdiction at issue. Furthermore, the EY Report may be valuable to establish the relevant facts, even if the report's purpose was not to identify customary international law through an assessment of State practice and *opinio juris*. It is also clear, however, that the persuasive force of the EY Report is affected by the parameters set by Claimant, which were capable of steering the conclusions.\n\n754.\n\nEven if taken at face value, the EY Report would only prove the preferential treatment of PWCC. It does not show that the distinction between PWCC and all other businesses was unjust, let alone a violation of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.\n\n755.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share the Respondent's criticism to the Claimant's use of the registry kept of CCAA cases by the Office of Superintendent in Bankruptcy and Monitors' reports (the \"**Registry**\") as proof of State practice with regard to financial assistance provided to unviable corporations. There is no reason why the Registry could not carry some evidentiary value. However, the Registry only provides limited and inconclusive evidence: the Claimant itself received assistance measures by GNS, which is a clear instance of countervailing practice. Furthermore, the Registry can neither show widespread State practice nor does it prove any *opinio juris*.\n\n756.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Respondent was under no obligation under the minimum standard of treatment as defined by customary international law to let the PHP Mill fail. The evidence of highly favorable treatment of PWCC and PHP does not suffice to demonstrate a violation of this standard on its own.\n\nv. Whether GNS's conduct violated the principle of proportionality\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n757.\n\nProportionality is a fluid concept, it does not enable investors to second guess acts of governments in a way that was not intended by the NAFTA drafters. With one tenuous exception,1711 tribunals have not accepted proportionality as a stand-alone criterion to assess whether the host State has afforded fair and equitable treatment. Instead, investment tribunals\u2014including those referred to by the Claimant\u2014apply a proportionality test as part of their appraisal of other manifestations of the fair and equitable treatment standard, such as due process or arbitrariness.1712\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Award, May 25, 2004, at para 109.\n\nAugust Reinisch and Christoph Schreuer, *International Protection of Investments: The Substantive Standards* (Cambridge University Press, 2020) at 447, para 980.\n\n758.\n\nThe Tribunal does not follow the Respondent's argument that there is no legal or factual basis to entertain a claim of disproportionate assistance in international law.1713 However, even if the Tribunal agreed that such a line of inquiry was appropriate under the customary minimum standard of treatment, it would not find a breach in this case in light of the high measure of deference afforded to the Respondent to attain its legitimate policy objectives.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, at para 150.\n\nvi. Whether Resolute's decision to shut down Bowater Mersey despite accepting financial assistance from GNS affects its claim under Article 1105\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n759.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it would be disingenuous for the Claimant to denounce GNS's financial support to PHP when it accepted a $50 million financial package from GNS (plus the potential for an additional $40 million) under similar circumstances.1714 The Claimant has given its explanation of the difference between its position and the Respondent's, describing its return to GNS of funds referenced by the Respondent with the aim to undermine the factual basis for the argument advanced by the Respondent. Putting that aside, however, the Tribunal notes that disingenuity may be a moral but not a legal qualification and does not affect the existence of a legal claim.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, at para 302, referring to Claimant's Memorial, at para 241; Witness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, April 17, 2019, at paras 9-12.\n\n760.\n\nAlthough neither Party invokes the clean hands doctrine explicitly, it constitutes a possible argument why Resolute's acceptance of financial assistance might be of legal relevance to the case. However, multiple reasons speak against this: first, the clean hands doctrine typically affects the admissibility of a claim, whereas the Respondent's invocation of the Claimant's own conduct was an argument on the merits of the fair and equitable treatment claim. Second, the clean hands doctrine has generally been rejected in investment arbitration.1715 Finally, the clean hands doctrine requires that the \"claim itself [be] based upon the unlawful act\"1716 of the claimant. As stated above, the Claimant's acceptance of financial assistance for a mill it subsequently shut down may raise question whether its complaint about assistance to PWCC should be viewed as \"disingenuous\", but that would not make its behavior unlawful. Accordingly, there is no basis to argue that the Claimant resorted to investment arbitration with unclean hands.\n\n*Hulley Enterprises (Cyprus) Limited v. Russia*, PCA Case No. AA-226, Final Award, July 18, 2014, at paras 1358-59; more generally, see *Guyana v. Suriname*, PCA Case No. 2004-04, Award, September 17, 2007, at paras 417-422.\n\nBin Cheng, *General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals* (Cambridge University Press, 1953), at 156.\n\nvii. Whether Resolute's decision not to bid on the Mill affects its claim under Article 1105\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n761.\n\nIn its pleadings, the Respondent stressed that the Claimant had been given the same opportunity to bid for the PHP Mill as the ultimate winner of the bid, PWCC. However, [REDACTED] the Claimant decided not to participate in the bidding.\n\n762.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Resolute's decision not to bid on the Mill could in principle affect its claim under Article 1105. Multiple investment tribunals have found that there was no breach of fair and equitable treatment if an investor was harmed by the economic consequences that emanated from the risk of its own business decisions: \"investment tribunals have held that the investor would in principle have to take the consequences following from its own failure in this respect\".1717\n\n*UAB E energija (Lithuania) v. Republic of Latvia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/33, Award, 22 December 2017, at para 837; see also *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, September 11, 2007, at para 336; *Cargill, Inc. v. Republic of Poland*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/2, Final Award, March 8, 2008, at para 510; *El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, October 31, 2011, at para 374.\n\n763.\n\nUnder the circumstances of the case at hand, the Claimant was aware of the economic outlook of the declining SC paper industry. Against the backdrop of this economic environment, the Claimant took the business decision not to bid on the PHP Mill and thus accepted the risk that another corporation might take over the Mill and enter into competition with the Claimant. In this connection, the Tribunal considers that it would have been reasonable for the Claimant to anticipate that the Respondent would offer financial assistance to corporations in the SC paper industry\u2014the Claimant itself was in discussions with GNS at the time for such assistance for Bowater Mersey.1718 As held above under Article 1102(3) at Paragraph 565, the Claimant confirmed at the 2021 Hearing that Resolute considered financial assistance by GNS as part of its decision whether to put in a bid for the Port Hawkesbury Mill. It might not have been reasonable for the Claimant to anticipate that the Respondent's financial assistance would be as extensive as it turned out to be; the Tribunal does not need to decide the matter conclusively. Even if the extent of the Respondent's financial assistance was not foreseeable, the Respondent's actions would not be considered manifestly unfair or unreasonable *ipso facto*.\n\nSee Witness Statement of Duff Montgomerie, April 17, 2019, at paras 9, 20, where he states: \"at the time NPPH entered CCAA creditor protection in early September 2011, we were already engaged in discussions with Resolute regarding financial support for its Bowater Mersey mill. During meetings with Resolute in September 2011, I encouraged Resolute to consider submitting a bid for the Port Hawkesbury mill. Mr. Garneau was non-committal\".\n\n764.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that Resolute's decision not to bid on the Mill does not change the Tribunal's finding that the treatment accorded by the Respondent was not manifestly unfair or unreasonable.\n\nviii. Conclusion\n----------------\n\n765.\n\nWhether or not the Claimant's own business decision respecting bidding on PHP led to the damage allegedly sustained by it, the Claimant failed to show that the GNS's Assistance Measures to PWCC violated the minimum standard of treatment owed to the Claimant under customary international law. As a result, the Tribunal concludes that Canada has not breached its obligations under Article 1105.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. R****elevant** **L****egal** **P****rovisions**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n766.\n\nNAFTA Article 1135(1) permits the Tribunal to \"award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules\".\n\n767.\n\nUNCITRAL Rules Article 38 states:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\n768.\n\nUNCITRAL Rules Article 39 states in relevant part:\n\n(1) The fees of the arbitral tribunal shall be reasonable in amount, taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject-matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the case.\n\n769.\n\nUNCITRAL Rules Article 40 states in relevant part:\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n(2) With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n**B. F****ixing of the** **C****osts under** **A****rticle** **38**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n770.\n\nUNCITRAL Rules Article 38 requires the Tribunal to \"fix the costs of arbitration\". The Tribunal will begin by fixing the costs under Article 38(a), (b), (c), (d), and (f) (the \"**Arbitration Costs**\"). It will then fix the \"costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable\" (the \"**Legal Costs**\") as described in Article 38(e).\n\n**1. Arbitration Costs**\n------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n771.\n\nThe Claimant notes that as at the date of the Revised Costs Submissions, it has deposited with the PCA US$ 950,000 to cover the fees, travel, and other expenses of the Tribunal and the fees and expenses incurred by the PCA.1719 Referring to UNCITRAL Rules Article 40(1), Resolute submits that it incurred travel and lodging expenses for witnesses that travelled to Toronto for the hearing on jurisdiction.1720\n\nClaimant's Revised Costs Submission, Annex, Tab: \"Summary\".\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 27.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n772.\n\nThe Respondent notes that as at the date of the Revised Costs Submissions, it has deposited with the PCA $1,031,363.00 to cover the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the cost of other assistance required by the Tribunal.1721\n\nRespondent's Revised Costs Submission, at 1.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n773.\n\nIn accordance with UNCITRAL Rules Article 39, \"the fees of the arbitral tribunal shall be reasonable in amount, taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject-matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the case\".\n\n774.\n\nIn Paragraph 19.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties agreed that:\n\nEach member of the Tribunal shall receive:\n\n19.1.1 a fee of USD 3,000, or such other fee as may be set forth from time to time in the ICSID Schedule of Fees, for each day of participation in meetings of the Tribunal or 8 hours of other work performed in connection with the proceeding or pro rata;\n\n19.1.2 subsistence allowances and reimbursement of travel (in business class) and other expenses within the limits set forth in Regulation 14 of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations and the Memorandum on the Fees and Expenses of ICSID Arbitrators.\n\n775.\n\nBy correspondence dated November 30, 2021 and December 3, 2021, and upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Parties each agreed to modify Procedural Order No. 1 going forward such that the arbitrators may claim reimbursement at cost of all their reasonable travel and other expenses in connection with case-related matters.\n\n776.\n\nIn the course of these proceedings, the Parties have made advance payments with the PCA of a total of US$ 1,900,000, that is, US$ 950,000 each.\n\n777.\n\nThe Tribunal fixes its fees and expenses, as per UNCITRAL Rules Articles 38(a) and (b), as follows:\n\n778.\n\nJudge James Crawford (until May 31, 2021): US$ 279,281.00 in fees and US$ 9,888.80 in expenses.\n\n779.\n\nProfessor Bernard Hanotiau (from August 10, 2021): US$ 170,625.00 in fees and US$ 10,629.36 in expenses.\n\n780.\n\nProfessor C\u00e9line L\u00e9vesque: US$ 430,312.50 in fees and US$ 3,882.37 in expenses.\n\n781.\n\nDean Emeritus Ronald A. Cass: US$ 551,059.50 in fees and US$ 5,135.26 in expenses.\n\n782.\n\nIn accordance with UNCITRAL Rules Article 38(c), and Paragraph 20 of Procedural Order No. 1, the PCA's fees and expenses for registry services in assistance of the Tribunal amount to US$ 195,283.04 and US$ 24,299.08 respectively.\n\n783.\n\nBy correspondence dated April 24, 2020, the Parties agreed, upon Judge Crawford's invitation, to the appointment of Professor Freya Baetens as Judge Crawford's assistant in these proceedings. The Parties agreed that Professor Baetens would be remunerated at EUR 235 per hour and would be able to claim back reasonable expenses. In accordance with UNCITRAL Rules Article 38(c), Professor Baetens' fees for assisting Judge Crawford whilst he was the Presiding Arbitrator amount to US$ 61,320.15.\n\n784.\n\nOther arbitration costs incurred pursuant to UNCITRAL Rules Article 38 and approved by the Tribunal in the course of these proceedings, including costs associated with the reservation of meeting and hearing facilities, the organisation of virtual proceedings, court reporting, IT support, courier costs, bank costs, communications, and supplies amounts to US$ 158,283.79.\n\n785.\n\nAccordingly, the total Arbitration Costs per UNCITRAL Rules Article 38 (excluding Legal Costs) are fixed in the amount of US$ 1,900,000.\n\n**2. Legal Costs**\n------------------\n\n786.\n\nUNCITRAL Rules Article 38(e) requires the Tribunal to fix the \"costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable\".\n\n787.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out below the amounts of costs for legal representation and assistance that are claimed by each of the Parties. The figures below are drawn from the Parties' Revised Costs Submissions. Each Party maintains that the costs it incurred are reasonable, given the novelty, seriousness, and complexity of the claim.1722\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 2; Respondent's Costs Submission, at para 18.\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Arguments**\n--------------------------------\n\n788.\n\nResolute submits that it incurred the following legal costs, amounting to $ 2,824,388.49 and US$ 6,440,293.59:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fees and expenses of BakerHostetler | US$ 4,955,287.35 |\n| Fees and expenses of NortonRoseFulbright | $ 2,402,355.51 |\n| Fees of KPMG | $ 154,666.04 |\n| Fees of GLM | $ 50,319.00 |\n| Fees and expenses of CapitalTrade, Dr. Jerry Hausman, and Mr. Seth Kaplan | US$ 1,485,006.24 |\n| Fees and expenses of Ernst & Young | $ 217,047.95 |\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n789.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it has incurred the following legal costs, amounting to $ 5,843,868.03:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fees of legal representatives at the Trade Law Bureau | $ 4,496,880.11 |\n| Fees of Cohen Hamilton Steger, AFRY/P\u00f6yry, and Core Legal | $ 1,545,456.39 |\n| Additional expenses (including travel costs of legal representatives, costs of administrative services and supplies, purchase of a collection of RISI price forecasts). | $ 84,502.78 |\n\n**(c) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n790.\n\nThe first step that is required by UNCITRAL Rules Article 38 is the identification of the \"successful party\". Having prevailed in the merits and damages phase of this arbitration, the Respondent is to be considered the \"successful party\" for the purposes of fixing costs. It is therefore unnecessary to fix the costs of the Claimant's legal representation and assistance. The degree of the Respondent's success, and the extent to which it should be taken into account in the apportionment of costs under UNCITRAL Rules Article 40, is dealt with in the subsequent section.\n\n791.\n\nNo objection has been raised by the Claimant regarding the quantum of Legal Costs that have been calculated by the Respondent. Indeed, the Tribunal notes that the Legal Costs of the Respondent are lower than those of the Claimant.\n\n792.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to fix, for the purposes of UNCITRAL Rules Article 38(e), the Respondent's reasonable costs for legal representation and assistance at $ 5,843,868.03.\n\n**C. A****pportionment of** **C****osts**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant's Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n793.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent should bear the Claimant's arbitration and legal costs.\n\n794.\n\nReferring to NAFTA Article 1135(1) and UNCITRAL Rules Article 38, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal may determine the reasonableness of any costs claimed and apportion these depending on the circumstances of the case.1723 According to the Claimant, the factors relevant to determining the allocation of costs include the relative success of the parties, whether the claims were serious, and whether unnecessary costs or delays were attributable to either party.1724\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at paras 3-4.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 7.\n\n795.\n\nThe Claimant argues that should it be wholly successful in the arbitration, Canada should pay all of Resolute's legal and arbitration costs.1725 Should it be partially successful, Resolute contends that Canada should be ordered to pay part of Resolute's arbitration and legal costs.1726\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 8.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 8.\n\n796.\n\nShould it not be successful, Resolute argues that the Tribunal should not award costs in Canada's favour for the following reasons.1727 First, Resolute notes that it prevailed in the jurisdictional phase and therefore the Tribunal should award Resolute its costs incurred in opposing Canada's motions on jurisdiction and admissibility.1728 Second, Resolute contends that its claims were serious, presented novel issues, and were compelled by underlying unfairness.1729 According to Resolute, the fact that it prevailed in the jurisdictional phase is evidence of the seriousness of its claims.1730 To demonstrate the seriousness of its claims, Resolute also recalls its arguments regarding the losses it suffered due to GNS's enrichment of PHP, noting that this outcome was foreseen by GNS and prompted a countervailing duty investigation.1731 Resolute argues that it was compelled to bring this case due to the unfairness of the actions of GNS and Canada.1732 It submits that Canada displayed \"reckless disregard\" for the Claimant's investments.1733 Further, Resolute argues that its efforts at seeking amicable resolution of this dispute were unreciprocated by Canada.1734 Resolute notes that Canada \"invited\" this NAFTA litigation by not declaring that the measures taken by GNS were subsidies before the WTO.1735 Resolute further submits that its claims present novel and complex issues regarding the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1102, the impact of \"self-contradiction\" in international fora, the ability of a State to invoke public interest as a \"complete defense\", and methods of calculating damages.1736 Resolute recalls that this arbitration also required a complex factual and damages analysis.1737\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 8.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 9.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at Part III.B.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 10.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 12.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 13.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 14.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at paras. 15-17.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 19.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 20.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at para 22.\n\n797.\n\nResolute submits that costs should be allocated to Canada for causing delays, noting that Canada delayed the production of a key document, Exhibit R-161.1738\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, at paras 23-24.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n798.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Resolute should bear all of Canada's costs of arbitration. Canada submits that it should in no circumstances bear any of Resolute's costs, even if a breach of NAFTA is found.1739\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 1.\n\n799.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Resolute's claims lack merit.1740 It reiterates that the Claimant's national treatment argument must fail because Article 1102 is not applicable in light of Article 1108(7) and because Resolute cannot prevail on the treatment \"in like circumstances\" test.1741 The Respondent submits that Resolute relies on factual misrepresentations in support of its argument that Canada breached the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.1742 The Respondent recalls that Resolute itself has benefited from a $50 million financial assistance package from GNS and chose not to bid on PHP.1743\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 2.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 7.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 8.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 9.\n\n800.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it should be awarded the full amount of its costs even though it did not prevail on jurisdiction.1744 The Respondent highlights that the claims nearly violated the three-year limitation period and were \"close to the line\" on the \"legally significant connection\" test.1745 The Respondent notes that the Claimant included at the merits stage claims that were ruled to be outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction in the jurisdictional phase.1746\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 10.\n\nRespondents Costs Submission, at para 10.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 10.\n\n801.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the same problems concerning attribution that plagued the Claimant's Article 1110 claim (which was eventually abandoned), continue to affect its claim under Article 1105.1747 The Respondent notes that Resolute refused Canada's proposal that Resolute withdraw its claim and share costs equally.1748\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 11.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 11.\n\n802.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's approach to damages justifies an order of costs in Canada's favor.1749 The Respondent argues that the Claimant made it difficult to assess the basis of its damages claim and produced \"multiple and significantly fluctuating numbers\" with every submission.1750\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 12.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 12.\n\n803.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant should bear its own costs even the Tribunal finds a breach of NAFTA.1751 The Respondent argues that it was Canada, rather than Resolute, that proposed a \"reasonable and coherent approach\" to quantifying damages.1752 The Respondent characterizes the Claimant's approach to damages as being \"manifestly untenable and confused\"; the Claimant did not follow the advice of its expert and eventually abandoned the damages request in its Reply Memorial altogether.1753\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 14.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 15.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, at para 16.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n804.\n\nAfter fixing the costs of the arbitration, the UNCITRAL Rules require the Tribunal to exercise its discretion in apportioning the costs of arbitration.\n\n805.\n\nUnder the UNCITRAL Rules Article 40(1), there is a presumption that the unsuccessful party bears the Arbitration Costs, subject to any determination by the Tribunal as to what apportionment may be reasonable in the circumstances of the case.\n\n806.\n\nIn the present matter, the Claimant is the unsuccessful party overall. However, as the Claimant has pointed out, the Respondent had raised objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction in the first, bifurcated phase of these proceedings that were not successful. The Tribunal affirmed in the Jurisdiction Decision its jurisdiction to decide the Claimant's claims concerning the Assistance Measures, excluding only the interim measures that were taken to keep the Port Hawkesbury Mill in operation and certain claims concerning taxation measures.1754 Therefore, the Respondent was the unsuccessful party overall in the jurisdiction phase of this Arbitration.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, at para 330.\n\n807.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to depart from the general presumption in UNCITRAL Rules Article 40(1) and to apportion the Arbitration Costs between the Parties, as follows: one third to be paid by the Respondent and two thirds to be paid by the Claimant. Given that the Arbitration Costs total US$ 1,900,000.00, the above apportionment means that the Respondent must bear US$ 633,333.33 and the Claimant US$ 1,266,666.67 of the total Arbitration Costs.\n\n808.\n\nThe Tribunal directs that, in addition to bearing its share of the Arbitration Costs, the Claimant shall reimburse the Respondent for that part of the Respondent's deposit in excess of the Respondent's apportioned share of the Arbitration Costs, i.e., US$ 316,666.67.\n\n809.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the UNCITRAL Rules Article 41(5) states that \"[a]fter the award has been made, the arbitral tribunal shall [\u2026] return any unexpended balance to the Parties\". The Tribunal notes that there is no unexpended balance to return to the Parties.\n\n810.\n\nUnder the UNCITRAL Rules Article 40(2), there is no presumption as to where the Legal Costs should lie. The Tribunal is free to determine which party shall reasonably bear those costs in the circumstances of the case.\n\n811.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it apposite to make the following observations in connection with the allocation of Legal Costs.\n\n812.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that the present case raised serious and difficult legal issues for the Parties and the Tribunal. In its Costs Submission, the Claimant highlighted the complexity of the issues surrounding the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1102, the arguments on \"self-contradiction\", and the methods of calculating damages. The Tribunal adds to this list the interaction between NAFTA Article 1102 and Article 1108 and the navigation of NAFTA language that was not defined by the NAFTA parties.\n\n813.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal notes that, through the course of the proceedings, neither Party distracted the Tribunal from its analysis of the core issues in this case, by withholding relevant information or by forwarding unnecessary or frivolous arguments. The Tribunal's conclusion is not altered by the Claimant's criticism of the Respondent's alleged delay in producing the [REDACTED] nor the Respondent's arguments concerning the Claimant abandoning its NAFTA Article 1110 claim and its alleged delay in bringing this Arbitration.\n\n814.\n\nThird, both Parties conducted themselves with good faith and congeniality through the proceedings. No undue costs or delay was introduced to the proceedings due to the conduct of either Party. The Tribunal is grateful to the Parties for their collaboration in the smooth organisation of two significant virtual hearings on the merits and damages. The Tribunal is also grateful for the Parties' cooperation and patience in ensuring that the reconstituted Tribunal was fully briefed on this matter in the most efficient manner possible.\n\n815.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, and exercising its discretionary powers under the UNCITRAL Rules Article 40(2), the Tribunal orders that the Claimant and the Respondent shall each bear their own legal costs in full, without any recourse to the other.\n\n**VIII.
