Rather, it stems from the fact that even acknowledging the increased use of the \"costs follow the event\" rule in investment arbitration practice, any resulting full or partial cost shifting should be based on a number of criteria and give proper weight to the outcome of arbitral proceedings in their entirety.\n\n3.\n\nSince my co-arbitrators and I seem to agree on the use of such a flexible principle of cost allocation, I all the more regret that we were unable to arrive at the same result in applying it.\n\n4.\n\nAs outlined in the Award, the Claimant's prayer for relief with respect to its costs is set out in paragraphs 442 and 443 of the Award. The Claimant sought reimbursement of costs in the total amount of EUR 3,083,279.25, including a success fee, or, alternatively, of costs in the amount of EUR 1,688,928.85, without a success fee.\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent's prayer for relief with respect to its costs is set out in paragraphs 447 and 448 of the Award. The Respondent requested reimbursement of costs in an amount of no less than EUR 166,555.28.\n\n6.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n7.\n\nArticle 61(2) and further provisions in Articles 28 and 47(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules give no clear guidance as to the manner in which costs should be allocated as between the Parties and thus endows the Tribunal with wide discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the parties as it deems appropriate.1\n\n*See e.g.* *GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft* v. *Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/16, Award, 31 March 2011, para. 362 (\"Article 61(2) does not prescribe a particular test for tribunals to assess costs, nor does it place any restrictions on a tribunal's ability to do so. In light of this, the Tribunal understands the power granted under this Article to be broad, allowing the Tribunal discretion in making its determination.\"); *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited* v. *Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, para. 560 (\"[...] The Tribunal considers that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention gives it the power to award costs (defined to include legal fees, out of pocket expenses as well as costs of the arbitration) and the discretion to decide at what level to do so. [\u2026].\"); *Plama Consortium Limited* v. *Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008, para. 316 (\"Article 61 of the ICSID Convention gives the Arbitral Tribunal the discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate. [\u2026].\").\n\n8.\n\nThis wide discretion enjoyed by ICSID tribunals contrasts with the general rule in international commercial arbitration exemplified under the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules according to which the costs of the arbitration shall \"in principle\" be borne by the unsuccessful party.2\n\nArt. 42(1) UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010 (\"The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\").\n\n9.\n\nIn fact, in past ICSID practice, most tribunals have simply \"split the costs\" by deciding that each party should bear its own costs and that the costs of the tribunals and the Centre should be borne in equal shares by the parties. This public international law approach to allocating costs between the parties, often also referred to as the \"American\" rule because of its use in US domestic litigation, clearly prevailed until a few years ago.3\n\n*See e.g.* *Malaysian Historical Salvors SDN BHD* v. *Government of Malaysia*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/10, Award on Jurisdiction, 17 May 2007, para. 150 (\"The Tribunal is aware that, while it can order the losing party to pay all costs, it is common ICSID practice for each party to bear its own legal costs and for the arbitration costs to be divided equally regardless of the outcome of the arbitration.\"); *Bayview Irrigation District et al* v. *United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/1, Award, 19 June 2007, para. 125 (\"The claims were not frivolous, and they were pursued in good faith and with all due expedition. The claims were, equally, defended in good faith and with due expedition. Both sides agreed to the separation of the jurisdictional issue, and this proved a sensible and economical step. The Tribunal does not consider that there is any reason to depart from the normal practice in such cases, according to which each Party shall bear its own costs, and the costs of the Tribunal shall be divided equally between the Parties.\"); *EDF (Services) Limited* v. *Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, para. 322 (\"The Tribunal notes that the traditional position in investment arbitration, in contrast to commercial arbitration, has been to follow the public international rule which does not apply the principle that the loser pays the costs of the arbitration and the costs of the prevailing party. Rather, the practice has been to split the costs evenly, whether the claimant or the respondent prevails. See, as one example, *Metalclad v. Mexico* (5 ICSID Rep. 209 NAFTA/ICSID (AF), 2000), in which the claimant prevailed but still had to bear its own costs. The same approach of splitting all costs evenly was adopted in cases in which the State was the winning party. See as examples, *Tradex v. Albania* (5 ICSID Rep. 43 ICSID, 1999)), and the NAFTA case *ADF v. United States* (6 ICSID Rep. 449, 536-237 (NAFTA/ICSID) (AF), 2003) in which the losing investors were not ordered to pay the costs of the winner, but rather each party had to pay its own legal costs and to share the costs of the arbitration.\"); para. 324 (\"Even in very ICSID recent cases, there are examples of tribunals splitting the costs equally or in a manner not corresponding to the outcome of the case. Thus, in the 2008 case of *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners (United States) and Electroquil S.A. (Ecuador) v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19 (2008)) small sums of money were awarded to the claimants. While in another 2008 case, *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd (Bermuda) v. Peru* (ARB/03/28 (2008)), Claimant won a significant sum; nevertheless, the costs were divided equally. In the 2008 case *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* (ARB/05/22(2008)), the claimants won their claim as to liability but were unable to establish their damages. The Tribunal held that each party was to bear its own legal costs, and the costs of the arbitration were to be shared between the parties equally. In the December 2008 case of *TSA Spectrum de Argentina v. Argentina* (ARB/05/5 (2008)), the Tribunal decided that the costs of the arbitration were to be shared equally with each side to bear its own costs.\"); para. 325 (\"But the investment arbitration tradition of dividing the costs evenly may be changing, although it is a bit early to know whether a different approach is evolving.\n\n10.\n\nMore recently also ICSID tribunals have awarded costs (or parts of the costs) to the successful party in investment cases.4 This may involve the costs of the proceedings and also the costs of a party's legal representation. Such an approach, following the so-called \"loser pays\" principle or \"costs follow the event\" or \"English\" rule, intends to put the prevailing party in a position as if it would not have had to incur the costs of pursuing a claim or defending against it.5\n\n*See e.g.* *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L.* v. *Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006, para. 338; *Plama Consortium Limited* v. *Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008, para. 316; *Phoenix Action, Ltd.* v. *Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, para. 152; *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited.* v. *Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, para. 542; *Ioannis Kardassopulos and Ron Fuchs* v. *Republic of Georgia*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15, Award, 3 March 2010, para. 692.\n\n*See e.g.* *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited* v. *Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, para. 563 (\"[\u2026] The present Tribunal is of the view that a rule under which costs follow the event serves the purposes of compensating the successful party for its necessary legal fees and expenses, of discouraging unmeritorious actions and also of providing a disincentive to over-litigation. [\u2026].\"); *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V.* v. *Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Award, 10 March 2014, para. 466 (\"There is no rule in ICSID arbitration that \u2018costs follow the event', nor does the broad body of arbitral practice suggest that this is the approach which should be followed in ICSID arbitration proceedings. However, in the exercise of its discretion to allocate costs, the Tribunal has the authority to award all or part of a party's costs of the arbitration and its legal fees and expenses. Taking into account all factors in this case, the Tribunal has decided partially to apply this principle.\").\n\n11.\n\nIn this situation, and absent a clear indication in the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, it would be incorrect, however, to consider that one approach clearly prevailed over the other. Rather, tribunals remain vested with the broad discretion inherent in Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n12.\n\nThe practice of ICSID tribunals also demonstrates that, in order to exercise such discretion in a rational way, they have taken into account a number of factors6 to justify their cost decisions:\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc.* v. *Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Reconsideration and Award, 7 February 2017, para. 620 (\"In the Tribunal's view, the apportionment of costs requires an analysis of all of the circumstances of the case, including to what extent a party has contributed to the costs of the arbitration and whether that contribution was reasonable and justified. This analysis should start by considering whether a party has prevailed on its claims, and if it has prevailed only in part, whether the rejected claims were reasonable or frivolous. It should also take into account the procedural conduct of the parties, and in particular whether such conduct delayed the proceedings or increased costs unnecessarily. The Tribunal notes that both Parties appear to be in agreement with these main principles: each Party considers itself to be the prevailing party, and as such seeks the recovery of all of its costs. In addition, each Party considers that the other party's conduct justifies a full award of costs in its favor.\" [Footnotes omitted]); *Orascom TMT Investments S.a r.l.* v. *People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, para. 584 (\"In reaching its decision on costs in this case, the Tribunal has in particular considered the following circumstances. First, the outcome of the case is ultimately favorable to the Respondent, as the Tribunal has decided that all of the Claimant's claims are inadmissible. Second, the Tribunal has also found that the Claimant's pursuit of the claims in this arbitration amounts to an abuse of rights. These two reasons justify that at least a significant proportion of the overall costs be borne by the Claimant. At the same time, the Claimant has prevailed on the Respondent's objections on *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae* jurisdiction. Considering the length of the submissions and the time devoted at the Hearing to those two objections, the costs incurred in relation to these two objections were certainly significant. While these objections were not frivolous and the Respondent was entitled to raise them, they were ultimately rejected, and it is thus fair that the outcome of such objections be taken into consideration in the Tribunal's decision on cost allocation.\").\n\n13.\n\nFirst, when assessing the outcome of the proceedings it is necessary to look at the overall outcome of the case and not merely on whether a claimant prevailed on a specific claim. This includes both the jurisdictional and admissibility aspects as well as the merits of a case. Equally, the quantum of the ultimate decision has to be put in relation to the compensation or damages originally claimed in order to assess the relative \"success\" of the parties.\n\n14.\n\nSecond, investment tribunals are empowered to take into account the behavior of parties instituting proceedings. This includes issues of *bona fides*, for example, the question whether claims are brought in good faith or reflect harassing litigation, but also whether claims are fraudulently instituted7 or whether investments are structured for the sole purpose of instituting investment arbitration.8 ICSID tribunals have been quite explicit in awarding costs against a party in case of abuse of process9 and frivolous proceedings.10 Likewise, the good faith of a host state should be taken into account when assessing its action even though it may be qualified as a breach of investment standards.11\n\n*See e.g.* *Europe Cement Investment & Trade SA* v. *Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/07/2, Award, 13 August 2009, para. 185 (\"In the circumstances of this case, where the Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the claim to jurisdiction is based on an assertion of ownership which the evidence suggests was fraudulent, an award to the Respondent of full costs will go some way towards compensating the Respondent for having to defend a claim that had no jurisdictional basis and discourage others from pursuing such unmeritorious claims.\"); *Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" SA* v. *Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/06/2, Award, 17 September 2009, para. 178 (\"In the circumstances of this case, the Arbitral Tribunal intends to employ this principle [\"costs follow the event\"] for the following reasons: - The Claimant has filed a fraudulent claim; - The Claimant has failed on all its requests for relief; - The Claimant has delayed the present arbitration proceeding and therefore raised its costs; [\u2026].\").\n\n*See e.g.* *Phoenix Action Ltd.* v. *Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, para. 151 (\"[\u2026] In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal intends to employ this principle [\"costs follow the event\"]. The Tribunal has concluded not only that the Claimant's claim fails for lack of jurisdiction, but also that the initiation and pursuit of this arbitration is an abuse of the international investment protection regime under the BIT and, consequently, of the ICSID Convention. It is also to be noted that the Claimant filed a request for provisional measures which was rejected in its entirety by the Tribunal and which added to the costs of the proceeding. The Respondent has been forced to go through the process and should not be penalized by having to pay for its defense.\").\n\n*Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A.* v. *Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/17, Award, 9 January 2015, para. 201 (\"The Tribunal is of the view that a finding of abuse of process justifies an award of costs against the unsuccessful party. Thus, the Claimants shall pay for the entirety of the costs of the proceedings, *i.e.* for the costs of the Arbitral Tribunal and for the costs of the proceeding. [\u2026].\").\n\n*Saba Fakes* v *. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010, paras. 153-154 (\"In light of the Tribunal's finding that the Claimant's claim was brought before the Centre on the basis of a transaction that did not correspond to an arrangement that was meant to deploy any legal consequences other than on paper and, as a result, plainly could not fulfil the requirements of an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(b) of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that the Claimant bear in full his legal fees and expenses, as well as the arbitration costs [\u2026]. For the same reasons, the Tribunal also considers it appropriate that the Claimant bear the Respondent's legal fees and expenses. A party pursuing a claim which is clearly outside the scope of the Centre's jurisdiction should not be encouraged, and should bear the risk of paying the full costs of such frivolous proceedings. [\u2026].\").\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc.* v. *Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Reconsideration and Award, 7 February 2017, para. 621 (\"In the Tribunal's view, after a consideration of all the relevant circumstances, the principles above may be adjusted to take into account that the respondent is a sovereign State. In particular, it considers that, even if a tribunal finds that a State has breached its international obligations vis-avis an investor, consideration must be given to the State's motives and good faith. In particular, where the actions of a State have been guided by its good faith understanding of the public interest and the State could reasonably doubt that it was breaching its international obligations, the Tribunal may consider it appropriate to apportion costs in a manner that alleviates the burden on the respondent State. These considerations apply to situations in which the State is the respondent, not the claimant.\").\n\n15.\n\nThird, ICSID tribunals are empowered to take into account the behavior of the parties during the proceedings.12 This may include poor and inefficient pleadings, in applying various forms of abusive, harassing or delaying tactics or in engaging in various other forms of inappropriate litigation techniques. The absence of such party behavior clearly points towards abstaining from any cost shifting.13\n\n*See e.g.* *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited* v. *Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, para. 562 (\"In this regard [allocating costs], the Tribunal has considered, among other things, the following factors: [\u2026] the conduct of the Parties during the proceedings;\").\n\n*See e.g.* *Crystallex\u00a0International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, paras. 959 et seq. (\"Furthermore, none of the facts that would clearly justify cost allocation (such as bad faith, abusive or unreasonable argument, or obstructions tactics) was present in this arbitration. To the contrary, each side presented valid arguments in support of its respective case and acted fairly and professionally. In particular, the extensive pleadings of both Parties greatly assisted the Tribunal in its task. [\u2026] Having considered all these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that each Party should bear its own costs and the Parties should equally share the ICSID costs. [\u2026]\").\n\n16.\n\nFurther, tribunals should take into account a number of additional factors, such as the reasonableness of the costs claimed, in particular, in relation to the size, complexity, and significance of the case, but also in relation to the costs claimed by the other party. Similarly, the question whether a dispute leads to a \"clear-cut\" case or whether the outcome was indeed \"close\" should be a factor in whether or not to allocate costs.\n\n17.\n\nOn the basis of these general considerations, I consider that in the present case the following elements are relevant to the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion: *(i)* the Claimant succeeded with its claim for a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT, but its claim for breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT as well as all other claims was dismissed; *(ii)* the Claimant's success on its FET claim was not a clear-cut case, as demonstrated by the Tribunal's thorough analysis above, since most of the alleged violations of Article 3(1) of the BIT did not amount to such breaches; *(iii)* the Claimant succeeded with its claim for damages only to an extent of approximately 16% of the amounts originally claimed (cf. EUR 1,585,000.00 awarded with EUR 9,820,000.00 claimed at Cl. Mem., para. 370); *(iv)* the Parties did not engage in any practices demonstrating a lack of good faith when instituting the present proceedings nor did either of them apply any subsequent abusive, harassing or delaying tactics during the proceedings; *(v)* the Claimant unusually claimed a success fee for its legal counsel resulting in a total fee claim that exceeded the Respondent's almost 20 times, even the costs without success fee (of EUR 1,688,928.85) exceeded the Respondent's claimed costs (of EUR 166,555.28) by a factor of 10.\n\n18.\n\nIn these circumstances and considering that the claims were not frivolous, were pursued and defended in good faith and with all due expedition, led to an outcome that only partially resulted in the Claimant prevailing, albeit at a disproportionately higher cost of litigation, I do not consider that there is any reason to depart from the traditional practice in ICSID cases that each Party shall bear its own costs.\n\n19.\n\nI would thus consider it appropriate that the Parties bear their own costs and should each pay half of the costs and expenses incurred by the Tribunal and of the charges of the Centre with regard to the present arbitration proceedings."}], "Content": "Award of the Tribunal\n---------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| i.

It is a limited liability company established under the laws of the Republic of Lithuania and incorporated in Lithuania.3 E energija carries out business in the energy sector and has, in particular, a number of concessions for central heating services in Lithuania, Ukraine and Latvia.\n\nC-1.\n\n3.\n\nE energija indirectly owns 58% of the shares in SIA Latgales Ener\u0123ija (\"Latgales Ener\u0123ija\"), a limited liability company established under the laws of the Republic of Latvia and incorporated in Latvia.4 E energija incorporated Latgales Ener\u0123ija as the entity through which it would invest in the concession for district heating in the Latvian city of R\u0113zekne (the \"R\u0113zekne Project\").\n\nRfA \u00b6 5, see also paragraph 74 below.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Latvia (\"Latvia\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties\". The Parties' respective representatives and their addresses are listed in page (i) above.\n\n6.\n\nThe dispute relates to the rights asserted by the Claimant under the BIT against the Republic of Latvia in connection with the R\u0113zekne Project.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 15 August 2012 ICSID received a request for arbitration from the Claimant against the Republic of Latvia, together with Exhibits C-1 through C-33 and Legal Authorities CLA-1 through CLA-22 (the \"Request\" or \"RfA\").\n\n8.\n\nOn 15 October 2012 the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request, as supplemented by letters dated 14 September 2012, 4 October 2012 and 10 October 2012, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute a Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n9.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the Parties, the Claimant elected to submit the arbitration to a three-member Tribunal, as provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n10.\n\nOn 8 March 2013 Mr. Samuel Wordsworth QC, a British national, accepted his appointment by the Claimant as arbitrator.\n\n11.\n\nOn 22 April 2013 Prof. Dr. August Reinisch, an Austrian national, accepted his appointment by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 June 2013 Dr. Paolo Michele Patocchi, a Swiss national, accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n13.\n\nOn 12 June 2013 the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was, therefore, constituted on that date. Ms. Geraldine R. Fischer, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nOn 11 September 2013 the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties in London. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed, *inter alia*, that: *(i)* the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006; *(ii)* the procedural language would be English, and *(iii)* the place of the proceedings would be London, United Kingdom. The Parties agreed on a timetable for the jurisdictional/merits phase of the proceedings, including production of documents. On 10 October 2013, after consultation with the Parties, the President of the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 which embodied the Parties' agreements on procedural matters including the procedural timetable (the \"Timetable\", Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1).\n\n15.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 2 of 26 November 2013 the Tribunal modified the Timetable further to the Claimant's application.\n\n16.\n\nOn 6 December 2013 the Claimant filed a Memorial with the following supporting documents:\n\n\u2022 Witness Statement of Mr. Virginijus Strioga (\"CWS-1\");\n\n\u2022 Witness Statement of Mr. Aleksas Jautakis (\"CWS-2\");\n\n\u2022 Witness Statement of Ms. Svetlana Rogozina (\"CWS-3\");\n\n\u2022 Witness Statement of Ms. Evisa Uskane (\"CWS-4\");\n\n\u2022 Witness Statement of Mr. Levs Voronovs (\"CWS-5\");\n\n\u2022 Expert Report on *Quantum* from Dr. Serena Hesmondhalgh of The Brattle Group (\"ER Hesmondhalgh I\");\n\n\u2022 Factual Exhibits C-34 to C-215; and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities CLA-23 to CLA-42.\n\n17.\n\nOn 18 April 2014 the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Preliminary Objections (\"Preliminary Objections\") and Request for Bifurcation (\"Request for Bifurcation\") and Counter-Memorial on the Merits with the following supporting documents:\n\n\u2022 Expert Report on Valuation Quantification of Damages Prepared by Mr. Michael Peer of KPMG Baltics SIA (\"ER Peer I\");\n\n\u2022 Factual Exhibits R-1 to R-14 ; and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities RLA-1 to RLA-15.\n\n18.\n\nIn its Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation the Respondent requested *inter alia* that the Tribunal stay the proceedings.\n\n19.\n\nOn 1 May 2014 the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal regarding the Respondent's submission of 18 April 2014, stating that such submission did not contain an application for bifurcation. The Claimant further requested confirmation that the Tribunal would proceed in accordance with the Timetable set out in Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1 of 10 October 2013 (\"Applicable Timetable if Tribunal Decides to Join Preliminary Objections to the Merits\").\n\n20.\n\nOn 5 May 2014 the President of the Tribunal directed the Respondent to clarify by 12 May 2014 whether it sought bifurcation, and, if so, on what basis. The Tribunal also directed the Claimant to answer the Respondent's letter of 12 May 2014 as well as the Respondent's request for a stay of proceedings by 19 May 2014.\n\n21.\n\nOn 12 May 2014 the Respondent submitted its Clarificatory Statement on its Request for Bifurcation stating that it sought bifurcation.\n\n22.\n\nOn 19 May 2014 the Claimant submitted its Response opposing the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation.\n\n23.\n\nOn 30 May 2014 the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 3 denied the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation and joined the Respondent's \"preliminary objections\" to the merits, stating that a further decision setting out reasons would be sent to the Parties as soon as possible in the following weeks. The Tribunal also denied the Respondent's application for a stay of these proceedings pending a final and binding decision by the courts of Latvia on Case No. C03051107. On 21 January 2015 the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 3 *bis* gave reasons for its decision declining the bifurcation and the stay of proceedings sought by the Respondent.\n\n24.\n\nOn 18 August 2014 the Tribunal ruled on the Parties' requests for production of documents in Procedural Order No. 4.\n\n25.\n\nOn 1 October 2014 the Tribunal decided on certain document production issues and amended the Timetable in Procedural Order No. 5.\n\n26.\n\nOn 10 October 2014 the Claimant filed a Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections with the following supporting documents:\n\n\u2022 Second Witness Statement of Mr. Virginijus Strioga (\"CWS-6\");\n\n\u2022 Second Witness Statement of Mr. Aleksas Jautakis (\"CWS-7\");\n\n\u2022 Second Witness Statement of Ms. Svetlana Rogozina (\"CWS-8\");\n\n\u2022 Second Expert Report on *Quantum* from Dr. Serena Hesmondhalgh of The Brattle Group (\"ER Hesmondhalgh II\");\n\n\u2022 Expert Report of Dr. Dagnija Blumberga (\"ER Blumberga I\");\n\n\u2022 Factual Exhibits C-216 to C-252; and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities CLA-43 to CLA-45.\n\n27.\n\nOn 12 December 2014 the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Preliminary Objections with the following supporting documents:\n\n\u2022 Third Expert Report on Quantification of Damages prepared by Mr. Michael Peer of KPMG Baltics SIA (\"ER Peer III\");5\n\n\u2022 Factual Exhibits R-15 to R-21; and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities RLA-16 to RLA-19.\n\nER Peer I was filed by the Respondent on 18 April 2014, see paragraph 17 above. ER Peer III \u00b6 1.2.1 mentions an ER Peer II dated 1 September 2014, which was KPMG's re-calculation of the heating tariffs and the underlying detailed calculations obtained from the Regulator's archive which the Respondent provided to the Claimant in the document production phase pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4 \u00b6 13. ER Peer II was not filed in these proceedings.\n\n28.\n\nOn 2 January 2015 the Claimant filed a Rejoinder on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections.\n\n29.\n\nOn 19 January 2015 the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organisational meeting with the Parties via telephone conference. The Tribunal then decided the points of procedure and organisation in dispute between the Parties in Procedural Order No. 6 of 16 February 2015.\n\n30.\n\nOn 9 February 2015 the Parties filed their Skeleton Arguments.\n\n31.\n\nA hearing on the Preliminary Objections and the Merits took place from 23 to 27 February 2015 in London, United Kingdom (\"Hearing\"). In addition to the Members of the Tribunal, the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Hearing was attended by the following persons:\n\nFor the Claimant:\n\nMr. George Burn Vinson & Elkins\n\nMr. Alexander Slade Vinson & Elkins\n\nMs. Ciara Ros Vinson & Elkins\n\nMr. Agris Repss Sorainen\n\nMr. Martins Paparinskis Sorainen\n\nMs. Zydruole Azukiene UAB E energija\n\nMs. Raminta Barauskiene UAB E energija\n\nMs. Ilinca Popescu The Brattle Group\n\nFor the Respondent:\n\nMr. Ivars Mekons Latvian State Chancellery\n\nMr. Ermins Darapolskis Attorney, the R\u0113zekne Municipality\n\n32.\n\nThe following persons were examined:\n\nOn behalf of the Claimant:\n\nMr. Virginijus Strioga UAB E energija\n\nMr. Aleksas Jautakis UAB E energija\n\nMs. Evisa Uskane SIA Latgales Ener\u0123ija\n\nDr. Serena Hesmondhalgh The Brattle Group\n\nDr. Dagnija Blumberga Riga Technical University\n\nOn behalf of the Respondent:\n\nMr. Michael Peer KPMG\n\nMr. Andris Purins KPMG\n\n33.\n\nIn addition to the examination of the persons mentioned above, the Tribunal heard opening and closing arguments.\n\n34.\n\nAn audio recording and a full transcript of the Hearing was provided to the Parties.\n\n35.\n\nDuring the Hearing, on 23 February 2015 the Claimant objected to the introduction of new documents by the Respondent. On the same day the Claimant nevertheless consented to the inclusion of Exhibit R-22. The Tribunal subsequently admitted Exhibit R-23.\n\n36.\n\nOn 26 February 2015 the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 7 authorised the Respondent to file a short report setting out Mr. Peer's comments on the new points made by Dr. Hesmondhalgh at the Hearing. The Claimant was in turn authorised to file its comments on such short report.\n\n37.\n\nOn 9 March 2015 the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 8 confirmed the directions given to the Parties at the Hearing with respect to the specific questions on which the Parties were entitled to file short submissions.\n\n38.\n\nOn 20 March 2015 the Claimant filed its submission to answer the questions set out in the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 8 including sixteen exhibits containing English translations of Latvian statutes, which the Tribunal renumbered in accordance with applicable procedural rules as follows:\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities CLA-46 (first translation) to CLA-61 (last translation).\n\n39.\n\nOn the same day the Respondent filed its submission to answer the questions set out in the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 8 with the following supporting documents:\n\n\u2022 Fourth Expert Report on Quantification of Damages prepared by Michael Peer of KPMG Baltics SIA (\"ER Peer IV\");\n\n\u2022 Expert Report regarding Loans and Guarantees provided in the context of Damages prepared by Michael Peer of KMPG Baltics SIA (\"ER Peer IVB\");\n\n\u2022 Factual Exhibits R-22 to R-35; and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities RLA-20 to RLA-39.\n\n40.\n\nOn 26 March 2015 the Claimant pointed out in a message to the Tribunal that the Respondent had disregarded the terms of Procedural Orders No. 1 and No. 8 by submitting new evidence with its submission of 20 March 2015. On 30 March 2015 the Claimant elaborated on its objection and requested that certain Factual Exhibits (R-24, R-25, R-26, R-27, R-28, R-29, R-30, R-32, R-33 and R-35) and Legal Authorities (RLA-21, RLA-22, RLA-24, RLA-34, RLA-37 and RLA-38) be struck off the record.\n\n41.\n\nOn 10 April 2015 the Claimant filed the Third Expert Report on *quantum* from Dr. Serena Hesmondhalgh of The Brattle Group (\"ER Hesmondhalgh III\"). The Claimant further reiterated its request that the Tribunal strike the Respondent's unauthorised documents from the record or permit the Claimant to respond to them.\n\n42.\n\nOn the same day the Respondent sought leave to comment on the Claimant's submissions dated 20 and 30 March 2015 and filed its Rebuttal Submission in accordance with Procedural Order No. 8, together with the following supporting documents:\n\n\u2022 Factual Exhibits R-36 and R-37.\n\n43.\n\nOn 15 April 2015 the Claimant objected to the Respondent's request to comment on its submissions of 20 and 30 March 2015 as well as to the filing of Exhibits R-36 and R-37.\n\n44.\n\nOn 13 May 2015 the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 9 authorised the Parties to file a short rebuttal to the submissions filed on 20 March 2015 and indicated that, upon the filing of such rebuttal, no further submissions would be admitted. The Parties filed their rebuttal submissions by 1 June 2015 in accordance with Procedural Order No. 9.\n\n45.\n\nOn 21 October 2016 the Claimant informed ICSID that all the proceedings to which Latgales Ener\u0123ija had been a party before the Latvian courts had been concluded, that all funds that had been frozen had been paid out by the court and that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had not received any amount out of such funds.\n\n46.\n\nOn 11 November 2016 the Respondent replied in accordance with the Tribunal's directions of 26 October 2016 that *(i)* Case No. C03051107 had been concluded by a judgment of the Supreme Court of Latvia dated 30 November 2015 and made available in a full version on 12 February 2016; Latgales Ener\u0123ija had not challenged that judgment and therefore the Claimant had accepted the economic outcome of the whole dispute; *(ii)* on 11 August 2016 the bailiff had issued the calculation regarding the distribution of the seized funds, which was not challenged by Latgales Ener\u0123ija either; the Respondent confirmed in its letter \"the fact that the Claimant has not received any amount back from the previously seized funds\";6 contending that such circumstance could not be relied upon against it under the Treaty; and *(iii)* the Respondent maintained its position on double-counting.\n\nHowever, the Respondent further stated that \"the Claimant has now, after proper local adjudication, been entitled to the previously seized funds (without prejudice to the reasonable demand that its subsidiary shall pay out its debts, and having been given the opportunity to challenge bailiff's actions with regard to the current distribution of the previously seized funds)\".\n\n47.\n\nOn 11 November 2016 the Tribunal invited further comments from the Parties limited to five pages, and indicated that either Party was authorised to produce the 30 November 2015 judgment; the Parties' comments were received on 6 and 19 December 2016 respectively.\n\n48.\n\nOn 6 December 2016 the Claimant replied that by its previous communication it had simply intended to inform the Tribunal of the final outcome of one factual issue on which the Parties' experts had expressed an opinion, namely that there might be a double recovery in case the Claimant or Latgales Ener\u0123ija had ever recovered part of the frozen funds. The Claimant rejected the points made by the Respondent, confirming that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had not received any funds and was not entitled to receive any; it also provided a breakdown showing that the majority of the funds were paid to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli (more precisely EUR 1,282,246.76 out of EUR 1,571,697.66).\n\n49.\n\nOn 19 December 2016 the Respondent sent its comments, to which it attached *(i)* the Supreme Court judgment dated 30 November 2015 in Case No. C03051107, *(ii)* the decision of the judge of the Chamber of Civil Cases of the Supreme Court dated 29 June 2016 dismissing Latgales Ener\u0123ija's application for cassation filed against the 30 November 2015 judgment as well as two further exhibits. The Respondent first summarised the Parties' respective cases in its submission, and then commented on the \"special role attributed by the Claimant to civil case No. C03051107\". The Respondent pointed out that the 30 November 2015 judgment decided that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was under a duty to pay the full price of the natural gas supplied, and not only to the extent of the latest natural gas tariff approved by the Regulator. As to the allocation of Latgales Ener\u0123ija's frozen funds decided by the bailiff, the figures indicated by the Respondent are not entirely in line with those indicated by the Claimant (according to the Respondent EUR 123,115.49 were allocated to a debt owed to JSC Lariva, the assignee of Explicit Consulting Group Ltd.; EUR 1,092,006.06 to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli); that was said to be a normal distribution of the funds in enforcement proceedings and the funds were therefore to be regarded \"under the Treaty, as released from injunction to the benefit of the Claimant\". The Respondent concluded that the Claimant by its conduct in relation to the Latvian proceedings as a whole expressed \"[its] interest and willingness to abide by the final verdict in domestic civil procedure No. 03051107 (...)\".\n\n50.\n\nOn 7 September 2016 the Tribunal was informed that the Respondent was no longer represented by Mr. Ivars Mekons but rather by Ms. Ilze Dubava and Ms. Nerika Lizinska, legal advisers with the State Chancellery of Latvia. On 8 September 2017 the Tribunal was further informed that Mr. George Burn left Vinson & Elkins who continued to be instructed in the present matter. The Claimant requested all future correspondence to be addressed to Mr. Mark Beeley and Mr. Alexander Slade.\n\n51.\n\nThe proceedings were closed on 11 October 2017.\n\n**III. FACTS**\n--------------\n\n52.\n\nIn this section of the present Award the Tribunal will outline the facts of the case as far as possible in chronological order from 2004 onwards. The facts of the case are uncontested to a considerable extent.\n\n**A. Heating in Rezekne and the 2004 Gas Supply Agreement (2004)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe city of R\u0113zekne, the capital of the Latvian eastern province of Latgale, is the seventh largest city in Latvia. It had a population of approximately 25,000 inhabitants in 2004 when the Parties started their talks. R\u0113zekne was then in a region with a high unemployment rate, low wages, a negative migration rate and low economic activity.7\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.2. See also Gas Supply Agreement, C-40 p. 3, \u00b6 E. These factors are also described in the \"Guidelines for the Development of the R\u0113zekne City Heat Supply System\" submitted by Latgales Ener\u0123ija to the Municipality (see paragraph 164 below), C-44 pp. 6-9.\n\n54.\n\nThe R\u0113zekne Municipality, which at the relevant time controlled the body regulating district heating services in R\u0113zekne, acts through its decision-making body, the R\u0113zekne City Council (\"RCC\"), comprised of local politicians appointed in local elections.8\n\nOn the 2005 elections, see paragraphs 128 and 139 ff. below.\n\n55.\n\nIn Latvia the heating supply for a city, town or a district is centralized; heat and hot water are piped directly into homes and businesses from a number of large boiler houses. District heating providers owned and controlled by the local municipalities and having the status of municipality undertakings supply heating to consumers and small businesses. The heating provider in any one region enjoys a monopoly in the supply of district heating.9\n\nRfA \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n\n56.\n\nIn 2004 the heating system ran on black oil and diesel. These were amongst the most expensive fuels used for district heating in Latvia.10\n\nRfA \u00b6 22.\n\n57.\n\nThe Ministry of Economy of the Republic of Latvia had confirmed the need to switch from those fuels to natural gas and develop the infrastructure required in order for natural gas to be used.11\n\nSee paragraph F of the Gas Supply Agreement, C-40, p. 3.\n\n58.\n\nHeating prices (\"tariffs\") were regulated by the State in order to protect the interest of users.12\n\nSee Sect. 5 of the Public Utility Regulators Act (CLA-49) and Sect. 3 of the Energy Act (CLA-48).\n\n59.\n\nThe body in charge of setting tariffs for district heating services for the territory of R\u0113zekne was the Multi-Industry Public Utility Regulator of the Latgale Municipalities (the \"Regulator\") at all relevant times for the purposes of these proceedings. The Regulator had been established by 31 Municipalities and had started to work in late August 2002.13\n\nC-36.\n\n60.\n\nThe tariff in force when the heating system was leased to Latgales Ener\u0123ija in spring 2005 was LVL 21.50/MWh for residents and LVL 22.26/MWh for other users14 in accordance with the Regulator's decision No. 9 dated 10 November 2003.15\n\nMs. Rogozina explains in her first Witness Statement that \"other users\" is a general expression including companies owned by public entities, private companies as well as individual merchants (CWS- 3 \u00b6 11).\n\nThis decision is recalled in the Regulator's decision No. 18 of 2 November 2005 (C-77 [page 1]). See also the first Witness Statement of Ms. Rogozina, CWS-3 \u00b6 15.\n\n61.\n\nPrior to 2015, district heating and hot water had been provided by AS R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli (\"R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\"), a public limited liability company16 wholly owned by the R\u0113zekne Municipality.17\n\nSee the Long-Term Agreement, C-4 p. 4, Clause 1.1(g) and C-4 p. 7, Clause 3.2.1(a); see also the first whereas clause of the February 2005 Agreement, C-8 [page 8].\n\nSee the first whereas clause of the Long-Term Agreement, C-4 p. 4, the first whereas clause of the February 2005 Agreement, C-8 [page 8] and Clause 1 of the February 2006 Agreement, C-16. R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli acknowledged that it was wholly owned by the R\u0113zekne Municipality in proceedings it brought before the Latvian courts, as noted by the Supreme Court of Latvia in its decision of 7 April 2014, R-8 \u00b6 11.\n\n62.\n\nR\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had been operating the system at a loss, and, by mid-2004, it was in default with respect to its obligations to suppliers. The system was \"highly subsidized and economically inefficient\"18 also due to technical causes.19 R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli took out loans from AS \"Latvijas Unibanka\" (\"Latvijas Unibanka\")20 and AS \"Baltic Trust Bank\"21 (\"Baltic Trust Bank\"). The loans were secured by pledges granted by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and the Municipality over their real estate.22 There was a risk that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli might be unable to ensure the supply of heating services during the heating season of September 2004-May 2005.23\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.1.\n\nFor instance, the central boiler house in Rancana iela had been commissioned back in 1975 and heat loss in the underground heat networks reached a figure of 20% (C-44 p. 12; 14); the majority of the heating lines were installed in the 1970s and 1980s and their life cycle was of some 20 years (C-44 p. 14).\n\nSee Clauses 2.1.1, 2.1.2 and 2.1.8 of the Guarantee Agreement, C-43, as well as Clause 3.2.2(b) of the Long-Term Agreement, C-4.\n\nSee Clause 3.2.2(b) of the Long-Term Agreement, C-4.\n\nSee Clause 2.1.5 of the Guarantee Agreement, C-43, and Clause 3.2.2(b) of the Long-Term Agreement, C-4. The former provision mentions \"the commercial pledge and mortgage\" provided by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli whereas the latter mentions only a \"mortgage\".\n\nSee the second whereas clause of the February 2005 Agreement (C-8 [page 8]) which reads as follows:  \n whereas the Council as the Lessor's shareholder organized a tender in 2004 on concession of the Lessor's heating supply resources and whereas the tender results were revoked, which resulted in insufficient amount of funds at the Lessor's disposal in the heating season 2004/2005 to settle accounts with its existing creditors, as well as to be able to provide fully-fledged heating supply services in the administrative territory of the R\u0113zekne city municipality.\n\n63.\n\nOn 29 April 2004 the R\u0113zekne Municipality, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and Latvijas G\u0101ze entered into a long-term gas supply agreement (the \"Gas Supply Agreement\")24 for a twenty-year period (Clause 19.2 of the Gas Supply Agreement). Under the terms of the agreement the R\u0113zekne Municipality undertook to purchase and pay a minimum quantity of natural gas each year (namely 87.5% of 24 million nm3 per year),25 and a failure to pay was sanctioned by a contractual penalty.26\n\nC-40; the full title of the agreement is \"Agreement No. 1580 on Construction of a New Natural Gas Infrastructure for Gasification of the City of R\u0113zekne Due to Long-Term Supplies of Natural Gas to the User for Combustion Facilities of Various Mutually Replaceable Fuels (Natural Gas and Oil Products)\".  \n This agreement was amended and supplemented by the parties on 1 June 2005, C-61, see paragraph 136 below and on 19 December 2005, C-81, see paragraph 160 below.\n\nC-40, Clauses 3.1 and 8.3.\n\nC-40, Clause 3.4.\n\n64.\n\nClause 8.3 of the Gas Supply Agreement provides that payments for the natural gas are made by the Municipality.\n\n65.\n\nClause 16.1 of the Gas Supply Agreement expressly states that the Municipality's liability under the terms of the agreement is maintained in case the Municipality were \"to authorise the User or another person to perform all the obligations or (...) part [of them] on behalf of the [R\u0113zekne] Municipality\".\n\n66.\n\nIn addition to the typical sale and purchase obligations in a gas supply agreement, the Gas Supply Agreement contains further provisions relating to the infrastructure required to use natural gas. Paragraph D of the preamble states that one of the purposes of the agreement \"... is [the] gasification of the City of R\u0113zekne requested by RPD [the R\u0113zekne Municipality] and the User...\". More specifically, Latvijas G\u0101ze undertook in Clause 2.2 to \"make all necessary investments in a new natural gas supply infrastructure\" up to the City borders. The Gas Supply Agreement further provides in Clause 2.4 that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli will for its part build \"gas pipes and equipment regulating gas pressure\" from its boiler house facade to the consumers' or other users' places.\n\n**B. The Original Arrangements and Main Events (End of 2004-2005)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Decision by the Rezekne Municipality to Have Recourse to a Foreign Investor in Order to Provide Heating Services (2004)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nIn early 2004 the R\u0113zekne Municipality called for tenders to improve the quality and the efficiency of the district heating system. Aside from a few indications in Mr. Strioga's first Witness Statement,27 the record contains limited information in this respect. Bidders were to submit their bids by 30 March 2004, 2:00 *p.m.* ; the bid opening would take place two hours later.28 The committee in charge would hold a closed session on the following day to select a bidder.29 It is common ground that, in the end, no suitable candidate emerged.30\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6\u00b6 7-10; Mr. Strioga was E energija's CEO and controlling shareholder at all relevant times.\n\nC-223.\n\nC-223.\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.1. See also the second whereas clause of the February 2004 Agreement, C-8 [page 8].\n\n68.\n\nThe R\u0113zekne Municipality then entered into direct negotiations with E energija and two Latvian companies, R.S. and SIA Wesemann.31\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6 9.\n\n69.\n\nOn 3 August 2004 the R\u0113zekne City Council adopted resolution No. 199 which authorised R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli to lease out its fixed assets, that is the heating infrastructure, for a long-term period \"taking into consideration the current actual and financial status of joint stock company R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli (\u2026)\".32\n\nR-24.1; this resolution is stated to be contained in Appendix No. 2B to the Long-Term Agreement, Art. 14 of the Long-Term Agreement, C-4 p. 37; however, such resolution is not part of Exhibit C-4 (either in the Latvian or the English language).\n\n70.\n\nOn 25 November 2004 Mr. Strioga, and Mr. Arnoldas Burkovskis, E energija's CFO, gave a presentation to the R\u0113zekne City Council.33 The purpose of the presentation was to persuade the Council that the privatization of the heating system was the better option.34\n\nC-41*.*\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6 11.\n\n71.\n\nThe presentation addressed in particular the investment that would be required as a matter of urgency, in an amount of EUR 7.7 million.35 In his witness statement Mr. Strioga indicated that such investment \"would have been made within 5 years (2006-2011)\"; the investment was divided into three phases, the third phase being so-called cogeneration.36\n\nC-41 [page 3]; broken down as follows: (i) replacement of boilers and boiler equipment: EUR 4.1 million; (ii) modernization of heat units: EUR 3.2 million and (iii) renovation of heating mains: EUR 0.4 million.\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6 14.\n\n72.\n\nThe presentation further dealt with R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's financial situation, including debts in an amount of LVL 1,190,000 and the aid from EU structural funds, which was regarded as insufficient.37 The involvement of an investor was presented as one possible solution, subject to a number of different commercial and legal arrangements.\n\nC-41 [pages 2-3].\n\n73.\n\nE energija's own proposal for the R\u0113zekne City Council completed the presentation. According to such proposal R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli could lease its heating infrastructure to E energija for a period of 20 to 30 years, in consideration of E energija's undertaking to invest an amount from EUR 10 to 12 million in the same period. Alternatively, the lease could relate to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli as a whole: \"lease of RS property or lease of RS itself (lease of business)\".38 The heating price would be reduced to 21.15 LVL/MWh from March 2005.39\n\nE energija would undertake to review the heat price taking into account changes only in the prices of gas, electricity and water as well as the impact of changes in inflation and taxation. E energija would further assume R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's debts and treat them as rent payment. Upon expiry of the lease the value of the heating infrastructure to be returned to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli would not be less than the value at the start of the lease period.40\n\nC-41 [page 4].\n\nC-41 [page 4].\n\nC-41 [page 4].\n\n**(2) The Incorporation of Latgales Ener\u0123ija (20 December 2004)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija was incorporated on 20 December 2004 as a limited liability company having its registered office in Riga, Latvia.41\n\nC-5; as of that date, E energija was Latgales Ener\u0123ija's sole shareholder with 200 shares with a nominal value of LVL 100 each (C-5 [page 14]), duly paid in (C-42 ; C-55).\n\n**(3) The Guarantee Agreement (30 December 2004)**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe renegotiation of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's debts took place in the latter part of 2004 and required a number of meetings and discussions.42\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6 21.\n\n76.\n\nOn 30 December 2004 E energija (as the \"Guarantor\") entered into a Guarantee Agreement with AS \"Latvijas Unibanka\" (\"Latvijas Unibanka\", as the \"Creditor\") (the \"Guarantee Agreement\")43 to provide \"guarantee and security\" with respect to the obligations arising under the \"Main Agreements\" entered into by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and Latvijas Unibanka. The bank held security over R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's assets and would not permit them to be leased without adequate security being provided, as explained by Mr. Strioga and Mr. Jautakis.44\n\nC-43. The Guarantee Agreement is set out in two-column format with the English and the Latvian texts in parallel; in case of discrepancies between the two texts, the English version shall prevail according to Clause 4.6. The Guarantee Agreement is stated to be governed by the laws of the Republic of Latvia (Clause 4.3).\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6 38 and CWS-2 \u00b6 23.\n\n77.\n\nThe amounts stated to be owed by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli as of the time of the execution of the Guarantee Agreement arose under different loans or credit lines, for a total amount of LVL 2,536,256.45 E energija undertook to guarantee such debts, unconditionally and irrevocably, having waived its right to demand that the Creditor should first assert its right to payment as against R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli as the Debtor.46\n\nThe amount set out above corresponded to both R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's short-time debts to Latvijas Unibanka mentioned in Clause 4.4.3(a) of the Long-Term Agreement and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's long-time debts to Latvijas Unibanka mentioned in Clause 4.4.4(a) of the Long-Term Agreement (see paragraphs 88 and 89 below).\n\nThe Guarantee Agreement related also to the obligations of the R\u0113zekne City Council as the guarantor with respect to the credit agreements mentioned in Clauses 1.6 and 1.7 of the Guarantee Agreement.\n\nC-43, Clauses 1.3 to 1.7. As explained by Mr. Jautakis in his first Witness Statement (CWS-2 \u00b6 24), these sums were then reflected in Clauses 4.4.3(a) and 4.4.4(a) of the Long-Term Agreement (C-4) and were \"taken over\" by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in due course, see paragraph 88 below.  \n The breakdown of the total amount was as follows:  \n (i) LVL 746,660 (under Credit Agreement No. RA 02155);  \n (ii) LVL 921,866 (under Credit Agreement No. RA 02219);  \n (iii) LVL 127,730 (under Credit Agreement No. RA 02300);  \n (iv) LVL 350,000 (under Credit Agreement No. RA 03357); and  \n (v) LVL 390,000 (under Credit Agreement No. RA 04454).\n\nC-43, Clauses 2.1 and 2.1.8\n\n**(4) The Agreement for Lease, Renovation and Operation of Long Term Assets (28 January 2005) (the \"long-term Agreement\")**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nA draft agreement was reviewed by representatives of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli, the R\u0113zekne City Council and Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 27 January 2005.47\n\nR-24 [pages 3-4].\n\n79.\n\nOn 28 January 2005 an agreement entitled \"Agreement for Lease, Renovation and Operation of Long-Term Assets\" was signed by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli (as the \"Lessor\") and Latgales Ener\u0123ija (as the \"Operator\") (the \"Long-Term Agreement\").48 The Long-Term Agreement is stated to be governed by the laws of the Republic of Latvia (Clause 11.1). The signature of the Long-Term Agreement had been authorised on the same day by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's Council upon the Board's request.49\n\nC-4; the Long-Term Agreement is set out in two-column format with the English and the Latvian texts in parallel; in case of discrepancies between the two texts, the Latvian version shall prevail according to Clause 13.4.\n\nR-24 [pages 2 and 5].\n\n80.\n\nThe first clause in the recitals of the Long-Term Agreement recalls the resolution of the R\u0113zekne City Council to \"allow R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli to lease out its fixed assets for a long-term period\". The second clause in the recitals of the same agreement mentions Latgales Ener\u0123ija's readiness and willingness \"to modernise the heating supply system\" and enable \"a transfer from heavy oil fuel to natural gas as a resource for heating energy production\", \"increase effectiveness of use of energy resources\" and \"fulfil the obligations of AS R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli against its creditors\".50\n\nC-4 p. 4.\n\n81.\n\nThe subject-matter of the Long-Term Agreement is set out in Clause 2.2 as follows:51\n\n2.2 The subject of the Agreement shall be lease of the Assets and investment into the Assets located in the city of R\u0113zekne and currently run by Lessor. By entering into the present Agreement the Lessor shall undertake to lease to the Operator the Assets, and the Operator shall undertake to use the Assets in order to operate the Business and settle accounts with the Lessor in the order and on conditions described in the Agreement.\n\n2.3 The Operator does not assume any liability or obligations of the Lessor and/or the Municipality other than liabilities directly undertaken under the Agreement.\n\nC-4 p. 6.\n\n82.\n\nThe term \"Assets\" is defined in Clause 1.1(a) of the Long-Term Agreement as \"all long-term assets\" owned by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli, including land, buildings, constructions, technological equipment and machines and other fixed and intangible assets set out in Appendix No. 1 to the Long-Term Agreement. R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli represented and warranted *inter alia* that it was the owner of the assets and had all agreements and employees to carry on the Business as a going concern.52\n\nC-4, Clause 3.2.4(a).\n\n83.\n\nThe term \"Business\" means \"the heat production, supply and division business and power generation business operated by the Lessor\".53\n\nC-4, Clause 1.1(b).\n\n84.\n\nThe Long-Term Agreement was entered into for a period of 30 years.54\n\nC-4, Clause 4.2.1.\n\n85.\n\nUpon expiry of the lease, all investments made by Latgales Ener\u0123ija as well as any improvements, modernization or rearrangement as well as any new structures would become the property of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli pursuant to the terms of a deed to be executed by reference to the market price at the time of the transfer.55 The Assets would be returned to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli in accordance with Clause 7.1.5 of the Long-Term Agreement.\n\nC-4, Clause 7.1.3.\n\n86.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija had the right, in its own discretion, to execute all works for major or current reconstruction or repair of the Assets necessary to renovate or modernize such Assets and to use them freely and without hindrance to supply heat and/or power to the consumers,56 all improvements to the Assets to be transferred to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli upon expiry of the lease.57\n\nC-4, Clauses 4.3.5 and 7.1.2, 2nd sentence.\n\nC-4, Clause 4.3.6.\n\n87.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija would own all revenue and profit received during the term of the lease and would be entitled to use such revenue and profit in its own discretion.58\n\nC-4, Clause 4.3.9.\n\n88.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija undertook to pay R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli an amount of LVL 5,100,000 in total including VAT, which amount included *(i)* the book value as of 1 January 2005 of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's short-time debts to creditors in an amount of LVL 1,448,977,59 which debts Latgales Ener\u0123ija agreed to \"take over from R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\",60 the creditors being Latvijas Unibanka, SIA \"AVT Nafta\" and SIA \"Dinaburga Rosme\", *(ii)* a yearly amount of LVL 200,000 to settle R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's debts in the first three years61 and a yearly amount of LVL 85,185 for each year of lease except in the first three years,62 as well as *(iii)* a further payment by Latgales Ener\u0123ija covering depreciation and an additional five percent of the book value of the Assets upon returning such Assets to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli.63\n\nThis amount was reassessed at LVL1,220,799.50 when the Assets and the Employees were taken over by Latgales Ener\u0123ija (C-49), see paragraph 119 below. It was then increased in 2006 in the Amended Long-Term Agreement, see paragraph 166 below.\n\nC-4, Clauses 4.4.1 and 4.4.3.\n\nC-4, Clause 4.4.1(a).\n\nC-4, Clause 4.4.1(b).\n\nC-4, Clause 4.4.2.\n\n89.\n\nIn addition to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's short-term debts, Latgales Ener\u0123ija was \"entitled\" under Clause 4.4.4 to \"take over\" R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's long-term debts to Latvijas Unibanka amounting to LVL 746,660 arising out of Credit Agreement No. RA 02155 and LVL 921,866 arising out of Credit Agreement No. RA 02219 (a total amount of LVL 1,668,526) as well as R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's long-term debts to Baltic Trust Bank in an amount of LVL 680,817.\n\n90.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija further undertook to take over all of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's employees (set out in Appendix 3) in accordance with Latvian Law.64\n\nC-4, Clause 5.\n\n91.\n\nClause 6 of the Long-Term Agreement deals with R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's rights and obligations in some further detail.\n\n92.\n\nClause 7 of the Long-Term Agreement deals with Latgales Ener\u0123ija's rights and obligations in some further detail; in particular Latgales Ener\u0123ija undertook to invest not less than EUR 1.5 million in the heat supply facilities within three years of the date on which the Long-Term Agreement had entered into force in order to ensure that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli could perform the duties owed to Latvijas G\u0101ze and undertaken under the Gas Supply Agreement65 (Clause 7.1.1), and to increase its share capital to LVL 500,000 within two weeks of the entry into force of the LongTerm Agreement (Clause 7.7).66\n\nC-40, see paragraph 63 above.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija's initial share capital as of December 2004 was of LVL 20,000, see paragraph 74 above.\n\n93.\n\nClause 8 deals with Latgales Ener\u0123ija's position as the Operator in relevant part as follows:67\n\n8.1 For the period the Agreement is valid, the Operator shall remain to be the exclusive heat supplier and shall undertake to supply heat and power energy to all the consumers who used to be supplied heat and power by means of the Assets leased according to the Agreement before the moment such Agreement has been signed.\n\n8.2 The Operator shall supply heat and power to the consumers and service heat, power and hot water supply systems following the technological obligations of the Operator stated by the laws. The order and conditions for servicing heat and power energy supply and systems of each consumer shall be defined in the agreement for supply of heat and power energy, consumption and payment to be signed with each consumer.\n\nC-4 pp. 29-30.\n\n94.\n\nThe Long-Term Agreement would enter into force provided that the conditions precedent in Clause 12.4 were met, including the execution of an agreement between the Municipality and Latgales Ener\u0123ija relating to the performance of the Long-Term Agreement in accordance with Clause 12.4.3 (this agreement was entered into on 10 February 2005, see paragraph 100 below).\n\n95.\n\nThe Long-Term Agreement contains express terms under which each party is entitled to terminate it unilaterally, provided that certain requirements are met. Clause 12.5.2 deals with unilateral termination by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and reads as follows:68\n\n12.5.2 Unilaterally by the Lessor in the event\n\na) the licence to perform Business is revoked due to fault of the Operator, or\n\nb) the Operator fails without any legal grounds to make the lease payments in the order set by the Agreement for more than three consecutive payments (months).\n\nIn such a case the Lessor shall warn and notify the Operator in writing about such default of the Agreement and fix the period of time of not less than 30 (thirty) days for the Operator to cure the default. In the event the Operator fails to cure the default, the Agreement shall be deemed to have been terminated on the end of the term specified in such notification.\n\nC-4 p. 33.\n\n96.\n\nClause 12.7 of the Long-Term Agreement states that neither party can terminate the Agreement under Clauses 12.5.2 or 12.5.3 \"during the period from July 1 to the end of the heating season next year of any calendar year\".\n\n97.\n\nClause 12 further deals with the monetary consequences of termination under Clause 12.5.2 in Clause 12.6 which reads as follows in relevant part:69\n\n12.6 Settlement of accounts between the Parties and sanctions in case the Agreement is terminated prior to its term set in Clause 4.2:\n\n12.6.1 In case the Agreement is terminated on the basis of the clauses 12.5.2 or 12.5.3, the Lessor must within 30 (thirty) days from the day the Agreement was terminated repay to the Operator all the investment the Operator has made into the assets leased (less depreciation) and take over all rights of claiming any consumers' unpaid amounts to the Operator for the nominal value of such debts (including interest and penalties) having accumulated within one year prior to the date of termination of the Agreement.\n\n12.6.2 In the event the Lessor terminates the Agreement on the basis of clause 12.5.2, the Operator shall pay the penalty fee to the Lessor equal to 10 (ten) per cent of the amount the Operator has invested (less depreciation) into the assets leased.\n\nC-4 p. 34.\n\n98.\n\nOn 28 January 2005 the R\u0113zekne City Council approved the Long-Term Agreement.70\n\nR-24 [page 6].\n\n99.\n\nThe Long-Term Agreement was amended by the parties on 10 February 2006 (see paragraphs 166 ff. below).\n\n**(5) The February 2005 Agreement (10 February 2005)**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe R\u0113zekne Municipality (through the R\u0113zekne City Council or the \"Council\") and Latgales Ener\u0123ija (as the \"Operator\") made an agreement on 10 February 2005 (the \"February 2005 Agreement\").71 The expression \"the Agreement\" in the February 2005 Agreement refers to the Long-Term Agreement72 and the \"Lessor\" to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli.73 As recalled in paragraph 94 above, the Long-Term Agreement itself contemplated the execution of a contract between the Municipality and Latgales Ener\u0123ija.\n\nC-8.\n\nC-8 [page 8], fourth whereas clause.\n\nC-8 [page 8], first whereas clause.\n\n101.\n\nUnder the February 2005 Agreement Latgales Ener\u0123ija undertook *inter alia* the following duties to the Council:\n\n(i) to provide centralized heating supply services in the city of R\u0113zekne (Clause 1.1);\n\n(ii) to maintain and repair where required the heating supply system to ensure good-quality heating supply services (Clause 1.2);\n\n(iii) to coordinate the reconstruction work relating to the heating infrastructure and to start construction work after obtaining the permit required to that effect (Clause 1.3);\n\n(iv) to take any steps as may be required, as soon as possible, to obtain the production, distribution and transfer licences from the competent authority (Clause 1.4);\n\n(v) to ensure that rates would be increased only due to force majeure or as a result of an increase in the prices of gas, electricity, water or other energy sources, provided that such increase had resulted in an increase of 5% in the costs of production, distribution or transfer of one unit of thermal energy, unless otherwise provided by law, rates to be adjusted in any event in accordance with Latvian law (Clause 1.6); and,\n\n(vi) to perform its obligations to the creditors of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli mentioned in the Long-Term Agreement (Clause 1.7).\n\n102.\n\nIn the February 2005 Agreement the R\u0113zekne City Council undertook *inter alia* the following duties to Latgales Ener\u0123ija:\n\n(i) not to hinder performance of the Long-Term Agreement by Latgales Ener\u0123ija (Clause 2.2) and,\n\n(ii) in accordance with Latvian law, to take all decisions required so that Latgales Ener\u0123ija could perform the Long-Term Agreement fully and without delay (Clause 2.8).\n\n103.\n\nAmong the terms setting out the R\u0113zekne City Council's duties to Latgales Ener\u0123ija, Clause 2.10 reads as follows in relevant part:74\n\n2.10 The Operator is and remains the only supplier of centralised heating to all consumers who received thermal energy from the Lessor at the moment that the Agreement is concluded. The Operator has the excusive rights to sell and supply centralised heating to residents, industrial consumers and cooperatives of residential houses in the city of R\u0113zekne. The Council undertakes not to adopt decisions and not to perform direct or indirect activities that would cause direct or indirect competition to the Operator's business in relation to the centralised heating supply and maintenance and servicing the heating supply networks, or any other operation undertaken by the Operator under the Agreement.\n\nThe Council undertakes to ensure that the municipality functions determined by the law with regard to provision of centralised heating services are not transferred to other persons and the municipality would not get involved in other projects of centralised heating supply, including installation of co-generation stations (\u2026).\n\nC-8 [page 10].\n\n104.\n\nThe February 2005 Agreement refers also to the Gas Supply Agreement75 in Clause 4 which reads as follows in relevant part:76\n\n4. The parties agree that the Operator is entitled to enter an agreement with AS \"Latvijas G\u0101ze\" on performance of Gas Purchase Agreement No 1580 [the Gas Supply Agreement, C-40]. If the mentioned agreement with AS \"Latvijas G\u0101ze\" is not entered and transfer to gas heating is delayed due to the Council or third party fault resulting in failure of AS \"Latvijas G\u0101ze\" to finish construction of natural gas infrastructure and preparation for operation in compliance with Gas Purchase Agreement No 1580, the Council undertakes to compensate the Operator for the losses incurred because the Operator keeps using black fuel oil instead of natural gas after the date when the natural gas infrastructure had to be constructed and prepared for operation in production of thermal energy under Gas Purchase Agreement No 1580 in the wording in force at the date of entering the Agreement.\n\nIn any case the Council is not released from obligations undertaken by Gas Purchase Agreement No 1580 on purchase of a specified amount of gas for the needs of the city of R\u0113zekne, and respectively - if these obligations are not performed and AS \"Latvijas G\u0101ze\" claims damages from the Council or the Lessor, or the Operator and/or a contractual penalty, the Council undertakes to pay AS \"Latvijas G\u0101ze\" for these losses and pay the contractual penalties.\n\nC-40, see paragraph 63 above.\n\nC-8 [page 12].\n\n105.\n\nThe February 2005 Agreement further makes provision in Clause 6 for the remedies in case of breach of contract (damages as well as a penalty).\n\n106.\n\nThe February 2005 Agreement was supplemented on 10 February 2006 (see paragraphs 169 ff. below).\n\n**(6) E Ener\u0123ija's Further Investment in the Capital of Latgales Energija (February-may 2005)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nIn February 2005 E energija sold 98 out of its 200 shares in Latgales Ener\u0123ija to Levs Voronovs, Juris Vanags, Martins Lauva and SIA Energo Sistemas, and its share in Latgales Ener\u0123ija's capital was reduced to LVL 10,200.77\n\nC-5 and CWS-2 \u00b6 9.\n\n108.\n\nFurther capital was contributed by all shareholders and E energija made a further contribution in an amount of EUR 300,000 and LVL 46,022.78 As a consequence, E energija's share in Latgales Ener\u0123ija's capital was equal to LVL 265,200 with a majority of 2,652 shares out of 5,200 shares as of 3 May 2005.79\n\nC-55 [page 3] and [page 5]; CWS-2 \u00b6 10.\n\nC-5 [page 15].\n\n**(7) Loans by E Ener\u0123ija to Latgales Ener\u0123ija (From February 2005 Onwards)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nE energija granted a number of loans to Latgales Ener\u0123ija from 18 February 2005 onwards.80 In the year 2005, E energia granted eight loans to Latgales Ener\u0123ija (one of which was increased from EUR 380,000 to EUR 1 million in the same year), for a total amount of EUR 2,325,000.81\n\nC-51 [pages 1-43]. This exhibit contains sixteen loans and/or amendments to existing loans granted by E energija to Latgales Ener\u0123ija from 2005 to 2007 included. The original version of the loans is in the Russian language (in four cases in the Russian and Latvian language).  \nCWS-2 \u00b6 14 with a table. The dates in the table fail to reflect the correction in handwriting for the first two loans which is March (not February, as indicated).\n\nC-51 ; Cl. Mem. \u00b6 43 mentions an amount of LVL 1,444,532 equal to EUR 2,055,383; however, the principal of all loans granted in 2005 is stated in EUR and the total amount is EUR 2,325,000.\n\n110.\n\nThe loans set out the borrower's duty to repay the loan with interest; they contain no provision as to their purpose or the manner in which the loan is to be used by the borrower, aside from the cases in which a loan was intended to consolidate or increase the amount of previous loans and a few other exceptions in cases where E energija would directly pay a third party. Mr. Jautakis explained in his first Witness Statement that E energija granted all of these loans in connection with Latgales Ener\u0123ija's obligations arising under the Long-Term and the February 2005 Agreements.82\n\nCWS-2 \u00b6 15.\n\n111.\n\nE energija granted three further loans to Latgales Ener\u0123ija in 2006,83 and four further loans, or amendments to pre-existing loans, were executed in 2007.84\n\nC-51 [pages 46-55], see also paragraph 197 below.\n\nC-51 [pages 59-69], see also paragraphs 312 ff. below.\n\n**(8) Rezeknes Siltumtikli's Assets and Employees Taken Over by Latgales Ener\u0123ija (25 February 2005)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nIt is common ground that the Long-Term Agreement entered into force in February 2005. On 25 February 2005 R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and Latgales Ener\u0123ija declared85 that the Assets and the Employees had been transferred to Latgales Ener\u0123ija in accordance with Clause 4.3.1 of the Long-Term Agreement.86\n\nC-9.\n\nC-4.\n\n113.\n\nThe licences required to operate the system were granted by the Regulator on 30 May 2005 (see paragraphs 129 ff. below). The record does not, however, indicate a precise date on which Latgales Ener\u0123ija started to operate the heating system.87\n\nRfA \u00b6 59 \"the middle of the heating season 2004/2005\".\n\n114.\n\nAfter taking over the heating system, Latgales Ener\u0123ija provided a continuous heating service in the city based on the tariff then in force.88\n\nRfA \u00b6 38.\n\n115.\n\nThe conversion of the heating system to natural gas would be ready only in November 2005 (see paragraph 156 below).\n\n116.\n\nAs explained by Mr. Strioga in his first Witness Statement, the old boilers were not replaced, but modified in order that they could burn both heavy fuel oil and natural gas, which enabled the Claimant to modernize the existing boiler houses with a comparatively small investment. The works were implemented by UAB Energijos Taupymo Centras (\"Energijos Taupymo Centras\" or \"ETC\"), the Claimant's parent company incorporated in Lithuania, together with the Russian producers of the boilers.89\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6\u00b6 4; 40.\n\n117.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija did not enter into any written agreement with R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli for the supply of natural gas. Nor did it succeed in entering into any agreement with Latvijas G\u0101ze or adhering to the Gas Supply Agreement existing between Latvijas G\u0101ze, the Municipality of R\u0113zekne and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli.90\n\nThe question whether Latgales Ener\u0123ija has nevertheless a duty to pay for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas G\u0101ze is in dispute in these proceedings, as it was in dispute in proceedings before the Latvian courts. The Tribunal's decision on this point is set out in paragraph 936 below.\n\nC-40, see paragraph 63 above. Latgales Ener\u0123ija's unsuccessful attempts to have a direct contract with Latvijas G\u0101ze are referred to in Latgales Ener\u0123ija's letter to the Regulator dated 28 October 2005, C-75; then in 2006 Latvijas G\u0101ze declined (C-88) the novation of the agreement proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija (C-86).  \n According to Mr. Strioga's first Witness Statement (CWS-1 \u00b6 20), the Municipality was under a contractual duty to take or pay a minimum amount of 21 million nm3 a year under the Gas Supply Agreement (C-40, Clause 3.1) in consideration for the large investment to be made in the heating infrastructure and Latvijas G\u0101ze had no interest to change its contracting parties.  \n In its judgment dated 7 April 2014 (R-8 \u00b6 11, see also paragraph 389 below) the Supreme Court of Latvia referred to a finding made by the court of first instance whereby the defendant (Latgales Ener\u0123ija) \"had not concluded an agreement with AS 'Latvijas G\u0101ze'\". This finding was not criticized by the Supreme Court.  \n The fact that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had no contract with Latvijas G\u0101ze is also mentioned in the preamble to the R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija Gas Supply Agreement (C-151).\n\n118.\n\nWhen Latgales Ener\u0123ija started to supply heating in 2005, it applied the tariff that had been granted to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli before the Long-Term Agreement91 and the February 2005 Agreement92 were entered into (see paragraphs 60 ff. above). However, Latgales Ener\u0123ija applied for a revised tariff on 13 October 2005 (see paragraphs 152 ff. below).\n\nC-4.\n\nC-8.\n\n119.\n\nOn 25 February 2005 the book value of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's short-time debts to creditors as of 1 January 2005, stated to be in an amount of LVL 1,448,977 in Clauses 4.4.1 and 4.4.3 of the Long-Term Agreement, was reassessed at LVL 1,220,799.50.93\n\nC-49. Latvijas Unibanka: LVL 865,420.26; AVT Nafta: LVL 226,870.33 and Dinaburga Rosme: LVL 128,509.00.\n\n**(9) R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's Short-term Debts Taken Over by Latgales Ener\u0123ija (From February 2005 Onwards)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nFrom February 2005 onwards Latgales Ener\u0123ija entered into a number of contracts to take over R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's debts in accordance with the Long-Term Agreement (see paragraph 88 above) and the February 2005 Agreement (see paragraph 101 above). The Amended Long-Term Agreement made on 10 February 200694 increased the amount of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's indebtedness (see paragraph 167 below).\n\nC-16.\n\n(A) R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's Indebtedness to AVT Nafta\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nOn 4 February 2005 SIA \"AVT Nafta\" (\"AVT Nafta\") assigned the debt it owned against R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli to Latgales Ener\u0123ija in an amount of LVL 240,000; the assignment agreement mentions that AVT Nafta obtained a loan from Latgales Ener\u0123ija in an amount of LVL 200,000, an amount which Latgales Ener\u0123ija instructed its bank to pay on 7 February 2005.95\n\nC-48 [page 2].\n\n122.\n\nOn 22 June 2005 a second assignment agreement was executed between the same parties with respect to a debt owned by AVT Nafta against R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli in an amount of LVL 250,000, which amount included the previous amount of LVL 240,000.96 Under Clause 3 of such second assignment, part of the price would be paid by Latgales Ener\u0123ija by setting off its claim for payment under the 4 February 2005 loan in an amount of LVL 210,000 (which included LVL 10,000 interest). Latgales Ener\u0123ija instructed its bank to pay the balance of LVL 40,000 on 19 June 2005.97\n\nC-58.\n\nC-48 [page 1], see also the explanations in Mr. Jautakis' first Witness Statement, CWS-2 \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n\n123.\n\nOn 27 June 2005 Latgales Ener\u0123ija and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli then agreed that \"the Company (Latgales Ener\u0123ija) (....) on 22 June 2005 settled liabilities towards SIA \u2018AVT NAFTA' in the total amount of LVL 250,000\".98 Latgales Ener\u0123ija and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli further agreed that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had therefore become a creditor of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli for such amount. The agreement further contemplated that such amount would be paid by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli under a separate agreement, under which R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli would set off its debt and consider that it had received an advance payment of the rent owed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija under the Long-Term Agreement.\n\nC-59.\n\n(B) R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's Indebtedness to Dinaburga Rosme\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nOn 6 April 2005 SIA Dinaburga Rosme (\"Dinaburga Rosme\") assigned the debt it owned against R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli to Latgales Ener\u0123ija in an amount of LVL 128,509.99 Latgales Ener\u0123ija paid the same amount to Dinaburga Rosme in 14 instalments in 2005 and 2006.100\n\nC-52.\n\nC-53.\n\n(C) R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's Indebtedness to Latvijas Unibanka\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nOn 27 May 2005 Latgales Ener\u0123ija and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli agreed that \"the Company (Latgales Ener\u0123ija) (..) on 3 May 2005 (. and) on 26 May 2005 settled liabilities towards AS \u2018SEB Latvijas Unibanka' in the total amount of LVL 65,000 and LVL 95,777.92\", that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had made such payment on behalf of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli pursuant to the terms of the Long-Term Agreement and that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had therefore become a creditor of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli for such amount.101 The agreement further contemplated that such amount would be set off under a separate agreement against the rent owed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija under the Long-Term Agreement.102\n\nC-57.\n\nC-57.\n\n126.\n\nOn 14 July 2005 Latgales Ener\u0123ija and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli made a similar agreement with respect to an amount of LVL 370,000 paid by Latgales Ener\u0123ija to Latvijas Unibanka.103 Exhibit C-56 shows that Latgales Ener\u0123ija paid Latvijas Unibanka LVL 95,777.92 and LVL 370,000, but there is no evidence of a payment of LVL 65,000. However, in the 27 May 2005 agreement R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli expressly acknowledged that Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 3 May 2005 paid LVL 65,000 to Latvijas Banka.104\n\nC-57.2.\n\nC-57.1.\n\n127.\n\nBy July 2005 Latgales Ener\u0123ija had therefore settled R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's indebtedness to Latvijas Unibanka in an amount of LVL 530,777.92.\n\n**(10) Local Elections in Latvia (March 2005)**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nIn March 2005 local elections were held in Latvia. The election results in R\u0113zekne were cancelled due to allegations of bribery. Further elections took place in August 2005 (see paragraphs 139 ff. below).\n\n**(11) Latgales Ener\u0123ija's Licences (30 May 2005)**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nOn 30 May 2005 the Regulator granted Latgales Ener\u0123ija the licence for the production of thermal energy No. 002-05 for the period from 30 May 2005 to 29 May 2025.105 The licence sets out special conditions in Appendix No. 1.\n\nC-10.\n\n130.\n\nOn the same day the Regulator granted Latgales Ener\u0123ija the licence for the transmission of thermal energy No. 003-05106 for the same period of time, as well as the licence for the sale of thermal energy No. 004-05.107\n\nC-11.\n\nC-12.\n\n131.\n\nEach licence sets out special conditions in its Appendix No. 1. Aside from the fact that each licence relates to a specific kind of activity, which is reflected in the Appendix of each licence, the three Appendices contain almost identical language.\n\n132.\n\nClause 1 of the licences sets out Latgales Ener\u0123ija's duty to provide uninterrupted and good quality public utility services of production, transfer and distribution and sale, respectively, of thermal energy in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the \"development plan of the city of R\u0113zekne\", Regulator's decisions as well as treaties and standards applicable in Latvia.\n\n133.\n\nClauses 6 and 7 read as follows:108\n\n6. The Multi-Industry Public Utility Regulator of Latgale Municipalities determines the following tasks for SIA \"Latgales Ener\u0123ija\":\n\n6.1 During the licence validity term, to ensure that all the existing users of thermal energy would be equipped with measurement tools for commercial recording, to know the energy consumed by each user and to be able to predict the future consumption of heat;\n\n6.2 To decrease heat loss at the heating mains;\n\n6.3 To prepare a long-term development plan;\n\n6.4. To seek the option to participate at various tenders with projects to attract funding from the state and international financial institutions.\n\n7. **Each year**, the licence holder must **submit the following documents** to the Multi-Industry Public Utility Regulator of Latgale Municipalities:\n\n7.1 **By 31 December each year**, a plan of activities for the following year in line with the long-term development plan of SIA \"Latgales Ener\u0123ija\" including data about the planned amount of production, transfer and distribution, and sale of thermal energy, measures to improve service quality and safety, to ensure environment protection, improvement of the material base (general plan for all types of heating supply services licenced - production, transfer, distribution and sale).\n\n7.2 **By the end of the quarter of the year**, a report regarding the results of the previous year in provision of heating supply services in line with the priorities indicated in Clause 6 of these conditions by including the report in the general company report on fulfilment of the annual plan of operations for the previous year, as well as other information every time upon a request of the Multi-industry Public Utility Regulator of Latgale Municipalities.\n\nC-10 [page 5] (original emphasis).\n\n134.\n\nClause 9 states four grounds upon which the licence may be revoked.109\n\nThe parties interchangeably use the terms \"cancelation\", \"annulment\", \"suspension\" and \"revocation\" with reference to the revocation of the licences on 3 June 2008 (see paragraphs 337 ff. below).

Mem. \u00b6 60. Clause 4.4.4 of the Long-Term Agreement entitled Latgales Ener\u0123ija to take over R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's long-term debts to Latvijas Unibanka in a total amount of LVL 1,668,526 and Baltic Trust Bank in an amount of LVL 680,817, see paragraph 89 above.\n\nC-4, see paragraph 89 above.\n\n142.\n\nLHV would in its own name take over two loans granted by Latvijas Unibanka to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli, on the Claimant's account, under the terms of an assignment agreement which it would execute with Latvijas Unibanka, Clause 2.2 of the Investment Services Agreement.117 E energija undertook to transfer a sum of LVL 1,113,895 or any other amount to LHV based on the Assignment Agreement between LHV and Latvijas Unibanka (Clause 2.1 of the Investment Services Agreement) and to pay the fees set out in Clause 3 of the same agreement.\n\nC-63, Clause 2.4 of the Investment Services Agreement refers to the two loans mentioned in Clause 4.4.4 of the Long-Term Agreement.\n\n143.\n\nLVH undertook in turn to transfer any payments received from R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli to E energija's account (Clause 1.3 of the Investment Services Agreement).\n\nMr. Jautakis explained in his first Witness Statement that the reason for the resort to a third party such as LHV to take over R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's long-term debts was that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli would be more likely to repay its debts.118\n\nCWS-2 \u00b6 50.\n\n(B) The Assignment Agreement (4 August 2005)\n--------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nOn the same day, Latvijas Unibanka and LVH executed the Assignment Agreement (the \"2005 Assignment Agreement\")119 contemplated by the Investment Services Agreement, the amount of Latvijas Unibanka's claim for payment against R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli being LVL 1,125,196120 in respect of both loans under Credit Agreement No. RA 02155 (as amended by a number of covenants) and Credit Agreement No. RA 02219, Clauses 1.1 and 1.2 of the 2005 Assignment Agreement.\n\nC-64.\n\nClause 1.1 of the Assignment Agreement states that the claim for payment of Latvijas Unibanka against R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli as of the date of the Assignment Agreement is for an amount of LVL 1,125,196. The reasons for the decrease in amount from LVL 1,668,526 (see footnote 115 above) and the amount of LVL 1,125,196 (Clause 1.2 of the Assignment Agreement) are not explained, but no explanation is required in view of the fact that Latvijas Unibanka accepted such amount in the Assignment Agreement.\n\n(C) Payment by E Ener\u0123ija (12 August 2005)\n------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nOn 12 August 2005 E energija paid Latvijas Unibanka the amount of LVL 1,125,196.96 on behalf of LHV.121\n\nC-65. Mr. Jautakis' first Witness Statement (CWS-2 \u00b6 49) indicates that E energija paid Lohmus the amount of LVL 1,125,196.96, but Exhibit C-65 indicates that the beneficiary of the payment is Latvijas Unibanka. It would seem that E energija directly paid Latvijas Unibanka the amount of LVL 1,125,196.96 which was to have been paid by LHV, thereby settling the debt for the same amount owed to LHV under the Investment Services Agreement.\n\n(D) The Agreement on Settlement of Debt (15 November 2005) and Reimbursement by Latgales Ener\u0123ija of Rezeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's Debts Under the Loans\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nOn 15 November 2005 Latgales Ener\u0123ija executed the Agreement on Settlement of Debt with R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli (the \"Agreement on the Settlement of Debt\")122 and undertook to repay R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's loan debt arising under the two loans granted by Latvijas Unibanka for October, November and December 2005 as well as January and February 2006 in an amount of LVL 62,252.85 including interest (Clause 1). Clause 2 of the same agreement provides that Latgales Ener\u0123ija shall continue to pay R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli's debts arising under those loans in accordance with the Debt Repayment Schedule attached as Appendix 1 to the Agreement on Settlement of Debt (which Appendix is not in evidence).\n\nThe Agreement on Settlement of Debt does not say to which entity Latgales Ener\u0123ija would make the payments contemplated by the agreement; such payments were to be made to LHV according to the Claimant,123 as confirmed in due course by Clause 1.2(d) of the Amended Long-Term Agreement.124\n\nC-80.\n\nCl.

The discussion relating to this topic continued in the following years (see paragraphs 164 ff. below for 2006).\n\n150.\n\nOn 12 October 2005 the Regulator informed the R\u0113zekne City Council that *(i)* municipalities should organise heating supply in their territory, *(ii)* municipalities might specify the development of heating supply within the \"development plan\" for their territory in coordination with the Regulator and *(iii)* Section 27 of the Methodology specified that the investment required was included in the calculation of the net profit for each heating supply service (production, distribution and sale) \"in accordance with the heat supply system development plan as approved by the corresponding local government.\"126 The Regulator asked the R\u0113zekne City Council to advise whether there was \"an effective and coordinated development plan of the city heating supply containing planned and already made investments of \u2018Latgales Ener\u0123ija' Ltd. in development and improvement of the city heating supply\".127\n\nNo answer to the Regulator\u2019s enquiry is in evidence on the part of R\u0113zekne City Council.\n\nC-35 [page 7].\n\nC-69.\n\n151.\n\nOn 27 October 2005 R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli wrote to Latgales Ener\u0123ija referring to the Regulator\u2019s 12 October 2005 letter to the City Council and asked whether Latgales Ener\u0123ija had \"specified and coordinated with local government the municipal heat supply development plan including both specified and intended investments in this field\".128\n\nR\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli letter further asked when Latgales Ener\u0123ija would start to use natural gas as a fuel.\n\nThere is no answer in evidence on the part of Latgales Ener\u0123ija to the first question;129 as to the second question, Latgales Ener\u0123ija answered on 7 November 2005 (see paragraph 156 below).\n\nC-74.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Regulator had asked Latgales Ener\u0123ija whether the heat supply development plan had been approved and \"Latgales Ener\u0123ija responded that it had not\". RfA \u00b6 63. However, in his first Witness Statement Mr. Strioga does not confirm that allegation (CWS-1 \u00b6 67).\n\n**(16) Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s Applications to the Regulator for a New Tariff (13 October 2005 and 10 November 2005) - The Regulator\u2019s Decisions**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli for the attention of the Regulator on 13 October 2005,130 the prime cost of 1 MWh was in an amount of LVL 28.26 in 2004. According to the same statement issued by Latgales Ener\u0123ija on the same day,131 the prime cost of 1 MWh was in an amount of LVL 38.24 in the period from 15 February to 31 August 2005. The tariff then in force (see paragraph 60 above) no longer covered the costs for the production of heat.\n\nC-70.\n\nC-71.\n\n153.\n\nOn 8 November 2005 Latgales Ener\u0123ija published a proposed tariff of LVL 32.96/MWh for residents and LVL 34.25/MWh for other users in the *R\u0113zeknes Vest\u00eds* newspaper.132\n\nC-79. The figure of LVL 34.25/MWh is mistakenly indicated as LVL 22.26 in the English translation of the published decision in C-15 [page 1] (accurate in C-82 [page 1]). It is unclear, moreover, whether this publication is the actual fresh application for a new tariff made by Latgales Ener\u0123ija, as contended by the Claimant (Cl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 95; the Regulator\u2019s decision refers to an application by Latgales Ener\u0123ija of 10 November 2005).\n\n154.\n\nOn 19 December 2005 the Regulator approved a new tariff of LVL 27.60/MWh for residents and LVL 29.02/MWh (without VAT) for other users in decision No. 19.133\n\nC-14 ; published version: C-82.\n\n155.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s published decision was stated to be based on Section 2.1 and Section 26 of the Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No. 281 of 26 June 2001, amended in 2008 (Methodology for Calculation of Tariffs for Public Utilities in the Fields Regulated by Local Municipalities, \"the Methodology\").134\n\nThe approval was based in substance on the proposition that \"[t]he approved tariff will cover the most necessary costs\", which addressed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s argument reported in the decision that \"[t]he grounds for the increase of tariffs are the growing fuel and electric energy prices\" and that \"the present tariffs do not cover the company\u2019s operating costs\".135\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s decision of 19 December 2005 did not refer to a \"development plan\".\n\nC-35.\n\nC-82 [pages 1-2].\n\n**(17) rezekne Heating System Converted to Use Natural Gas (November 2005)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nBy November 2005 Latgales Ener\u0123ija had converted the heating infrastructure so that it could use natural gas. On 7 November 2005 Latgales Ener\u0123ija sent R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and the R\u0113zekne City Council a notice informing them that, as of that day, they were ready to supply heating using natural gas as fuel and requesting the delivery of 5 million cubic metres of natural gas in 2005 and 21 million cubic metres of natural gas in 2006.136\n\nC-78.\n\n157.\n\nAs there was no written agreement to which Latgales Ener\u0123ija was a party with respect to the supply of natural gas (see paragraph 117 above), R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli invoiced Latgales Ener\u0123ija for the gas supplied based on the invoices received from Latvijas G\u0101ze. Latgales Ener\u0123ija in turn paid such invoices directly to Latvijas G\u0101ze. In an interview given on 13 September 2007, Mr. Vjakse confirmed that this was the arrangement under which Latvijas G\u0101ze was paid for the natural gas supplied.137\n\nC-134.\n\n158.\n\nIt is in dispute between the Parties whether Latgales Ener\u0123ija owed Latvijas G\u0101ze a duty to pay for the natural gas supplied (see paragraphs 586 ff. and 726 ff. below).\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that by December 2005 Latgales Ener\u0123ija had made the investment required to convert the heating infrastructure to accept natural gas and had started to use natural gas to produce thermal energy in R\u0113zekne.138\n\nHowever, the actual gasification of the system was only partial as of the end of 2005, in that it related to two out of three heat sources, namely the boiler houses in Rancana iela 1 (also often referred to as R\u012bgas iela) and Atbr\u012bvo\u0161anas alej\u0101 155a.139\n\nRfA \u00b6 39.\n\nC-44 p. 11: \"Since November [2005] partial transition to gas heating has been carried out. (...) To eliminate these problems. Latgales Ener\u0123ija SIA at the end of 2005 carried out the transition from fuel oil to gas as fuel in two heat production sources. Therefore currently the boiler houses in Rancana iela 1 and Atbr\u012bvo\u0161anas alej\u0101 155a have gas-heated boilers. However, this cannot be called a complete gasification of the heat supply system (...)\".

The Council as the sole shareholder of AS \"R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli\" undertakes to perform the below activities until 28 February' 2006 (unless the below sub-clauses provide different terms):  \n 1.1 (...).  \n 1.2 By a Council decision, to coordinate and approve the guidelines for development of heating supply system of the city of R\u0113zekne prepared by the Operator and the Council;\n\n172.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija undertook more specifically to decrease the thermal energy rate for heating of premises by 2.05 LVL/MWh for residents and 0.43 LVL/MWh for other users in case the Council performed its obligations under Clauses 1.1, 1.4 and 1.5 of the February 2006 Agreement (Clause 2). Further decreases were contemplated by Clause 3.\n\n173.\n\nClause 4 provided that in case the Council timely and fully performed the obligations undertaken under the Agreement, Latgales Ener\u0123ija would apply a further decrease in thermal energy rates until 1 October 2006 and apply a rate of LVL 25.02/MWh for residents and LVL 28.59/MWh for other users.\n\n174.\n\nThe February 2006 Agreement further contained terms dealing with the event of a breach of contract by each party. Clause 5 dealt with Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s contractual rights in case the R\u0113zekne City Council failed to perform any of the obligations undertaken in Clauses 1.1 to 1.5;164 Clause 6 dealt with the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s contractual rights in case Latgales Ener\u0123ija failed to perform the obligations undertaken in Clauses 2 to 4 of the February 2006 Agreement.\n\nC-17, Clause 5 reads as follows:  \n 5. In case any of the obligations indicated in Clauses 1.1-1.5 is not performed by the Council of AS \"R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli\", SIA \"Latgales energija\" unilaterally decreases the rent paid to AS \"R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli\" for the period from 25.02.2006 to 24.02.2007 for the actual lost income calculated by multiplying the actual amount of sold heating and the difference between the rate approved by the Multi-industry Public Utility Regulator of Latgale Municipalities: 27.60 LVL/MWh for residents and 29.03 LVL/MWh for other users, and the actual applied rate. Likewise SIA \"Latgales energija\" is entitled to terminate this agreement at any time, but not before 01.03.2006, and claim compensation for the lost income.  \n The expression \"the Council of AS 'R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli\u2019\" in Clause 5 of the English version is ambiguous; in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it has the same meaning as \"the Council\" as the sole shareholder of AS \"R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli\" in Clause 1 since R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli is not in terms a party to this agreement.\n\n175.\n\nThe R\u0113zekne City Council was to perform the obligations undertaken under Clauses 1.1 through 1.5 of the February 2006 Agreement by 28 February 2006 (unless otherwise expressly provided by such clauses).\n\n176.\n\nThere is no correspondence between the parties in February 2006, the month in which the R\u0113zekne City Council was due to perform the obligations contemplated by Clause 1 of the February 2006 Agreement, on the record, either confirming performance of the agreement by either side or otherwise. There is no correspondence in evidence for the period immediately following either.165\n\nThe first communications in which Latgales Ener\u0123ija took the view that the R\u0113zekne City Council was in breach of its contractual obligation with respect to the heat supply development plan were made later in 2006 and 2007 (see C-96 [19 October 2006] and paragraph 178 below; C-112 [2 February 2007] and paragraph 207 below; C-116 [6 March 2007] and paragraph 209 below; C-118 [19 April 2007] and paragraph 210 below; C-121 [29 May 2007] and paragraph 214 below; C-129 [13 July 2007]). Most of these communications were addressed to the R\u0113zekne City Council; when R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli was the addressee, the R\u0113zekne City Council would be copied in.\n\n177.\n\nFrom February 2006 until 1 October 2006, Latgales Ener\u0123ija applied the rates of LVL 25.02/MWh for residents and LVL 28.59/MWh for other users, *i.e.* the rates decreased pursuant to Clause 4 of the February 2006 Agreement.166\n\nSee CWS-1 \u00b6 71; CWS-3 \u00b6 17. last sentence; see also C-157 and paragraph 294 below.  \n Ms. Rogozina was not called to be cross-examined at the Hearing, see paragraph 32 above.\n\n178.\n\nOn 19 October 2006, after the Regulator rejected Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application for a new tariff,167 Latgales Ener\u0123ija wrote to the R\u0113zekne City Council in relation to the performance of the February 2006 Agreement, and more specifically in relation to the \"guidelines for the city heat supply system\", pointing out that it had carried out all the activities required on its part to comply with Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement and that it had received no answer from the Council in spite of its reminders.168 Latgales Ener\u0123ija gave notice to the Council that it would have no choice but to resort to Clause 5 of the February 2006 Agreement169 unless the Council adopted the \"guidelines\" within the following two months.\n\nSee C-19 and paragraph 184 below.\n\nC-96.\n\nQuoted in paragraph 174 above, footnote 164 as well as in Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s letter.\n\n179.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s case that the R\u0113zekne City Council failed in particular to approve the \"guidelines for the development of the heating supply system\", and thereby failed to live up to its side of the bargain.170\n\nCl.

In its calculations attached to its application Latgales Ener\u0123ija indicated that the new price charged by Latvijas G\u0101ze for the natural gas had risen from LVL 83.06 to LVL 113.76 (which represented an increase of 36%), and the new price for electricity from LVL 29 to LVL 34 (which represented an increase of 17%).173\n\nC-18 : see also paragraph 154 above.\n\nC-18 [page 5].\n\n183.\n\nOn 15 August 2006 Latgales Ener\u0123ija asked the Regulator to cancel its previous application of 12 June 2006 and submitted fresh calculations for the rate applicable to residents, seeking a rate of LVL 30.91/MWh for residents, and LVL 33.92/MWh for other users of thermal energy. Ms. Rogozina explains in her first Witness Statement that such step was caused by a change in VAT rules.174\n\nCWS-3 \u00b6 19.\n\n184.\n\nOn 13 October 2006 the Regulator denied Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application by a unanimous vote.175 The reasons for this decision are discussed in paragraphs 901 ff. below.\n\nDecision No. 17. C-19 ; R-35,1.\n\n185.\n\nOn 17 November 2006 Latgales Ener\u0123ija challenged the Regulator\u2019s decision before the Administrative District Court.176\n\nC-100. The application to have the Regulator\u2019s decision of 13 October 2006 set aside was based first on the proposition that the three coefficients that were not used in Latgales Ener\u0123ija calculations filed in support of the proposed new tariff could not be applied because they would be part of the heat supply development plan which the Municipality' had failed to approve (C-100 \u00b6 17). Moreover, Latgales Ener\u0123ija contended that the Regulator's decision No. 19 dated 19 December 2005 had not applied the three coefficients relied upon by the Regulator in the decision sought to be set aside, and the Regulator had thereby departed from its previous practice so as to make it impossible for the applicant to apply for new tariffs (C-100 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19).  \n Secondly. Latgales Ener\u0123ija contended that the Regulator was *bound* under Sect. 19.5 of the Public Utility Regulators Act (CLA-49) and Sect. 59 of the Administrative Procedure Act (CLA-47) to request an applicant to file missing documents to prove the costs on which a proposed tariff was to be based before a decision on a proposed tariff could be made.\n\n186.\n\nSince the challenge of the Regulator\u2019s 13 October 2006 decision had not been heard yet by the time the Regulator had made decision No. 12 of 11 June 2007, which was also challenged by Latgales Ener\u0123ija, on 22 June 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija amended its 17 November 2006 application to set aside so as to include *only* the Regulator\u2019s decision No. 12 dated 11 June 2007.177 There was therefore no decision by the Administrative District Court in relation to the Regulator\u2019s decision No. 17 dated 13 October 2006.

Locis, Ms. Groce and Mr. Patmalnieks); four invited specialists, of whom two members of the Council (Mr. G. Spradzenko, Deputy of RCC and Member of the Board of SIA R\u0113zekne \u00dcdens [water sewerage company]; Mr. E. Skincs, Member of the Boad of SIA R\u0113zekne N amsaimni eks [estate agent]; Mr. O. Skmjats, member of the Board of SIA Siltumserviss [company active in heat supply and heat supply network] and Ms. D. Abramova, Deputy of RCC); and Ms. Vilumovska.  \n Further persons took part in the meetings of the Working Group. At least one representative of Latgales Ener\u0123ija (R-30 [pages 2-46]) attended the meetings of the Working Group save for the meetings of 19 July, 31 July and 11 September 2007.  \n According to the minutes produced by the Respondent, the Working Group had sixteen meetings from 14 May to 19 September 2007 (R-30 [pages 2-46]).\n\nCouncil decision No. 188. R-30 [page 1].\n\n214.\n\nOn 29 May 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija again reminded215 the R\u0113zekne City Council that it was in breach of its contractual obligation to agree and approve \"guidelines for the development plan of the heating supply system\" in accordance with the February 2006 Agreement,216 pointing out that it was entitled under Clause 5 of that agreement to decrease the lease payments to be made to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli217\n\nSee paragraph 178 above.\n\nC-17, Clause 1.2, see paragraph 171 above.\n\nC-121.\n\n215.\n\nOn the same day Latgales Ener\u0123ija applied for a new tariff to the Regulator (these developments will be dealt with separately in paragraphs 230 ff. below, save insofar as they are relevant to the \"heat supply development plan\"). On the following day the Regulator asked Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide \"information regarding the approved R\u0113zekne City heat supply development plan, which must be in place\" in accordance with the Methodology.218 On 6 June 2006 Latgales Ener\u0123ija answered that the approval of such plan was exclusively a matter for the R\u0113zekne City Council, to which the Regulator should therefore turn, adding that to the best of its knowledge the plan had not been adopted.219 On 11 June 2007 the Regulator denied Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application for a new tariff220\n\nC-122.\n\nC-123.\n\nC-21, see more in detail paragraph 233 below.\n\n216.\n\nOn 12 June 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council answered Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s 29 May 2007 letter, pointing out that the Working Group in charge of developing the \"strategic plan for the development of the R\u0113zekne city heat supply system\" had repeatedly221 requested Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide information on whether the introduction of new facilities and technologies would affect the thermal energy tariff, but had not received any answers.222 The delay had therefore been caused by Latgales Ener\u0123ija, and Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s allegation that the Council was responsible for such delay was unjustified. The Council further denied that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was entitled to reduce the amount of the lease payments owed under the Long-Term Agreement without an amendment of the same, which had to be made in writing.\n\nThe requests mentioned in this letter are not in evidence.\n\nC-124.\n\n217.\n\nOn 4 July 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija claimed in a letter sent both to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and the R\u0113zekne City Council that the Regulator\u2019s refusal to approve a new tariff223 had been ultimately caused by the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s failure to approve a \"heat supply system development plan\".224 Relying on the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s obligations under Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement with particular respect to the approval of the \"heat supply system development plan\",225 Latgales Ener\u0123ija reiterated that it was under no obligation to decrease the heat energy tariff under the terms of the February 2006 Agreement and presented a calculation of the amount of LVL 138,069.24 which it was entitled to deduct from the lease payments owed to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli under Clause 5 of the February 2006 Agreement.226\n\nC-21, see more in detail paragraph 233 below.\n\nC-128,1.\n\nC-17, see paragraph 171 above.\n\nC-128 [pages 2-3].\n\n218.\n\nOn 9 July 2007 R\u0113zekne City Council rejected Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s complaints and claim for compensation, stating it had performed all its obligations and met all the requirements in order for the thermal energy tariff to be reduced by Latgales Ener\u0123ija, having recalled its criticism of the \"guidelines\" received from Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 17 November 2006.227 The letter addressed the tasks to be undertaken by the Council and Latgales Ener\u0123ija within the Working Group and criticised Latgales Ener\u0123ija for failing to provide sufficiently clear and detailed information, without which it was impossible to evaluate the situation and forecast the necessity and scope of the investments required for the period 2007-2013.228 A 19-page document was attached to that letter which is not in evidence.\n\nC-99. see paragraph 189-190 above.\n\nC-128 [page 8].\n\n219.\n\nOn 18 July 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija replied that the development of the \"heat supply development plan\" was an obligation on the Municipality under the Energy Act (Section 51, Part 1) and the Municipality\u2019s rejection of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s claim for compensation was contrary to the provisions of the February 2006 Agreement.229 Latgales Ener\u0123ija did not, however, answer the Council\u2019s criticism in relation to the alleged failures of its representatives to provide information required by the working group in charge of the \"heat supply development plan\".\n\nOn 19 July 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council reiterated that the Working Group had received only partial information from Latgales Ener\u0123ija, which was requested to provide the following by 24 July 2007 on five key items set out in the letter.230 The draft \"strategic plan\" would be submitted for approval by 14 September 2007, the letter indicated.\n\nC-128 [page 13].\n\nC-128 [page 15].\n\n220.\n\nOn 19 July 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija complained to the Council that it had been notified of a Working Group meeting on that very day at 10:20 *a.m.* after the meeting had started at 10:00 *a.m.;* adequate notice was requested for future meetings.231\n\nC-128 [page 19].\n\n221.\n\nOn 23 July 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija answered the Council\u2019s 19 July 2007 request as follows:232\n\n(i) as at July 2007 there was no updated information regarding the investments planned; a survey of the prices of potential suppliers would be required which would take between five to seven weeks, to update the information in relation to the heat supply main network, the scope of boiler reconstruction, the measures to improve energy efficiency etc.; expected prices had increased, but the volume of investment had not changed;\n\n(ii) there had been no changes in the schedule of the planned investments; however, the timing of the schedules depended on the timing of their approval so that if approval was delayed, completion of the works would be delayed;\n\n(iii) the sources of the planned investments would be as follows: up to 90% bank resources, and 10% equity capital; and\n\n(iv) as to the question how the planned investments would affect the energy efficiency measures, the answer was provided to Mr. Vjakse on 1 July 2007 and during the meetings of the Working Group. Within two years of obtaining the investments:\n\n\u2014 self-consumption in the boilers would decline to 8.1% (in 2006 it was 11.3%);\n\n\u2014 losses in the heat transmission network would decline to 17.2 (currently 18.1%);\n\n\u2014 the amount of fuel consumed for the production of 1 MWh heat would decline to 136 kg of the assumed fuel (currently 151.2 kg); and\n\n\u2014 the energy consumption would fall to 22.9 kWh (currently 24 kWh); the number of employees at the boiler houses would fall by 15% while the salaries will increase by 20% as employees would have to have higher qualifications; the heat energy tariff was expected to grow by 7% (at the inflation of 0 from July 2007).\n\nC-128 [page 211.\n\n222.\n\nOn 30 July 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija sent a two-page \"investment plan\" covering a seven-year period starting from the date of the approval of the \"R\u0113zekne city heat supply system development strategic plan\".233\n\nC-128 [page 25].\n\n223.\n\nOn the following day the Council replied that the information provided by Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 23 July 2007 was insufficient as it failed to reflect essential cost items. The letter stated that an expert had been involved to develop the \"R\u0113zekne city heat supply strategic plan\" and additional information was requested.234\n\nC-128 [page 31].\n\n224.\n\nOn 11 September 2007 a meeting of the Working Group took place. Latgales Ener\u0123ija had announced that it would be unable to attend.235 As indicated in the minutes of the meeting, a draft Development Plan was available by then.236\n\nDuring that meeting Ms. Abramova, sitting on the Working Group as an invited specialist and a member of the City Council, suggested to make \"editorial comments\" to the draft Development Plan: \"when talking about future development, to use the word \u2018operator\u2019, without mentioning SIA Latgales energija as the only possible operator of thermal energy\".237 The minutes indicate that Mr. I. Locis, head of the Working Group and Vice-Executive Director of the City Council, would make the editorial changes by 13 September 2007 and prepare the document for review.238 The record does not show whether the minutes of this particular meeting were provided to Latgales Ener\u0123ija.\n\nR-30 [page 43].\n\nR-30 [page 43].\n\nR-30 [page 44].\n\nR-30 [page 44].\n\n225.\n\nOn 13 September 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council sent Latgales Ener\u0123ija a 54-page document setting out the \"strategy for the development of the R\u0113zekne city heat supply\" further to Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s request.239 Latgales Ener\u0123ija was invited to participate in an unscheduled session of the City Development, Infrastructure and Public Order Committee in the morning of the following day, and the meeting of the subsection of the R\u0113zekne City Council in the afternoon,240 but informed the Mayor that it was unable to attend and requested a postponement.241 It is not clear whether a meeting took place on 14 September 2007 as there are no minutes of such a meeting on the record and it is recalled that no witnesses have been put forward by the Respondent.\n\nC-133.\n\nC-133.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija was unable to attend the meeting of the Working Group scheduled to take place on 14 September 2007 due to prior commitments and had applied to the Mayor for a ten-day postponement on 11 September 2007 (R-30 [page 55]): on the following day Latgales Ener\u0123ija restated its application stating that it had not received the Development Plan to be discussed (R-30 [page 56]); on 13 September 2007 the Mayor sent the Plan but maintained the date for the meeting on the following day (R-30 [page 57]).\n\n226.\n\nOn 17 September 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council invited Latgales Ener\u0123ija to participate in the meeting of its deputies that would take place on 19 September 2007 on the \"development strategy [for the] heat supply\" in R\u0113zekne for 2007-2013.242 Latgales Ener\u0123ija indicated on the very same day that it would attend.243\n\nC-135.\n\nC-135.\n\n227.\n\nOn 19 September 2007 the Working Group met.244 No representative from Latgales Ener\u0123ija attended. One of the items discussed was the manner in which the Development Plan in the making should refer to Latgales Ener\u0123ija. Ms. Abramova reiterated her suggestion that Latgales Ener\u0123ija should not be mentioned \"as the only possible operator\";245 another member of the City Council, Mr. Petkevics, concurred and suggested that Latgales Ener\u0123ija should be mentioned \"only in the descriptive part, when characterising the current situation\"246 The record does not show whether the minutes of this particular meeting were provided to Latgales Ener\u0123ija.\n\nR-30 [pages 45-46].\n\nR-30 [page 45].\n\nR-30 [page 45].\n\n228.\n\nOn 21 September 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council approved the heat supply development strategy for the city of R\u0113zekne for 2007-2013.247 The document entitled \"R\u0113zekne Heating Supply Development Strategy for 2007-2013\" is in evidence as Exhibit C-213.\n\nDecision No. 364, C-137.\n\n229.\n\nAs the next sub-sections will recall, the finalization of the R\u0113zekne Heating Supply Development Strategy for 2007-2013 was not, by far, the sole event worth recalling in the second part of 2007. By 21 September 2007 a number of equally significant events had taken place:\n\n(1) the Regulator had denied Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application for a new tariff;\n\n(ii) Latvijas G\u0101ze had stopped deliveries of natural gas;\n\n(iii) R\u0113zekne\u2019s Mayor had given an interview indicating that Latgales Ener\u0123ija might no longer be the exclusive supplier of thermal energy in spite of the express terms contained in the Long-Term Agreement and the February 2006 Agreement; and\n\n(iv) R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had sued Latgales Ener\u0123ija in the Latgale Regional Court and had obtained an injunction freezing Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account.\n\nThe following sub-sections will deal with those developments.\n\n**(2) Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019S Application to the Regulator for a New Tariff (29 May 2007) and the Regulator\u2019s Decision (11 June 2007) -Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s Application to the Regulator for a New Tariff (5 November 2007) and the Regulator\u2019s Decisions (9 November 2007 and 7 December 2007)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe tariff in force in 2007 (LVL 27.6/MWh for residents and LVL 29.02/MWh for other users) had been approved by the Regulator on 19 December 2005.248\n\nFrom February to October 2006 Latgales Ener\u0123ija had applied a reduced tariff of LVL 25.02/MWh for residents and 28.59/MWh for other users (see paragraph 177 above) in accordance with Clause 4 of the February 2006 Agreement.249\n\nOn 19 October 2006 the Regulator had denied Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application for a new tariff250 In 2006 the price charged by Latvijas G\u0101ze in accordance with the decision by the Public Utilities Commission had risen by some 36%.251\n\nSee paragraph 154 above; see also the Regulator\u2019s decision No. 12 of 11 June 2007.

C-117.\n\nSee CWS-3 \u00b6 23.\n\n232.\n\nOn 29 May 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija applied to the Regulator seeking a tariff ranging from LVL 32.67/MWh to LVL 41.62/MWh from 1 September 2007 onwards.254\n\nC-20. The date in C-20 contains is a spelling mistake, the year is not \"2006\" but \"2007\"; the stamp also shows that this application was received by the Regulator on 30 May 2007.  \n Ms. Rogozina gives the figures of LVL 33.80/MWh to LVL 42.75/MWh in her first Witness Statement, CWS-3 \u00b6 23.\n\n233.\n\nOn 11 June 2007 the Regulator denied Latgales Ener\u0123ija application by a unanimous vote.255 The reasons for the decision are discussed in paragraphs 904 ff. below.\n\nDecision No. 12. C-21 ; R-35.2.\n\n234.\n\nOn 22 June 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija challenged the Regulator\u2019s decision before the Administrative District Court in the same proceedings which it had brought against the Regulator\u2019s prior decision of 13 October 2006.256\n\nC-125 ; see also paragraphs 185-186 above.  \n The application to set aside rests on a breach by the Regulator of Sect. 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act and Sect. 15(12) of the same Act. The first provision is to the effect that in administrative proceedings institutions and courts shall, within the scope of applicable provisions of law, protect the rights and legal interests of private persons (CLA-47). The second provision is said to embody the principle of prohibition against legal obstruction by institution and courts.  \n Sect. 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act (CLA-47) reads as follows:  \n Principle of Observance of the Rights of Persons  \n In administrative proceedings, especially in adopting decisions on the merits, institutions and courts shall, within the scope of the applicable norms of law. facilitate the protection of the rights and legal interests of private persons.  \n Sect. 15(12) of the Administrative Procedure Act (CLA-47) reads as follows:  \n Institutions and courts may not refuse to decide an issue on the grounds that such issue is not regulated by law or other external regulatory enactment (prohibition of legal obstruction by institutions and courts). They may not refuse to apply a norm of law on the grounds that such norm does not provide for the mechanism of application, it is not exhaustive or no other regulatory enactments have been issued which would more closely regulate the application of the relevant norm. This shall not apply only in cases where an institution, which is required to apply this norm or participate in its application in another way, has not been established or is not operating.\n\n235.\n\nThe Administrative District Court eventually made its decision on 15 April 2009 and dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application.257\n\nC-192, see paragraph 392 below.\n\n236.\n\nOn 28 September 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija applied again to the Regulator seeking a new tariff from 1 November 2007 onwards.258 The proposed tariff ranged from 35.95 LVL/MWh to 44.16 LVL/MWh depending on the natural gas rate. Reliance was placed on changes in the natural gas rates and in the minimum salary as well as other factors.\n\nC-140.  \n Ms. Rogozina gives the figures of LVL 33.80/MWh to LVL 42.75/MWh in her first Witness Statement, CWS-3 \u00b6 23.\n\n237.\n\nIn the autumn of 2007 a number of significant events took place which the Tribunal will discuss in the following sub-sections of this Award:\n\n(i) on 11 September 2007 Latvijas G\u0101ze stopped the supply of natural gas (see paragraph 248 below); as a consequence, Latgales Ener\u0123ija experienced difficulties in providing heating to certain areas of the city of R\u0113zekne;\n\n(ii) on 4 October 2007 the Regulator warned Latgales Ener\u0123ija that it might revoke the three licences issued to Latgales Ener\u0123ija (see paragraph 262 below);\n\n(iii) the Municipality declared an energy crisis in the city of R\u0113zekne on 9 October 2007 (see paragraph 264 below);\n\n(iv) the heat supply development strategy for the city of R\u0113zekne for 2007-2013 had just been approved by the Municipality on 21 September 2007259 (see paragraph 228 above); and\n\n(v) on 11 October 2007 the Regulator decided to take over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s zone (see paragraph 274 below).\n\nDecision No. 364, C-137 ; C-213.\n\n238.\n\nOn 5 November 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija wrote to the Municipality announcing that if the Regulator approved the new tariff proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija, Latgales Ener\u0123ija would apply reduced rates as set out in that letter.260\n\nC-154.\n\n239.\n\nOn 9 November 2007 the Regulator unanimously approved new tariffs.261 Latgales Ener\u0123ija submits that the approved tariffs would have enabled it to pay the increased prices for natural gas.262\n\nDecision No. 28, C-27.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 190.\n\n240.\n\nHowever, on 7 December 2007 the Regulator revoked its previous decision No. 28 dated 9 November 2007 and dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application for a new tariff dated 18 September 2007263 The decision does not state whether it is a majority decision or a unanimous decision.\n\nDecision No. 35 dated 7 December 2007, C-28.\n\n241.\n\nThe decision states that on 29 November 2007 R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija had written a letter to the Regulator *(not in evidence)* stating that the amount of natural gas which Latvijas G\u0101ze was to supply was 21,000 nm3 whereas Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application contained a smaller amount, which proved in the Regulator\u2019s opinion that the calculations on which Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application was based were not in accordance with \"the actual situation\" and that the rates submitted were therefore to the detriment of the public interest. Such information had been knowingly supplied by Latgales Ener\u0123ija and the Regulator\u2019s decision was therefore to be reviewed. The Regulator found that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had obtained a new tariff \"by illegal means\" and that the approved tariff was \"unreasonably high\"264\n\nC-28 [page 18].\n\n242.\n\nThe decision does not state that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s comments were sought on R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija\u2019s 29 November 2007 letter before reviewing the Regulator\u2019s decision dated 9 November 2007.\n\n243.\n\nOn 12 December 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija challenged the Regulator\u2019s decision before the Administrative District Court.265 The court dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application on 30 October 2009.266 Latgales Ener\u0123ija appealed against that judgment and the Administrative Regional Court dismissed the appeal on 23 September 2010.267\n\nC-164.\n\nR-4 \u00b6 5.\n\nR-4, see paragraph 401 below.\n\n244.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija had started to charge users according to the revised tariffs approved by the Regulator on 9 November 2007 as it took the view that the effects of the Regulator\u2019s decision of 7 December 2007 were stayed pending the resolution of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s challenge.268 However, the R\u0113zekne City Council did not accept Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s position (see paragraphs 324 ff. below).\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 199.\n\n**(3) Towards the Declaration of an Energy Crisis by the REzekne City Council (9 October 2007)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nOwing to the Regulator\u2019s refusal to approve a new tariff in 2006 (see paragraph 184 above) and in 2007 (see paragraphs 233 and 240 above) and to the increase in the gas prices charged by Latvijas G\u0101ze allowed by the competent authority in 2006 and 2007 (see paragraphs 181 and 231 above) Latgales Ener\u0123ija felt that it would no longer be in a position to pay the amounts which Latvijas G\u0101ze was invoicing R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli. On 2 July 2007 it informed R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli that, as of 11 June 2007, it would pay for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas G\u0101ze in accordance with the tariff applied by the Regulator when the heating tariff was approved, namely \"LVL 83.60/1000 m3\"269\n\nC-127.\n\n246.\n\nOn 25 July 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija informed R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli that it paid less than Latvijas G\u0101ze had invoiced R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli for June 2007, by some LVL 10,000.270\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija did not pay the outstanding balance to Latvijas G\u0101ze. Neither did R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and the R\u0113zekne City Council which were the contracting parties to the Gas Supply Agreement with Latvijas G\u0101ze.271\n\nC-130.\n\nC-40, see paragraph 63 above; C-61, see paragraph 136 above; and C-81, see paragraph 160 above.\n\n247.\n\nOn 29 August 2007 Latvijas G\u0101ze warned the R\u0113zekne City Council and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli that it would suspend supplies of natural gas unless the R\u0113zekne City Council paid in full for the natural gas supplied to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli until the end of July 2007.272 On 10 September 2007 Latvijas G\u0101ze sent the R\u0113zekne City Council and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli a second warning.273 On 11 September 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council asked Latvijas G\u0101ze not to interrupt supplies of natural gas.274\n\nThis communication is mentioned in C-132, but is not itself in evidence.\n\nC-132.\n\nThe letter is not in evidence, but is referred to in R-32.\n\n248.\n\nOn 11 September 2007 Latvijas G\u0101ze stopped its natural gas supply just before the beginning of the heating season.\n\n249.\n\nIn its letter to the R\u0113zekne City Council and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli dated 14 September 2007 Latvijas G\u0101ze stated that the City Council had not paid for the natural gas received in July 2007 in full and the City Council\u2019s request to maintain supplies had been rejected by its Board; the amount claimed by Latvijas G\u0101ze was of approx. LVL 148,000 plus an advance payment of LVL 400,000 for October 2007 and interest on delayed payment, to be calculated.275\n\nR-32.\n\n250.\n\nAs a consequence of the interruption in the supply of natural gas, Latgales Ener\u0123ija had to switch back to its reserves of heavy fuel oil, which it did, in order to provide heating and hot water.276\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6 93 and Transcript, Day 2, 68/15-24. See also Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s letter to the Regulator dated 30 October 2007, C-153 \u00b6 13. '\n\n251.\n\nOn 13 September 2007 the Mayor of R\u0113zekne gave an interview that was published on 15 September 2007 in the local paper *R\u0113zeknes Vest\u00eds.277* In his answer to the question put to him278 the Mayor reportedly answered as follows:\n\nFirst of all I want to reassure residents and to confirm that supply of hot water and heating would be provided.\n\nAnd now I will explain how this difficult situation occurred. Everybody knows that the lease agreement with company Latgales energija is disadvantageous for the city. The same can be said about the agreement with Latvijas G\u0101ze. The agreement on gas supply lias been concluded among AS Latvijas G\u0101ze, AS R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli and R\u0113zekne Council, instead of concluding directly with the producer of thermal energy. Latvijas G\u0101ze issues an invoice for gas consumption to R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli. and the latter, in its turn, issues an analogous invoice to Latgales energija that sen es as the final link in the chain of payments for gas. After all. this company uses gas and receives payment from the heat consumers. However, if a single santims remains unpaid for the consumed gas. the council bears the liability. as the municipality is the guarantor for payments under the agreement with Latvijas G\u0101ze. So far, R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli prevented occurrence of debts. However, two months ago, when the Regulator rejected a project to increase the thermal energy tariffs (considering them to be unreasonably high). Latgales energija begun to pay only a part of the accrued amount, that is. failed to pay the difference between the current rate and the increased rate they desired, which was rejected by the Regulator. Thus, a debt of LVL 29,164 occurred.\n\nLatgales energija took the following position: you. the council, hinder and cause obstacles for the Regulator to increase the tariffs.\n\nWe would like to note that the council does not determine and does not influence the tariffs, this is in the power of the Regulator, not the council. Apparently. Latgales energija is thus trying to impose a pressure on the Regulator...\n\nThe City Council can easily pay the debt to Latvijas G\u0101ze. The debt amount is small. The best variant how to do it is by amending the budget in the end of the year to transfer this money to R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli increasing its share capital, thereafter these funds would cover the debt. Therefore we addressed the management of Latvijas G\u0101ze with a request to extend the payment term of the invoice for the gas until 1 January 2008. This issue will be discussed at a board meeting of AS Latvijas G\u0101ze on Friday (14 September).\n\nOf course, we are interested in a direct agreement between Latvijas G\u0101ze and the operator, heating company. However, with regard to Latgales energija. Latvijas G\u0101ze has a categorical position: there will be no direct agreement with this company...\n\nThe situation reached a critical point. This cannot go any further. Therefore, last week the board of AS R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli made a decision to instruct board member Aldis Mez\u00e1ls to hire a law office from Riga to draft documents that are required to bring a claim to court against SIA Latgales energija.\n\nOn 14 September, a claim will be brought to the administrative court to collect the debt from Latgales energija at three positions: for the continued delay in payment of depreciation to akeiju sabedriba R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli (in the amount of 75 thousand lats): for the failure under the agreement to take over the debt of R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli. in the amount of one million lats; for failure to pay the invoices of Latvijas G\u0101ze for the consumed gas.\n\nI will explain that as of the beginning of operations Latgales energija did not pay a santims for depreciation (however, according to law, deductions should be done annually). In relation to taking over the debt of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli. Latgales energija did not take it over, it assigned the debt (that is, did not take over the debt itself, but the right of claim, to collect the debt); as a result, this million lats was distributed across the entire remaining lease term and counted in the rent payment.\n\nTherefore, company R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli faced limited cash income that would allow the payment.\n\nWhat will be our further steps? Tomorrow (14 September), six companies that provide heating in Latvia will receive letters with a description and analysis of the situation with the heating supply in R\u0113zekne and an offer to take up provision of heating in our city. I am sure, there will be persons who would want to take this up. Then we will announce a tender and choose a company that would meet our requirements. The main and mandatory condition would be: conclusion of a direct agreement between Latvijas G\u0101ze and the operator; also requirements that the tariff of the heating in R\u0113zekne would not exceed 30 lats for five years.\n\nI can tell that the future of Latgales energija in our city will be decided on 25 September. By this date, the regular payment for the gas should be paid, and in case Latgales energija fails to pay it, then I would bring a question to deputies regarding termination of the agreement with this company. In case the payment is made, then the question of gas payment is removed, and we sit down at the table of negotiations to discuss issues of heating supply in the city.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to address the residents of our city: don\u2019t panic. There will be no interruption in supply of hot water and heating. I can ensure that much lias been done to solve the problem, but it has not been publicly advertised. For three months, I have been negotiating with several companies persuading them that R\u0113zekne has a future. And I can guarantee that in case of necessity a new company, large, serious and reliable, would appear here. Previously we did not have alternatives. Now we have them.\n\nC-134.\n\nThe question put to the Mayor was: \"Gas supply stopped in R\u0113zekne. The problem with the heat supply lias again run into a dead end... What should R\u0113zekne residents expect, how does the council intends [sic] to solve the problem?\"\n\n252.\n\nOn 19 September 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija wrote to the Mayor with reference to the interview published in *R\u0113zeknes Vest\u00eds,* asking whether it was accurate that a letter had been, or would be, sent to six Latvian heat supply companies with a proposal to supply thermal energy in R\u0113zekne, and whether in such case Latgales Ener\u0123ija would be able to take part in the competition.279 No answer to that letter is in evidence.\n\nC-136.\n\n253.\n\nOn 20 September 2007 the differences of opinion between R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and Latgales Ener\u0123ija regarding the time when payment of depreciation was owed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija (see paragraphs 193 ff. above) suddenly came to a head. R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli sued Latgales Ener\u0123ija in the Latgale Regional Court seeking *inter alia* payment of certain amounts (see paragraph 302 below). R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli finally sought, and obtained, the attachment of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s funds held by banks and payments owed by any third parties.\n\n254.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that the claims were spurious280 and the application for an attachment was calculated to prevent Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s from using its bank account to make and receive payments and to disrupt Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s business operations and create further difficulties in order for stable and uninterrupted heating to be provided just before the heating season began.281\n\nCl.

The Social Care Directorate made a similar request in relation to the Social Care Centre for the Retired.285\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the request in order for heating to be started was made on 1 October 2007 and the Municipality Educational Department complained to the Regulator on the same day (Cl.

and\n\n(xii) on 30 October 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija answered the Regulator\u2019s warning of 5 October 2007 (see paragraph 297 below).\n\nThese events will be recalled in some detail in the following sub-sections.\n\n(A) Towards the Regulator\u2019s Decision Taking over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s Zone (11 October 2007)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe first meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee took place on 9 October 2007.303 The meeting ended with the Mayor proposing to send Latgales Ener\u0123ija a request in writing to supply heating to the six schools and nursery schools within 24 hours as of receipt of the letter and to inform the Regulator and a number of Ministries of the decision made.\n\nC-145 [page 2].\n\n269.\n\nThe request that heating be provided within 24 hours was confirmed by the Mayor in a letter dated 10 October 2007.304\n\nC-145 [page 1].\n\n270.\n\nOn 10 October 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council submitted an application to the Regulator; that application is not in evidence, but it is mentioned in the Regulator\u2019s decision No. 26 dated 11 October 2007.305\n\nC-23 [pages 9 ff.].\n\n271.\n\nIn the meantime, on 10 October 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council had signed the Loan Agreement with the Treasury of the Republic of Latvia (the \"Latvian Treasury Loan Agreement\") which it had entered into in order to fund the increase in the share capital of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija (see paragraph 261 above).306\n\nR-20 [pages 2 ff.].\n\n272.\n\nThe next meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee took place on 11 October 2007.307 The meeting ended with a decision to apply to the Latvian Public Utilities Commission. Asked by the Mayor to comment on the situation, Mr. Melnikovs stated that the northern boiler was not running at all, Latgales Ener\u0123ija was seeking to buy fuel without using funds and to have its bank account unblocked.\n\nC-146.\n\n273.\n\nOn 11 October 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council submitted an application to the Regulator, which is not in evidence, but is mentioned in the Regulator\u2019s decision No. 26 dated 11 October 2007.308\n\nC-23 [page 10].\n\n274.\n\nOn 11 October 2007 the Regulator decided to take over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s zone forthwith.309 On 31 March 2010 Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application to have that decision set aside was dismissed by the Administrative Regional Court, then it was dismissed anew on 24 November 2011.310\n\nC-23 [pages 9 ff.].\n\nR-3. see paragraph 402 below.\n\n(B) The Appointment of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as the Person Responsible to Provide Heating Services in REzekne (12 October 2007)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nOn 12 October 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council appointed R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija \"as the person in charge of provision of thermal energy in in the administrative territory of R\u0113zekne\".311\n\nC-25. The decision is stated to be based on Sect. 15(1)(1) of the Municipalities Act (CLA-46) and Sect. 28(2) of the Public Utility Regulators Act (CLA-49).\n\n276.\n\nThe third meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee took place on 13 October 2007 and lasted five hours and fifteen minutes.312 The meeting ended with the decision to execute the Council\u2019s decision of the previous day to delegate the task to provide heating to the Municipality to R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija.313\n\nThe minutes are exhibited as C-147 ; in addition, an audio recording was made which is not in evidence.  \n The Centre was chaired and managed by the Mayor Mr. Vjakse and further included Mr. G. Spradzenko, Ms. M. Muceniece. Mr. I. Klimanovs, Mr. M. Bartasevics, Mr. E. Jurkans, Ms. D. Abramova, Mr. V. Nikonovs. Mr. A. Pusnakovs (Councillors of R\u0113zekne City Council); Mr. I.

Zimina (Head of the Public Relations Department of the R\u0113zekne City Council). In addition, the meeting was attended by Mr. Strioga (E energija). Messrs L. Voronovs, I. Berzins, S. Melnikovs (Latgales Ener\u0123ija), Mr. E. Skincs (Member of the Board of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija); Mr. A. Mez\u00e1ls (Member of the Board of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli).\n\nC-147 \u00b6 16.\n\n277.\n\nAfter summarizing recent events the Mayor presented two options; the minutes of the meeting do not reflect the discussion on those two options clearly,314 but those options are clearly outlined in a document prepared by the Mayor.315 At the hearing, only the Claimant brought witnesses to testify on what was said at that meeting.316\n\nC-147.\n\nC-148.\n\nSee in particular CWS-1 \u00b6\u00b6 102-104.\n\n278.\n\nAccording to Option No. 1, Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s activity would be limited to the production of thermal energy; R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija would be in charge of the transmission and distribution, as well as the sale of thermal energy. According to Option No. 2, R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija would take over production, transmission and distribution as well as the sale of thermal energy and Latgales Ener\u0123ija would drop out of the picture altogether, save for any legal proceedings which it might bring, as such an event was expressly identified as a risk.317\n\nC-148.\n\n279.\n\nBoth options thus excluded that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would keep the position that had been agreed upon under the agreements made with the R\u0113zekne City Council on the one hand (see paragraphs 100 ff. and 169 ff. above), and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli on the other (see paragraphs 78 ff. and 166 ff. above).\n\n280.\n\nOn 15 October 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council ordered the Municipal Police to guard the property of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli in the three boiler houses.318 This was the Municipality\u2019s reaction to an apparent belief that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had brought in private security to protect the premises, a point that was briefly discussed in the 13 October 2007 Energy Crisis Committee meeting.319\n\nC-149.\n\nC-147 \u00b6 5.\n\n281.\n\nOn 17 October 2007 Latvijas G\u0101ze resumed the supplies of natural gas.320\n\nC-153 \u00b6 12.\n\n282.\n\nOn 17 October 2007 the Latgale Regional Court revoked its previous decision of 21 September 2007321 granting an attachment on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s assets (for more details see paragraph 305 below).322\n\nC-138, see paragraph 255 above.\n\nC-150.\n\n(C) The R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija Gas Supply Agreement (17 October 2007)\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nOn 17 October 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija (as \"the User\") entered into a gas supply agreement with R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija (as \"the Supplier\") (the \"R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija Gas Supply Agreement\").323\n\nC-151.\n\n284.\n\nClauses 2.2 and 4.2 of the R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija Gas Supply Agreement provide that Latgales Ener\u0123ija has a duty to pay the invoices for actual consumption of natural gas issued by R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija.\n\n(D) The October 2007 Agreement (25 October 2007)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nOn 23 October 2007 a meeting took place which paved the way for the execution of a contract two days later.324\n\nSee CWS-1 \u00b6 105 and Transcript, Day 2, 75-76 [Strioga].\n\n286.\n\nOn 25 October 2007 an agreement was made between Latgales Ener\u0123ija, UAB E Ener\u0123ija, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli, the R\u0113zekne City Council and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija (the \"October 2007 Agreement\").325 The October 2007 Agreement contemplated the actions to be taken by each party, subdivided into three distinct stages as follows:\n\n(i) Stage I, covering the period from 25 October to 28 October 2007;\n\n(ii) Stage II, covering the period from 25 October to 30 November 2007; and\n\n(iii) Stage III, covering the period until 30 May 2008.\n\nC-26.\n\n287.\n\nStage 1 (Clauses *(a)* to *(e))* in essence contemplated five points as follows:\n\n*(a)* the parties undertook to take all necessary actions in relation to bailiffs in order to remove the attachment of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s accounts in the shortest possible time to ensure free flow of funds; R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli was entitled to challenge the court decisions only in order to have the attachment removed; the parties would then reach a settlement by 30 May 2008 on the claim brought by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli; no new proceedings would be brought and no new claims would be made within the proceedings currently pending;\n\n*(b)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija undertook to grant discounts to users as from the date when the Regulator would approve new rates;\n\n*(c)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija would submit its calculations relating to a new rate to the R\u0113zekne City Council ten days before submitting them to the Regulator (see paragraph 291 below);\n\n*(d)* the parties undertook to sign a statement of acceptance and delivery upon the installation and commissioning of a Witomax boiler at Atbr\u012bvo\u0161anas alej\u0101 155a; and\n\n*(e)* R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli would give approval by 15 November 2007 in order for a sub-lease agreement to be signed with SIA \"LE Remonts\" (\"LE Remonts\") and with SIA LE Kogeneracija (\"LE Kogeneracija\") and would issue the documents required in order for an application for the installation, commissioning and operation of a cogeneration plant to be submitted to AS Latvenergo.\n\n288.\n\nStage II (Clauses *(f)* to (i)) in essence contemplated four further points as follows:\n\n*(f)* R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli would agree with E energija and Latgales Ener\u0123ija on certain annotations to be cancelled in the Land Registry in relation to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s assets; a separate agreement was concluded between the Claimant and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli on 25 October 2007 to this effect;326\n\n*(g)* the parties would prepare and submit to each other a list of complaints relating to the Long-Term Agreement (see also paragraph 294 below);\n\n*(h)* the parties undertook to refrain from public announcements and complaints unless previous agreement had been reached in that respect; and\n\n*(i)* R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija undertook to supply natural gas to Latgales Ener\u0123ija in accordance with the R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija Gas Supply Agreement; R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija and Latgales Ener\u0123ija would agree on a more detailed agreement within one month as of the conclusion of the October 2007 Agreement.327\n\nR-3 3.  \n The Respondent contends that the purpose and the effect of this agreement goes far beyond what is contemplated by the October 2007 Agreement, see paragraph 1125 below.\n\nClause 8.1 (in handwriting after the signature page) of the R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija Gas Supply Agreement (C-151) seems to indicate that the parties did not have sufficient time to work out all contract terms properly.\n\n289.\n\nFinally, Stage III (Clauses *(j)* to *(k))* in essence contemplated two points as follows:\n\n*(j)* R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli undertook to submit proposed amendments for the revision of the Long-Term Agreement by 29 February 2008; and\n\n*(k)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija would submit its own suggestions and objections in relation to the proposed amendments submitted by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli by 25 March 2008, which the parties would start to review within 15 days; the parties would coordinate their amendments to the Long-term Agreement by 30 May 2008.\n\n290.\n\nOn 26 October 2007 however, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli filed an ancillary complaint against the Latgale Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 17 October 2007 that had revoked the attachment on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s assets328.329 As a consequence, Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account remained frozen. That was a breach of the October 2007 Agreement on the part of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and the Municipality (see more in detail paragraphs 964-967 below).\n\nC-150. see paragraph 282 above and paragraph 306 below.\n\nC-152.\n\n291.\n\nOn 5 November 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija offered the R\u0113zekne City Council reduced rates (see paragraph 238 above).330 The reason for which Latgales Ener\u0123ija proposed reduced rates to the R\u0113zekne City Council rather than the Regulator lies in paragraph *(c)* of the October 2007 Agreement (C-26, see also paragraph 287 above), in spite of the fact that the letter does not expressly refer to the October 2007 Agreement.331\n\nC-154.\n\nSee also CWS-3 \u00b6 26.\n\n292.\n\nOn 7 November 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija wrote to the R\u0113zekne City Council, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija with respect to the performance of their obligations under the October 2007 Agreement, pointing out that funds in its bank account were still frozen by the attachment, requesting explanations as to the reasons why the provisions of the October 2007 Agreement had not been complied with and expressing its concerns that it would not otherwise be able to perform its own obligations under the October 2007 Agreement.332\n\nThere is no answer to that letter on the record, either by the R\u0113zekne City Council, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli or R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija.\n\nC-155.\n\n293.\n\nOn 29 November 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija informed the Regulator that it might be unable to provide heat services.333 On 7 December 2007 the Regulator asked whether Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s statements should be understood as an application in order for the Regulator to revoke Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences.334 On 12 December 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija answered that its 29 November letter was sent simply to inform the Regulator of the existing difficulties.335\n\nC-158.\n\nC-161.\n\nC-163.\n\n294.\n\nOn 30 November 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija sent the R\u0113zekne City Council and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli the list of its claims in relation to the Long-Term Agreement in accordance with Clause *(g)* of the October 2007 Agreement.336 The list included claims against the R\u0113zekne City Council337 and claims against R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli.338\n\nOn 30 November 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija wrote to R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija that it was under no obligation for the time being to pay for the natural gas supplied since its bank account had been attached and the R\u0113zekne City Council, R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli were in breach of their contractual duties under the October 2007 Agreement,339 in particular with respect to the duty to lift the attachment.

In his interview given on 13 September 2007 the Mayor had referred to that dispute in some detail, indicating that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had instructed counsel from Riga the week before in order to sue Latgales Ener\u0123ija.353\n\nC-134. see paragraph 251 above.\n\n302.\n\nOn 20 September 2007 R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli brought an action against Latgales Ener\u0123ija before the Latgale Regional Court354 under the terms of the Long-Term Agreement355 seeking payment of the amounts of LVL 778,415.41 for the lease of the assets, LVL 72,774.20 for a contractual penalty and LVL 29,164.41 for an outstanding debt for gas delivered, in total LVL 880,354.02 and recovery against Latgales Ener\u0123ija.356\n\nR\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli further sought a declaration that the Long-Term Agreement was terminated as of the date of the judgment to be made and that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli was entitled to recover the possession of the leased assets, as well as a declaration that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was bound to pay in full the invoices presented by Latvijas G\u0101ze.\n\nFinally, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli sought the attachment of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s assets and funds in cash held by banks and payments owed by any third parties.\n\nThe document instituting the proceedings is not in evidence, but its content is summarised in C-138 p. 2.\n\nG4.\n\nC-138 [page 2].\n\n303.\n\nOn 21 September 2007 the Latgale Regional Court granted R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s application and attached funds held in Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account, including debts owed by third parties to Latgales Ener\u0123ija, for an amount up to LVL 880,354.02, with immediate effect.357\n\nC-138 [page 3].\n\n304.\n\nOn 5 October 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija applied to the Latgale Regional Court to have the attachment cancelled.358\n\nC-143.  \n The application sought a review of the attachment decision (C-138) as a matter of urgency on the basis that the heating season would start by the following week according to the previous practice, and Latgales Ener\u0123ija would increasingly need to use its money to purchase the fuel required for its operations; if the attachment was maintained for more than two weeks, the city of R\u0113zekne might be left without heating and hot water (C-143 \u00b6\u00b6 5-7). Latgales Ener\u0123ija raised an objection to the jurisdiction of the court relying on the fact that its registered office was in Riga, but asked nonetheless the Court to cancel the attachment decision as a matter of urgency (C-143 \u00b6\u00b6 16; 19-21; 54).\n\n305.\n\nOn 17 October 2007 the Latgale Regional Court revoked its decision granting the attachment dated 21 September 2007, upheld Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s jurisdictional objection and transferred the case to the Riga Regional Court on jurisdictional grounds.359\n\nC-150 [page 3].\n\n306.\n\nOn 26 October 2007 R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli brought an ancillary complaint against the Latgale Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 17 October 2007 before the Supreme Court, asking the Supreme Court to set aside the judgment revoking the attachment of Latgales Ener\u0123ija.360\n\nC-152.  \n R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli contended that the judgment by the Latgales Regional Court should be set aside and a decision should be made on the merits. It argued that the subject-matter of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s action was the possession of the leased facilities including the immovable property since R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had sought the termination of the Long-Term Agreement. R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli further contended that the Latgales Regional Court had jurisdiction on the basis that the assets in dispute were in R\u0113zekne and that jurisdiction lay also with the courts of the place where damage to the property in dispute liad been caused. The losses suffered by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli could be caused by a breach of contract, not only by a tort as found by the Latgales Regional Court.\n\n307.\n\nThis complaint was filed one day after the October 2007 Agreement361 was executed.

After mid-December 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija had started to charge users in accordance with the revised tariff approved by the Regulator on 9 November 2007 as it took the view that the effects of the Regulator\u2019s decision of 7 December 2007 were stayed due to Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application for review (see paragraph 244 above).\n\nIn January 2008 the R\u0113zekne City Council wrote to users indicating *(i)* that the rate applicable was the tariff approved on 19 December 2005 (see paragraph 154 above) and *(ii)* that this was the sole rate which Latgales Ener\u0123ija was entitled to apply.387 The same information was provided in the press.388\n\nC-184,2.\n\nC-169.\n\n325.\n\nThere was widespread confusion in the public as to the applicable rates.

On 7 March 2013 the Supreme Court held, on appeal, that the 2008 Assignment Agreement was valid, but it also decided that Latgales Ener\u0123ija no longer owned a debt against R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli on the basis that Latgales Ener\u0123ija owed itself a debt to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli under the Long-Term Agreement which gave rise to a merger of rights and liabilities.477 Mr. Jautakis in his first Witness Statement refers to a Latvian decision of 2009 holding that the assignment was invalid, but no such decision is in evidence.478\n\nR-10 p. 1, see paragraphs 404 ff. below.\n\nCWS-2 \u00b6 20.\n\n380.\n\nFurther arrangements were made in 2009 (see paragraph 411 below).\n\n**F.

Rep. \u00b6 67.\n\n**(2) The Civil Proceedings Brought by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli against Latgales Ener\u0123ija**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nR\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had brought an action against Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 20 September 2007 and the Latgale Regional Court had granted an attachment on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s funds on the following day (see paragraphs 301 ff. above).\n\nR\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had not applied to the court in order that the attachment should be lifted despite the undertakings contained in the October 2007 Agreement and Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s complaints.482\n\nC-26. see paragraphs 286 ff. above.\n\n384.\n\nR\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli amended its claims on the merits twice, first on 4 June 2008483 and then on 17 June 2009.484\n\nC-246 p. 6.\n\nC-246 p. 6.\n\n385.\n\nOn 30 June 2009 Latgales Ener\u0123ija filed its answer to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s statement of claim.485\n\nC-234.  \n Latgales Ener\u0123ija answered R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s claim for unpaid rent contending that the Long-Term Agreement (C-4) was still in force and that the part of the rent relating to the depreciation of the assets would be payable at the time the assets had to be returned to the plaintiff; therefore, Latgales Ener\u0123ija was not in default (C-234 [pages 1-2]). It also followed that there were no grounds upon which the Long-Term Agreement could be terminated (C-234 [page 3]).  \n R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s notice of termination of the Long-Term Agreement (C-180, see paragraph 339 above) was inconsistent with the terms of the Long-Term Agreement and it could therefore have no effects whatsoever (C-234 [page 3]).  \n Finally, Latgales Ener\u0123ija answered that it was not bound to pay the invoices issued by Latvijas G\u0101ze to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli for the natural gas supplied (C-234 [pages 3 ff.]). This was so on the basis that the plaintiff did not have a licence to sell natural gas.\n\n386.\n\nOn 9 July 2009 the Riga Regional Court granted R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s claims in substantial part as follows:486*(i)* the court \"revoked\" the Long-Term Agreement;487*(ii)* the court awarded the claim for payment of the lease with respect to depreciation488 as well as *(iii)* the claim for payment of gas delivered and used. However, the court dismissed *(iv)* the claim for payment of a contractual penalty and *(v)* the request for a declaration that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was bound to pay the invoices issued by Latvijas G\u0101ze.489\n\nC-194,\n\nIt is unclear whether the court declared that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s notice of termination was effective and the Long-Term Agreement had terminated pursuant to such notice, or whether the Long-Term Agreement was revoked by virtue of the judgment of the court.\n\nThe court held that the part of the lease payments owed for depreciation under Clause 4.4.2(a) of the Long-Term Agreement was not payable until such time when the leased infrastructure would be transferred back to the lessor, and Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s argument was accepted in this respect. As a consequence, the claim for a contractual penalty was dismissed. However, payment of the part of the lease relating to depreciation was ordered since the Long-Term Agreement was no longer in force according to the court.\n\nC-194 [page 10 (penultimate paragraph)], contains a typo in the original (the original text in Latvian could not be checked as it was cut off in the pages filed attached to the translation) or a translation mistake; \"invoices issued by JSC Latgales Ener\u0123ija\" should read \"invoices issued by Latvijas G\u0101ze\".\n\n387.\n\nOn 29 July 2009 Latgales Ener\u0123ija appealed against this judgment before the Supreme Court of Latvia.490\n\nC-23 5.\n\n388.\n\nOn 20 April 2012 the Court Panel for Civil Matters of the Supreme Court of Latvia dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s appeal.491\n\nThe court stated that the judgment by the Riga Regional Court was \"correct and sufficiently substantiated\"; the court therefore agreed with the court below and did not need to repeat the reasons given by the Riga Regional Court (C-246 p. 15).\n\n389.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija filed an application to have this judgment set aside in cassation proceedings. On 7 April 2014 the Supreme Court allowed the application, set the judgment aside and remitted the case to another court of appeal in order for a fresh decision to be made.492 On 30 November 2015 the Chamber of Civil Cases of the Supreme Court of Latvia found that the Long-Term Agreement had been unilaterally terminated on 16 September 2008 and awarded R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli its claim for payment of the rent and for unpaid gas (judgment filed by the Respondent in this arbitration on 19 December 2016).493\n\nR-8.\n\nThe court found that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was under an obligation to pay for the gas supplied by Latvijas G\u0101ze in the amounts invoiced by Latvijas G\u0101ze. The judgment considers the provisions of the Long-Term Agreement, but not the February 2005 Agreement.\n\n**(3) Dismissal of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s Challenge against the Regulator\u2019s Decision to Revoke the Licences (3 June 2008) and the Judgment of 16 June 2009 (6 May 2010)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nOn 16 June 2009 the Administrative District Court dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application494 to have the Regulator\u2019s decision No. 10 dated 3 June 2008495 set aside by which the Regulator had revoked the three licences granted to Latgales Ener\u0123ija.496 Latgales Ener\u0123ija appealed against that decision.497\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application is not in evidence, but it is summarised in the Administrative Court of Appeal decision in R-2. Latgales Ener\u0123ija made the following arguments.  \n First, the licences could be revoked only subsequent to a decision suspending them in accordance with Sects. 17 to 19 of Regulation No. 664 on the Licensing of Public Utilities (CLA-56) and imposing a time limit in order for the service provider to cure the breach(es) which caused the suspension. In the present case the Regulator had failed to suspend the licences and fix a time limit in order for Latgales Ener\u0123ija to cure any alleged breaches.  \n Secondly, a licence may be revoked provided, however, that a prior warning has been given to the service provider at least three months in advance; the licence may be revoked within the month following the expiry of the three-month time limit; a failure to comply with the one-month time limit requires the whole procedure to be repeated. In the present case the licences were revoked almost five months after the expiry of the notice period. Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s right to a stable and predictable legal position had been breached.  \n Thirdly, the licences were revoked on a basis other titan that which liad been mentioned in the Regulator\u2019s warning of 4 October 2007 (C-22, see paragraph 262 above).  \n The Regulator opposed that both of the time limits relied upon by Latgales Ener\u0123ija were not applicable to the revocation of a licence by the Regulator, and that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had been given an opportunity to be heard and had failed to comply with the Regulator\u2019s decisions.\n\nC-29, see also paragraph 337 above.\n\nR-2\u00b63.  \n Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application to set aside was dismissed on 16 June 2009 on the basis that *(i)* the law did not require that a decision revoking a licence should be preceded by one suspending the licence; *(ii)* the Regulator had proceeded in accordance with the provisions of the Public Utility Regulators Act (CLA-49) ; *(iii)* the Regulator was bound to give the utilities provider a three-month notice prior to revoking a licence; *(iv)* however, the Regulator was not bound to make a decision within a month as from the day on which the three-month time limit had expired as the Regulator was entitled to proceed on a case-by-case basis and it was not necessary, therefore, to repeat the procedure as contended by the applicant; and *(v)* the breaches of paragraphs 7.1, 7.2 and (indirectly) 6.2 of the licences had been substantiated in the Regulator\u2019s decision and the applicant had been notified in previous correspondence and had been provided with an opportunity to cure such breaches. The Regulator\u2019s decision was therefore in accordance with law and the application to set aside was to be dismissed.\n\nR-2 \u00b6 4.\n\n391.\n\nOn 6 May 2010 the Administrative Regional Court498 dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s appeal against the 16 June 2009 decision.499\n\nThe translation filed by the Respondent (R-2) indicates the name of the court as \"the Regional Court of Administrative Cases\", the Respondent\u2019s exhibit list as the \"Latvian Administrative Appeal court\" *(Administrativa apgabaltiesa* is the name in the original decision).\n\nThe reasons for dismissal of the appeal are set out in four paragraphs as the Administrative Court of Appeal held that the judgment by the court below was accurate and the Court of Appeal concurred with the court below.\n\n**(4) Dismissal of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s Challenge against the Regulator\u2019s Decision No. 12 dated 11 June 2007 (15 April 2009)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nOn 15 April 2009 the Administrative District Court dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application500 to have the Regulator\u2019s Decision No. 12 dated 11 June 2007501 set aside (by which the Regulator had rejected the new tariffs proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 29 May 2007502).503 The reasons given by the court are recalled and discussed in paragraph 906 below.\n\nC-100, see paragraph 185 above, as amended in C-125 (see paragraphs 186 and 234 above).\n\nOriginally the decision sought to be set aside was the Regulator\u2019s decision No. 17 dated 13 October 2006 (C-19, see paragraph 184 above); the Regulator\u2019s decision No. 12 dated 11 June 2007 (C-21, see paragraph 233 above) was also challenged with the amended application, and Latgales Ener\u0123ija limited its challenge to the latter decision in its amended application (see paragraph 186 above).\n\nC-20, see also paragraph 232 above.\n\nC-192.\n\n393.\n\nOn 14 May 2009 Latgales Ener\u0123ija appealed against the 15 April 2009 decision by the Administrative District Court and applied to the court in order to be granted a fresh time limit in which to bring its appeal. The appeal and the application are not in evidence.504\n\nSee R-1 p. 1.\n\n394.\n\nOn 27 May 2009 Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application was denied and the appeal was dismissed. This decision is not in evidence.505\n\nSee, however, R-1 p. 1.\n\n395.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija appealed against the decision of 27 May 2009, and the appeal was dismissed on 24 September 2009.506\n\nR-l. It is unclear whether the appeal was denied by the Latvian Administrative Appeal Court, as stated in the Respondent's exhibit list, or the Administrative District Court, as stated in the translation of Exhibit R-l ; the name of the court in Latvian is *Administrativa rajona tiesa.* The Tribunal takes it that it is the Administrative District Court.\n\n**(5) Dismissal of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s Complaint against the Enforcement of the Council\u2019s Decision No. 316 of 14 July 2008 by Forcible Means (2 July 2009)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nOn 2 July 2009 the Administrative District Court dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s complaint against the R\u0113zekne City Council and the State Police that the enforcement of R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s decision No. 316 dated 14 July 2008507 by forcible means was unlawful.508 Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s complaint is not in evidence.\n\nC-33. see paragraph 349 above.\n\nR-6.  \n The court stated that its decision related solely to the question whether the procedure of enforcement by forcible means was lawful, not the question whether the decision to be enforced was itself lawful (R-6 \u00b6 5). The court considered that the decision to be enforced had come into force and had not been executed voluntarily by Latgales Ener\u0123ija (R-6 \u00b6 10). The court found that the decision to be enforced was not final and enforceable, but an exception to the rule applied where the decision to be enforced stated that enforcement was required as a matter of urgency to avert a danger to State security, public order, the life or the health or property of citizens. The court found that there was a risk in the present case that the supply of heating in the city of R\u0113zekne could not be ensured unless the heating infrastructure was taken over, and that the decision to be enforced contained sufficient indications as to the need to ensure that heating services should continue to be provided (R-6 \u00b6 10). This was so in spite of the fact that the decision to be enforced had been made on 14 July 2008 and the warning preceding enforcement was dated 15 September 2008 (R-6 \u00b6 10).  \n The court further found that the warning contained all the indications required by law, including a direction to the addressee to comply with the decision voluntarily; Latgales Ener\u0123ija's objections raised on that basis were without foundation (R-6 \u00b6 11).  \n The court went on to examine whether the 15 September 2008 (C-186) warning of enforcement by forcible means contained an advance notice which was in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, since enforcement by forcible means had been announced for the following day, when enforcement in fact took place. The court found that the warning was lawful considering the urgency and the need to protect the health and property of the city inhabitants (R-6 \u00b6 12).  \n The court found that Latgales Ener\u0123ija liad not argued that the use of force was disproportionate and that there were no elements on the record suggesting that direct force had been applied at all, or had been applied inappropriately (R-6 \u00b6 13).  \n The court dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija's complaint also insofar as it was directed against the State Police, having found that Latgales Ener\u0123ija argued that the police officers had not applied physical force \"but their presence was sufficient to give an impression that the use of such force was real\". Considering that Latgales Ener\u0123ija could reasonably be expected to resist the enforcement of the decision by forcible means, the presence of police officers was lawful and justified (R-6 \u00b6 14).  \n The court finally considered Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s complaint that it had been denied access to its property left in the building as a consequence of the fact that it was denied access to its offices. The court found that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli liad drawn up a notice to Latgales Ener\u0123ija requesting the offices premises to vacated on 16 September 2008 and asking Latgales Ener\u0123ija personnel to return on 22 September 2008 to receive their personal belongings and vacate the premises. Latgales Ener\u0123ija maintained that it had received such notice only on 22 September 2008. R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli then sent Latgales Ener\u0123ija a letter on 29 September 2008 stating that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s belongings would be transferred on 6 October 2008. The Court concluded that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli therefore had taken possession of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s belongings for some time, but had taken prompt action to return them. That was a breach of procedure, but its importance was not sufficient to cause the whole enforcement procedure to be unlawful (R-6\u00b6 15).\n\n**(6) Dismissal of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s Challenge against the Council\u2019s Decision No. 316 of 14 July 2008 (25 May 2010)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nOn 25 May 2010 the Administrative District Court dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s challenge against the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s decision No. 316 dated 14 July 2008509 (by which the Council had decided that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was immediately to provide access to all assets at all three boiler houses and transfer all other means required for the provision of heating to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija).510\n\nC-33, see paragraph 349 above.\n\nR-5.\n\n398.\n\nThe Administrative District Court considered that the Regulator\u2019s decision revoking the licences had to be enforced as a matter of urgency as the R\u0113zekne City Council had a duty to decide how to organise the heat supply services for the residents of the city. The Council\u2019s assessment was reasonable in that the restriction of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s private rights had to give way to the public interest represented by the interest of the 25,000 residents of R\u0113zekne to be provided with heat supply services.\n\n399.\n\nThe Court finally dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s complaint that the Council\u2019s decision amounted to a forced taking of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s property which was not based on law and did not provide for a fair compensation; the Court stated that it was true that the Council had not considered the issue of the value of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s investment in its decision, and Latgales Ener\u0123ija was therefore entitled to proceed in accordance with the terms of the Long-Term Agreement and claim the market price of the investments made.\n\n**(7) Dismissal of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s Challenge against the Regulator\u2019s Decision No. 35 Dated 7 December 2007 and the Judgment Dated 30 October 2009 (23 September 2010)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nOn 12 December 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija had challenged the Regulator\u2019s decision No. 35 of 7 December 2007511 by which the Regulator had annulled its previous decision of 9 November 2007 approving the draft tariffs proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija; the challenge was dismissed by a decision of the Administrative Regional Court of 30 October 2009512.513\n\nC-28, see paragraph 240 above.\n\nThe decision is not on the record, but it is summarised in R-4 \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 5.\n\nC-164.\n\n401.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija appealed against that judgment; the appeal was dismissed by the Administrative Regional Court on 23 September 2010.514\n\nR-4.\n\n**(8) Dismissal of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s Challenge against the Regulator\u2019s Decision No. 26 Dated 11 October 2007 and the Judgment Dated 31 March 2010 (24 November 2011)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nOn 31 March 2010 the Administrative District Court dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application to have the Regulator\u2019s decision No. 26 of 11 October 2007515 set aside.516 Latgales Ener\u0123ija appealed against this judgment. The appeal was dismissed by the Administrative Regional Court on 24 November 2011.517\n\nC-23, see paragraph 274 above.\n\nR-3. The translation filed by the Respondent (R-3 p. 1) indicates the name of the court as \"the Administrative Regional Court\"; however, the Latvian original text refers to the decision of the *Administrativas rajona tiesa* of 31 March 2010, the decision was therefore made by the Administrative District Court (same inaccuracy in the translation in R-3 \u00b6 4).\n\nR-3 \u00b6 4.\n\n403.\n\nThe Administrative Regional Court stated that it was not in dispute that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had failed to provide heat supply to the entire Northern housing estate of R\u0113zekne including six schools.518 The court then considered Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s defence that the failure to provide heat supply had been caused by coordinated action on the part of the R\u0113zekne City Council and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli, which it dismissed as unproven. The court dealt with three distinct points.\n\nFirst, the court found that it was Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to pay in full the amounts for which Latvijas G\u0101ze issued invoices to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli in June, July, August and September 2007 which gave rise to the Council\u2019s debt to Latvijas G\u0101ze and the suspension by Latvijas G\u0101ze of the natural gas supply. As a consequence, the Council announced the energy crisis which was the basis for the Regulator\u2019s decision.519\n\nSecondly, the court held that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s argument that the Regulator\u2019s decision was affected by a conflict of interest on the basis that deputies of the Council had taken part in its making was without foundation.520\n\nThirdly, the court examined Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s defence that the attachment of funds obtained by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account (see paragraphs 253 to 255 above) was the cause of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s inability to pay. The court found that such might have been the case; however, even in such case Latgales Ener\u0123ija was not released from its duty to provide its services on a continuous basis throughout the period of validity of the licences and in accordance with the terms thereof.521\n\nR-3 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\nR-3 \u00b6 12.\n\nR-3 \u00b6 13.\n\nR-3 \u00b6 14.\n\n**(9) The Civil Proceedings Brought by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli against Latgales Ener\u0123ija and the Claimant**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nR\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli appealed against the judgment made by the Riga Regional Court on 23 September 2010 dismissing the action brought against Latgales Ener\u0123ija and the Claimant on 13 August 2008 (see paragraph 371 above).\n\n405.\n\nOn 7 March 2013 the Latvian Supreme Court allowed the appeal.522\n\nR-10.  \n The court decided as follows: *(i)* R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s obligations and debts under the two credit agreements were terminated; *(ii)* the pledges registered pursuant to such agreements were discharged; *(iii)* the entries relating to such pledges in the Land Registry were to be deleted; *(iv)* R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s was released from the duty to comply with the decision of the court below; and *(v)* R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s claim that the assignment between Latgales Ener\u0123ija and UAB be declared to be invalid was dismissed.\n\n**(10) Supplementing Certain Arrangements Made in the 2005-2008 Period - New Arrangements**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(A) Payment by the Claimant under the Parent Company Guarantee Delivered to Sampo Banka/Danske Bank\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nOn 30 June 2009 Danske Bank (formerly Sampo Banka523) requested the Claimant to pay an amount of LVL 1,218,056.16 under the Sampo Banka Guarantee524.525 Danske Bank stated in its request to the Claimant that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had failed to pay its debt under the Sampo Banka Loan Agreement.526 According to Mr. Jautakis\u2019 first Witness Statement, the Claimant paid the principal amount (LVL 1,118,056.16) as well as interest (LVL 184,091.68), and thus a total amount of LVL 1,302,147.84 to Danske Bank. Reliance is placed on Exhibit C-196.527\n\nThe merger between JSC Sampo Banka and Danske Bank A/S took effect on 30 June 2008, C-193 and C-195, Preamble. Clause 2.\n\nC-102, see paragraph 202 above.\n\nC-193.\n\nC-101, see paragraph 199 above.\n\nCWS-2 \u00b6 61.\n\n407.\n\nOn 5 August 2009 Danske Bank and the Claimant agreed on a repayment schedule contemplating ten instalments;528 the repayment schedule was amended twice, first under the terms of an agreement dated 17 May 2010529 and then under the terms of an agreement dated 26 April 2011.530\n\nC-195.\n\nC-203.\n\nC-204.\n\n408.\n\nOn 9 November 2012 Danske Bank confirmed to the Claimant\u2019s auditors that the Claimant had no outstanding obligations to the bank.531\n\nC-208.\n\n409.\n\nThe payment by the Claimant of a total amount of LVL 1,302,147.84 to Danske Bank was alleged by the Claimant in its first memorial of 6 December 2013;532 such evidence was not disputed by the Respondent in its first Counter-Memorial. Mr. Jautakis\u2019 evidence was not challenged by the Respondent at the Hearing (see paragraph 315 above). However, the Respondent challenged that there was evidence that the Claimant paid the amount of the guarantee to Danske Bank for the first time in a post-Hearing submission on March 2015.533\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 62. 70. 361(4) and confirmed by CWS-2 \u00b6 61.\n\nResp. P-H (PO8) \u00b6 22.\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses that objection based on the documents in evidence in relation to the guarantee provided by the Claimant to Danske Bank, as amended, and Danske Bank\u2019s request for payment.534 If the Respondent intended to challenge the statement made by Danske Bank to the Claimant\u2019s auditors,535 it should have raised this point in its pleadings and called the auditors and cross-examined them at the Hearing.\n\nC-102 ; C-193 ; C-195 ; C-203 ; C-204.\n\nC-208.\n\n(B) Arrangements Following the 2008 Assignment Agreement\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nThe circumstances in which the 2008 Assignment Agreement was made are summarised in paragraphs 377 ff. above.\n\n412.\n\nMr. Jautakis\u2019 first Witness Statement536 explains that the Latvian courts held in 2009 that the 2008 Assignment Agreement between the Claimant and Latgales Ener\u0123ija was invalid; however, no such decision is in evidence, as noted in paragraph 379 above. In the same passage of his first Witness Statement, Mr. Jautakis refers to Exhibit C-190, which states that on 30 June 2009 the Claimant and Latgales Ener\u0123ija \"cancelled the agreement and cession was left in SIA Latgales Ener\u0123ija\".537 That allegation is not supported by documentary evidence.\n\nCWS-2 \u00b6 20.\n\nC-190. Sect. 17.\n\n413.\n\nMr. Jautakis further explains in his first Witness Statement that the Claimant then assigned its right to claim from Latgales Ener\u0123ija to Hansel Realty Management Spain S.L., a Spanish company.538 This assignment refers to a debt of Latgales Ener\u0123ija in an amount of EUR 1,386,967.69 (without interest and penalties) arising under a loan agreement dated 30 June 2009 which is not in evidence. Mr. Jautakis explains that no monies have been recovered to date from Latgales Ener\u0123ija in spite of a judgment by the Vidzeme Urban District Court of the city of Riga.539\n\nCWS-2 \u00b6 20; C-197.\n\nCWS-2 \u00b6 20; C-198.\n\n(C) The EBRD Loan (29 October 2009)\n-----------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nOn 29 October 2009 the EBRD Loan Agreement540 was renegotiated.541 Mr. Jautakis explains that this revision was made upon the EBRD\u2019s request, and the interest rate charged on tranche 2 was increased from 1.95% to 5% per annum.542\n\nC-165.\n\nC-199.\n\nCWS-2 \u00b6 86.\n\n**G. The Lithuanian Decisions Relied on by the Respondent (From 2005 to 2011)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant should have taken certain precautions before entering into the Long-Term Agreement in order to avoid contentious issues, such as the question of who was responsible to devise a \"heat supply development plan\".\n\nReliance is placed by the Respondent on Exhibit R-19 which includes news published in Lithuania as well as twelve decisions made by Lithuanian judicial authorities, in support of the allegation that \"it is actually Claimant\u2019s (its ultimate beneficiary\u2014Mr. Virginijus Strioga\u2019s) common practice to enter into deals with high potential that serious contentious issues will later arise (mainly, due to lack of precisely defined rules of cooperation) and subject to tedious litigation proceedings (...) rather than properly arranging for future cooperation in advance by all involved parties\".543\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 33.\n\n416.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine that aspect in due course in light of Exhibit R-19 and the Parties\u2019 pleadings (see paragraphs 547 ff. below).544\n\nExhibit R-19 contains the following:  \n I.

The Negotiations between the Parties from 1 September 2008 Onwards**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nThe present account of the negotiations between the Parties is based *inter alia* on the correspondence filed by the Respondent with the ICSID Secretary-General attached to its letter dated 6 September 2012 by way of two attachments (filed electronically as \"Enclosure 1\" and \"Enclosure 2\"). Such correspondence was not re-filed before the Tribunal in accordance with the requirements of Procedural Order No. 1 and it will therefore be identified simply by reference to the original electronic file in which it was filed designated by the expressions \"Enclosure 1\" and \"Enclosure 2\".\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Notice of Dispute dated 1 September 2008 was received by the Respondent on 25 September 2008.545 On 24 November 2008 the State Chancellery of Latvia invited Mr. Strioga to a meeting with Mr. Mekons, the representative of the State Chancellery in charge of the matter.546 The meeting took place on 5 December 2008; thereafter, Mr. Mekons put a number of questions to the Claimant\u2019s representatives,547 which the Claimant answered on 22 December 2008.548\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated 25 September 2008, Enclosure 1.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated 24 November 2008, Enclosure 1.\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 10 December 2008, Enclosure 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s email dated 22 December 2008, Enclosure 2.\n\n419.\n\nThe Parties then agreed between the end of 2008 and the beginning of January 2009 to have a conference call for further discussions which took place on 9 January 2009, as confirmed by Mr. Mekons\u2019 email of the same date.549\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 9 January 2009. Enclosure 2.\n\n420.\n\nOn 11 March 2009 Latvia\u2019s Prime Minister Mr. Ivars Goldmanis informed the Claimant that the suggested action plan prepared by the State Chancellery would be transferred to the new Prime Minister, once appointed, which was not to be construed as an acknowledgement that any applicable provisions of law had been breached by the Republic of Latvia.550\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated 11 March 2009. Enclosure 1.\n\n421.\n\nOn 27 April 2009 Latvia\u2019s Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis informed the Claimant that the Government had asked a third neutral party having knowledge of the circumstances in dispute to give his views about particular aspects of the Notice of Dispute, which was not to be construed as an acknowledgment of any liability on the part of the Respondent.551\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated 27 April 2009. Enclosure 1.\n\n422.\n\nThe Parties agreed to meet again on 27 August 2009, but they failed to reach agreement.552\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 24 August 2009 and Mr. Strioga\u2019s answer dated 25 August 2009, Enclosure 2.\n\n423.\n\nOn 23 September 2009 Mr. Mekons sent the Government\u2019s proposal to counsel for the Claimant and Mr. Strioga,553 which the Claimant rejected on 29 September 2009, calling it a \"zero compensation proposal\" and pointing out that it was entitled \"to move the dispute to international arbitration\".554\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 23 September 2009. Enclosure 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 29 September 2009. Enclosure 1.\n\n424.\n\nA meeting was then scheduled for 1 October 2009555 and a further meeting for 19 October 2009.556\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 30 September 2009. Enclosure 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 15 October 2009, and the Claimant\u2019s answer dated 16 October 2009, Enclosure 2.\n\n425.\n\nOn 27 October 2009 the Respondent made a further proposal for a settlement involving no monetary compensation.557 That communication is relevant to the interpretation of the Claimant\u2019s Board Minutes dated 1 December 2009 and will therefore be quoted verbatim:558\n\nDear Aleksas [Mr. Jautakis],\n\nAs [expressed to you this morning, and. in line with last week\u2019s discussion, I wish to outline in writing the view of the R\u0113zekne municipality concerning the settlement model.\n\nThe R\u0113zekne municipality. after carefully [sic] analysis of the financial position of SIA \"Latgales Ener\u0123ija\". namely, the claims of the creditors and different charges and interest over the assets of the company, **considers that a fair solution would be a solution not involving additional payment from any of the parties.**\n\nIn addition to waiver of claims against the company, all assets of SIA \"Latgales Ener\u0123ija\" attached for the benefit of the R\u0113zekne municipality would be lifted by virtue of an application of the R\u0113zekne municipality to the relevant court, thus releasing the frozen funds of the company. As a reciprocal commitment from SIA \"Latgales Ener\u0123ija\" and UAB \"E energija\", we expect all claims against the State and the R\u0113zekne municipality to be waived accordingly.\n\nIf. unfortunately, you deem such a solution unacceptable, the State Chancellery will immediate put forward its alternative proposal for the settlement model, namely, the mediation pursuant to the Latvian-Lithuanian BIT. As a dispute pursuant to a BIT emanates from a certain set of factual circumstances (no BIT contains abstract obligations of the State apart from actual State behaviour within its territory), we consider it proper to bring to the attention of the mediator or the mediation panel all claims surrounding the circumstances (that is. claims of E energija and claims of the R\u0113zekne municipality). With due regard to international practice, the State Chancellery is of the view that mediation is an expedite, confidential and cost-efficient solution.\n\nRespondent's email dated 27 October 2009, Enclosure 2 (original emphasis).\n\nC -247\n\n426.\n\nThe Claimant rejected the Respondent\u2019s proposal on 6 November 2009. That communication is also relevant to the interpretation of the Claimant\u2019s Board Minutes dated 1 December 2009 and it reads as follows:\n\nDear Mr. Ivars Mekons.\n\nReferring to your proposal sent by e-mail correspondence dated 27th October 2009. we are informing that such resolution is not acceptable to us, because, as we understand it, the resolution proposal does not include monetary compensation to us.\n\nAs indicated in our claim and through all the subsequent communication, we are of a position that our investment in Latvia was expropriated without proper compensation for the incurred losses of the investor. Consequently, fair resolution of the dispute cannot in our view be achieved if no compensation is offered.\n\nAs far as mediation is concerned, we could have seen its benefit at the early stage of our attempts to resolve the dispute amicably. However, taking into consideration that our intensive mutual attempts to reach a settlement already last 14 months and have not resulted in any approximation of the positions of the parties, we do not see how at this stage the mediation procedure can lead to the settlement of the dispute.\n\nBased on that, regretfully we have to conclude that we are left with no other alternative but to bring this matter to arbitration.\n\n427.\n\nOn 25 November 2009 the Respondent took note of the rejection of its proposal by the Claimant and suggested mediation again in the following terms:559\n\n(...)\n\nTherefore, as I already explained to you, as an alternative to a \"zero-zero payments\" solution, **as a feasible alternative I deem the mediation process, whereby the parties, pursuant to the BIT, would have an impartial professional evaluation on the merits of their claims.** Mediation, of course, generally is not binding and the parties are free to accept or reject the proposals from the mediation panel. **However, and the practice increasingly confirms this, especially in the BITs disputes, that the disputing parties can beforehand freely enter into a contractual commitment to abide by the resolution of the mediation panel.** *As the mediation panel should be chosen from the pool of arbitrators and energy experts, **the mediation package which I propose is actually akin to the arbitration process with much more efficient (the merits would be considered from both legal and professional aspects), expedite and cheaper solution.***\n\n(...)\n\nIn my last email I did not have the opportunity to explain in details the mediation package. Therefore, I would indeed appreciate if you consider this and engage in further talks regarding this proposal.\n\nC-236 (original emphasis).\n\n428.\n\nOn 27 November 2009 the Respondent answered two questions from the Claimant in relation to the proposed mediation, indicating *(i)* that the Republic of Latvia would enter into \"a legally binding agreement on the process of settlement...\" and *(ii)* that the ICSID Conciliation Rules could be used.560\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 27 November 2009, Enclosure 2.\n\n429.\n\nIt is in this context which the Claimant\u2019s Board made the resolution evidenced by the Board Minutes dated 1 December 2009.561\n\nC-247.\n\n430.\n\nOn 25 January 2010 the Respondent made a further proposal for a settlement,562 which the Claimant rejected on 5 February 20 1 0.563 On the same date, the Claimant answered a further email by the Respondent, indicating what its minimum requirements for a settlement would be in financial terms,564 whereupon the Respondent proposed that the Parties turn again to the mediation proposal.\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 25 January 2010, Enclosure 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s email dated 5 February 2010 11:36:15 *a.m.* GMT+2, Enclosure 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 5 February 2010 12:19:23 *p.m.* GMT+2, Enclosure 2.\n\n431.\n\nOn 8 February 2010 the Claimant answered as follows: \"As we informed [the] State Chancellery by our letter dated on 6/11/2009 No. 186, we do not see how at this stage the mediation procedure can lead to the settlement of the dispute. We do not have ground on changing our decision [sic]\".565\n\nClaimant\u2019s email dated 8 February 2010, Enclosure 2.\n\n432.\n\nOn 25 February 2010 the Respondent volunteered to draft \"a settlement agreement as regards mediation\".566 No answer to that email is in evidence.\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 25 February 2010, Enclosure 2.\n\n433.\n\nOn 25 June 2010 the Claimant enquired with the Respondent whether all the possibilities to resolve the dispute amicably had been exhausted in light of the fact that their upcoming Board meeting would have the investment dispute on the agenda.567\n\nC-242.\n\n434.\n\nOn 14 July 2010 the Deputy Director of the State Chancellery answered suggesting a meeting in person or a conference call to be attended by the Claimant, the State Chancellery and the R\u0113zekne municipality and asking the Claimant to contact Mr. Mekons.568\n\nC-241.\n\n435.\n\nThereafter, negotiations halted. The final meeting took place on 1 April 2011 which followed a meeting on 18 March 2011.569 The following correspondence was exchanged by email between the Parties after the 18 March 2011 meeting.\n\nClaimant\u2019s email dated 21 March 2011. Enclosure 2.\n\n436.\n\nOn 21 March 2011 the Claimant wrote the following to the Respondent:570\n\nFollowing your meeting with Mr. Virginijus Strioga, E energija CEO last Friday. I am writing to agree on the date and time convenient for you for the meeting in Riga this week to further discuss the R\u0113zekne case and potential international arbitration.\n\n(...)\n\nClaimant\u2019s email dated 21 March 2011, Enclosure 2.\n\n437.\n\nThe Legal Adviser to the Latvian Prime Minister followed up with her own email confirming the meeting for 1 April 2011 and had pointed out the following in her email to the Claimant:571\n\nLet me also emphasise that this meeting shall not be considered as a meeting under the auspices of the Latvian-Lithuanian investment protection treaty. For certain factual and legal reasons the Republic of Latvia sees the investment dispute as closed, and, consequently, the meeting shall be deemed solely as a good faith effort of Latvia outside the scope of the State\u2019s international obligations and with no negative legal or financial consequences arising out of it to Latvia.\n\nRespondent\u2019s email dated 24 March 2011, Enclosure 2.\n\n438.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s answer confirms its intention to attend the meeting of 1 April 2011. It does not express any agreement or disagreement with the passage set out in the preceding paragraph.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES\u2019 REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimant**\n-------------------\n\n439.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration the Claimant seeks the following relief:572\n\n(...) the Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to:\n\n(a) declare that the Respondent has breached Articles 4(1), 3(1) and 3(2) of the BIT;\n\n(b) order the Respondent to pay damages for the material loss incurred in an amount to be established, but which the Claimant currently estimates will represent in excess of EUR 7 million, an amount which the Claimant reserves the right to quantify at a subsequent stage in this arbitration by expert evidence;\n\n(c) order the Respondent to pay the costs of this arbitration, including all expenses that the Claimant has incurred or shall incur herein in respect of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, legal counsel, experts and consultants, as well as its own internal costs;\n\n(d) order the Respondent to pay interest at a rate to be established on the amount of the award; and\n\n(e) order such other and further relief as the arbitrators shall deem just and proper.\n\nRfA \u00b6 169.\n\n440.\n\nIn its first Memorial the Claimant amended the relief originally sought on three points:573\n\n(i) the amount in point (b) in the preceding paragraph was increased to EUR 9,820,000; and\n\n(ii) point (d) on interest, set out in the preceding paragraph, was replaced by two paragraphs reading as follows:\n\n(d) order the Respondent to pay interest, compounded quarterly, at the rates set out in paragraph 366 above on the amount of the damages awarded from the date of expropriation until the date of the award;\n\n(e) order the Respondent to pay interest, compounded quarterly, at the rates set out in paragraph 366 above on the amount awarded from the date [of] the award until payment by the Respondent; and\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 370.\n\n441.\n\nIn its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections the Claimant requests that the Tribunal deny the Respondent\u2019s \"preliminary objections\" to jurisdiction. The Claimant decreased the amount sought on the merits to EUR 8,300,000,574 then increased such amount to EUR 8,390,000 in its Skeleton Argument.575\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6 178.\n\nCl.

Obj.

Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 4.14.\n\n475.\n\nThe Respondent objects that there is a \"reasonable doubt\" that the Claimant brought this arbitration in good faith to influence the Lithuanian authorities or show that certain legal remedies lie in case of an expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s assets in light of the fact that two municipalities in Lithuania, Prienu and Ukmerg\u00e9, terminated their cooperation with the Claimant in connection with district heating services to be provided by the Claimant relying on the Claimant\u2019s improper conduct and a \"series of events\" which took place between 2010 and 2012; reliance was placed by the Respondent on Exhibits R-11 to R-14.624\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 4.15. At the Hearing the Respondent relied on the same circumstances, not in support of an objection to jurisdiction or admissibility, but as a ground for a stay of the proceedings or the termination of the proceedings (Transcript. Day 1, 149/3-5).\n\n(B) Lack of a Dispute Concerning Investment within the Meaning of the BIT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nIn its first letter to the ICSID Secretariat dated 27 August 2012 the Respondent takes the view that the basis for the claims asserted by the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration was not the alleged breach of a bilateral investment protection treaty, but the alleged breach of a private contract.\n\n477.\n\nThis objection was elaborated upon by the Respondent in due course and the Respondent argues in particular that the Claimant \"loads the Tribunal with typical **commercial issues** that, according to the *Vivendi doctrine* (...), are essentially contractual claims outside the scope of international investment law\".625\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 2.1(4) (original emphasis).\n\n**D.

Rep. \u00b6 128.\n\n479.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent does not, in the Claimant\u2019s view, challenge \"the Tribunal\u2019s standing to consider claims brought by E energija under the terms of the BIT and the ICSID Convention\"; Latvia rather argues that the Tribunal is precluded from considering the claims which it otherwise has jurisdiction to entertain.627 The Respondent\u2019s objections go to the admissibility of such claims rather than the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.628\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6 129.\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6 130.\n\n480.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent has the burden of proving that its objections prevent the Tribunal from considering the Claimant\u2019s claims and the threshold must be a high one; for example, see the interim award in *Chevron* v. *Ecuador629,630*\n\n*Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, Interim Award, 1 December 2008 *(\"Chevron v. Ecuador\"),* CLA-44 \u00b6\u00b6 138-139; 143.\n\nCl.

Rep. \u00b6 132.\n\n482.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s argument may be summarised as follows:\n\n(i) the Request for Arbitration complies with ICSID Institution Rule 2 as it was filed with the power of attorney appointing Salans LLP and Sorainen as the counsel acting for the Claimant, signed by the Claimant\u2019s CEO Mr. Strioga,632 which meets the requirements of Institution Rules 2(1)(f) and 2(2); that was the only \"necessary internal action\" required;633\n\n(ii) moreover, Mr. Strioga subsequently confirmed in his letter dated 3 October 2012634 that \"all necessary internal actions\" had been taken \"to authorise the filing of the Request for Arbitration\", and that is in itself sufficient, since Mr. Strioga has authority to act alone on behalf of the Claimant as recorded in the Register of Legal Entities in Lithuania;635\n\n(iii) no board decision was required;636 the minutes of the Claimant\u2019s Board meeting of 1 December 2009 attached to Mr. Strioga\u2019s letter of 3 October 2012 were provided \"by way of further support\",637 but they need not be examined since they are irrelevant in order to decide whether the Claimant authorised the filing of the Request for the purposes of Institution Rules 2(1)(f)and 2(2);638\n\n(iv) in any event, the Claimant contends that the Respondent misreads the minutes of the Claimant\u2019s Board meeting of 1 December 2009 in two respects:639\n\n(1) the Respondent relies on the minutes of the Claimant\u2019s Board meeting of 1 December 2009, in particular on the sentence \"Decided: Apply to international arbitrage in case Latvian Government rejects the proposed UAB E energija scenario: SIA \u2018Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019 cash should be released from the executor\u2019s account then the case would be brought to the mediation panel\" and concludes that resort to mediation was a condition precedent to the institution of arbitration proceedings; and\n\nthe Respondent\u2019s construction of that sentence is inaccurate; that sentence indicates that the Claimant would apply to arbitration in case Latvia rejected a certain proposal made by the Claimant; such proposal contemplated a resort to mediation in case Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s funds, which had been attached, had been released;640 however, those funds were not in fact released641 and the Board\u2019s decision to commence arbitration was, and remains, valid;642 and\n\n(2) the Respondent relies on the minutes of the Claimant\u2019s Board meeting of 1 December 2009643 to object that arbitration could be commenced only with the EBRD\u2019s approval; and\n\nthe Respondent\u2019s submission is without foundation as no Board decision was required to bring this arbitration; in any event, the reference to the EBRD is not contained in the part of the minutes that sets out the decision, but in a \"commentary\";644 the EBRD was in fact approached by the Claimant \"for support in relation to an arbitration\", which it provided in the form of a letter to Latvia;645 Ms. G\u00f3ransson, the EBRD representative on the Claimant\u2019s Board, attended the Board meeting of 1 December 2009 and approved the decision.646\n\nCM.\n\nCl.

Canada* with respect to the three ingredients of estoppel;647 the Claimant replies *(i)* that the Respondent has failed to show that the Claimant ever made any statement that it would not pursue the claims set out in the Notice of Dispute,648 and *(ii)* that the Respondent failed to show any reliance on its part on such alleged statement, and any detriment suffered as a consequence of such alleged reliance; no issue of estoppel can therefore arise;649\n\n(ii) *on acquiescence:* the Claimant submits that the doctrine of acquiescence has two constituent elements, namely *(i)* inaction on behalf of a State or a failure to assert a claim, *(ii)* such failure must have extended over a certain period of time, and *(iii)* there must have been circumstances that would have required action (reliance was placed by the Claimant on the commentary on *The Law of International Responsibility650)',* the Claimant submits that cogent evidence of a tacit intention to withdraw a claim must be required in a case, such as the present case, in which the investor has submitted a Notice of Dispute;651\n\nin the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent has provided no evidence that the circumstances required action on the part of the Claimant in the present case; the BIT contains no time limits in order for claims to be brought and the Claimant submitted a detailed Notice of Dispute652;653 and\n\nin particular, the Claimant argues that Latvia\u2019s letter of 12 July 2010654 answered the Claimant\u2019s letter of 15 June 2010;655 in its 15 June 2010 letter the Claimant had informed the Respondent that it contemplated arbitration proceedings since amicable negotiations had failed; the Respondent answered proposing a meeting or a telephone conference; admittedly, the Respondent\u2019s letter was followed by a few months in which the negotiations between the Parties halted; however, the circumstances at the time did not require action by the Claimant and the Claimant was under no obligation to bring an arbitration immediately, and the Respondent has failed to show that the duration of the silence on the part of the Claimant was sufficient to amount to an abandonment of the claims set out in the Notice of Dispute and that the circumstances required action on the part of the Claimant;656\n\n(iii) *on extinctive prescription:* the Claimant acknowledges that prescriptive extinction may apply even if a State has not acquiesced in the extinction of a claim, but replies *(i)* that the BIT does not contain any time limits within which a claim is to be brought, *(ii)* that there is no general agreement as to any actual time limits in international law and *(iii)* that the mere lapse of time is not sufficient to extinguish a claim; extinctive prescription has been applied only where the lapse of time has put the respondent at a disadvantage (reliance was placed by the Claimant on the commentary on *The Law of International Responsibility657),658* the overall delay of less than 4 years between the Notice of Dispute and the Request for Arbitration is not an unreasonable period such as to bar a claim and the Respondent has suffered no prejudice;659 and\n\n(iv) *on bad faith:* the Claimant denies that it brought the present arbitration against Latvia in bad faith to in order to influence the Lithuanian authorities in relation to the termination of district heating concessions in two Lithuanian municipalities and wonders how proceedings brought against one State could possibly influence the authorities of another State.660 The Claimant further points out that, on the one hand, the concession in Prienu had not been terminated, and, on the other, the Ukmerg\u00e9 concession was terminated after the local authorities attempted to negotiate an agreed termination with the Claimant; those facts therefore bore no relation to the present dispute.661\n\n*Pope & Talbot v.

The Reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, whereas the Respondent raised the following \"preliminary objections\" to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, which the Tribunal joined to the merits in Procedural Order No. *3bis:*\n\n(i) lack of the Claimant\u2019s internal authorisation for instituting these proceedings (\"First Objection\"); and\n\n(ii) lack of \"dispute\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention (\"Second Objection\").662\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 4.1 ff.; Procedural Order No. *Ibis.*\n\n485.\n\nIn this section of the present Award the Tribunal will examine (1) its jurisdiction *ratione personae,* (2) the Parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration (including the Respondent\u2019s First Objection) and (3) its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* (including the Respondent\u2019s Second Objection).\n\n**(1) Jurisdiction** *Ratione Personae*\n---------------------------------------\n\n486.\n\nThe Republic of Lithuania signed and ratified the ICSID Convention on 6 July 1992 which entered into force in the Republic of Lithuania on 5 August 1992.663\n\nCLA-5.\n\n487.\n\nThe Republic of Latvia signed and ratified the ICSID Convention on 8 August 1997 which entered into force in the Republic of Latvia on 7 September 1997.664\n\nCLA-5.\n\n488.\n\nThe BIT665 was ratified by the Republic of Lithuania on 19 July 1996666 and by the Republic of Latvia pursuant to an Act of the Latvian Parliament dated 2 May 1996.667\n\nBIT, CLA-1.\n\nCLA-2.\n\nCLA-3.\n\n489.\n\nThe BIT entered into force on 23 July 1996.668\n\nBIT, CLA-1.\n\n490.\n\nArticle 1(2) of the BIT reads as follows:\n\nArticle 1 Definitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n1. (omitted)\n\n2. The term \"investor\" means:\n\na) in respect of the Republic of Lithuania:\n\n(i) natural persons who are nationals of the Republic of Lithuania according to the laws of the Republic of Lithuania;\n\n(ii) any entity constituted under the laws of the Republic of Lithuania and registered in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania in conformity with its laws and regulations;\n\n(...) (omitted)\n\n491.\n\nThe Claimant is a limited liability company incorporated in Lithuania and having its registered office in Vilnius, Lithuania.669 The Claimant is therefore an \"investor\" of Lithuania within the meaning of Article 1 (2)(ii) of the BIT.\n\nC-l.\n\n492.\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration....\n\n493.\n\nAs a limited liability company incorporated in Lithuania and having its registered office in Lithuania on the date the Request was submitted to ICSID, the Claimant is also a \"juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration\" within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n494.\n\nThe Respondent has not challenged these points.\n\n495.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that there is no lack of jurisdiction *ratione personae* under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(2) The Parties\u2019 Consent to ICSID Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nThe Tribunal will determine whether *(i)* the Parties consented to ICSID jurisdiction under Article 7 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and *(ii)* whether the alleged lack of compliance by the Claimant with its internal requirements to initiate these proceedings has any effects on the Claimant\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n497.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\nChapter II\n\nJurisdiction of the Centre\n\nArticle 25\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n498.\n\nArticle 7 of the BIT reads as follows:\n\nArticle 7\n\nDisputes between One Contracting Party and an Investor of the Other Contracting Party\n\n1. Notice of a dispute concerning investment between one of the Parties and an investor of the other Party shall be given in writing. This shall include a detailed statement by the investor to the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made. The Parties shall, if possible, endeavour to settle their differences by means of a friendly agreement.\n\n2. If such dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months from the date of the written notification provided in paragraph 1, the dispute, at the request of either party and at the choice of the investor, shall be submitted to:\n\n- an ad hoc court of arbitration, for arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules issued in 1976 by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or to\n\n- the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Dispute (ICSID) established under the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, for arbitration under ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings if both of the Contracting Parties have acceded to the Convention.\n\n3. The arbitral decisions shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party shall execute them in accordance with its laws and in accordance with the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention), if the Contracting Parties are members of that Convention. The arbitration shall take place in a State that is a party to the New York Convention.\n\n(footnotes omitted)\n\n(A) The Parties\u2019 Consent to ICSID Jurisdiction\n----------------------------------------------\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Respondent offered to submit certain disputes to ICSID arbitration under Article 7 of the BIT provided *(i)* that the investor gave the host State a notice of dispute in writing including a detailed statement (Article 7(1) of the BIT), and *(ii)* that the Parties endeavoured to settle their dispute amicably in the six months following the notification of the notice of dispute (Article 7(2) of the BIT).\n\n500.\n\nThe Respondent did not dispute that these requirements were met.\n\n501.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the two requirements in Article 7(1) and 7(2) of the BIT were met in the present case. First, the Claimant delivered its Notice of Dispute on 2 September 2008 to the Respondent, thereby complying with Article 7(1) of the BIT. Secondly, the Respondent accepts that negotiations with the Claimant started on 1 September 2008670 and continued until 14 July 2010 with a final meeting on 1 April 2011 without any settlement being reached.671 The Parties therefore tried to settle their dispute amicably for more than six months before the Claimant submitted the dispute to ICSID, as required by Article 7(2) of the BIT.\n\nSee the letter by the Slate Chancellery to the ICSID Secretary-General dated 6 September 2012.\n\nRfA \u00b6 11; Cl. Rep. \u00b6 153; Resp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 4.13(2); 4.13(3); see also the letter by the State Chancellery to the ICSID Secretary-General dated 6 September 2012.\n\n502.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that the Claimant accepted the Respondent\u2019s offer contained in the BIT to settle the dispute by ICSID arbitration by filing its Request for Arbitration on 15 August 2012. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the requirement of consent under Article 7(2) of the BIT was met, as was the requirement of \"consent in writing\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nThis conclusion, however, is subject to the determination by the Tribunal of the Respondent\u2019s First Objection that the Claimant\u2019s internal documents authorising the request show an alleged lack of compliance with a condition precedent *(i.e.* mediation) and a failure to obtain the required EBRD approval before instituting these proceedings.\n\n(B) The Respondent\u2019s First Objection - Lack of Internal Authorisation to Initiate these Proceedings\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nAs part of the Secretary-General\u2019s screening process, the ICSID Secretariat requested the Claimant\u2019s confirmation that it had \"taken all necessary internal actions to authorise the request\" pursuant to ICSID Institution Rule 2(1)(f). In a letter dated 3 October 2012 the Claimant confirmed that \"UAB \u2018E energija\u2019 has taken all necessary internal actions to authorise the filing of the Request\" and attached UAB\u2019s Board Meeting Minutes dated 1 December 2009.672\n\nC-247.\n\n504.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s First Objection is based on these Board Minutes. According to the Respondent, such Minutes demonstrate a \"[l]ack of compliance with Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention [and] ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, Rule 2(1)(f) and Rule 2(2)\".673 No other authorities aside from these provisions are relied upon by the Respondent in support of this preliminary objection.\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 4.4; 4.8.\n\n505.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, whether the authorising documents provided by the Claimant in the present case were such as to warrant the registration of the request is a matter for the ICSID Secretary-General.\n\n506.\n\nArticle 36(2) of the ICSID Convention (and Institution Rule 2) deal with the registration procedure, not with the jurisdiction of a tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention. Jurisdiction is dealt with in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Insofar as the Respondent\u2019s \"preliminary objection\" is based on Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention and Institution Rule 2, such objection must therefore fail.\n\n507.\n\nAs the Claimant argues that it consented to ICSID arbitration by filing the Request, a lack of authorisation to file the Request, if established, could operate so as to taint the Claimant\u2019s consent in the Tribunal\u2019s view. The Tribunal will therefore examine the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Board Minutes contain conditions precedent to the initiation of arbitration that were not met, which vitiated the Claimant\u2019s consent.\n\n508.\n\nThe passage of the Claimant\u2019s Board Minutes674 relied upon by the Respondent reads as follows:\n\n**5. Discussed. Decision to apply with SIA \"Latgales energija\" case to arbitrage.**\n\n**Decided:** Apply to international arbitrage in case Latvian Government rejects the proposed UAB E energija scenario: SIA \"Latgales energija\" cash should be released from the executor's account then the case would be brought to the mediation panel.\n\n**Commentary.** UAB E energija will issue letter to the Latvian government regarding the decision of the board. E energija will also apply to EBRD regarding approval of the decision to apply to international arbitrage.\n\nC-247, attached to the Claimant\u2019s 3 October 2012 letter to Mr. Bum (original emphasis).\n\n(i) *Board Minutes - The Reference to Mediation*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n509.\n\nBased on the wording of the Board Minutes, the Tribunal finds that this resolution by the Claimant\u2019s Board, made on 1 December 2009, is a decision to apply to international arbitration in case the Government of Latvia rejected a proposal made by the Claimant in order that the Claimant\u2019s funds be released.\n\n510.\n\nIn its submissions, the Claimant explained the meaning of the sentence set out above after \"Decided\" (see paragraph 482 above), and the Respondent did not specifically challenge that explanation.675\n\nThe Respondent accepts that it was the Party that proposed mediation (Transcript, Day 1, 147/15-16). The Respondent offered mediation on 27 October 2009 (see paragraph 425 above) after the Claimant had indicated on 23 September 2009 that it would \"move the dispute to international arbitration'' (see paragraph 423 above). The Claimant rejected the Respondent\u2019s mediation proposal on 6 November 2009 (see paragraph 426 above), whereupon the Respondent made a further attempt at proposing mediation on 25 November 2009 (see paragraph 426 above). When the Claimant\u2019s Board made its resolution on 1 December 2009, the Respondent\u2019s mediation proposal dated 25 November 2009 (C-236) had been neither accepted nor rejected by the Claimant. The Respondent's mediation proposal was rejected by the Claimant on 8 February 2010.\n\n511.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 position in this respect, the Tribunal determines that in order for mediation to take place, the Government of Latvia would have had to accept the proposal made by the Claimant, on any plain reading of the resolution set out in paragraph 508 above.\n\n512.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proof with respect to the allegation that mediation was a condition precedent to arbitration.676\n\nSee *e.g.* *Chevron* v. *Ecuador,* CLA-44 \u00b6\u00b6 138-139.\n\n(ii) *Board Minutes - The Reference to EBRD Approval*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n513.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that approval by the EBRD was a condition precedent to the Claimant commencing arbitration, which the Claimant denies. The passage relied upon by the Respondent in the Claimant\u2019s Board Minutes dated 1 December 2009 is reproduced in paragraph 508 above.\n\n514.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the operative part of the Claimant\u2019s Board Minutes of 1 December 2009 is set out after the word \"Decided\". The two sentences set out after the word \"Commentary\" appear to indicate what the Board would do, the decision to go to arbitration having been adopted.\n\n515.\n\nIf approval by the EBRD had been a condition precedent to the institution of these arbitration proceedings pursuant to arrangements made by the EBRD, the reference to the EBRD would likely not have been inserted under the \"Commentary\" section.\n\n516.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the Claimant\u2019s Board Minutes of 1 December 2009 are insufficient to prove that the EBRD\u2019s approval was a condition precedent to arbitration, and the Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proof in this respect. The Respondent\u2019s \"preliminary objection\" based on the EBRD\u2019s lack of approval must therefore be dismissed.\n\n517.\n\nAs a general note, the Tribunal finds that general denials (such as that contained in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Preliminary Objections677) are insufficient and must fail.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that *(i)* the Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proof in relation to any alleged conditions to the Claimant\u2019s consent and the First Objection is therefore dismissed, and that *(ii)* the Parties consented to ICSID arbitration, the Claimant met the notice and amicable settlement requirements in Article 7 of the BIT and there was therefore valid written consent for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSuch general denial inserted at Resp. Rej. \u00b6 40 reads as follows: \"As a final general comment, if Respondent has not commented expressly on a certain Claimant\u2019s position in any of previous Claimant\u2019s pleadings, it does not mean that Respondent agrees with such statements or allegations of fact or law. Respondent has attempted to position its viewpoint clearly without duplicate or tedious reiterations or denials. Respondent reserves its right to supplement its position in due time (including, invoking additional evidence or witnesses)\".\n\n**(3) Jurisdiction** *Ratione Materiae*\n---------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nIn this section the Tribunal will deal with the Respondent\u2019s Second Objection and determine whether it has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Specifically, the Tribunal will decide *(i)* whether there is a \"dispute concerning an investment\" under Articles 1(1) and 7(1) of the BIT; *(ii)* whether there is a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" according to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention or *(iii)* whether there is no \"dispute\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention having regard to the principles of estoppel, acquiescence, extinctive prescription and good faith (Second Objection).\n\n(A) Articles 1(1) and 7(1) of the BIT - A \"Dispute Concerning Investment\"\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n519.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT reads as follows:\n\nArticle 1\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n1. The term \"investment\" shall mean every kind of asset, invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party, and shall include in particular, though not exclusively:\n\na) movable and immovable property as well as any other property rights, such as mortgages, hens and pledges, and similar rights;\n\nb) shares, bonds and other kinds of interest in companies;\n\nc) claims to money which has been used to create an economic value or claims to any performance having an economic value;\n\nd) copyrights, industrial property rights (such as patents, trade marks, industrial designs and models, trade names), knowhow and good-will;\n\ne) any right to conduct economic activities conferred by state authorities, including concessions to search for, extract and exploit natural resources.\n\n(...)\n\n520.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Claimant made an investment in the territory of Latvia in accordance with the local laws and regulations. The Respondent called no fact witnesses to challenge Mr. Jautakis\u2019 first Witness Statement, which contains detailed explanation as to the various transactions forming part of the Claimant\u2019s investment, and Mr. Jautakis was not cross-examined at the Hearing.678 The Respondent also expressly acknowledged the existence of an investor and an investment as part of its argument advanced that the Energy Charter Treaty should apply.679\n\nTranscript. Day 2, 82/14.\n\nSee Resp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.29.\n\n521.\n\nSpecifically, after reviewing the documentary evidence, the Tribunal concludes as follows:\n\n(i) the shares and statutory capital in Latgales Ener\u0123ija constitute an investment under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT;\n\n(ii) the loans provided by the Claimant to Latgales Ener\u0123ija to fund Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s operations in R\u0113zekne; the guarantee provided in relation to the loans granted by Latvijas Unibanka to the R\u0113zekne Municipality and the guarantee provided in relation to a loan granted by Sampo Banka to Latgales Ener\u0123ija constitute an investment under Article 1 (1)(c) of the BIT;680 and\n\n(iii) the know-how and expertise in heating services681 as well as the operational management expertise682 provided by the Claimant constitute an investment under Article 1 (1)(d) of the BIT.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija is not an investor for the purposes of Article 1(1) and 1(2) of the BIT and is also not a \"national of another Contracting State\" within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention as there is no agreement between the Parties that it should be treated as the investor. As such, Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s assets are not, therefore, \"the investment\"; it does not follow, however, that they are irrelevant, since for example the value of the shares in Latgales Ener\u0123ija depends on the value of such assets that include *inter alia* the right to operate the heating system in the city of R\u0113zekne under the Long-Term Agreement and the three licences.\n\nSee *e.g.*C-43; C-102.\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6 40 (citing technical solutions found to enable the old boilers to run on natural gas).\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6 42 (discussing Mr. Strioga\u2019s operational expertise).\n\n522.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s invocation of various BIT breaches meets the condition of a \"dispute concerning investment\" under Article 7(1) of the BIT.\n\n523.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes again that general denials, such as those contained in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Preliminary Objections, are insufficient in the Tribunal\u2019s view.683\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 40, reproduced in footnote 677 above.\n\n524.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the BIT.\n\n(B) Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention - \"a Legal Dispute Arising Directly out of an Investment\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not challenged the Claimant\u2019s submission that its investment qualifies as an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention (quoted in paragraph 497 above) as understood by analysing the features discussed in Prof. Schreuer\u2019s commentary.684 Nor has the Respondent denied the relevance of those features. Moreover, the Respondent has itself contended that there is an investment in the present case, albeit with reference to the Energy Charter Treaty as the Tribunal has just recalled in paragraph 520 above.\n\nC. Schreuer, L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair, *The ICSID Convention. A Commentary,* 2nd ed., Cambridge 2009, CLA-6 pp. 128-129.\n\n526.\n\nAfter examining the features of an investment discussed in Prof. Schreuer\u2019s commentary, with the understanding that they are not meant to be taken as a list of jurisdictional requirements, the Tribunal concludes that they are met in this case.\n\n527.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal finds there was a long-term investment as, among other factors, the Long-Term Agreement was entered into for a period of thirty years,685 and the February 2005 Agreement was entered into for the same period as the Long-Term Agreement.686 Moreover, the Claimant alleges to have made a significant monetary investment that includes LVL 3.4 million and EUR 2,821 million investments in 2005 and 2006,687 which the Tribunal deems to be a substantial monetary commitment. The Tribunal further finds that the investment was not devoid of risk, a circumstance on which the Respondent has expressly relied by contending that the Claimant failed to conduct a proper risk assessment prior to its decision to invest.688 Finally, the Tribunal concludes that the project was significant for the development of the Republic of Latvia due to the importance of district heating and the supply of hot water as a critical public service, and to the need to switch from expensive and polluting fuels to natural gas, as acknowledged by the Respondent.\n\nC-4, Clause 4.2.1.\n\nC-8. Clause 11.\n\nRfA \u00b6 49(2).\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 1.1.\n\n528.\n\nIt is plain from all the above that the Claimant made an investment in Latvia for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n529.\n\nAs the Claimant has alleged various breaches of the BIT in relation to Latvia\u2019s treatment of its investment, the Tribunal finds that there is a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, subject to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Respondent\u2019s Second Objection.\n\n(C) The Respondent\u2019s Second Objection - Lack of a \"dispute\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider the Respondent\u2019s challenge that there is no dispute under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention due to estoppel, acquiescence, prescriptive extinction and due to the Claimant\u2019s alleged bad faith.\n\n(i) *Estoppel*\n--------------\n\n531.\n\nBoth Parties have relied on the *Pope & Talbot* interim award.689 According to this decision, estoppel requires three elements: *(i)* \"a statement of fact which is clear and unambiguous\"; *(ii)* a statement that \"must be voluntary, unconditional and authorised\"; and *(iii)* that \"there must be reliance in good faith upon the statement either to the detriment of the party so relying on the statement or to the advantage of the party making the statement\".690\n\n*Pope & Talbot* v. *Canada,* RLA-13/CLA-43. The Respondent specifically relied on \u00b6 11 of this interim award.\n\n*Pope* A *Talbot* v. *Canada,* RLA-13/CLA-43 \u00b6 111.\n\n532.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the Parties\u2019 correspondence relating to their negotiations subsequent to the Notice of Dispute.691 The Respondent relies on the Claimant\u2019s alleged \"voluntary and unconditional conduct\" which is said to be \"of such a nature as to cause a reasonable reliance in Latvia that the investment claims, as outlined in the Request, will not be pursued beyond negotiations (...)\".692 However, no relevant conduct or statement by the Claimant has been shown to exist. To the contrary, the communication sent by the Claimant to the Respondent immediately prior to the Parties\u2019 last meeting to discuss settlement opportunities expressly mentioned the \"potential international arbitration\".693 Reliance on a mere lapse of time is insufficient to give rise to a preclusion based on estoppel.\n\nSee paragraphs 418 ff. and 501 above.\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 4.13.\n\nSee paragraph 436 above.\n\n533.\n\nThe Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proof with respect to the first factual requirement of an estoppel defence. The Respondent has also failed to show its reliance on the Claimant\u2019s alleged conduct or statement that the investment claims would not be pursued beyond negotiations. The Tribunal therefore finds that no issue of estoppel arises on the facts of this case.\n\n(ii) *Acquiescence*\n-------------------\n\n534.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not shown that the time which lapsed after the Claimant sent the Respondent its Notice of Dispute is such that the Claimant must be deemed to have accepted by conduct that its claims were extinguished.\n\n535.\n\nNeither Article 7 nor any other provisions of the BIT contains a time limit by which a claimant must bring arbitration proceedings. It was therefore entirely a matter for the Claimant to decide when to bring arbitration proceedings.\n\n536.\n\nThe fact that the Claimant took part in the 1 April 2011 meeting after receipt of the Respondent\u2019s email dated 24 March 2011 stating that the meeting would not be held \"under the auspices of the Latvian-Lithuanian investment protection treaty\" on the basis that the Government of Latvia regarded \"the investment dispute as closed\" does not give rise to acquiescence, not least since such communication was preceded by a communication by the Claimant indicating that the objective of the meeting would be \"to further discuss the R\u0113zekne case and potential international arbitration\".694 Moreover, the Claimant did not express any agreement to the proposition that the investment dispute was \"closed\". The Respondent\u2019s objection based on acquiescence must therefore be dismissed in such circumstances.\n\nSee paragraph 436 above.\n\n(iii) *Extinctive Prescription*\n-------------------------------\n\n537.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s objections based on prescriptive extinction are rested on the same bases as the Respondent\u2019s estoppel and acquiescence objections.\n\n538.\n\nThe Respondent did not rebut the Claimant\u2019s reply that the BIT contained no time limits (see paragraph 483 above). Similarly, the Respondent did not rebut the Claimant\u2019s contention that prescriptive extinction had been applied in cases in which the respondent had been put at a disadvantage by the lapse of time and that the Respondent had shown no disadvantage in the present case.\n\n539.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the absence of a time limit in the BIT is dispositive in the present case and that the lapse of less than four years from the date when the Notice of Dispute dated 1 September 2008 was sent to the Respondent to the date of the Request for Arbitration dated 15 August 2012 is insufficient to attract the application of the doctrine of prescriptive extinction.\n\n540.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s objection based on prescriptive extinction must therefore be dismissed.\n\n(iv) *Bad Faith - Reasonable Doubt as to a Lack of Good Faith*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n541.\n\nThe burden of proof in relation to allegations of bad faith on the part of the Claimant is squarely on the Respondent.695 The Tribunal takes the view that the standard of proof should be appropriately high considering, first, that as a general matter *bona fide* conduct must be presumed in principle;696 secondly, that the Respondent\u2019s allegations include matters and parties which are not before this Tribunal; and, thirdly, that such allegations are based mostly on news reports. The Respondent appears to acknowledge the difficulty in discharging its burden of proof as it stops short of making an allegation of bad faith and states that there is \"reasonable doubt\" that the Claimant acted in good faith.\n\nSee *e.g.* *Chevron* v. *Ecuador,* CLA-44 \u00b6\u00b6 137-138.\n\nSee *e.g.* *Chevron* v. *Ecuador,* CLA-44 \u00b6 143.\n\n542.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the documentary evidence relating to the events in Prienu and Ukmerg\u00e9 initially filed by the Respondent (Exhibits R-11 to R-14).\n\n543.\n\nExhibit R-11, dated 5 October 2010, is another similar printout stating that the Regulator suspended the licence of Miesto energija pending the state of emergency and that the contract with Miesto energija was terminated by the Municipality due to high prices.\n\n544.\n\nExhibit R-12, dated 4 November 2010, is the printout from a news portal quoting another news service, *Lietuvos rytas.* As a consequence of the Claimant\u2019s decision to raise heating prices again, the Prienu authorities reportedly decided to take over district heating, following the example of Ukmerg\u00e9. The report does not exclude a political motivation for the decision in both cities, since entrepreneurs are quoted in Exhibit R-12 as saying that \"the politicians of Ukmerg\u00e9 and Prienu are simply preparing for municipal elections\".\n\n545.\n\nExhibit R-13, dated 12 January 2012, is also a printout from a news portal quoting *Lietuvos rytas.* One concrete element in this report about Prienu relates to the negotiations that were underway between the local authorities and the operator. This exhibit also mentions the city of Ukmerg\u00e9, reportedly the only one in Lithuania to have taken over heating completely from the private operator in charge.\n\n546.\n\nExhibit R-14, dated 17 October 2012, reports that E energija will seek compensation in an amount of 15 million litas before the courts against the Ukmerg\u00e9 municipality; the present arbitration proceedings are recalled in the closing paragraph.\n\n547.\n\nThe Tribunal further considered the documentary evidence subsequently filed by the Respondent (namely Exhibit R-19) attached to its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Preliminary Objections. The Tribunal takes the view that the filing by a party of an exhibit containing one hundred odd pages attached to a submission in which the exhibit is not discussed in any detail is of very little assistance to it.\n\n548.\n\nIn fact, Exhibit R-19 is mentioned only once in the whole submission697 in support of one allegation relating to what could be briefly described as Mr. Strioga\u2019s reckless way of doing business in the eyes of the Respondent.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 33.\n\n549.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken the various press reports698 contained in Exhibit R-19 into consideration, some of which were briefly referred to by counsel for the Respondent in its opening argument.699 However, the Tribunal will not embark, unassisted by counsel on both sides, on an analysis of the Lithuanian decisions in Exhibit R-19, none of which were referred to in the pleadings.\n\nFor a list of the various Lithuanian news reports and judgments see footnote 544 above.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 149-156.\n\n550.\n\nThe Tribunal is driven to the conclusion that the Respondent has not discharged its burden of proof in relation to the allegation that the Claimant brought these arbitration proceedings to influence the authorities in Lithuania. The Respondent\u2019s objection based on the Claimant\u2019s alleged bad faith, or the reasonable doubt that the Claimant may not have acted in good faith, must therefore be dismissed.\n\n551.\n\nAs far as concerns the Respondent\u2019s allegation that it is the Claimant\u2019s and Mr. Strioga\u2019s common practice to enter into deals without defining clear rules of cooperation, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not discharged its burden of proof by filing documents relating to the Claimant\u2019s contractual arrangements with certain Lithuanian municipalities and the difficulties which arose out of such contracts. Moreover, the Claimant\u2019s alleged common practice has not been shown to be relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n552.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent\u2019s objection based on an absence of good faith must be dismissed.\n\n**F. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7 of the BIT. The Respondent\u2019s \"preliminary objections\" are dismissed.\n\n**VI. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S APPLICATION FOR TERMINATION, AND, ALTERNATIVELY, FOR A STAY OF THE PROCEEDINGS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s application to have these arbitration proceedings stayed was first filed on 18 April 2014 as part of the Memorial setting out the Respondent\u2019s objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (see paragraph 450 above).\n\n**A. The Parties\u2019 Prayers for Relief on the Stay of Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent**\n----------------------\n\n555.\n\nIn its Memorial on Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation, and Counter-Memorial on the Merits the Respondent seeks the following relief:700\n\nConsidering the above mentioned factual and legal description of the situation, the Respondent kindly requests the Tribunal to:\n\n1) (...)\n\n*or*\n\n2) declare that, in accordance with Article 41(6) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, this arbitration proceeding is to be suspended pending the final and binding adjudication in Latvian courts of the local judicial civil proceeding No. C03051107;\n\n*or*\n\n(...)\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 5.\n\n556.\n\nIn its Skeleton Argument the Respondent requests the Tribunal \"under the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary competence, to suspend or terminate the proceedings on grounds enumerated in Respondent\u2019s pleadings\".701\n\nResp. Skeleton p. 4.\n\n**(2) The Claimant**\n--------------------\n\n557.\n\nIn its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections the Claimant requests the following relief:702\n\nThe Claimant therefore respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to:\n\n(a) deny the requests for relief set out by the Respondent in section 5 of the Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Preliminary Objections on Jurisdiction;\n\n(b) (...)\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6 178.\n\n558.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections the Claimant restates substantially the same relief.703\n\nCl. Rej. J. \u00b6 13.\n\n**B. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nThe Respondent rested its original application for a stay on the 7 April 2014 judgment by the Supreme Court of Latvia, allowing Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application for review against a judgment dated 20 April 2012 and remitting the case to a new court of appeal for a fresh decision.704 The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should \"follow the Vivendi doctrine and allow adjudication of the underlying civil dispute by Latvian courts...\".705 The Respondent contends that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s conduct should be attributed to the Claimant and regarded as an acknowledgment by the Claimant of the fact that the Latvian courts were properly dealing with the matter pending these arbitration proceedings; the Claimant\u2019s attempt at forum shopping trivialized both these proceedings and the Latvian proceedings in which Latgales Ener\u0123ija had actively and selectively sought procedural remedies. The Respondent suggests that the Tribunal could only gain from allowing the Latvian courts to hear all factual and legal issues, which were numerous and technical, in relation to the termination of the Long-Term Agreement (referred to as the \"Concession Agreement\" by the Respondent); reliance is placed by the Respondent on *Impregilo* v. *Argentina706,707*\n\nR-8. see paragraphs 388 ff. above.\n\nResp.

J. & C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 4.17-4.19.\n\n560.\n\nIn its Clarificatory Statement on Bifurcation the Respondent goes a step further, arguing that the Claimant has pursued the same issues in the Latvian courts and these arbitration proceedings.708\n\nResp. Req. Bifurc. \u00b6 3(3).\n\n561.\n\nIn its Skeleton Argument the Respondent also seeks a termination of the proceedings on procedural grounds, submitting that the Tribunal had discretion to decide whether to stay the proceedings or terminate them on procedural grounds.709\n\nResp. Skeleton pp. 3-4; see also Transcript, Day 1, 149/3-9; 155/14-156/23.\n\n**C. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n562.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position may be summarised as follows:\n\n(i) the Latvian proceedings relied upon by the Respondent in support of its application for a stay of proceedings were brought by the Municipality through R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli against Latgales Ener\u0123ija in September 2007; the argument that these arbitration proceedings should be stayed pending proceedings brought by Latvia itself against the Claimant\u2019s investment in Latvia cannot be sustained and the accusation that Latgales Ener\u0123ija has in bad faith engaged in forum shopping to the detriment of the Respondent is similarly without foundation;710 the Respondent appears to suggest that Latgales Ener\u0123ija should not defend itself against Latvian proceedings lest this get in the way of the Claimant\u2019s claims under the BIT, which is a flawed argument;711 and\n\n(ii) in any event, Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s defences in the Latvian proceedings relied upon by the Respondent and the Claimant\u2019s claims in these arbitration proceedings are entirely different since the claims presently under consideration arise out of the BIT; the outcome of the Latvian proceedings is irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s mission since the value of the Claimant\u2019s investment in Latvia has already been irreparably destroyed; a Latvian decision on whether the Long-Term Agreement was properly terminated could make no difference to such value and could not determine whether Latvia is in breach of any of its obligations under the BIT, and the issues of lease payments and gas debt are not part of the Claimant\u2019s case in these arbitration proceedings;712 the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the distinction made in *Impregilo713* between legitimate expectations and contractual rights is unclear;714 the Claimant is not a party to the Latvian proceedings, it is not a party to the contracts forming the basis of those proceedings and the Claimant\u2019s claims in these arbitration proceedings are not claims for breach of contract so that there is no reason for the Tribunal to stay these proceedings as a consequence of the Latvian proceedings.715\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 165-166.\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6 167.\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 168-169.\n\n*Impregilo v. Argentina,* RLA-14 \u00b6\u00b6 292-294.\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6 172.\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 173-174.\n\n**D. The Reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Application for a Stay and Termination of the Proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n563.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s application was denied by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. *3bis* dated 21 January 2015 (see paragraph 23 above).\n\n564.\n\nThe Respondent made a fresh application to have these proceedings stayed or terminated on procedural grounds in its Skeleton Argument dated 9 February 2015 referring to the \"grounds enumerated in the Respondent\u2019s pleadings\" (see paragraph 452 above).\n\n565.\n\nThe point was then argued at the Hearing by both Parties.716\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 72-85 [Claimant]; 145-158 [Respondent],\n\n566.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view the Respondent\u2019s application for a stay is without foundation, as the Tribunal has already found in Procedural Order No. *2bis.*\n\n567.\n\nFirst, the parties to the Latvian proceedings and the parties to these arbitration proceedings are not the same. The Latvian proceedings relied upon by the Respondent in support of its application for a stay were brought by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli against Latgales Ener\u0123ija (see paragraphs 302 ff. above).\n\n568.\n\nSecondly, the issues arising in these proceedings are not the same as those arising in the Latvian proceedings. The proceedings relied upon by the Respondent in support of its application for a stay were brought under the Long-Term Agreement. They do not relate to the standards of protection under the BIT with which this Tribunal is concerned; that much has been expressly admitted by the Respondent and such admission contradicts the Respondent\u2019s contention that the issues pending before the Latvian proceedings and this Tribunal are the same.\n\n569.\n\nThirdly, the fact that there may be an overlap between contract claims and treaty claims is not sufficient *per se* to warrant a stay of proceedings.\n\n570.\n\nFourth, this Tribunal has already observed in Procedural Order No. 3 *bis* that the Respondent\u2019s complaint that the Claimant has been actively and selectively seeking procedural remedies in the Latvian courts is without foundation, since the Latvian proceedings relied upon by the Respondent were brought by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli. Other proceedings were subsequently brought by R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija against Latgales Ener\u0123ija (see paragraphs 310 ff. above), and by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli against Latgales Ener\u0123ija and the Claimant (see paragraphs 371 ff. above).\n\n571.\n\nThere are therefore in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion no sound and cogent reasons to stay these arbitration proceedings.\n\n572.\n\nAs there are no reasons to stay these proceedings pending the outcome of the Latvian proceedings, there are, *a fortiori,* no reasons to terminate these proceedings.\n\n**E. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision the Respondent\u2019s Application for Termination, and, Alternatively, a Stay of the Proceedings**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n573.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent\u2019s application for termination, and, alternatively, for a stay of proceedings must be denied.\n\n**VII. LIABILITY**\n------------------\n\n574.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will restate the Parties\u2019 prayers for relief on liability (A) before summarizing the respective cases on liability submitted by the Claimant (B) and the Respondent (C). The Tribunal will then state the reasons for its decision on liability (D) before issuing its decision (E).\n\n**A. The Parties\u2019 Prayers for Relief on Liability**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant**\n--------------------\n\n575.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant requests the following relief:717\n\nThe Claimant therefore respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to:\n\n(a) declare that the Respondent has breached Articles 4(1). 3(1) and 3(2) of the BIT.\n\n(b) (...)\n\nCl.

Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 5.\n\n578.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits does not set out a prayer for relief.\n\n**B. The Claimant\u2019s Case on Liability**\n---------------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Respondent has breached Articles 3(1), 3(2) and 4(1) of the Lithuania-Latvia BIT.\n\n580.\n\nSome of the Claimant\u2019s claims under the BIT are contingent upon certain specific issues that are in dispute between the parties.\n\n581.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarise the Claimant\u2019s arguments relating to these issues (see paragraphs 582 ff. below) and will then summarise the Claimant\u2019s position regarding Latvia\u2019s liability under the Treaty in the following order:\n\n(i) attribution *(i.e.* whether the conduct of the Municipality, the Regulator, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija can be attributed to the Respondent as a matter of international law, see paragraphs 621 ff. below);\n\n(ii) expropriation *(i.e.* whether the Respondent is liable for unlawfully expropriating the Claimant\u2019s investment without compensation, see paragraphs 648 ff. below);\n\n(iii) fair and equitable treatment *(i.e.* whether the Respondent breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment, see paragraphs 663 ff. below);\n\n(iv) full protection and security *(i.e.* whether the Respondent breached the standard of full protection and security, see paragraphs 691 ff. below);\n\n(v) arbitrary or discriminatory measures *(i.e.* whether the Respondent took arbitrary and discriminatory measures against the Claimant, see paragraphs 694 ff. below); and\n\n(vi) breaches of the most favoured nation clause *(i.e.* whether the Respondent breached an obligation on which the Claimant is entitled to rely by virtue of the most favoured nation clause, see paragraphs 706 ff. below).\n\n**(1) Specific Issues**\n-----------------------\n\n582.\n\nThe Tribunal will in turn summarise the Claimant\u2019s position relating to the following issues:\n\n(i) the application of the Principles of European Contract Law, UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts and TransLex Principles advocated by the Respondent (see paragraphs 583 ff. below);\n\n(ii) the functional and legal independence between the different parts of the \"concession arrangement\" (see paragraphs 585 ff. below);\n\n(iii) the duty to pay for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas G\u0101ze (see paragraphs 586 ff. below);\n\n(iv) the outstanding lease payments (see paragraphs 590 ff. below);\n\n(v) the risk allegedly assumed by the Claimant (see paragraph 593 below);\n\n(vi) the influence allegedly brought to bear by the Municipality on the Regulator (see paragraphs 594 ff. below);\n\n(vii) the review of the tariffs by the Regulator (see paragraphs 599 ff. below);\n\n(viii) the development plan (see paragraphs 607 ff. below);\n\n(ix) the revocation of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences to produce, transmit and sell thermal energy (see paragraphs 617 ff. below).\n\n(A) The Application of Principles of European Contract Law, Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts and TransLex Principles\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n583.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Principles of European Contract Law (\"PECL\") prayed in aid by the Respondent are inapplicable to the present dispute as such Principles do not constitute general principles of law recognized by civilized nations within the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.719 The Claimant submits that, in any event, such Principles could not excuse the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT.720 Moreover, the Long-Term Agreement is expressly stated to be governed by Latvian law in its Clause 11 of the Long-Term Agreement, which operates so as to exclude the application of the PECL to that agreement.721\n\nCl.

Tribunal \u00b6 42.\n\n588.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant submits that the Long-Term Agreement did not constitute a transfer of an undertaking *(\"Betriebs\u00fcbergang\")* as a matter of Latvian law, but rather constituted a lease of certain assets which the Long-Term Agreement clearly identified;734 similarly, the Long-Term Agreement identified those debts of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli which Latgales Ener\u0123ija agreed to assume; all of which would not have been necessary, by definition, if the Long-Term Agreement had been a transfer of an undertaking.735 Only R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s employees were taken over by Latgales Ener\u0123ija under the terms of the Long-Term Agreement; that amounted to a transfer of an undertaking under the Labour Code *(not in evidence)* and not under the Commercial Code.736 Finally, the Claimant submits that the concept of *Betriebs\u00fcbergang* is not applicable in Latvia or to the transfer of contractual obligations other than employment rights.737\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 155; 160-161; Cl. Rep. \u00b6 56.\n\n591.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, in monetary terms, the most significant part of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s claim was based on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s alleged obligation to make monthly payments for the depreciation of the leased assets under Clause 4.4.2 of the Long-Term Agreement.740 However, the depreciation was to be paid by investing in the heating infrastructure \"so that by the end of the lease term the book value of the assets handed back was no less than the book value of the assets handed over at the start, plus 5%\"741 The Latvian courts eventually confirmed that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s position in this respect was correct as a matter of Latvian law.742\n\nCl.

Tribunal \u00b6 6.\n\n592.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s claim is significant because of its timing, as it was brought at a time when the gas supply had been suspended by Latvijas G\u0101ze one day before the Municipality approved the heat supply development plan.743\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 160; Cl. Rep. \u00b6 56, see paragraph 254 above.  \n The Tribunal notes the Claimant\u2019s distinction between the \"city plan\", the \"heat supply development plan\" and the \"operator\u2019s plan\". The Tribunal\u2019s use of these terms in the summary of the Claimant\u2019s position is without prejudice to the Tribunal's finding regarding the existence of different plans and the respective duties attached thereto.\n\n(E) The Risks Allegedly Assumed by the Claimant\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n593.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s contention that it assumed certain risks and it contends that it could not have anticipated the \"change in approach\" on the part of the Municipality and the Regulator.744 Specifically, the Claimant submits that it did not assume:\n\n(i) the risk that the Municipality would fail to devise and approve a heat supply development plan;\n\n(ii) the risk that the Municipality would fail to comply with its own contractual duties to Latvijas G\u0101ze, thereby causing the suspension of the natural gas supply;\n\n(iii) the risk that the Municipality would actively seek to replace Latgales Ener\u0123ija as the heat supply operator well before Latvijas G\u0101ze suspended the supply of natural gas;\n\n(iv) the risk that the Municipality would declare an energy crisis relying on a situation it had itself brought about;\n\n(v) the risk that the Municipality would prevent Latgales Ener\u0123ija from obtaining increased tariffs despite the increase in the price of natural gas;\n\n(vi) the risk that the Municipality would misrepresent the content of confidential letters to the Regulator, that would in turn base its own allegations concerning Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s breaches of the licence requirements on such misrepresentations;\n\n(vii) the risk that the Municipality would seek to persuade consumers not to pay Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s invoices;\n\n(viii) the risk that the Municipality (acting through R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija) would seek to obtain an attachment of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank accounts;\n\n(ix) the risk that the Regulator would change its practice, whereby it had granted tariff increases despite the absence of a heat supply development plan; or\n\n(x) the risk that the Regulator would revoke Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences based on a situation that was not only caused by the Municipality and the Regulator, but that had been addressed and explained by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in its letters to the Regulator.745\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6 96.\n\n600.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, Latgales Ener\u0123ija was therefore entitled to obtain new tariffs in light of the applicable Methodology *(i)* after the Public Utilities Commission decided on 22 March 2006 to increase the price of natural gas by 36 % from 1 May 2006 onwards and the price of electricity had increased by about 17 % (see paragraph 181 above), and *(ii)* after the Public Utilities Commission decided on 28 March 2007 further to increase the price of natural gas from 1 May 2007 (see paragraph 231 above).765 However, the Regulator refused to grant new tariffs in both instances.\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6 238.\n\n(ii) *The Principles Applied*\n-----------------------------\n\n631.\n\nFirst, the Claimant contends, relying on Article 8 of the ILC Articles, that the Respondent is responsible for the actions of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija since the Municipality was the sole shareholder in such companies and, in this capacity, the Municipality instructed, directed and controlled all of the operations of such companies at all relevant times.842 R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija were therefore no more than an extension of the Municipality.843\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 234; Cl. Rep. P-H \u00b6 14.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 234.\n\n632.\n\nConsequently, the Claimant submits that the conduct of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija is attributable to the Respondent based on nine factual circumstances.844\n\nThe circumstances relied upon by the Claimant are as follows:  \n (i) the members of the boards of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija were appointed by the chairperson of the Municipality in accordance with Latvian law (Cl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 9);  \n (ii) while R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli owned and operated the district heating system, the tender for a private operator could be called only by the Municipality and the Long-Term Agreement could be signed only with the permission of the Municipality (Cl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 12; Transcript, Day L 38/12-17; Transcript, Day 4, 32/15; 19-21; 55/10-20);  \n (iii) the Municipality remained under the obligation to pay for natural gas deliveries even though the gas was received by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli (Cl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 12; Transcript, Day 4, 32/24-25; 33/1-3: 37/13-25; 38/1-3);  \n (iv) the Municipality proposed to pay the debt owed to Latvijas G\u0101ze by increasing the share capital of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli, instead of paying Latvijas G\u0101ze directly or letting R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli decide how' to pay its debt (Cl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 12; Transcript, Day 4, 33/4-7);  \n (v) the Municipality (and not R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli) called a tender and eventually chose a company capable of meeting its requirements (Cl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 12);  \n (vi) the Municipality (and not R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli) proposed to terminate the Long-Term Agreement through an agreement of the Council deputies (Cl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 12);  \n (vii) the Municipality (and neither R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli nor R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija) suggested solutions to solve the heat supply crisis in October 2007 involving the use of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija to operate the heating system (Cl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 12);  \n (viii) the decision by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli to commence litigation in September 2007 was taken under the direction or control of the Municipality with the sole purpose to put pressure on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s business and to obtain a transfer of heating operations to R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija (Cl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 12); and  \n (ix) the Municipality signed the October 2007 Agreement \"despite it not containing any express terms relating to the Municipality\" (Transcript, Day 4, 32/21-23).\n\n633.\n\nThe Municipality authorised all of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s actions and assumed the responsibility therefor.845 To the Claimant, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli was interchangeable with and controlled by the Municipality \"such that the Municipality must have assumed responsibility for it\".846 By controlling the provision of district heating services R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli exercised a public function and the control over R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli was used by the Municipality to achieve a particular result.847\n\nCl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 9.\n\nCl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 11.\n\nCl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 11.\n\n634.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Municipality did not play a role in the execution of the Long-Term Agreement, the Claimant states that the Municipality exercised control over R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija at least starting from the change in political leadership in R\u0113zekne onwards (see paragraphs 128 and 139-140 above) and used such companies to achieve its goal to regain control over the heating system.848 Furthermore, the Claimant argues that the February 2005 Agreement is irrelevant to the question whether R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s conduct is to be attributed to the Respondent under international law.849\n\nCl. Rep. P-H \u00b6 15.\n\nCl. Rep. P-H \u00b6 16.\n\n635.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant contends, relying on Article 5 of the ILC Articles, that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija have been exercising delegated governmental authority to run the district heating system and their actions are therefore attributable to the Respondent since the supply of district heating services is \"a public power\" and the responsibility of the local municipality and thus a \"governmental action\" or \"public function\"; reliance is placed on Section 15(1) of the Municipalities Act.850\n\nCl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 13; Cl. Rep. P-H \u00b6 10; Transcript. Day 4, 33/8-16.\n\n636.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the Municipality\u2019s creation of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and the delegation of the supply of district heating services to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli were based on the Municipalities Act; reliance is placed on Section 14(1) and Section 15(3) of the Municipalities Act and Section 40 of the Public Administration Act in force between 2003 and 2009.851\n\nCl. Rep. P-H \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n\n637.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent misconstrues Section 15 of the Municipalities Act.852 The Claimant agrees that Section 15 of the Municipalities Act does not specify the means for supplying district heating services.853 However, the Claimant contends that Section 15 of the Municipalities Act does provide for the Municipality\u2019s obligation to organise district heating services.854\n\nCl.

P-H \u00b6 7.\n\n638.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent has admitted that the Municipality delegated such public power to Latgales Ener\u0123ija by wrongly arguing that R\u0113zekne Siltumt\u012bkli had delegated to Latgales Ener\u0123ija the duty to devise the heat supply development plan through the Long-Term Agreement; the Claimant contends that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli delegated the day-to-day operation of the heat supply system to Latgales Ener\u0123ija under the terms of the Long-Term Agreement and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli was in a position to delegate such public power since the Municipality had delegated such power to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli in the first place.855\n\nCl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 13; Cl. Rep. P-H \u00b6 7.\n\n639.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s opinion, the Municipality could have passed on the Regulator\u2019s query regarding the status of the heat supply development plan to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli856 only provided that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had the authority to deal with such issue on behalf of the Municipality.857\n\nRegulator\u2019s letter to the Municipality of 12 October 2005, C-69, see paragraph 150 above.\n\nCl. Rep. P-H \u00b6 8.\n\n640.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s contention that no governmental power had been delegated regarding the contractual obligations towards the Claimant and Latgales Ener\u0123ija, the Claimant states that the claims under the BIT relate to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s conduct in its exercise of governmental authority more broadly and not only to the performance of the Long-Term Agreement.858\n\nCl. Rep. P-H \u00b6 9.\n\n641.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant argues that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s decision to commence litigation against Latgales Ener\u0123ija in September 2007 was based on considerations regarding the overall control of the supply of district heating rather than commercial considerations; the Claimant refers in particular to the context of the energy crisis during September and October 2007 and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s delegated power to organise the heating system.859 The Claimant submits that other actions were also taken in the context of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s delegated governmental authority such as the interference with the decisions of the Regulator.860\n\nCl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 15.\n\nCl. Rep.

Mem. \u00b6 239.\n\n645.\n\nThe Claimant refers to its argument based Articles 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles summarised in footnote 844 above to argue that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija were exercising administrative or governmental authority in the field of heat supply delegated to them by the Municipality.866 Furthermore, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija were involved in approving commercial transactions and the imposition of fees, quotas or charges through \"their involvement in and the signing of the October 2007 Agreement which contained an agreement as to tariffs\".867\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6 243.\n\n652.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, unlawful expropriation in the present case is not limited to the expropriation of tangible assets, but extends to the taking or destruction of all kinds of investments by the Respondent.883\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 251-252.\n\n(i) *\"Outright, Indirect and Unlawful Expropriation\"*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n653.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the forcible taking of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s business on 16 September 2008 amounts to an \"outright indirect unlawful expropriation\" of its investment by the Respondent.884 On that day the Municipality\u2019s executive decisions were enforced by armed local and state police and personnel forcibly entering the premises of Latgales Ener\u0123ija, having expelled Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s employees and appropriated all of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s assets used to operate the heating system.885\n\nCl.

Day 1. 40/6-13.\n\n659.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s specific complaints are as follows:\n\n(i) the Municipality did not prepare and approve the heat supply development plan as required by Latvian Law and Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement until after it had decided to take back the heating system;893\n\n(ii) on 22 March 2006 and 28 March 2007 the Public Utilities Commission of Latvia adopted decisions increasing the price that Latvijas G\u0101ze was entitled to charge for the supply of natural gas which in turn resulted in price increases for Latgales Ener\u0123ija of 36 % as from May 2006 and 22 % as from May 2007 respectively;894\n\n(iii) on 13 October 2006 and 11 June 2007 the Regulator rejected Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application for a revision of its tariffs to account for the increase in the wholesale price of natural gas, having reversed its prior practice;895\n\n(iv) the Municipality failed to pay Latvijas G\u0101ze for the deliveries of natural gas, in breach of the February 2005 Agreement and the Gas Supply Agreement;896 as a result, Latvijas G\u0101ze stopped supplying gas to Latgales Ener\u0123ija and Latgales Ener\u0123ija was forced to switch back to black fuel in September 2007, which caused a short interruption of heat supply at the start of the heating season 2007-2008;897\n\n(v) the Municipality\u2019s wholly-owned companies brought unjustified claims against Latgales Ener\u0123ija; they sought and obtained an attachment of Latgales Ener\u0123ija bank accounts; such actions and decisions were carried out with the intention to replace Latgales Ener\u0123ija with a Municipality-owned company and ultimately to re-nationalize the heating system;898\n\n(vi) the Regulator issued warnings putting Latgales Ener\u0123ija on notice that its licences were at risk of being revoked;899 according to the Claimant, the Regulator issued unwarranted warnings to Latgales Ener\u0123ija under the influence of the Municipality, which had created the crisis situation in the first place and actively sought to influence consumers to pay less than the full amount of their invoices or not to pay anything at all to Latgales Ener\u0123ija;900\n\n(vii) the Municipality declared an energy crisis, which was a crisis of its own making; then it refused to solve the crisis through the release of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank accounts in violation of its contractual obligation and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s contractual obligation to do so;901\n\n(viii) the Regulator decided to take over the zone of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences in circumstances where the crisis situation had been created by the Municipality itself;902\n\n(ix) on 12 October 2007 the Municipality adopted a decision appointing R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as \"the person in charge of providing thermal energy in R\u0113zekne\"; R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija was then a newly-incorporated limited liability company, wholly-owned by the Municipality;903\n\n(x) on 7 December 2007 the Regulator annulled its previous approval of new tariffs dated 9 November 2007 based on R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija\u2019s indications as to the volume of natural gas Latgales Ener\u0123ija would use, rather than on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s own calculations;904\n\n(xi) the Municipality attempted to persuade Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s employees to quit their jobs and join R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli;905\n\n(xii) the Regulator wrongly stated that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was in breach of the law because of an erroneous report received from R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli which misrepresented the assignment agreement between R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and Latgales Ener\u0123ija that had no bearing on the heat supply;906\n\n(xiii) on 3 June 2008 the Regulator unlawfully revoked Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences to produce, transmit and sell thermal energy relying on spurious breaches of the licence conditions, all of which had been previously \"addressed and explained\" by Latgales Ener\u0123ija and that had been caused by the actions of the Municipality and the Regulator; the Regulator thereby disregarded the required three-month waiting period in breach of Section 28(1) of the Public Utility Regulators Act and the fact that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had resumed a steady supply of thermal energy to R\u0113zekne;907 according to the Claimant, the revocation of the licences was the culmination of a series of acts that destroyed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s business;908\n\n(xiv) on 13 June 2008 the Municipality and its deputy executive director, acting as \"the person in charge of organising the provision of heating in the city of R\u0113zekne\", decided to appoint Municipality-owned companies temporarily to produce and sell thermal energy in R\u0113zekne; that decision required Latgales Ener\u0123ija to hand over the assets necessary for the provision of heating services that it had leased from R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli;909\n\n(xv) these decisions of 13 June 2008 entered into force despite the appeal filed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija;910 on 7 July 2008 R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and a bailiff went to Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s offices and requested Latgales Ener\u0123ija to hand over its assets, which it \"reasonably\" refused to do;911\n\n(xvi) on 14 July 2008, after the court declined its jurisdiction to hear Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s appeal against the decisions of 13 June 2008, the Municipality adopted a decision requiring Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide access to the assets leased under the Long-Term Agreement, including the assets Latgales Ener\u0123ija had purchased or upgraded as a result of Claimant\u2019s investment;912 Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s appeal did not suspend the effects of the decision;913\n\n(xvii) on 16 September 2008 the Municipality\u2019s decision of 14 July 2008 was enforced by armed local and state police and personnel from R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli; Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s employees were forcibly evicted from their office building; R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s personnel took over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s offices, boiler houses and other premises and appropriated all of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s assets, including assets that were leased to Latgales Ener\u0123ija for 30 years under the Long-Term Agreement and assets belonging to Latgales Ener\u0123ija;914 according to the Claimant, this effectively terminated the 30-year Long-Term Agreement;915 and\n\n(xviii) before and throughout this whole period the Municipality had refused to consent to necessary investments in the heating system, particularly in connection with the cogeneration facilities.916\n\nRfA \u00b6 131;

The Claimant submits that the tribunal concluded that there was a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard where the conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant \"involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process\".\n\n*Tecmed v. Mexico,* CLA-17 \u00b6 162. The Claimant contends that the tribunal found that Mexico had breached the fair and equitable treatment standard *inter alia* on the basis that the regulatory authority had revoked the claimant\u2019s licence to operate a landfill and had failed to notify the claimant of its intention to do so. thereby depriving the claimant of an opportunity to state its case.\n\nRfA \u00b6 140.\n\n684.\n\nFinally, the Claimant states that whereas denial of justice has been traditionally associated with the administration of justice in local courts, the tribunal in *Rumeli990* held that \"[c]ourts are not the only State organs the conduct of which can amount to a denial of justice. Administrative organs can also engage the State\u2019s international responsibility by denying justice\".991 The Claimant points out that to reach its conclusion, the tribunal in *Rumeli992* had cited the finding in *Amco II* to the effect that there was \"no provision of international law that makes impossible a denial of justice by an administrative body\".993\n\n*Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan,* CLA-34 \u00b6 623.\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6 303.\n\n697.\n\nThe Claimant states that tribunals had adopted different approaches as to the meaning and scope of the concept of an \"arbitrary measure\".1032 Some tribunals such as the UNCITRAL tribunal in *Lauder* v. *Czech Republic,1033 Occidental* v. *Ecuador1034* and *CMS v. Argentina1035* relied on the ordinary meaning of the adjective \"arbitrary\" which they defined as \"founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact\".1036 Other tribunals relied on the finding of the International Court of Justice in *ELSI (United States of America* v. *Italy)1037* that contrasted arbitrary measures with the rule of law and defined them as a \"wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety\".1038 The Claimant further relies on the findings in *National Grid* v. *Argentina1039, Saluka v.

Mem. \u00b6 312.\n\n705.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the use and enjoyment of its investment was irreparably impaired as a result of these actions and that it could no longer \"sell or maintain\" the investment.1069 The cumulative effect of these arbitrary and discriminatory measures was to destroy the value of the Claimant\u2019s investment.1070\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 321-322.\n\n(B) The Claimant\u2019s Specific Complaints\n--------------------------------------\n\n707.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Municipality failed to issue the required heat supply development plan and, consequently, the Regulator failed to authorise Latgales Ener\u0123ija to charge the revised heating tariffs even though these tariff increases were necessary in order for Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s business to continue to operate due to the consecutive increases in the price of gas charged by Latvijas G\u0101ze.1073 To the Claimant, tariff changes were an essential part of its investment as it is impossible for a heat supply operator to function without tariffs that accurately reflect the costs of the business in accordance with the provisions of the tariff methodology.1074\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 323; Transcript, Day 1, 52/2-6.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 82/11-17.\n\n708.\n\nIn addition, the Regulator unreasonably refused to maintain Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences to produce, transmit and sell thermal energy in R\u0113zekne in breach of its own regulations.1075 This impaired the management, maintenance and use of the Claimant\u2019s investment.1076\n\nCl.

On the one hand, the Respondent has advanced certain arguments which are not directly related to any specific treatment standard; on the other, the Respondent\u2019s discussion of the applicable standards has been brief on most aspects. The Respondent\u2019s position may be summarised as follows:\n\n(i) general denial and overall response to the Claimant\u2019s position (see paragraphs 711 ff. below);\n\n(ii) specific issues (see paragraphs 717 ff. below);\n\n(iii) attribution (see paragraphs 749 ff. below); and\n\n(iv) no violation of the BIT (see paragraphs 763 ff. below).\n\n**(1) General Denial and Overall Response to the Claimant\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n711.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, the Respondent denies and objects to all allegations of any breach of the BIT made by the Claimant and all prayers for relief submitted by the Claimant including the request for payment of damages or compensation for the involvement of experts and counsel.1079\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 1.4; sec also Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7.\n\n712.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s case is based on inaccurate facts and is misleading insofar as it predicates that the Claimant suffered the loss of its business. The Claimant\u2019s case is presented in a highly selective and subjective manner in point of fact and law, rests on an oversimplification of the matter in dispute and discards important aspects; the Claimant\u2019s complaints rest on witness statements signed by persons directly interested in the outcome of this case.1080\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.33.\n\n713.\n\nFinally, the Claimant has put purely commercial issues before the Tribunal which are outside the scope of international investment law.\n\n714.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the damage allegedly suffered by the Claimant is based on inflated future dividends and losses due to the failure to obtain the repayment of loans; the Long-Term Agreement was demonstrably unsuitable to generate any cash flows, as confirmed by the Respondent\u2019s expert report submitted by KPMG Baltics SIA.1081\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 2.2.\n\n715.\n\nThe R\u0113zekne Municipality, the Respondent argues, wished to improve the quality and economic performance of its district heating system, to transpose the existing, highly subsidized and economically inefficient system into a business-orientated system \"with consideration of the social interest at large\".1082 After the initial tender yielded no suitable results, the Claimant and the Municipality reached agreement on a \"concession arrangement\" regarding the district heating assets in R\u0113zekne.1083 R\u0113zekne is a major city in Latgale, a region with \"highest social sensitivity\" due to widespread unemployment, low salaries, a negative migration rate and low economic activity; any fluctuation in the continuity, stability, service level or price of basic public utility services can cause serious social unrest and resistance.1084\n\nResp.

Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.9.\n\n**(2) Specific Issues**\n-----------------------\n\n717.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarise the Respondent\u2019s arguments relating to these specific issues as follows:\n\n(i) the application of the Principles of European Contract Law, UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts and TransLex Principles (see paragraphs 718 ff. below);\n\n(ii) the functional and legal independence between the different parts of the \"concession arrangement\" (see paragraphs 719 ff. below);\n\n(iii) the duty to pay for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas G\u0101ze (see paragraphs 726 ff. below);\n\n(iv) the outstanding lease payments (see paragraphs 733 ff. below);\n\n(v) the influence allegedly brought to bear by the Municipality on the Regulator (see paragraphs 734 ff. below);\n\n(vi) the review of the tariffs by the Regulator (see paragraphs 743 ff. below);\n\n(vii) the development plan (see paragraphs 736 ff. below); and\n\n(viii) the revocation of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences to produce, transmit and sell thermal energy (see paragraphs 743 ff. below).\n\n(A) The Application of Principles of European Contract Law, Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts and TransLex Principles\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n718.\n\nAs the \"concession arrangement\" was \"basically spelled out in commercial agreements\", the Respondent invokes the application of the Principles of European Contract Law,1086 the 2010 UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts and the Trans-Lex Principles which may be considered as general principles of law recognised by civilized nations within the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the Statute of International Court of Justice,1087 contending that the application of such principles is suitable where specific issues are to be decided and gaps are found to exist in the abstract principles set out in an investment treaty.1088\n\nR-3.\n\nRLA-3.\n\nResp.

Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.5.\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.5.\n\n721.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"concession arrangement\" consisted of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences issued by the Regulator for the production, transmission and sale of thermal energy in R\u0113zekne.1097 According to the Respondent, these licences were issued in the \"public (administrative) law sphere\".1098\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.4.\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.6.\n\n722.\n\nA further distinguishing factor between the two parts of the \"concession arrangement\" is the legal, functional and financial independence of the Regulator in line with the requirements of European law.1099\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.7, see paragraph 734 below.\n\n723.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the Claimant\u2019s argument that all the contracts concluded between Latgales Ener\u0123ija and the Municipality represent exercise of public power by the Municipality.1100 The treatment of the Long-Term Agreement and related agreements as commercial contracts is therefore in accordance with the \"sense and meaning\" of the Treaty and the applicable Latvian law.1101\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 13 ff.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 15.\n\n724.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that \"State contracts (...) of commercial (economic) nature (...) (for example, privatization agreements, joint venture agreements, concession agreements)\" are subject to international law as a general rule.1102 While such contracts may contain \"sovereign promises\", they are still treated as commercial agreements; reliance is placed on the *ad hoc* award in *Texaco* v. *Libya1103.1104*\n\nResp.

Rej. \u00b6 16.\n\n725.\n\nThe Respondent finally argues that the October 2007 Agreement gives rise only to best-effort duties as it was concluded at a time when the proceedings in the Latvian courts reached their peak and it dealt with a number of aspects, including the steps required in order to have the attachment of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account lifted, in order for the parties to agree on the key points of disagreement regarding the Long-Term Agreement and to reach agreement on amendments to the Long-Term Agreement.1105\n\nThe Respondent asserts that this is confirmed by the fact that no party \"has ever challenged the non-performance of this agreement in court\".1106 According to the Respondent, all involved parties understood that the October 2007 Agreement was simply an agreement to cooperate in good faith and was not a \"contractually binding agreement with exactly spelled out rights and obligations\".1107 Reliance is placed by the Respondent on Articles 1:302, 5:102 and 5:105 of the PECL \"as general principles of international law\"; an analysis of the October 2007 Agreement under Latvian law would yield the same result.1108\n\nResp.

Rep. (PO9) \u00b6 37.\n\n729.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s contention that Latvian civil law gives preference to a literal rule of interpretation and construction.1112 Rather, Latvian civil law is based on the civil law tradition \"where similar aspects are construed reasonably and the main actual form of construction of contracts is [to determine] what the other party objectively could understand\".1113\n\nResp.

To request such payments, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli sent a \"notice of warning\" to Latgales Ener\u0123ija in November 2006.1124\n\nTranscript, Day 4, 130/21-25; 131/1-18.\n\n(E) The Influence Allegedly Brought to Bear by the Municipality on the Regulator\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n734.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Regulator was a legally, functionally and financially independent entity that made its decisions based \"only on strict grounds prescribed\" by the Public Utility Regulators Act, and was financed solely through fees paid by the providers of public utilities such as Latgales Ener\u0123ija; reliance is placed on Sections 8(6), 8(7), 8(8), 11 and 29 of the Latvian Public Utility Regulators Act1125 in force at the relevant time.1126 The Regulator\u2019s legal status, governance, operation and competence were entirely separate from the Municipality and its decision-making process.1127 The Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s allegations are completely unwarranted and not proven by any evidence; reliance is placed on the decisions made by the Latvian courts denying Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s complaints with respect to the manner in which the Regulator had applied the law1128.1129\n\nCLA-49, see paragraph 38 above; RLA-2.\n\nResp.

P-H (PO8) \u00b6 11.\n\n737.\n\nThe Respondent further states that the issues relating to the adoption of the development plan fall into four categories as follows:1137\n\n(i) the Parties\u2019 conduct and their understanding as to whose legal duty it was to devise the development plan in light of the particular arrangements;\n\n(ii) the timing and circumstances in which Latgales Ener\u0123ija came up with the allegations concerning the lack of a development plan;\n\n(iii) the Respondent\u2019s conduct after it turned out that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was unable to provide a proper development plan; and\n\n(iv) the reasonable risk any prudent investor would have been deemed to have assumed considering the lack of a development plan.\n\nResp. P-H (PO8) \u00b6 10.\n\n738.\n\nOn the *first point,* the Respondent contends that \"subsequent practice\" plays a paramount role in public international law, that Latgales Ener\u0123ija understood that it had been delegated the duty to devise a concrete text and submit it to the Municipality for approval, as shown the \"consistent development of events\" since Latgales Ener\u0123ija did not disclaim its duty provide a draft development plan and that Latgales Ener\u0123ija is therefore not entitled to rely on the Municipality\u2019s ultimate responsibility to devise the development plan to avoid its own duty.1138 Finally, the Administrative District Court stated *inter alia* that the Municipality was entitled to delegate this obligation \"freely to any private individual or entity\".1139\n\nResp. P-H(PO8)\u00b611.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 113/5-12.\n\n739.\n\nOn the *second point,* the Respondent contends that Latgales Ener\u0123ija suddenly changed its approach to its obligations after undertaking them, that Latgales Ener\u0123ija has not been \"sufficiently persistent\" in making its complaint that the Municipality\u2019s failure to devise a development plan amounted to a breach of the Municipality\u2019s duties to the Claimant, and, finally, that Latgales Ener\u0123ija, having threatened to sue on four occasions relying on the absence of a development plan for the City and other alleged breaches,1140 eventually failed to do so.1141\n\nR-26; R-27; R-28 ; R-29.\n\nResp. P-H(PO8)\u00b613.\n\n740.\n\nOn the *third point,* the Respondent submits that the Municipality in good faith invited Latgales Ener\u0123ija to participate in the drafting of a \"proper\" development plan after it had appeared most likely that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would not be in a position to submit a \"proper document\" and the Municipality took the matter in its own hands.1142\n\nResp. P-H (PO8) \u00b6 14.\n\n741.\n\nOn the *fourth and final point,* the Respondent contends that Clause 1.6 of the February 2005 Agreement expressly provides that tariffs would be adjusted in line with the applicable provisions of law, that there was therefore no representation or warranty relating to the situation in which there was no development plan in place, nor was there any waiver on the part of the Municipality for the benefit of the Claimant.1143 Moreover, Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement expressly provided that Latgales Ener\u0123ija should devise a draft of the development plan which the Municipality would then *\"formally validate\",* with the clear implication that such draft would have to comply with the law.1144 Clause 5 of the February 2006 Agreement specifically provided that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was entitled to claim damages for the Municipality\u2019s failure to comply with its duties under the Agreement; Latgales Ener\u0123ija did not enforce such contract term.1145 The Respondent further notes that the licences issued shortly after the conclusion of the Long-Term Agreement contained various obligations that were dependent on the existence of a development plan, and that were not challenged by the Claimant.1146\n\nResp.

J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.21.\n\n747.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Municipality ultimately had to appoint an interim provider for heating services in R\u0113zekne under the applicable law and therefore requested Latgales Ener\u0123ija to return the leased assets on 14 July 2008;1171 the Municipality was left with no choice but to enforce the decision with the help of the police forces as the heating season was about to start and Latgales Ener\u0123ija continued to refuse to return the heating assets.1172\n\nCM3.\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.22.\n\n748.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that *(i)* the Claimant is not entitled to rely on the \"formal duty\" of the Municipality to devise and approve the development plan and the \"alleged duty\" of the Municipality to pay for the delivered gas in case Latgales Ener\u0123ija did not make a sufficient profit, *(ii)* the Municipality needed to avoid subsidizing the district heating system, which was clearly understood by the Claimant, *(iii)* the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Municipality had assumed the risk to cover the price difference in case of an unforeseen rise in the supply costs was contrary to the very purpose of inviting private capital, *(iv)* a prudent risk management by the Claimant should have taken into account the factors that are typically involved in the district heating business and resolved them before undertaking the duties arising out of the concession (see paragraphs 781 ff. below) and, finally *(v)* there was no duty on the Municipality to guarantee the solvency and viability of the business, which was a risk to be borne by the Claimant.1173\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Municipality reasonably exercised its discretion so as to involve another entity in order to have heating supplied under such circumstances, bearing in mind that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had expressed its dissatisfaction with the performance of the Long-Term Agreement from the outset of the Project, had blamed the Municipality for everything and had hardly a caring attitude, so that the Municipality\u2019s decision to proceed with the enforcement of its previous decision directing Latgales Ener\u0123ija to \"return\" the leased assets was a logical outcome in the circumstances.1174 That said, the Respondent points out that actual force was never used and that the Claimant had never adduced any evidence in that regard.1175\n\nResp.

(PO9) \u00b6 20.\n\n761.\n\nFinally, the Respondent did not present additional arguments regarding the Claimant\u2019s submission with regard to the application of Article 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT pursuant to the MFN Clause contained in Article 3(2) of the BIT since, in the Respondent\u2019s view, Article 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT fits well into Article 5 of the ILC Articles and does not represent \"an addition to the general rules of attribution existing under customary international law\".1200\n\nResp. Rep. (PO9) \u00b6 9.\n\n(D) Latgales Ener\u0123ija\n---------------------\n\n762.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was the Claimant\u2019s vehicle through which it operated \"the concession\" and therefore Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s conduct is attributable to the Claimant \"for the purposes of the concession\".1201\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.3; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 11.\n\n**(4) The Respondent\u2019s Arguments with Respect to the Alleged Breaches of the BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(A) No Breach of the BIT\n------------------------\n\n763.\n\nThe Respondent submits that its treatment of the Claimant\u2019s investment does not constitute a violation of the BIT.\n\n764.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s claims are in essence based on three points: *(i)* the Municipality was bound to pay the full price for the natural gas supplied, *(ii)* the Municipality was bound to prepare a heat supply development plan for the City, and its failure to comply with such duty caused the Regulator to dismiss the new tariffs proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s and *(iii)* the Municipality and the Regulator conspired to drive Latgales Ener\u0123ija out of business.\n\n765.\n\nThe Respondent has already shown *(i)* that the duty to pay for the natural gas supplied was only on Latgales Ener\u0123ija (see paragraphs 726 ff. above), *(ii)* that it was Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s obligation to provide the development plan (see paragraphs 736 ff. above) and *(iii)* that the Regulator applied Latvian law properly, as confirmed by the decisions made by the Latvian courts that are entitled to due deference; there is, moreover, no evidence of any collusion or conspiracy between the Municipality and the Regulator (see paragraph 734 above).\n\n766.\n\nRegarding the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim, the Respondent asserts that it is contradictory for the Claimant to make a claim for outright and gradual expropriation at the same time.1202 The Respondent contests the Claimant\u2019s allegation that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was actually insolvent and the contention that Latvian law prevented the liquidation of the company due to pending litigation.1203\n\nTranscript. Day 1. 136/10-25; 137/1-9.\n\nTranscript. Day 1. 137, 137/14-25; 138/1-13.\n\n767.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s complaint of a breach of its expectations due to the Municipality\u2019s alleged failure to devise a development plan of its own motion must be considered under international law, since a breach of national law does not automatically entail a breach of international law and the position under Latvian law cannot therefore be dispositive.1204 However, as an experienced and prudent manager, the Claimant could not have been surprised by the sharp increase in the gas supply costs and should have taken all precautions required \"to avoid contentious issues\" under the circumstances, such as carrying out risk management and, for example, requiring guarantees from the Municipality regarding the development plan before it entered into the \"concession arrangement\"; but the only guarantee Latgales Ener\u0123ija obtained was contained in Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement.1205\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 32.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 32; Resp. Rep. (PO9) \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n768.\n\nIn such circumstances, it is fair to conclude, according to the Respondent, that the sole obligation on the State is not to adopt decisions that are arbitrary or \"prejudiced decisions\".1206 In the present case, the Respondent actively sought solutions considering the interests of the inhabitants of R\u0113zekne at large, and not only the commercial interests of the Claimant.1207 The Respondent submits that in \"[s]ocially vulnerable business areas\" such as district heating services, the investor\u2019s expectations cannot be the same as in \"wider, general business undertakings\" because a \"social element plays a substantial role\".1208 According to the Respondent, Latgales Ener\u0123ija was involved in the whole process to devise the development plan and its representatives participated in 12 out of 16 meetings of the Working Group; the correspondence contained in R-30 showed the Municipality to be interested in finding common ground.1209\n\nResp.

Rep. (PO9) \u00b6 34.\n\n770.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the same test applies to the legal question whether the Respondent had breached the Claimant\u2019s expectations by failing to procure that Latvijas G\u0101ze should not suspend the deliveries of natural gas.1211\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 32.\n\n771.\n\nThe Respondent submits that public international law is not \"simply a supreme adjudicator\" and that the Tribunal must not consider \"whether Latvian courts have properly applied Latvian domestic law\" in the present case; the Tribunal is called upon to determine only whether international law rules and provisions pertinent to this case were observed properly.1212\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.31.\n\n772.\n\nThe Respondent has acted in a predictable and transparent manner;1213 the commercial agreements were performed on a commercial basis in accordance with their terms and there was no sovereign interference to alter or terminate the terms and conditions of those agreements.1214\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 27-30.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 28 [table].\n\n773.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Claimant has advanced the same arguments before the Latvian courts and in these proceedings: the Claimant attempts to show in its Memorial why Latgales Ener\u0123ija did not have to pay for the gas and why the development plan was the sole responsibility of the Municipality; however, the documents and/or the facts must be read otherwise.1215 The decisions of the Latvian courts with respect to the \"commercial part\" of the \"concession agreements\"1216 and the \"public or administrative part\" of the licences and other \"sovereign decisions\"1217 clearly show that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s arguments made in the Latvian proceedings are essentially the same as the arguments advanced in the Claimant\u2019s Memorial in these proceedings.1218 In the Respondent\u2019s view, there was no apparent or clear disregard of the facts or the law in violation of the BIT, let alone any intention to harm the Claimant.1219\n\nResp.

J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.32.\n\n774.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the Claimant through Latgales Ener\u0123ija selectively decided which judicial decisions to appeal in the Latvian courts; particularly with regard to the \"concession agreements\" and the licences, the Claimant did not appeal the decision ordering Latgales Ener\u0123ija to pay its outstanding debt for the natural gas delivered as well as the decisions to suspend the licences and to enforce the \"return of the assets\".1220\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.35.\n\n775.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the whole treatment afforded to the Claimant and Latgales Ener\u0123ija was reasonable and that they were able to raise all of their arguments \"at all times\"; reliance is placed by the Respondent on the award in *Arif* v. *Moldova1221.1222*\n\n*Mr. Franck Charles Arif* v. *Republic of Moldova,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/23, Award, 8 April 2013, RLA-23, \u00b6453.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 123/7-22.\n\n776.\n\nAs to the Regulator, the Respondent asserts that it requested performance of the licence conditions, not of the commercial agreements.1223 According to the Respondent, the Claimant was aware of the terms of the licences, in particular, the obligation to submit regular reports and forecasts, and did not challenge them in court; the Claimant cannot consider such terms as invalid simply by alleging that the Respondent did not perform some obligations.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 28.\n\n777.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimant had a duty to restructure the existing business in order to ensure a sustainable supply of heat; that in turn required the operator to be proactive in submitting information to the State authorities.1224\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 31.\n\n778.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Regulator put Latgales Ener\u0123ija on notice of the breach of various licence conditions, proceeding gradually from the 4 October 2007 warning, the 11 October 2007 suspension and then the revocation of the licences on 3 June 2008. The revocation of the licences by the Regulator was therefore the ultimate sanction against Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s repeated failure to comply with the licence conditions, the most important of which were the failure to provide good-quality uninterrupted heating services, and Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s refusal to pay the full price of the natural gas.1225\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 3.21; 3.23.\n\n779.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s argument that the Municipality had to cover the price difference arising out of an unforeseen rise in the costs of natural gas was tantamount to saying that the Municipality had to subsidise the Claimant\u2019s investment; aside from running counter to the basic purpose of inviting private capital, such a proposition had no basis in the contracts signed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija.1226\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.23, see also paragraphs 726 ff. above.\n\n780.\n\nFinally, the evidence is, according to the Respondent, that it is the Claimant\u2019s or Mr. Strioga\u2019s common practice to enter into deals having a potential for serious issues to arise and litigation to take place in due course due to a lack of \"precisely defined rules of cooperation\"; reliance is placed by the Respondent on Exhibit R-19 containing a number of press reports by the Lithuanian press and judgments by Lithuanian authorities.1227\n\nSee the Tribunal\u2019s index of this exhibit in footnote 544 above; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 33.\n\n(B) The Risks Assumed by the Claimant vs. the Claimant\u2019s Legitimate Expectations\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n781.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the investor\u2019s own conduct should be taken into account to determine the Respondent\u2019s liability under the BIT; reliance is placed on the awards in *Azinian v. United Mexican States,1228 MTD1229* and *Noble Ventures v. Romania1230.1231* According to the Respondent, these cases all dealt with various \"substantial bad faith conducts by [the] investor itself\u2019 such as improper due diligence, non-submission of relevant information and \"causing the events for revocation of licence\".1232\n\nThe Respondent submits that all these factors are pertinent in the present case.1233\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian & Ellen Baca* v. *United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999 *(Azinian v.

J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.34.\n\n782.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, a more reasonable and prudent investor than the Claimant would have considered the risks typically linked to the provision of district heating services in countries such as Latvia before making the investment.1234\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.23; Transcript, Day 4, 87/10-15.\n\n783.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent submits that the Claimant should have taken into account the following risks:\n\n(i) the general risk inherent in the fact that the Claimant did not have a comprehensive legal, financial or technical due diligence carried out;1235\n\n(ii) the risk which the Claimant assumed due to the non-existence of a heat supply development plan for the City when the Long-Term Agreement was executed, due *inter alia* to the fact that it was common practice for an operator to be the main entity devising and proposing major improvements and developments of the district heating system;1236\n\n(iii) the risk inherent in the \"mutual cooperation obligation\" to devise a development plan that had to be accepted by both parties (Latgales Ener\u0123ija and the Municipality) as well as the risk inherent in the absence of a timeline relating to the preparation of such plan;1237\n\n(iv) the risk of possible increases in the price Latvijas G\u0101ze would be allowed to charge for the natural gas delivered;1238\n\n(v) the risk that an increase in the tariff Latgales Ener\u0123ija was allowed to charge had to rest on objective business needs rather than the sole fact that there had been an increase in the price of gas or electricity;1239\n\n(vi) the risk that the business may not be profitable;1240 and\n\n(vii) the general risk of adverse events.1241\n\nRespondent's Closing Argument, Slide 11.\n\nResp.

Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.24.\n\n(C) Change of Circumstances\n---------------------------\n\n785.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent submits that there has been no breach of the BIT due to a change of circumstances.1243\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.37.\n\n786.\n\nTo that end, the Respondent again makes reference to Article 6:111 of the PECL, in particular subparagraphs (b) and (c).1244\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.37.\n\n787.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Regulator largely based its decision to revoke Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to procure a \"safe, continuous and reliable\" delivery of district heating services in R\u0113zekne.1245 According to the Respondent, even assuming that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was entitled to rely on the assumption that there would be permanent and continuous delivery of natural gas and that it would not have to prepare for emergency measures in case of a disruption of the delivery of natural gas, Latgales Ener\u0123ija \"directly caused and was responsible for the circumstances that led to the revocation of the [l]icences\".1246 When it withheld payments to Latvijas G\u0101ze, Latgales Ener\u0123ija should have realized that Latvijas G\u0101ze was not bound to procure a \"safe and sound business\" to Latgales Ener\u0123ija and that Latvijas G\u0101ze could therefore suspend or stop the delivery of natural gas.1247\n\nResp.

Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.39.\n\n**D. The Reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n789.\n\nThe Tribunal will deal with the issues in the following order:\n\n(i) the applicable law (see paragraphs 790 ff. below);\n\n(ii) whether the alleged conduct and breaches of the BIT complained of by the Claimant can be attributed to the Respondent insofar as the Municipality, the Regulator and the two companies R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija are concerned (see paragraph 794 ff. below);\n\n(iii) the claim for breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT (see paragraph 831 below);\n\n(iv) the claim for expropriation under Article 4(1) of the BIT (see paragraph 1067 below); and\n\n(v) the claim for breach of the MFN under Article 3(2) of the BIT (see paragraph 1102 below).\n\n**(1) Applicable Law**\n----------------------\n\n790.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that the present dispute is an investment dispute within its jurisdiction according to the provisions of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. As an ICSID Tribunal it has to turn to the Convention\u2019s provisions in order to determine the applicable law.\n\n791.\n\nArticle 42 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\nArticle 42\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n792.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, acceptance of the offer to arbitrate in Article 7 of the BIT establishes an implicit agreement that the applicable law consists primarily of the standards of protection contained in the BIT, but that recourse may be had to general international law as well as to the domestic law of Latvia.\n\n793.\n\nThe Tribunal finally notes that it is not in dispute that *(i)* Article 1(1) of the BIT refers to Latvian laws and regulations, *(ii)* such laws and regulations apply to the actions of Latvian executive and judicial authorities and *(iii)* the agreements entered into by Latgales Ener\u0123ija with the Municipality, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija are governed by such laws and regulations. As follows from the preceding paragraph, the Tribunal considers that it is empowered by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention to interpret and apply such laws and regulations in so far as necessary to determine the dispute that has been referred to it.\n\n**(2) The Issue of Attribution**\n--------------------------------\n\n794.\n\nAs reflected in Article 2 of the ILC Articles:1249\n\n*Article 2*\n\n*Elements of an internationally wrongful act of a State*\n\nThere is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission:\n\n*(a)* is attributable to the State under international law; and\n\n*(b)* constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\n\nILC Articles, CLA-7.\n\n795.\n\nThe issue for the purposes of the present Award is the threshold question whether the conduct of which the Claimant complains is attributable to the Respondent under international law. The Tribunal will examine the case of the Municipality, the Regulator and the two companies R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija.\n\n(A) The Municipality\n--------------------\n\n796.\n\nThere can be no doubt\u2014nor did the Respondent appear to contest (see paragraph 750 above)\u2014that the Municipality\u2019s conduct is attributable to the Respondent.\n\n797.\n\nThe relevant rule is stated in Article 4 of the ILC Articles:\n\n*Article 4*\n\n*Conduct of organs of a State*\n\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which lias that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n\n798.\n\nAs paragraph 3 of the ILC\u2019s Commentary to that article observes, the rule which it embodies \"has long been recognized in international judicial decisions\".1250\n\nThe Commentary is not on the record, but both Parties relied on it in the submissions filed after the Hearing (Cl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6\u00b6 9-11 and Resp. P-H (PO8) \u00b6 9). Moreover, during the Hearing Mr. Wordsworth invited them to comment on a passage in that commentary (paragraph 6 on Art. 8) (Transcript, Day 4, 79/23-25; 80/1-15) and in the submissions to be filed after the Hearing (Transcript, Day 4, 125/7-18). Further to that request the Parties briefly referred to that commentary during the Hearing (Transcript, Day 4, 91/21-25; 92/1-10 for the Claimant; Day 4, 179/7-13 for the Respondent). The Commentary is available at: http://legal.un.Org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9 6 2001.pdf.\n\n799.\n\nParagraph 6 of the Commentary elaborates that the rule \"extends to organs of government of whatever kind or classification, exercising whatever functions, and at whatever level in the hierarchy, including those at provincial or even local level\". The rule therefore encompasses an organ of local government such as the Municipality, which is given the status of part of the Latvian State by the Municipalities Act.1251\n\nCLA-46.\n\n800.\n\nProvided that the acts in question are performed in an official capacity, they are attributable to the State. There is no dispute that the acts of the Municipality in this case were performed in an official capacity.\n\n801.\n\nAll of the actions of the Municipality at issue in this case are therefore attributable to the Respondent.\n\n(B) The Regulator\n-----------------\n\n802.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s allegations concern both the Regulator\u2019s refusal to grant Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s applications for revised tariffs on 13 October 20061252 and on 11 June 2007,1253 as well as its annulment on 7 December 20071254 of a prior decision to grant Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application for revised tariffs1255 and ultimately, on 3 June 2008, its revocation of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences1256 following the warning of Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 4 October 20071257 and the decision to take over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s zone on 11 October 2007.1258\n\nC-19.\n\nC-21.\n\nC-28.\n\nC-27.\n\nC-29.\n\nC-22.\n\nC-23.\n\n803.\n\nThe arguments as to the attribution of this conduct were not well developed on either side. Nonetheless, the material which has been put before the Tribunal readily justifies the conclusion that such conduct is attributable to the Respondent.\n\n804.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the nature of the Regulator as a State organ as understood under Article 4 of the ILC Articles may be inferred from provisions of the Public Utilities Regulators Act which contain a number of relevant indications:\n\n(i) whether the Regulator is a central body or is part of local government, it must \"operate independently and autonomously\" in performing the functions determined by the Public Utilities Regulators Act \"when taking decisions and issuing administrative acts in order to protect the interests of users and to promote the development of providers of public utilities in accordance with the principles of justice, transparency, neutrality, equality and proportionality\";1259\n\n(ii) exceptions apart, a body such as the Regulator bound to act in accordance with the \"principles of justice\" may be presumed to be a State organ, and the further principles mentioned by Section 5 of the same Act are simply general principles of administrative law recognized in most jurisdictions;\n\n(iii) the Regulator\u2019s individual decisions are in the nature of administrative acts \"binding upon specific providers and users of public utilities\";1260 and\n\n(iv) both an administrative act or an actual action of the Regulator may be challenged before an Administrative Regional.1261\n\nCLA-49, Section 5, see also Sections 7(2), 11(1).\n\nCLA-49, Sections 6(1), 7(3).\n\nCLA-49, Section 11(4).\n\n805.\n\nTo the extent that the acts of the Regulator were not attributable to the Respondent under Article 4 of the ILC Articles, they would be attributable as a matter of Article 5. Article 5 of the ILC Articles reads as follows:\n\n*Article 5*\n\n*Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority*\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n\n806.\n\nLike Article 4, Article 5 of the ILC Articles merely codifies a well-established rule of international law.\n\n807.\n\nThere are thus three aspects to the analysis:\n\n(i) the Regulator must have exercised elements of governmental authority;\n\n(ii) it must have been empowered by the Respondent\u2019s law to do so; and\n\n(iii) it was acting in that capacity in regulating tariffs and granting or revoking licences.\n\n808.\n\nAs to the first aspect, paragraph 6 of the commentary to Article 5 of the ILC Articles explains:\n\nArticle 5 does not attempt to identity' precisely the scope of \"governmental authority\" for the purpose of attribution of the conduct of an entity to the State. Beyond a certain limit, what is regarded as \"governmental\" depends on the particular society, its history and traditions. Of particular importance will be not just the content of the powers, but the way they arc conferred on an entity, the purposes for which they are to be exercised and the extent to which the entity is accountable to government for their exercise. These are essentially questions of the application of a general standard to varied circumstances. The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n\n809.\n\nArticle 5 thus directs the Tribunal to consider a range of factors, each of which may be relevant to differing extents. But in this case the Respondent accepted (indeed, insisted) that the Regulator\u2019s function relating to its decisions, including as to licences, was of a public nature, financed solely from fees levied from utility companies.1262 There can be little doubt that it was the exercise of an element of governmental authority as classically understood. The same can be said of the Regulator\u2019s function of approving the tariffs applicable to the licenced activity. It is also notable that, as the Respondent points out, the Regulator\u2019s decisions were subject to review in the administrative rather than civil courts.1263 Both the licensing and tariff-approval functions were therefore the exercise of an element of governmental authority.\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 3.7-3.8; see also CLA-49. Section 29.\n\nSee *e.g.*C-14 ; Resp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.7.\n\n810.\n\nAs to the second aspect of the analysis, the Regulator was empowered to exercise that function by statutory authority, in the form of the Public Utilities Regulators Act. The manner of that empowerment only reinforces the conclusion that the Regulator was an entity exercising an element of governmental authority.\n\n811.\n\nAs to the third aspect, since all of the Regulator\u2019s actions at issue in this case concerned the exercise of that authority, the Tribunal concludes that they are attributable to the Respondent.\n\n(C) The Companies R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n812.\n\nThe Claimant founds its case to a limited degree on the conduct of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija, both of which are wholly owned by the Municipality: in particular, on R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s bringing a civil suit against Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 20 September 2007 which resulted in a freezing order being granted against Latgales Ener\u0123ija the following day, and on a further suit by R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija brought on 27 December 2007 to the same effect. The Claimant\u2019s case, put broadly, is that these litigations were orchestrated by the Municipality to further its aim of removing Latgales Ener\u0123ija from the supply of heating to R\u0113zekne.\n\n813.\n\nThe question of the attribution of these actions is more complex than that of the acts of the Municipality and the Regulator. Accordingly, by Procedural Order No. 8 the Tribunal invited the Parties to file \"a short submission on the question whether acts by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and/or R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija [were] attributable to the Respondent\".\n\n814.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the actions of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija were attributable to the Respondent on three bases:1264\n\n(i) R\u00e9zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u00e9zeknes Ener\u0123ija exercised delegated governmental authority, in the form of delegated authority to run the district heating system, thereby falling within Article 5 of the ILC Articles;\n\n(ii) R\u00e9zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u00e9zeknes Ener\u0123ija exercised delegated administrative or governmental authority, thereby falling within Article 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT, imported into the BIT by the MFN provision in Article 3(2) of the Lithuania-Latvia BIT; and\n\n(iii) R\u00e9zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u00e9zeknes Ener\u0123ija acted under the control and direction of the Municipality, thereby falling within Article 8 of the ILC Articles.\n\nCl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6\u00b6 8 ff.\n\n815.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief the Respondent denies that R\u00e9zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s and R\u00e9zeknes Ener\u0123ija\u2019s actions were attributable to it on the basis of either Article 5 or Article 8 of the ILC Articles.1265\n\nResp. P-H (PO8) \u00b6\u00b6 7 ff.\n\n(i) *Article 5 of the ILC Articles*\n-----------------------------------\n\n816.\n\nThe short answer to this argument appears to be that, even if R\u00e9zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u00e9zeknes Ener\u0123ija had been empowered to exercise any element of governmental authority, they were not exercising such authority \"in the particular instance\", as Article 5 requires.\n\n817.\n\nAs the Respondent observes, both litigations were brought in the civil courts, on the basis of purely commercial agreements.1266 As a matter of first principles - and contrary to the Claimant\u2019s contention1267 - the mere fact that the Municipality was responsible for organising district heating is not enough to transform the consequent provision of such heating (whether by private or semi-private entities) into an exercise of governmental authority.\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 5.\n\nSee *e.g.* Cl. Rep. \u00b6 18.\n\n(ii) *MFN in Article 3(2) of the BIT*\n-------------------------------------\n\n818.\n\nThe next strand of the Claimant\u2019s case is as follows:\n\n(i) R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija\u2019s conduct would be attributable to the Respondent under article 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT; and\n\n(ii) by virtue of the MFN provision in article 3(2) of the (Lithuania-Latvia) BIT, the Claimant is entitled to have its claim determined by reference to that provision of the US-Latvia BIT.\n\n819.\n\nArticle 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT1268 provides:\n\nArticle II\n\n2\n\na. (...)\n\nb. Each Party shall ensure that any state enterprise that it maintains or establishes acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party\u2019s obligations under this Treaty *wherever such enterprise exercises* any regulatory, administrative or *other governmental authority* that the Party lias delegated to it, such as the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions, or impose quotas, fees or other charges.\n\nUS-Latvia BIT, CLA-25.\n\n820.\n\nIt appears doubtful that this provision adds anything to the Claimant\u2019s case on Article 5 of the ILC Articles. Even if \"regulatory\" or \"administrative\" authority were in isolation capable of bearing a broader meaning than \"governmental authority\", it appears from the use of \"other\" that those terms are to be read *eiusdem generis* with \"governmental authority\" as generally understood. Further, although the list of examples of such authority which follows is merely illustrative, it appears to leave little scope to suppose that the terms were intended to bear a broader meaning than the \"governmental authority\" referred to in Article 5 of the ILC Articles.\n\n821.\n\nFor the same reasons discussed above in relation to Article 5 of the ILC Articles, there appears to be nothing to establish that either R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli or R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija was exercising any such authority when it engaged in the conduct at issue. Article 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT would therefore appear inapplicable on the current facts.\n\n822.\n\nOn this basis, it would be unnecessary to reach a view on whether the MFN provision in the BIT is capable in principle of applying in the present case.\n\n(iii) *Article 8 of the ILC Articles*\n-------------------------------------\n\n823.\n\nThe final issue is whether R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija\u2019s conduct is attributable to the Respondent under the test expressed in Article 8 of the ILC Articles.1269 This provides:\n\n*Article 8*\n\n*Conduct directed or controlled by a State*\n\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of. that State in carrying out the conduct.\n\nILC Articles, CLA-7.\n\n824.\n\nParagraphs 6 and 7 of the Commentary to that article are pertinent enough to be worth quoting in full:\n\nQuestions arise with respect to the conduct of companies or enterprises which are State-owned and controlled. If such corporations act inconsistently with the international obligations of the State concerned the question arises whether such conduct is attributable to the State. In discussing this issue it is necessary to recall that international law acknowledges the general separateness of corporate entities at the national level, except in those cases where the \"corporate veil\" is a mere device or a vehicle for fraud or evasion. The fact that the State initially establishes a corporate entity, whether by a special law or otherwise, is not a sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that entity. Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, *prima facie* their conduct in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of governmental authority within the meaning of article 5. This was the position taken, for example, in relation to the *de facto* seizure of property by a State-owned oil company, in a case where there was no proof that the State used its ownership interest as a vehicle for directing the company to seize the property. On the other hand, where there was evidence that the corporation was exercising public powers, or that the State was using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct in question lias been attributed to the State.\n\nIt is clear then that a State may. either by specific directions or by exercising control over a group, in effect assume responsibility for their conduct. Each case will depend on its own facts, in particular those concerning the relationship between the instructions given or the direction or control exercised and the specific conduct complained of. In the text of article 8, the three terms \"instructions\", \"direction\" and \"control\" are disjunctive; it is sufficient to establish any one of them. At the same time it is made clear that the instructions, direction or control must relate to the conduct which is said to have amounted to an internationally wrongful act.\n\n825.\n\nIt is therefore clear that it is not enough to meet the test set out in Article 8 of the ILC Articles that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija were State-owned. Nor is it enough that they may in general have been subject to the Municipality\u2019s control (as the Claimant argued in its closing submissions). Rather, the specific question to be addressed in this case is whether the Respondent instructed, directed or controlled R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s or R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bringing of the litigation which resulted in Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank accounts being frozen.\n\n826.\n\nThere is a dearth of direct evidence as to any such instruction, direction or control in this case. That is partly a consequence of the Respondent\u2019s failure to tender any witnesses of fact for cross-examination and partly a consequence of the fact that the Respondent produced only few documents further to Procedural Order No. 4.1270 As to the Claimant\u2019s allegation that the Municipality directed the companies\u2019 actions, the Respondent says that the suggestion is \"at the best, worth a big and healthy smile\".1271\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 8 the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to state whether there were any documents responsive to the Claimant\u2019s requests for production granted by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 4 and. further to a renewed verification of its files, to produce any responsive documents by 20 March 2015.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 27.\n\n827.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there is, however, a body of circumstantial evidence which, taken as a whole, permits the inference that the Municipality (as an organ of the Respondent) must have instructed R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija to bring the claims against Latgales Ener\u0123ija and must have instructed R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli not to comply with the October 2007 Agreement.\n\n828.\n\nThe evidence giving rise to such an inference so far as R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli is concerned is as follows:\n\n(i) although the Municipality\u2019s sole ownership of the companies is not by itself sufficient to found an inference of direction, it is a significant background factor;\n\n(ii) against that background is to be considered the newspaper interview given by the Mayor of the Municipality (Mr. Vjakse) on 13 September 2007. Among the key points emerging from the interview were these:1272\n\n\u2014 the Municipality or the mayor himself had been in private negotiations \"for three months\" to identify \"alternatives\" to Latgales Ener\u0123ija;\n\n\u2014 Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s future as an operator in R\u0113zekne was said to depend on whether it paid Latvijas G\u0101ze;\n\n\u2014 despite that, the Mayor stated unconditionally that \"[W]e will announce a tender and choose a company that would meet our requirements\"; and\n\n\u2014 the Mayor also stated, \"the future of Latgales energija in our city will be decided on 25 September. By this date, the regular payment for the gas should be paid, and in case Latgales energija fails to pay it, then I would bring a question to deputies regarding termination of the agreement with this company\";\n\n(iii) shortly before the interview, and following the Mayor\u2019s alleged private negotiations with Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s competitors, the Municipality-owned R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had (absent any other explanation for its timing)1273 decided to bring the civil claim against Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 20 September 2007 seeking an attachment which was granted on 21 September 20071274 and which prevented Latgales Ener\u0123ija from being able to pay Latvijas G\u0101ze;\n\n(iv) on the same day, the Municipality adopted a Development Plan;1275\n\n(v) the name of Latgales Ener\u0123ija which featured in the draft was deleted and replaced by the word \"operator\" further to the suggestions made by representatives of the City Council during two meetings of the Working Group in the absence of Latgales Ener\u0123ija (see paragraphs 224 and 227 above); and\n\n(vi) finally, it is significant that when the lifting of the attachment of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account was agreed upon as a measure to be taken as a matter of urgency pursuant to the October 2007 Agreement (see paragraph 287 above), such undertaking was assumed also by the City Council, which was one of the parties privy to that agreement, and not only by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli;1276 this could only mean that the City Council would be bound to give R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli any directions as may be required.\n\nC-134, reproduced in paragraph 251 above.\n\nThe bulk of the sum claimed was represented by amounts allegedly owed for depreciation of assets and the dispute between R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and Latgales Ener\u0123ija in this respect went back to the previous year (see paragraphs 193 ff. above).\n\nC-138, see paragraph 255 above.\n\nC-137, see paragraph 228 above.\n\nC-26, see paragraph 286 above.\n\n829.\n\nThe sequence of events which followed suggests an intention on the Municipality\u2019s part then to use R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as an instrument in connection with Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s removal, which culminated in R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bringing its claim for a freezing order against Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 27 December 2007:\n\n(i) on 28 September 2007 the Municipality decided to establish R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija;1277\n\n(ii) R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija was incorporated by the Municipality on 2 October 2007 and, immediately thereafter, R\u0113zeknes City Council applied for a loan in an amount of LVL 4 million which was arranged in the first week of October 2007 (see paragraphs 260 ff. above);\n\n(iii) on 4 October 2007 the Regulator warned Latgales Ener\u0123ija that the licences might be revoked;1278\n\n(iv) one week later, on 9 October 2007, the Municipality declared an energy crisis;1279\n\n(v) the Regulator took over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s zone on 11 October 2007;1280\n\n(vi) on 12 October 2007, the Municipality adopted a decision appointing R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as the \"person in charge\" of the provision of heating services in R\u0113zekne;1281 and\n\n(vii) at a meeting the same day attended by the Mayor, representatives of Latgales Ener\u0123ija, and representatives of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija, the Mayor made the following, telling remark: \"In the light of the crisis situation, in the name of the new company [i.e. R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija], we are claiming that before 14 October, 6 00 P.M. [Latgales Ener\u0123ija] to deliver the service activity area and to ensure that the people from R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija can start fulfilment of the obligations as defined by the Regulator and the [Municipality]\".1282\n\nC-142; see also paragraph 258 above.\n\nC-22, see paragraph 262 above.\n\nC-24, see paragraph 264 above.\n\nC-23, see paragraph 274 above.\n\nC-25, see paragraph 275 above.\n\nC-147. page 12 (emphasis supplied).\n\n830.\n\nThese facts are sufficient in order for the Tribunal to conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that the Respondent did direct R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija to bring their respective claims against Latgales Ener\u0123ija. In reaching such a conclusion, the Tribunal takes into account the Respondent\u2019s failure to offer any witness of fact for cross-examination on this point.\n\n**(3) Claims for Breach of Article 3(1) of the Treaty (Fair andEquitable Treatment, Full Protection and Security; No Arbitrary or Discriminatory measures with Respect to the Investment)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n831.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the BIT reads as follows:\n\nArticle 3\n\nProtection and Treatment of Investments\n\n1. Each Contracting Party shall at all times ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party as well as their full security and protection in its territory.\n\nNeither Contracting Party shall by arbitrary or discriminatory measures impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party.\n\n(A) The Applicable Standard of Treatment\n----------------------------------------\n\n832.\n\nFair and equitable treatment is the first standard of investment protection mentioned in the first sub-paragraph of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n833.\n\nThere has been considerable debate as to the content of this standard, including as to whether it confers protection going beyond the minimum standard of treatment required as a matter of customary international law.\n\n834.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, as is now recognized in multiple awards, the standard is concerned with \"[p]rotection of legitimate expectations (...); [g]ood faith (...) [and] [t]ransparency, consistency, non-discrimination\", as was noted by the *Biwater Gauff* tribunal.1283 In *Saluka* the tribunal concluded on the standard of fair and equitable treatment as follows: \"A foreign investor whose interests are protected under the Treaty is entitled to expect that the Czech Republic will not act in a way that is manifestly inconsistent, non-transparent, unreasonable *(i.e.* unrelated to some rational policy) or discriminatory *(i.e.* based on unjustifiable distinctions)\".1284 Although made in the specific context of NAFTA, the views expressed by the *Waste Management* tribunal have been influential, and have frequently been referred to both with respect to NAFTA claims and claims under treaties that refer solely to an obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment, *i.e.* without any reference to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. That tribunal stated that the NAFTA standard of fair and equitable treatment is breached\n\n(...) by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying that standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.1285\n\n*Biwater Gauff* v. *Tanzania,* CLA-36 \u00b6 602.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic,* CLA-21 \u00b6 309.\n\n*Waste Management* v. *Mexico,* CLA-15 \u00b6 98.\n\n835.\n\nOne important element of the standard of fair and equitable treatment is the protection of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. The Tribunal considers, in line with the views expressed by various other tribunals, that for the investor\u2019s expectations to be protected by the standard of fair and equitable treatment:\n\n(i) the investor\u2019s expectations must be \"legitimate\";1286 indeed \"reasonable and legitimate\";1287\n\n(ii) more is required than a \"basic expectation\", as has been referred to in various cases, including *Biwater Gauff,1288*\n\n(iii) there must have been reliance by the investor with respect to making the investment;1289 and\n\n(iv) that reliance must be reasonable.1290\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic,* CLA-21 \u00b6 302; *El Paso* v. *Argentina,* CLA-39 \u00b6 359.\n\n*Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan,* CLA-34 \u00b6 609; *Biwater Gauff* v. *Tanzania,* CLA-36 \u00b6 602.\n\n*Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania,* CLA-36 \u00b6 602.\n\n*Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania,* CLA-36 \u00b6 602.\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico,* CLA-15 \u00b6 98.\n\n836.\n\nWhereas stability and predictability of the legal environment have been regarded as concrete renderings of the fair and equitable treatment standard in a number of decisions,1291 these cannot be absolute requirements, and have often been weighed against further criteria, and most notably the right of the host State to exercise its general legislative power and enforce laws and regulations to protect the public interest. Thus, the *Saluka* tribunal noted that \"[n]o investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time the investment is made remain totally unchanged\";1292 the *El Paso* tribunal went a step further, holding that it was unable to follow the line of cases in which fair and equitable treatment had been viewed as implying the stability of the legal and business framework.1293\n\nSee *e.g. CMS* v. *Argentina,* RLA-30 \u00b6\u00b6 274; 276.\n\n*Saluka* v. *Czech Republic,* CLA-21 \u00b6 305.\n\n*El Paso* v. *Argentina,* CLA-3 9 \u00b6 352\n\n837.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that reasonableness on the part of the investor in relying on representations by the State means *inter alia* that it is a matter for the investor to evaluate the risk inherent in the proposed investment taking into account all relevant circumstances; investment tribunals have held that the investor would in principle have to take the consequences following from its own failure in this respect.1294\n\n*MTD v. Chile,* CLA-18 \u00b6 164; *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania,* CLA-36 \u00b6 601.\n\n838.\n\nMoreover, the breach by a State of a representation made in a contract may not suffice to give rise to a breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment since a distinction must be made between pure contract claims and treaty claims. The Tribunal considers that, as a general rule, a breach of contract is unlikely on its own to amount to a breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, and the State would have to have acted in its sovereign capacity.1295\n\nSee e.g. *Waste Management v. Mexico,* CLA-15 \u00b6 115.\n\n839.\n\nGood faith is generally regarded as a fundamental part of the fair and equitable standard of protection. The Tribunal considers that a breach of good faith does not require proof of an intention to harm the investment or the investor,1296 but such an intention or motive, if found to exist, may be relevant.1297 The Tribunal considers that the following finding by the *Saluka* tribunal is of assistance: the host State is required to implement its policies\n\n*(...) bona fide* by conduct that is. as far as it affects the investors\u2019 investment, reasonably justifiable by public policies and that such conduct does not manifestly violate the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination. In particular, any differential treatment of a foreign investor must not be based on unreasonable distinctions and demands, and must be justified by showing that it bears a reasonable relationship to rational policies not motivated by a preference for other investments over the foreign-owned investment.1298\n\n*El Paso* v. *Argentina,* CLA-39 \u00b6 357.\n\nSee e.g. *Waste Management v. Mexico,* CLA-15 \u00b6 138.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic,* CLA-21 \u00b6 307.\n\n840.\n\nFull protection and security is the second standard of investment protection mentioned in the first sub-paragraph of Article 3(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal considers that the standard of full protection and security seeks specifically to protect the physical integrity of the investment against the use of force.1299 Full protection and security does not provide for strict liability,1300 but rather requires the host State to exercise due diligence in the treatment of the investment.1301 The Tribunal notes that certain decisions have held that the standard did not protect only the physical integrity of the investment, but had a broader scope which includes the investor\u2019s rights.1302 The *Biwater Gauff* tribunal mentioned the stability of the investor\u2019s environment, including the commercial and legal environment.1303\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic,* CLA-21 \u00b6 484.\n\n*Tecmed* v. *Mexico,* CLA-17 \u00b6 177; *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* CLA-21 \u00b6 484.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic,* CLA-21 \u00b6 484.\n\n*ELSI,* CLA-24 \u00b6\u00b6 109-111 *;* *Azurix* v. *Argentina,* CLA-19 \u00b6\u00b6 406, 408; *Siemens* v. *Argentina,* CLA-11 *\u00b6 303**;* *AES v. Hungary,* CLA-38 \u00b6 13.3.2.\n\n*Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania,* CLA-36 \u00b6 729.\n\n841.\n\nThe protection against arbitrary and discriminatory measures which impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments is the third standard of investment protection established in Article 3(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal considers that a measure may be characterized as arbitrary if it is \"founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact\"1304 or constitutes a \"willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety\".1305 The Tribunal considers that a measure which is arbitrary or discriminatory is likely also to violate the fair and equitable treatment standard considering the elements of the fair and equitable treatment set out above (see paragraphs 832 and 834 above). For there to be a breach of this limb of Article 3(1), there must be not only one or more arbitrary or discriminatory measures but also impairment to the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of an investment. This is a familiar formulation, but the Tribunal nonetheless notes the broad scope of what is prohibited in terms of impairment.\n\n*Lauder v. Czech Republic,* CLA-29 \u00b6 221; see also *El Paso* v. *Argentina,* CLA-39 \u00b6 319.\n\n*ELSI,* CLA-24 \u00b6 128; *Siemens* v. *Argentina,* CLA-11 \u00b6 318; *El Paso* v. *Argentina,* CLA-39 \u00b6 319.\n\n(B) Whether the Respondent Is in Breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n842.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine *(i)* the claim rested on a breach of the Claimant\u2019s expectations based on the Long-Term Agreement (see paragraphs 844 ff. below), *(ii)* the claim based on the Municipality\u2019s delay in approving the heat supply development plan for the City (see paragraphs 855 ff. below), *(iii)* the claim based on the Municipality\u2019s refusal to consent to the Claimant\u2019s investments in the heating system (see paragraphs 888 ff. below), *(iv)* the claims based on the Regulator\u2019s refusal to set a new tariff (see paragraphs 899 ff. below), *(v)* the claims based on the Municipality\u2019s and the Regulator\u2019s conduct in connection with the energy crisis (see paragraphs 923 ff. below), the claims based on the Regulator\u2019s warning and the revocation of the licences by the Regulator (see paragraphs 988 ff. below) and the claims based on the Municipality\u2019s conduct subsequent to the revocation of the licences (see paragraphs 1028 ff. below). The Tribunal will finally consider the cumulative effect of the measures taken by the Regulator and the Municipality (see paragraphs 1060 ff. below).\n\n843.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding on whether the Respondent acted in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT is set out in paragraph 1066 below.\n\n(i) *The Claim Rested on a Breach by the Respondent of the Claimant\u2019s Expectations Based on the Long-Term Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n844.\n\nThe Claimant relies on a number of expectations, and most notably the expectation that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would recover the investment made by the Claimant and earn a profit as provided in the Long-Term Agreement (see paragraph 675 above). The Tribunal dismisses this claim.\n\n845.\n\nThe Claimant emphasised, in replying to the Respondent\u2019s arguments, that its claims are Treaty claims,1306 pointing out that the rights asserted in these arbitration proceedings are not \"mere contractual claims\" and are distinct from the claims asserted by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in the Latvian courts based on the contracts or the licences.1307\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6 77.\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.\n\n846.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that its role is to determine whether the Claimant is entitled to assert a claim for breach of the standards of protection in Article 3(1) of the BIT, not whether it is liable in contract under the terms of the Long-Term Agreement. However, the claim that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would be entitled to use the assets, create new assets and make a profit as provided by the Long-Term Agreement is in substance a contractual claim brought under the veil of a breach of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n847.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent did not, in particular, guarantee the profitability of the investment under Article 3(1) of the BIT; neither did the terms of the Long-Term Agreement for that matter, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s submission. The Claimant could not therefore reasonably have such an expectation when the Long-Term Agreement was made on 28 January 2005.\n\n848.\n\nInvestment tribunals have consistently found that BITs are not an insurance against business risks.1308\n\nIn the context of the fair and equitable treatment standard, see *e.g.* *MTD v Chile,* CLA-18 \u00b6 178 and *Biwater Gauff* v. *Tanzania,* CLA-36 \u00b6 601 referring to *Waste Management v. Mexico,* CLA-15.\n\n849.\n\nIn the present case the Claimant, a company active *inter alia* in the heating business, was aware of certain risks inherent in the investment and must be deemed to have assumed them unless they were expressly excluded; its investment in Latvia related to activities which the Claimant has been carrying out in its own country according to the representations made to the Respondent.1309 Whereas both Lithuania and Latvia had gradually embraced a system of market economy after regaining independence in the early 1990s, the privatization of district heating utilities was a new page of history for the City of R\u0113zekne when the Claimant decided to invest there, as contended by the Respondent. When the Claimant summarised the current position of the heating system in R\u0113zekne in the PowerPoint presentation made to the Municipality on 25 November 2004, it identified by the same token some of the specific risks possibly affecting the profitability of the investment under consideration, in particular the fact that the infrastructure would have to be replaced and a change in the type of fuel had to be introduced.1310\n\nSee the Claimant\u2019s PowerPoint presentation of 25 November 2004, C-41 [page 1].\n\nC-41 [pages 2-31.\n\n850.\n\nThe Claimant has provided no precise answer to the Respondent\u2019s allegation that its due diligence was at best insufficient and its decision to invest \"overconfident\"; when asked whether any due diligence had been made to assess the legal, financial and technical risks, Mr. Strioga answered that his company had hired local lawyers to obtain advice on Latvian law, but he could not remember whether any due diligence report had been received.1311 The Tribunal notes that due diligence by the Claimant was contemplated as a possible condition precedent to the entry into force of the February 2005 Agreement by Clause 5 of the same agreement.1312\n\nTranscript. Day 1, 29/13-30/9.\n\nC-8.\n\n851.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant does not contend that it received any specific assurances by the Latvian authorities regarding the review of the tariff. The Regulator\u2019s and the Municipality\u2019s conduct in relation to the tariffs proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in 2006 and 2007 will be examined in due course (see paragraphs 899 ff. below).\n\n852.\n\nCertain specific complaints made by the Claimant are dealt with in the following sections of the present Award: *(i)* the complaint that the Respondent disappointed the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectation that the Regulator would not depart from its 2005 practice is dealt with in paragraphs 910 ff. below; *(ii)* the complaint that the Respondent disappointed the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectation that the Municipality would pay for the natural gas is dealt with in paragraphs 925 ff. below; *(iii)* the complaint that the interview given by the Mayor and the Municipality\u2019s attempts to attract a new operator in the summer of 2007 disappointed the Clamant\u2019s legitimate expectation that the Municipality would not actively seek to replace Latgales Ener\u0123ija is dealt with in paragraphs 938 ff. below; *(iv)* the complaint that the Respondent disappointed the Claimant\u2019s expectations that the Municipality would not actively prevent Latgales Ener\u0123ija from operating its business and would comply with the undertaking to have the attachment lifted is dealt with in paragraphs 950 ff. below; *(v)* the complaint that the Respondent disappointed the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectation that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would be able to use the assets for the production, transmission and distribution of thermal energy for 30 years is dealt with in paragraph 1044 below; *(vi)* the complaint that the Respondent disappointed the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectation that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would not be required to hand over the leased assets to Municipality-owned companies is dealt with in paragraph 1048 below.\n\n853.\n\nFinally and in any event, the Tribunal considers that the expectations relied upon by the Claimant (see paragraph 675 above) relate to mere contractual obligations1313 and/or represent in essence an alternative way to plead arbitrary conduct or conduct contrary to good faith.1314 Insofar as the Claimant has relied on mere contractual obligations, such complaints must be dismissed for the reason set out in paragraph 846 above. Insofar as the Claimant has presented other alleged breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT clothed as breaches of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations, such attempts must fail under the heading of a breach of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations; the Tribunal will examine the substance of the complaint and determine whether the Respondent has acted in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT in the following sections of the present Award.\n\nSee paragraph 675 above, in particular: (i); (iii) and (xiii) in that the Claimant\u2019s complaint may be understood as referring to a breach of the February 2005 Agreement; and (v); (vi); (vii); (ix); (xii) and (xiv).\n\nSee paragraph 675 above, in particular (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (viii), (x), (xi), (xii), (xiii) and (xiv).\n\n854.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this claim.\n\n(ii) *The Claim Based on Delay by the Municipality in the Adoption of a Heat Supply Development Plan for the City of R\u0113zekne*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n855.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the delay by the Municipality in the adoption of a heat supply development plan for the City is a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, both *per se* and because the non-existence of such a plan caused the Regulator to deny Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s applications for a new tariff in 2006 and 2007; the Claimant further contends that the Regulator\u2019s and the Municipality\u2019s conduct amount to an abuse of power amounting to arbitrary measures that resulted in its investment being irreparably impaired. The Tribunal will examine only the delay claim in this section; the Regulator\u2019s decisions will be examined in the following subsection of this Award (see paragraph 899 below). The Respondent alleges that the delay was caused by the Claimant\u2019s failure to prepare a proper draft for the heat supply development plan with due dispatch and the Claimant\u2019s refusal to provide relevant information to the Municipality as to the planned investments.\n\n856.\n\nThe issues arising for determination are as follows:\n\n(i) Whose duty was it to establish and adopt a heat supply development plan for the City of R\u0113zekne as a matter of Latvian law?\n\n(ii) Was there any delay in the establishment and adoption of such plan that is attributable to the Municipality?\n\n(iii) If a finding of delay is made, does such delay on the part of the Municipality amount to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT?\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 887 below.\n\n857.\n\nThe Claimant contends in these arbitration proceedings that the establishment and approval of a heat supply development plan for the City of R\u0113zekne was the duty of the Municipality, whereas the Respondent submits that such duty was delegated by the Municipality to Latgales Ener\u0123ija.\n\n858.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it was the duty of the Municipality to prepare and approve a heat supply development plan for the City of R\u0113zekne; Latgales Ener\u0123ija had a duty to cooperate and provide the information required, as contemplated by the February 2006 Agreement, in order that the heat supply development plan be complete.\n\n859.\n\nThe regulatory context consists of the following enactments: the Energy Act,1315 the Municipalities Act,1316 the Public Utility Regulators Act1317 and the Methodology for Calculation of Tariffs for Public Utilities in the Fields Regulated by Local Municipalities1318 enacted pursuant to the Public Utility Regulators Act. The Public Administration Act1319 contains provisions relevant to the issue of delegation. The provisions of these enactments relevant for present purposes are as follows:\n\n(i) Section 51 of the Energy Act,1320 as it was in force when the Long-Term Agreement and the February 2005 Agreements were made, provided that the Municipality had to determine the development of heating supply.1321 The Respondent has not contested the application of this particular provision. Neither Party has contended that the change in the subsequent versions of Section 51(2) of the Act from the expression \"Local governments (...) determine (...)\" to the expression \"Local governments (...) may determine (...)\" has any particular consequences in the present case.1322\n\n(ii) Section 14(2)(1) of the Municipalities Act1323 provides that in order to perform their functions, local governments have \"the duty\" to prepare a development programme for the territory of the relevant local government and to ensure the implementation of the territorial development plan. Section 15(1) further specifies the functions of local governments, the first item of which is \"to organise for residents the provision of utilities (water supply and sewerage; supply of heat (...)) irrespective of the ownership of the private property\".\n\n(iii) Section 16(6) of the Public Utility Regulators Act1324 provides that the \"Municipal regulator, issuing the licence to the public service provider shall take into account the development plans for the administrative territory of relevant municipality in the context of the development of regulated sectors as well as the regulations of the municipality\".\n\n(iv) The Methodology1325 deals with the the calculation of the thermal energy tariffs (Clauses 3 ff). Clause 17 provides that the forecasted thermal energy consumption balance shall be drawn up \"in accordance with the heat supply system development plan (concept) of the corresponding local government\". Clause 23.3 provides that \"[e]fficiency changes in the boiler room (Dhk.) are determined based on the investments used for this purpose in accordance with the approved heat supply system development plan of the corresponding local government\". Clause 27 refers to the same plan in relation to the necessary investment.\n\nCLA-48. see paragraph 38 above.\n\nCLA-46. see paragraph 38 above.\n\nCLA-49. see paragraph 38 above.\n\nC-35.\n\nCLA-52. see paragraph 38 above.\n\nCLA-48. see paragraph 38 above. The provisions of the Energy Act relevant for present purposes cover the licensing of energy supply merchants (Sections 5 ff.). the natural gas supply sytem (Sections 41 ff.), the heating supply system (Sections 46 ff), increase of energy efficiency (Sections 53 ff.) and energy crisis (Sections 59 ff.).\n\nSection 51 of the Energy Act reads as follows:  \n (1) Local governments, when performing their permanent functions as prescribed by law, shall organise heating supply in the administrative territory thereof, as well as promote competition in the heating supply and fuel market.  \n (2) Local governments, within the scope of the development plan of their administrative territory, determine the development of heating supply and coordinate it with regulator taking into account the provisions of the environmental protection and the protection of cultural monuments, as well as the possibilities to use local energy resources and evaluating the safety of heating supply and long-term marginal costs.\n\nCLA-48 p. 22.\n\nCLA-46.\n\nCLA-49.\n\nC-35.\n\n860.\n\nThe licences granted to Latgales Ener\u0123ija and the contracts signed by the Municipality and its wholly-owned companies with Latgales Ener\u0123ija mention more than one type of development plan.\n\n(i) The licences mention \"the development plan of the City of R\u0113zekne\" in Clause 1 (see paragraph 132 above); then in Clause 7.1 they mention \"the long-term development plan of SIA \"Latgales Ener\u0123ija\"\" (see paragraph 133 above). These provisions point to the existence of two different plans, one issued by the Municipality for the City of R\u0113zekne, another by the operator.\n\nThe clear language of the licences shows that one is therefore dealing with two distinct concepts of a long-term development plan. The Parties\u2019 submissions have not taken that distinction into account until after the Hearing.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 decision revoking the licences refers to Clause 7 of the licences and states that the long-term development plan mentioned therein is \"the company\u2019s long-term development plan\".1326 This is clearly a plan other than \"the development plan of the City of R\u0113zekne\" mentioned in Clause 1 of the licences.\n\n(ii) The February 2005 Agreement contains no mention of any development plan of any kind. The February 2006 Agreement contains an express term in Clause 1.2 (see the verbatim quotation in paragraph 171 footnote 163 above). Under this provision it was the Council\u2019s duty \"to coordinate and approve the guidelines for development of heating supply system of the city of R\u0113zekne prepared by the operator and the Council\".\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that despite the use of the word \"guidelines\" this expression refers to the heat supply development plan for the City contemplated by the provisions mentioned above of the Public Utility Regulators Act and the Methodology.\n\nC-29 [page 6], \u00b6 9.\n\n861.\n\nThere is no doubt that it was the responsibility of the R\u0113zekne City Council to prepare a development plan for the City of R\u0113zekne. When the Long-Term Agreement and the February 2005 Agreement were entered into by Latgales Ener\u0123ija, no such plan was in existence and the R\u0113zekne City Council had therefore a general duty to act, as confirmed by the Regulator\u2019s letter of 12 October 2005 to the R\u0113zekne City Council enquiring into whether there was \"an effective and coordinated development plan of the city heating supply containing planned and already made investments of \u2018Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019 Ltd. in development and improvement of the city heating supply\".1327\n\nC-69.\n\n862.\n\nThe Claimant would have been entitled to make its decision to invest in R\u0113zekne conditional upon the adoption of such a plan, but it did not. The failure to do so is a risk undertaken by the Claimant, as pointed out by the Respondent.\n\n863.\n\nHowever, the position fundamentally changed in 2006 when the Municipality and Latgales Ener\u0123ija executed the February 2006 Agreement.1328 Under Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement (see the verbatim quotation in paragraph 171 footnote 163 above) the R\u0113zekne City Council undertook a duty to coordinate and approve such plan and Latgales Ener\u0123ija undertook to cooperate in good faith with the Council because Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement must be read against the background of the general principle of Latvian law whereby contracts are to be performed in good faith.1329\n\nC-17.\n\nLatvian Civil Code, CLA-55, Art. 1. This provision deals with good faith in general and reads as follows:  \n Rights shall be exercised and duties performed in good faith.\n\n864.\n\nIt is in dispute between the Parties whether the main duty to provide a heat development plan for the City of R\u0113zekne lay on the City Council or Latgales Ener\u0123ija; the Respondent has contended at the Hearing that such a duty had been delegated to Latgales Ener\u0123ija in accordance with Section 15(3) of the Municipalities Act1330 and Section 40 and Section 41 of the Public Administration Act1331.1332\n\nCLA-46. see paragraph 38 above. Sect. 15(3) reads as follows:  \n The local government may delegate the tasks arising from each autonomous function of the administration to a private individual or another public person. Procedures for, types and restrictions of the delegation of the administration tasks shall be determined by State Administration Structure Law *[i.e.* the Public Administration Act].\n\nCLA-52, see paragraph 38 above. Sects. 40 and 41 of the Public Administration Act read as follows:  \n Section 40. Basic Provisions for Delegation  \n (1) A public person may delegate a private individual and another public person (hereinafter - authorised person) such tasks that include administrative decision making. Such delegation is authorised only if the authorised person can perform the relevant task more effectively.  \n(2) An administration task may be delegated to a private individual by an external regulatory' enactment or by an external regulatory' enactment or contract made by public person.  \n (3) Administration tasks may be delegated to another public person in cases laid down in law. In such case, the provisions of this Chapter shall be applied, insofar as the special legal norms of other laws do not lay down otherwise.  \n Section 41. Subject-matter of Delegation  \n (1) A public person may delegate administration tasks, the performance of which is in the competence of such public person or its institution. When delegating administration tasks, the relevant public person shall be responsible for the performance of the function as a whole.  \n (2) The following administration tasks may not be delegated:  \n 1) sectoral policy-making and development planning;  \n 2) co-ordination of the activities of the sector;  \n 3) supervision of institutions and administrative officials;  \n4) approval of the budget of public persons, distribution of financial resources at the level of programmes and sub-programmes, and control of financial resources.  \n (3) In addition to that referred to in Paragraph two of this Section the following may not be delegated to a private individual:  \n 1) issuance of administrative acts, except cases when it is provided for in an external regulatory' enactment;  \n 2) administration tasks related to the performance of the functions of the external and internal security of the State, except cases when it is provided for in law;  \n 3) other administration tasks, which by their nature may be performed only by State institutions.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Argument. Slides 13-14.\n\n865.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the R\u0113zekne City Council did not delegate the task to prepare, coordinate, let alone approve, the heat supply development plan for the City of R\u0113zekne to Latgales Ener\u0123ija.\n\n866.\n\nFirst, the Respondent has failed to show that the requirements of Section 40 and Section 41 of the Public Administration Act were met, and that there was any enactment or contract that provided for such delegation. Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement (quoted in paragraph 171 footnote 163 above) did not delegate this task to Latgales Ener\u0123ija. Neither did the licences, since all licences expressly refer to \"the development plan of the City of R\u0113zekne\" in Clause 1 (see paragraph 132 above) and then refer to a different document to be prepared by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in Clause 7.1 (see the verbatim quotation in paragraph 133 above), as a comparison between Clause 1 and Clause 7.1 shows.\n\n867.\n\nSecondly, the conduct of the R\u0113zekne City Council from 2006 onwards can be consistent only with the proposition that the Council had not delegated to Latgales Ener\u0123ija the task to prepare the heat supply development plan for the City; had there been such a delegation in place, the Council would not have seen the need for a number of the actions that it took.\n\nWhen Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 15 November 2006 sent the Council its 44-page draft1333 as a contribution to the preparation of the heat supply development plan, this text contained a sentence suggesting that the performance of certain Municipality functions had been delegated to Latgales Ener\u0123ija;1334 the Council reacted to the point, denying that it had ever transferred any heat supply functions to Latgales Ener\u0123ija.1335\n\nThen some six months later the R\u0113zekne City Council set up a Working Group to produce the heat supply development plan for the City.1336 It is relevant in this context that the Working Group was set up by a formal decision of the R\u0113zekne City Council and was presided over by Mr. Ivars Locis, the Council\u2019s Deputy Executive Director.1337\n\nIt is finally also relevant that the heat supply development plan for the City was formally adopted by a decision of the R\u0113zekne City Council on 21 September 2007.1338\n\nR-31.\n\nR-31 [page 5]: \"Considering that based on the agreement regarding lease of the local government heat supply systems entered into with the R\u0113zekne City Council and the reference included therein regarding the duty of LLC Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide for heat supply to the objects connected to the centralised heat supply system of the city according to the agreement and the requirements of legal acts, the company has taken over from the City Council the duties specified in Section 15 of the Law on Local Governments [The Municipalities Act], i.e. ensuring provision of utilities or, more particularly, heat supply. In connection with this LLC Latgales Ener\u0123ija is performing its activities and thereby also planning and development [sic] of centralised heat supply in R\u0113zekne City\".\n\nC-106 : \"The submitted document does not meet the provisions of the applicable legislation and does not correspond to the actual state of heat supply in the city of R\u0113zekne, as follows: 1. (...); 2. (...) 3. The claim that the R\u0113zekne City' Council has transferred heat supply functions to Latgales energija SIA does not correspond to the legal or the actual situation; 4. (...)\".\n\nIn its letter dated 9 July 2007 the City Council described the respective contribution of the Municipality and the operator as follows: \"R\u0113zekne City Council (...) has set up a work group for formulation of the city development strategy, where it would be necessary to include the chapter of the strategy on heating supply system prepared by the Operator. For the purposes of more successful and efficient cooperation and to help the Operator to prepare its chapter of the strategy, the representatives of the Operator are being invited to the meetings of the said work group\" (C-128 [page 8]).\n\nR-30 [page 1].\n\nC-137.\n\n868.\n\nHaving determined that the R\u0113zekne City Council was in charge of preparing, coordinating and approving the heat supply development plan for the City, and in fact carried out such responsibilities, and that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had a contractual obligation to cooperate in good faith with the Council in order to reach that objective, the Tribunal turns to the question whether there was any delay on the part of the Municipality, taking into account, amongst other things, the manner in which Latgales Ener\u0123ija cooperated with the Municipality.\n\n869.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s analysis will focus on the period from 20 January 2006, when Latgales Ener\u0123ija sent its first draft to the R\u0113zekne City Council, until 21 September 2007, the date when the heat supply development plan for the City was finally approved by the R\u0113zekne City Council. It took twenty months in order for the heat supply development plan for the City to be made. Considering that the February 2006 Agreement made on 10 February 2006 provided in its Clause 1.2 that the plan would have to be approved by 28 February 2006, something clearly went wrong.\n\n870.\n\nOn 20 January 2006 Latgales Ener\u0123ija sent the R\u0113zekne City Council its draft \"Guidelines for the development of the R\u0113zekne City heat supply system\"1339 (see paragraph 164 above). The Council in fact received this draft,1340 but did not acknowledge receipt of it to Latgales Ener\u0123ija; so Latgales Ener\u0123ija sent the Council two reminders on 10 May 2006 and 19 October 2006;1341 no answer by the Council is in evidence to either reminder.\n\nThe R\u0113zekne City Council studied Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s 44-page draft: Ms. Abramova, Deputy Chair of the City Council, first wrote to the Mayor on 27 January 2006 suggesting that the draft Guidelines received from Latgales Ener\u0123ija should undergo wider consultation;1342 the Mayor\u2019s answer to this formal communication (if any) is not in evidence. Then on 19 May 2006 the Chairman of R\u0113zekne City Task Force for the Supervision of Heat Energy Affairs Mr. Zeile wrote to the Mayor stating *inter alia* that whereas \"in principle\" the guidelines proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija \"are correct (...), they must be supported by figures and justified\".1343 In this communication Mr. Zeile set out five proposals, including the need for a feasibility study on the heat supply options for the City, and he concluded that it would be necessary to develop a short-term and a long-term concept of heat supply for the City. Apart from the comment that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s proposal must be supported by figures, the Chairman of the Task Force expressed no criticism as to Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s draft Guidelines in its communication to the Mayor. There is no evidence that Mr. Zeile\u2019s comments to the Mayor were in any way relayed to Latgales Ener\u0123ija or that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was contacted by the R\u0113zekne City Council in May 2006 or afterwards, before November 2006.\n\nC-44.\n\nR-25 [page 1],\n\nC-91; C-96.\n\nR-25 [page 1].\n\nR-25 [pages 2-3].\n\n871.\n\nClause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement contemplated the approval by the Municipality of the heat supply development plan of the City by 28 February 2006. It is common ground that no plan was discussed and approved by 28 February 2006.\n\n872.\n\nThere is no evidence on the record that the R\u0113zekne City Council promptly informed Latgales Ener\u0123ija that the draft Guidelines submitted by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in January 2006 were not a sufficient basis in order for work to start on the part of the Municipality. The Mayor was not called by the Respondent to give evidence as a witness; neither were Ms. Adamova or Mr. Zeile for that matter.\n\n873.\n\nThe Council did not contact Latgales Ener\u0123ija with respect to the heat supply development plan for the City until after Latgales Ener\u0123ija had written to the Council on 19 October 2006.1344 In this letter Latgales Ener\u0123ija relied on Clause 5 of the February 2006 Agreement (quoted in paragraph 174 above footnote 164) and indicated that, unless the heat supply development plan for the City was adopted within two months, Latgales Ener\u0123ija would deduct the whole amount corresponding to the reduction on the tariffs that it had granted pursuant to the February 2006 Agreement from the rent owed to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli. This letter followed, and was probably prompted by, the Regulator\u2019s decision of 13 October 2006 by which the Regulator had refused to accept the new tariff proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija since one of the reasons for that decision was, in substance, that there was no heat supply development plan in place in the City of R\u0113zekne.1345\n\nC-96 ; the 10 May 2006 reminder was not answered.\n\nC-19, see also paragraph 184 above and paragraph 901 below.\n\n874.\n\nThe R\u0113zekne City Council started to criticise Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s conduct of early 2006 with respect to the heat supply development plan almost two years after receiving the draft Guidelines in January 2006. Thus, in a letter of 15 November 2007 to the Ministry for Regional Development and Local Government Affairs the Council stated that it had no document to approve by 28 February 20061346 and that Latgales Ener\u0123ija sent its first drafts to the Council only on 15 November 2006.1347 However, the Council\u2019s explanations to the Ministry were factually inaccurate in that they failed to mention that the Council had received Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s first draft Guidelines on 20 January 2006.\n\nThe same inaccuracy is contained in R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s letter to Latgales Ener\u0123ija dated 10 December 2007.1348\n\nR-28 [page 4],\n\nR-28 [page 21.\n\nR-29 [page 18].\n\n875.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that by 20 January 2006 the City Council had received draft Guidelines by Latgales Ener\u0123ija on which it was possible to work, as confirmed both by Ms. Adamova and Mr. Zeile to the Mayor of R\u0113zekne, which conclusion is further supported by the fact that the R\u0113zekne City Council and Latgales Ener\u0123ija agreed on 10 February 2006 (Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement) that the heat supply development plan for the City would be approved by the Council by 28 February 2006.\n\n876.\n\nAs the heat supply development plan for the City was not approved by 28 February 2006, Latgales Ener\u0123ija did not immediately complain to the Municipality.\n\n877.\n\nOn 10 May 2006 Latgales Ener\u0123ija wrote to the R\u0113zekne City Council seeking comments on its 20 January 2006 draft Guidelines. No answer by the Council is in evidence. On 19 May 2006 Mr. Zeile wrote to the Mayor about Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s draft Guidelines and gave his own proposals. No answer by the Mayor is in evidence. Then the first communication in which Latgales Ener\u0123ija complained of a breach of the February 2006 Agreement by the Municipality is dated 19 October 2006,1349 followed by further letters.1350\n\nC-96.\n\nC-121.\n\n878.\n\nOn 3 November 2006 the Mayor requested Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide the Council with \"the heat supply development plan for the 2006-2009 period\"; the letter specifically mentioned important points which had to be specified in such plan, but omitted any reference to the draft Guidelines received in January 2006.1351\n\nC-97.\n\n879.\n\nOn 15 November 2006 Latgales Ener\u0123ija sent the Council two drafts: a one-page draft for the period 2006-20091352 and a 22-page draft for the period 2006-2014.1353\n\nC-99.\n\nR-31,2.\n\n880.\n\nOn 29 December 2006 the R\u0113zekne City Council criticised the drafts received from Latgales Ener\u0123ija in a one-page letter setting out eight comments.1354 The letter mentioned the existence of a working group that had met to review Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s drafts of 15 November 2006.\n\nC-106; see paragraph 190 above.\n\n881.\n\nIn 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council decided to constitute the Working Group and the implementation of that decision took five months: announced on 29 December 2006,1355 then again on 19 February 2007,1356 the Working Group was in fact constituted only on 11 May 20071357 despite the fact that its president and a significant number of other members were members of the City Council (see paragraph 213 above).\n\nC-106.\n\nC-114.\n\nR-30.1.\n\n882.\n\nOn 30 May 2007 the Regulator requested Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide \"information regarding the approved R\u0113zekne City heat supply development plan\" by 8 June 2007.1358 The Regulator, which had sent its previous enquiry to the R\u0113zekne City Council in 2005,1359 did not explain the reasons for which it now addressed its request to Latgales Ener\u0123ija. On 6 June 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija replied asking the Regulator to turn to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of the Municipality Act and the Energy Act.1360\n\nC-122.\n\nC-69. see paragraph 150 above.\n\nC-123.\n\n883.\n\nThe first meeting of the Working Group took place on 14 May 2007.1361 After the Working Group was constituted, it met at regular intervals from May to September 2007; Mr. Ivars Paurs was called in as an expert at the end of July 2007. The heat supply development plan for the City was finalised in less than five months.\n\nR-30.1.\n\n884.\n\nIn this period, the R\u0113zekne City Council had repeatedly to request information from Latgales Ener\u0123ija. The discussion between the parties was complicated by the dispute relating to whose primary responsibility it was to produce a heat supply development plan for the City. In addition, Latgales Ener\u0123ija complained that its repair and investment proposals had not been answered by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli.\n\n885.\n\nAside from these aspects, the finalisation of the heat supply development plan for the City was delayed to an extent also by Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s apparent reluctance to provide the Working Group with all the information required, as shown by the repeated requests which the R\u0113zekne City Council had to send to Latgales Ener\u0123ija.1362 However, the Respondent has not provided concrete evidence in these proceedings as to the delay caused by Latgales Ener\u0123ija.\n\nSee C-124 of 12 June 2007 [mentioning prior repeated requests without any precise indication],   \nC-128 [pages 7 ff.] of 9 July 2007, to which a 19-page document was attached which is not in evidence. This letter complains in strong terms that Latgales Ener\u0123ija is reluctant to provide information and refers to the minutes of the Working Group in general terms. The Working Group concluded in fact on 31 July 2007 at a meeting not attended by Latgales Ener\u0123ija that the information requested from the operator had not been provided (R-30 [page 29]), a point disputed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s representative at the 8 August 2007 meeting (R-30 [page 32]).  \nC-128 [page 15] of 19 July 2007, requesting Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide the missing information by 24 July 2007.  \nC-128 [page 15] mentions the following:  \n (i) the planned investments in developing the city\u2019s heat supply system infrastructure (heating pipelines, boiler houses, scope of reconstruction, energy efficiency measures), updated information as of July 2007;  \n(ii) the time schedule relating to the planned investments and repair and overhaul of the heat supply system;  \n (iii) the planned sources of financing for the necessary investments (own funds, credit); and  \n (iv) information as to how the planned investment will affect energy efficiency measures, thermal energy production and supply tariff.  \nC-128 [page 31] of 31 July 2007 requesting Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide information still outstanding. C-128 [page 31] requests the following:  \n (i) updated capacities of boiler houses;  \n (ii) heat loads: by district, in winter and summer;  \n (iii) the potential for developing heat loads:  \n (iv) suggestions for the centralised heat supply zone (CHS), requirements for consumers in such zone;  \n (v) the load on networks (how many MWlt/km? should such networks be retained?); and  \n (vi) how suited the existing diameters of the existing piping to consumer load were.  \n Latgales Ener\u0123ija was also asked to describe the self-cost of thermal energy generation and provide information as to current tariffs and actual costs as well as measures to reduce self-costs.\n\n886.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The better part of the year 2006 and almost half of 2007 were characterised by the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s inaction and delay with respect to the establishment of the heat supply development plan for the City. As from 13 October 2006, when the Regulator refused to approve a tariff proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija relying *inter alia* on the absence of an approved heat supply development plan for the City, it became clear that the Municipality\u2019s delay would in fact prevent the Regulator from accepting any new tariff proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija until such a plan had been approved.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s contention that Latgales Ener\u0123ija could have relied on \"more general development documents and relied on its own business scenario\" since the Regulator\u2019s decision did not mention that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had failed to do so.\n\nConsidering the position adopted by the Regulator, it must have been clear to the Municipality that, confronted with ever rising prices of natural gas, Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s position would become ever more difficult. Yet the Municipality\u2019s inaction continued and further significant delay accrued. Any delay as may have been caused by Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure promptly to provide the Working Group with all the information required is insignificant by comparison to the delay caused by R\u0113zekne City Council.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s complaint that Latgales Ener\u0123ija belatedly contacted the R\u0113zekne City Council in May 2006 after sending its proposal in January 2006 is devoid of any foundation; upon receipt of such proposal, it was a matter for the Council to react and contact Latgales Ener\u0123ija, which the Council failed to do.\n\n887.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Council\u2019s conduct, in the circumstances recalled above, appears to be founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact, *i.e.* it was arbitrary and falls short of the duties further outlined in paragraphs 841 ff. above with respect to Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n(iii) *The Claim Based on the Municipality's Refusal to Consent to Investments into the Heating System*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n888.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the Municipality breached its expectations that it would comply with requests to provide consent for the making of investments into the heating system and that Latgales Ener\u0123ija could modernise and improve the system; that the Municipality\u2019s refusal to provide consent to investments (including as to cogeneration) was an act of harassment, and that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was thereby unable to invest the full amount of EUR 1.5 million into the heating system in the first three years of the lease. The Respondent opposed this claim in contemporaneous correspondence, denying that the investments to be made by Latgales Ener\u0123ija were sufficient.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 898 below.\n\n889.\n\nThis complaint includes two points: *(i)* the Municipality\u2019s refusal to consent to investments to be made by Latgales Ener\u0123ija to the Assets, and *(ii)* the Claimant\u2019s failure to comply with the minimum investment required in the first three-year period of the lease in accordance with Clause 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement (see paragraph 92 above).\n\n890.\n\nThe Claimant has filed three documents in support of this claim: Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s letter to the Mayor of R\u0113zekne dated 6 March 2007,1363 Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s letter to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli dated 18 April 20071364 and Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s letter to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli dated 13 July 20071365 as well as Mr. Strioga\u2019s first Witness Statement.1366\n\nThe first letter refers to repair or investment proposals allegedly made by Latgales Ener\u0123ija and it points out that the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s failure to answer will result in the investment made by Latgales Ener\u0123ija to fall short of the minimum amount contractually agreed of EUR 1.5 million.\n\nThe second letter restates the content of the first letter without reference to the amount of EUR 1.5 million; in addition, it mentions R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s failure to grant permission for the installation of cogeneration equipment as well as new boilers at R\u012bgas iela and Atbr\u012bvo\u0161anas alej\u0101 155a.\n\nThe third letter refers to four previous letters by Latgales Ener\u0123ija to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli or the R\u0113zekne City Council that have allegedly remained unanswered; none of those letters is in evidence. One of such letters is said to have requested permission for the installation of the cogeneration facility and two 30 MW water boilers.\n\nC-116.\n\nC-118.\n\nC-129.\n\nCWS-1 \u00b6\u00b6 14: 60-64.\n\n891.\n\nAlmost one year later, on 15 May 2008 R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli wrote to the R\u0113zekne City Council and the Regulator pointing out that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had failed to invest the minimum amount of EUR 1.5 million in the first three years of operation in breach of Clause 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement.1367 Five days later the R\u0113zekne City Council made the same point, amongst other things, in a letter to Latgales Ener\u0123ija.1368 In its answer dated 2 June 2008 Latgales Ener\u0123ija restated *inter alia* that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had withheld its consent to the building of the cogeneration station.1369\n\nC-231.\n\nC-178.\n\nC-179 [page 2],\n\n892.\n\nThe burden of proof is on the Claimant as to *(i)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s alleged proposals for repairs to and investments into the heating system, *(ii)* the alleged refusal by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and the R\u0113zekne City Council to approve Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s proposals and *(iii)* the reason(s) for which R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s and/or the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s approval was required. The Respondent has not answered this claim.\n\n893.\n\nThe Tribunal has already noted that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s proposals are not in evidence (see paragraph 209 above); Mr. Strioga\u2019s evidence fails to provide details as to the proposed investments, apart from cogeneration which is specifically mentioned.\n\n894.\n\nCogeneration has been dealt with in a patchy manner in the pleadings. One must first determine whether cogeneration was part of the R\u0113zekne Project or was simply a possible option. Clause 2.10 of the February 2005 Agreement (quoted in paragraph 103 above) provides that the Municipality will not get involved in the installation of cogeneration stations with third parties. Clause 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement does mention cogeneration,1370 but it does so by reference to the Gas Supply Agreement.\n\nIn its first comprehensive memorial of 6 December 2013 the Claimant contended that cogeneration had been an important part of the investment ever since the beginning1371 and it referred to the \"cogeneration project\",1372 but it also stated that cogeneration was simply a \"possibility\" according to the Gas Supply Agreement.1373 In its Reply the Claimant then contended that \"the Municipality\u2019s requirement for cogeneration was contractually recognised in the Long Term Agreement\".1374\n\nArt. 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement (C-4) reads as follows:  \n The Operator within three years as of the Agreement entering into force undertakes to invest into the Heat supply facilities either in the Assets or new assets in the amount not less than EUR 1,500,000 (one million and five hundred thousand Emos) in order to background obligations against AS \"Latvijas G\u0101ze\" assumed by the Lessor concerning gasification and cogeneration according to an agreement no. 1580 dated 23 April 2004.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 83.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 85.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 20.\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6 116(5).\n\n895.\n\nThe witness evidence and the scant documentary evidence on cogeneration does not justify the conclusion that the Muncipality was under an obligation to Latgales Ener\u0123ija to adopt a cogeneration project.\n\nMr. Strioga\u2019s evidence on cogeneration is to the effect that all permissions required were received.1375 However, only Latvenergo\u2019s statement is in evidence, and it is dated 22 February 2006;1376 Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s proposal (if any) is not in evidence. The Tribunal further notes that Mr. Jautakis refers more generally to a \"plan\" in his first Witness Statement.1377\n\nCogeneration was a much-discussed item within the Working Group for the preparation of the heat supply development plan for the City, and the final plan of 21 September 2007 expressly mentions cogeneration.1378\n\nThe plan for the City was issued in the middle of the energy crisis at a time when the investor and the Municipality\u2019s differences had grown into a full-blown dispute. Whereas the Claimant complains of a lack of approval on the part of the Municipality of offers allegedly made, the Municipality in turn complained of a lack of information as to planned investments on the part of Latgales Ener\u0123ija.1379\n\nTranscript. Day 2. 12/13-19.\n\nC-87.\n\nCWS-2 \u00b6 79.\n\nC-213 p. 22.\n\nC-128 [page 15].\n\n896.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to prove that the Muncipality was under an obligation to Latgales Ener\u0123ija to realise a cogeneration project. It follows that until and unless a specific project had been agreed upon by the Municipality and Latgales Ener\u0123ija, Latgales Ener\u0123ija had no right to carry out a cogeneration project. In the circumstances that have been recalled, the Tribunal cannot conclude in the absence of sufficient documentary evidence that the Claimant\u2019s alleged offers were offers proper which called for a decision on the part of the Municipality, rather than \"a plan\", as stated by Mr. Jautakis in his evidence. Such offers, if final and sufficiently detailed, would have been contained in documents, especially insofar as investments were concerned.\n\n897.\n\nThe Tribunal further finds that the Claimant\u2019s reminders in Exhibits C-116, C-118 and C-129 are insufficient to prove Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s alleged proposals as to repairs and investments.\n\n898.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to prove its claim that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and/or the R\u0113zekne City Council dismissed or failed to answer Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s proposals for repairs and investment, including as to cogeneration, and dismisses such claim.\n\nAs to the Claimant\u2019s claim that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and/or the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s alleged refusal caused Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to comply with the minimum investment required under Clause 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement, such point is relevant only in the context of the revocation of the licences by the Regulator; the Tribunal will examine such point in that context (see paragraphs 1021 ff. below).\n\n(iv) *The Claims Based on the Regulator\u2019s Repeated Refusals to Set a new Tariff*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n899.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s decisions as to the tariff relevant for the purposes of this Award are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Date | Exh. | \u00b6in this Award | Summary | Corut decisions |\n| Date | Exit. | \u00b6in this Award | Summary |\n| 19.12.05 | C-14 C-15 C-82 | 154 | Decision No. 19 new tariff: LVL 27.60/29.02/MWh1380 |  |\n| 13.10.06 | C-19 R-35 | 184 | Decision No. 17 *denying* the application for a new tariff | No decision made on the challenge, see \u00b6 186 above |\n| 11.06.07 | C-21 |  | Decision No. 12 *denying* the application for a new tariff | 15.04.09 | C-192 | 392 | Application to set aside *dismissed* |\n| 24.09.09 | R-l | 395 | Application for a fresh time limit to be set for a final appeal *denied* |\n| 09.11.07 | C-27 | 239 | Decision No. 28 new tariff: LVL 33.90 to LVL 42.40/MWh1381 |  |\n| 07.12.07 | C-28 | 240 | Decision No. 35 *revoking* Decision No. 28 of 09.11.07 | 30.10.09 | *Not in evidence* | 243, 400 | Application to set aside *dismissed* |\n| 23.09.10 | R-4 | 401 | Appeal *dismissed* |\n\nThe lower tariff is for residents, the other for other users.\n\nThis is a uniform tariff for all users, the values indicated in this table are the lowest and the highest rate.\n\n900.\n\nThe Claimant complains that its expectations were breached by the Respondent in that *(i)* the Regulator, having reversed its previous practice, refused to set new tariffs relying on the absence of a Development Plan, and that *(ii)* the Regulator revoked on 7 December 2007 the tariff approved on 9 November 2007 in non-transparent conditions and wrongly, as a result of the Municipality\u2019s interference; the 7 December 2007 decision was arbitrary and discriminatory; more generally, the Respondent breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment due to the Regulator\u2019s arbitrary and discriminatory refusal to calculate a new tariff where a new tariff was critical due to factors outside the operator\u2019s control, especially in light of the increase in the price of natural gas. The Respondent denies that the Municipality interfered with the Regulator and contends that the Regulator acted independently within the scope of its duties and prerogatives; in the period from 2005 to 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija applied four times for a new tariff and the Regulator issued a new tariff in 2005.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s findings are set out in paragraphs 903, 911,918 and 922 below.\n\n901.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s Decision of 13 October 2006, The Regulator\u2019s decision of 13 October 2006 refusing the tariff proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija rested on two grounds: *(i)* the rates proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija did not show changes in boiler house efficiency in line with investments and the plan of heating supply development approved by the Municipality and *(ii)* the proposed rates were not based on costs fully substantiated *(e.g.* the salaries to be paid by Latgales Ener\u0123ija) as required by Section 19 of the Public Utility Regulators Act.1382 The Claimant\u2019s complaints relate only to the first reason given by the Regulator; the Claimant has not contested the second reason on which the Regulator\u2019s decision is based.\n\nCLA-49. see paragraph 38 above.\n\n902.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Regulator\u2019s refusal to approve a new tariff was therefore stated to be due also to Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to substantiate its own costs. In such circumstances, the Regulator was entitled to refuse to approve the tariff proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija on that ground alone. The decision was based on principles of law, the most fundamental of which was the principle whereby the Regulator must ensure that the new rates proposed by an operator must be based on costs that have been duly substantiated. This is far from an outlandish concern as it is the Regulator\u2019s duty to protect end-users.\n\n903.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the Regulator\u2019s decision of 13 October 2006 cannot therefore be characterised as arbitrary or as frustrating the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations since the investor was under a duty to provide the required information to the Regulator in accordance with Latvian law and failed to do so.\n\n904.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s Decision of 11 June 2007. The Regulator\u2019s decision of 11 June 2007 refusing the tariff proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija is based on the following grounds: *(i)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija failed to provide an accurate calculation of the fuel costs in accordance with Clause 23(1) of the Methodology in two respects: *first,* the balance sheet of the predictable thermal energy consumption must be prepared in accordance with the heat supply development plan approved by the Municipality (Section 17 of the Methodology) and no such plan existed in the City of R\u0113zekne; such plan was necessary to determine expected changes in house boiler efficiency (the \"Dhk\" coefficient) and such coefficient had not been included in Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s calculation; *secondly,* two further coefficients (the boiler house net efficiency index \"hnetokom\" and the index of expected changes of heating network \"Dhst.\") had not been included by Latgales Ener\u0123ija; and *(ii)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija failed to provide the Regulator both with the long-term development plan required by Clause 6.3 of the licences and the prospective one-year plan of operation to be provided every year under Clause 7.1 of the licences (see paragraphs 133 above). In an *obiter* the Regulator added that the development plan had not been approved \"due to the applicant\u2019s fault\".\n\n905.\n\nAs a consequence, the Regulator found that the rates submitted by Latgales Ener\u0123ija failed to comply with the requirements of Clauses 17, 23(1), 23(2), 23(3) and 23(6) of the Methodology (C-35) and Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s proposal must therefore be dismissed *inter alia* under Sections 1, 9(1)(1) and (3), 9(2), 19(1) and (4) of the Public Utility Regulators Act.\n\n906.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s decision was upheld on appeal by the Administrative District Court on 15 April 2009.1383 On the issue of coefficients, the court noted that there was no dispute that three coefficients1384 prescribed by the Methodology were not used by Latgales Ener\u0123ija due to the fact that \"the city of R\u0113zekne [had] not developed and approved [a] heating system development plan\",1385 thereby accepting a point argued by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in its application to set aside,1386 namely that all three coefficients depended on the existence of a development plan. However, the court went on to find that the three coefficients were prescribed by the Methodology; a failure to apply them in the calculation of the tariff meant that a tariff so calculated was inaccurate, and therefore unacceptable, since such tariff would give rise to undue costs for end-users.1387 On Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s complaint that the Regulator\u2019s reversal of its prior practice was unlawful, the court accepted that the Regulator had set a new tariff in 2005 without applying the three coefficients in dispute. However, Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s reliance on the 2005 tariff could be protected only provided that the situation in 2005 and in 2007 was the same. The court found that such was not the case, holding *(i)* that the Regulator had already rejected a tariff proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in 2006 and *(ii)* \"(...) that in 2005 the situation of heat supplies in R\u0113zekne was different and namely, in 2005 a different heat supply operator (the Applicant) has commenced their operations in the city and it was necessary to ensure the heat to the city. Without approval of the tariffs, there was a risk that the city is left without heat supply\".1388\n\nC-192.\n\nDhk, hnetokm and Dhst\n\nC-192 \u00b6 23.7.\n\nC-125.\n\nC-192 \u00b6 23.7.\n\nC-192 p. 209, \u00b6 9.\n\n907.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s 11 June 2007 decision raises two main issues, namely whether the fair and equitable treatment standard is breached by a decision which requires the operator to calculate a proposed new tariff by using coefficients which are not available due to no fault of the operator, and whether the Regulator was bound by its previous practice.\n\n908.\n\nNot without hesitation, the Tribunal concludes that the Regulator\u2019s decision is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory *per se* insofar as it puts end-user protection first and requires compliance with coefficients which would have been available if the heat supply development plan for the City had been approved by the Municipality.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s *dictum* stating that the non-existence of the plan was due to the operator\u2019s fault is nevertheless unwarranted because it was not for the Regulator to express an opinion on a dispute between the R\u0113zekne City Council and Latgales Ener\u0123ija; it is significant that the Administrative District Court did not repeat such statement in its decision.\n\n909.\n\nWhether the reversal of the Regulator\u2019s 2005 practice was lawful is first and foremost a matter of Latvian law. It was examined by the Administrative District Court, which found that the situation in 2007 was not the same as in 2005. The Tribunal considers that the reason given by the court based on the distinction between the situation in 2007 and in 2005 recalled in paragraph 906 above is not compelling; yet the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that it is not for an investment tribunal to second guess the courts of the host State, although this Tribunal has reached this conclusion not without reluctance in the present case as it would seem to be almost self-evident that it was vital to ensure that heating could be provided to the City in 2007 as it was in 2005.\n\n910.\n\nThe Claimant has contended that it relied on the fact that the Regulator would not change its 2005 practice, *i.e.* that the Regulator would continue to consider and accept proposals for a new tariff, if need be, despite the absence of a heat supply development plan for the City. However, the Long-Term Agreement and the February 2005 Agreements were entered into by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in January and February 2005 respectively, and the Regulator\u2019s decision setting a new tariff was made in December 2005. There is no evidence of any specific representations or assurances by the Regulator to the Claimant or Latgales Ener\u0123ija that new tariffs could still be adopted despite the fact that there was no heat supply development plan in place for the City; the Claimant has not discharged its burden of proof in this respect.\n\n911.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Regulator\u2019s 11 June 2007 decision is ultimately based on the Regulator\u2019s duty to protect end-users and it cannot be said to amount to bad faith, wilful disregard of due process of law, to be founded on preference or prejudice rather than reason or fact, or not to bear any reasonable relationship to some rational policy or otherwise to be in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n912.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s Decisions of 9 November and 7 December 2007. The Regulator\u2019s decision of 9 November 2007 set a new tariff upon Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s proposal; in the meantime the Municipality\u2019s heat supply development plan for the City had been adopted on 21 September 2007 (see paragraph 228 above).\n\nOn 7 December 2007 the Regulator revoked its 9 November 2007 decision on the grounds that: *(i)* that it had received a letter by R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija indicating an amount of natural gas planned to be supplied by Latvijas G\u0101ze that was different from the amount indicated by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in its application for a new tariff, *(ii)* that the tariff approved on 9 November 2007 was not calculated in accordance with the actual situation in accordance with Clause 22(1) of the Methodology and *(iii)* that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had \"knowingly submitted (...) false information\" and obtained a new tariff \"by illegal means\", as a consequence of which its conduct was \"unlawful\".\n\nThe 7 December 2007 decision did not set out the applicable tariff further to the revocation of the Regulator\u2019s 9 November 2007 decision.\n\n913.\n\nOn 23 September 2010 the Administrative Regional Court dismissed Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s appeal against the decision of the Administrative Regional Court of 30 October 2009, upholding the Regulator\u2019s decision of 7 December 2007; the 23 September 2010 decision confirms that the reasons stated in the 30 September 2009 decision were sound as a matter of Latvian law.1389 Only the 23 September 2010 decision is in evidence, but the 30 October 2009 decision is summarised therein; both decisions deal with the amount of natural gas that was properly to be taken into consideration for the purposes of the Methodology and the consequences which such amount would have on the price of gas sold by Latvijas G\u0101ze, which are both highly technical matters.\n\nR-4.\n\n914.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija was not heard before the 7 December 2007 decision was made. This decision was not made purely on technical grounds since the Regulator found that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had deliberately submitted information known to be false, to the detriment of the public interest, and that its conduct was therefore unlawful.\n\n915.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the fact that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was accused of such wrongdoing in the decision without being heard amounts to a procedural irregularity, all the more so in a case in which such accusation rested on information unilaterally provided by R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija to the Regulator. However, the Tribunal considers that it is relevant that the Regulator\u2019s 7 December 2007 decision was subject to judicial review before two successive Latvian courts, which upheld the Regulator\u2019s decision, and as to which it is not suggested that there was any denial of justice. The Tribunal considers that the irregularity in the procedure of the Regulator should be weighed alongside the existence of an avenue of appeal and, not without reluctance, the Tribunal finds that such irregularity is not serious enough to give rise to a breach of due process amounting to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n916.\n\nThe Tribunal further dismisses the Claimant\u2019s complaint that the Regulator\u2019s 7 December 2007 decision was arbitrary and/or discriminatory. The issue in dispute went to the question whether the rates proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija for a particular user group were based on an accurate calculation. The Regulator\u2019s decision involved the determination of technical issues under the Methodology as well as the quantity of natural gas that had to be purchased from Latvijas G\u0101ze as it purported to correct a mistake in the 9 November 2007 decision due to the inaccurate quantity of natural gas taken into account by Latgales Ener\u0123ija.\n\n917.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimant has failed to show that the Regulator\u2019s 7 December 2007 decision was based on prejudice or preference rather than reason or fact.\n\n918.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal therefore dismisses the Claimant\u2019s complaints that the Regulator\u2019s decision of 7 December 2007 constitutes a breach of due process, that it is arbitrary and it was made in bad faith, in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n919.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s Alleged Failures to Set a New Tariff Taking into Account the Increase in Electricity and Natural Gas Prices. The Tribunal must finally consider the Claimant\u2019s complaint that the Regulator breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment by refusing to set a new tariff in circumstances in which a new tariff was critical due to factors outside the operator\u2019s control, especially in light of the increase in natural gas and electricity prices.\n\n920.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s 11 June 2007 decision was not arbitrary in itself, as the Tribunal has found in paragraph 911 above. However, as found in paragraph 886 above, the Municipality bears responsibility for the fact that there was no heat supply development plan in place for the City when the Regulator made this decision.\n\n921.\n\nWhen the Public Utility Commission authorised an increase in the price of natural gas on 28 March 2007 (see paragraph 231 above), the price of natural gas had increased by between 55% and 129% from the rate included in the December 2005 tariff calculations according to the Claimant. The Respondent has not specifically challenged these figures.\n\nOwing to the absence of a heat supply development plan for the City, Latgales Ener\u0123ija was effectively deprived of its statutory right to propose a new tariff where the costs of the heat supply had increased by more than 5% for factors beyond its control (Clause 13 of the Methodology). This was actually so regardless of the tariff that Latgales Ener\u0123ija might propose to the Regulator. The situation was all the more unfair to the Claimant because Latgales Ener\u0123ija had in fact consented to decreasing the rates charged to end-users under the February 2006 Agreement in consideration *inter alia* for the Municipality\u2019s undertaking to have the heat supply development plan for the City approved by the end of February 2006 (see paragraphs 173, 177 and 180 above).\n\nHaving said this, the Tribunal has already found in paragraph 886 above that the Municipality\u2019s delayed approval of the heat supply development plan for the City prevented a review of the tariffs by the Regulator. Responsibility for such a state of affairs lies with the Municipality, not the Regulator.\n\n922.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this claim.\n\n(v) *The Claims Based on the Municipality\u2019s and the Regulator\u2019s Conduct in Connection with the Energy Crisis*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n923.\n\nThere are multiple claims made by the Claimant in relation to the Municipality\u2019s and the Regulator\u2019s conduct in connection with the energy crisis of September/October 2007.

The failure by the Municipality to pay the balance of Latvijas G\u0101ze\u2019s invoices to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli prior to mid-September 2007*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n925.\n\nThe Claimant complains of a breach of its legitimate expectations that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would receive natural gas to be able to provide heating services and the Municipality would abide by the contractual arrangements in relation to the supply of such natural gas, and would in particular pay Latvijas G\u0101ze. Relying on different legal theories the Respondent contends that only Latgales Ener\u0123ija had a duty to pay for the natural gas delivered.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 937 below.\n\n926.\n\nThe Claimant rests its legitimate expectations on a combined reading of Clause 2.3 of the Long-Term Agreement1390 and Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement.1391\n\nC-4, quoted in paragraph 80 above.\n\nC-8, quoted in paragraph 104 above, as amended by Clause 6 of Amendment No. 3 to the Gas Supply Agreement (C-81).\n\n927.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement deals only with cases of delay in the completion of the infrastructure for the use of natural gas by Latvijas G\u0101ze and does not avail the Claimant\u2019s case. It is the Respondent\u2019s case that Latgales Ener\u0123ija undertook to pay for the gas for a number of reasons: first, because the Long-Term Agreement is to be characterised as the transfer of a business as a whole as a matter of Latvian law *(Betriebsubergang),* and, secondly, because Latgales Ener\u0123ija tacitly undertook such an obligation to pay.\n\n928.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s argument is based on Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement. Each paragraph of Clause 4 contemplates a specific case. According to the first paragraph, the Municipality shall indemnify Latgales Ener\u0123ija of the losses incurred in case the completion of the natural gas infrastructure by Latvijas G\u0101ze has been delayed due to the fault of the Municipality or a third party and Latgales Ener\u0123ija has therefore had to use heavy fuel oil rather than natural gas. According to the second paragraph, the Municipality shall pay Latvijas G\u0101ze any losses and/or contractual penalties which Latvijas G\u0101ze may claim from *(inter alios)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija based on the Municipality\u2019s obligations undertaken under the Gas Supply Agreement \"on purchase of a specified amount of gas for the needs of the city of R\u0113zekne\".\n\n929.\n\nThe Municipality had undertaken a minimum purchase obligation under Clauses 3.1 ff. of the Gas Supply Agreement,1392 the breach of which was sanctioned by a contractual penalty according to Clause 3.4 of the same agreement.\n\nC-40.\n\n930.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the reference by Clause 4, second paragraph, of the 2005 February Agreement to the \"purchase of a specified amount of gas\" is to be read against the background of the take-or-pay obligations undertaken by the Municipality under the Gas Supply Agreement with Latvijas G\u0101ze. It follows that the interpretation and construction of Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement advanced by the Claimant is inconsistent with a plain reading of the express terms of the provision under consideration.\n\n931.\n\nWhether the second paragraph of Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement is capable of applying each year, or is related to the first year of operation in which a delay has occurred with respect to the date of completion of the natural gas infrastructure, as contended by the Respondent, is irrelevant for present purposes. The Tribunal finds that what is relevant is the absence of an express term in the February 2005 Agreement to the effect that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would have no duty to pay for the natural gas used on the basis that such duty was solely on the Municipality.\n\n932.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was bound to pay for the gas on the basis that the Long-Term Agreement is to be characterised as a contract making provision for a transfer of business as a whole *(Betriebs\u00fcbergang).*\n\n933.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that such argument is unsound because it is contradicted by the negotiations between the Parties and the express terms of the Long-Term Agreement. The Long-Term Agreement is stated to be a contract between a lessor (R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli) and an operator (Latgales Ener\u0123ija) relating to certain assets (as defined in Clause 1.1(a)) of the same agreement). Moreover, the Claimant\u2019s PowerPoint presentation of 25 November 2004 made an express distinction between a \"lease of RS property\" and \"lease of RS itself (Tease of business\u2019)\".1393 The Long-Term Agreement was made as a lease of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s assets and the legal concept of a *Betriebs\u00fcbergang* prayed in aid by the Respondent, which corresponds to a \"lease of RS itself (Tease of business\u2019)\", is therefore the concept which the parties eventually discarded, as proved by the express terms of the Long-Term Agreement.\n\nC-41 [page 4].\n\n934.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s final argument is based on an alleged tacit agreement by Latgales Ener\u0123ija. When the gas started to be supplied from 7 November 2005 onwards, no contract in writing was made between R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and/or the Municipality on the one hand, and Latgales Ener\u0123ija on the other, despite the fact that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would start to use the natural gas. Even subsequently, when it became clear that Latvijas G\u0101ze had no interest in having a direct contractual relationship with Latgales Ener\u0123ija, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and/or the Municipality and Latgales Ener\u0123ija did not enter into a contract in writing in relation to the natural gas used by Latgales Ener\u0123ija. It is common ground that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli invoiced Latgales Ener\u0123ija on the basis of invoices received from Latvijas G\u0101ze. Latgales Ener\u0123ija paid such invoices directly to Latvijas G\u0101ze until May 2007 without raising any objections as to the tariff underlying Latvijas G\u0101ze\u2019s invoices. These facts are described in Ms. Rogozina\u2019s first Witness Statement1394 on which the Respondent has itself relied;1395 such facts are therefore common ground.\n\nCWS-3 \u00b6\u00b6 31ff.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Argument, Slide 15; see also Cl. Mem. \u00b6 139; Cl. Rep. Tribunal \u00b6 42.\n\n935.\n\nA contract relating to the natural gas used by Latgales Ener\u0123ija, not reduced to writing, has thereby come into being between Latgales Ener\u0123ija and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli, to whose installations the natural gas was supplied by Latvijas G\u0101ze. For the purposes of this Award, which is not concerned with the determination of the respective contractual rights and duties of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli, the R\u0113zekne City Council and Latgales Ener\u0123ija, it is irrelevant whether Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s duty to pay for the natural gas used ultimately arises under an amendment of the Long-Term Agreement, as found by the Latvian courts, or is the term of an independent contract not reduced to writing between R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and Latgales Ener\u0123ija which arose out of a consistent, continuous and uncontested course of dealing.\n\n936.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that neither the Long-Term Agreement nor the February 2005 Agreement contains any terms determining which party is liable for the payment of natural gas as between the Municipality and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli on the one hand, and Latgales Ener\u0123ija on the other. As these are the main contracts pursuant to which the investment was made, it follows that the Claimant could not, at the time of the investment, reasonably expect, based on such contracts, that the Municipality would pay for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas G\u0101ze, considering in particular that *(i)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija would in fact use the gas to provide heating services and *(ii)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija would therefore have to be reasonably expected to pay for the gas used.\n\n937.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Municipality\u2019s failure to pay the balance outstanding for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas G\u0101ze is not, therefore, a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT in itself.\n\n*b. The interview given by the Mayor of the City of R\u0113zekne on 13 September 2007 and the Municipality\u2019s alleged attempts to attract a new investor in the summer of 2007*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n938.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the Municipality breached its expectation that the Council would not actively seek to replace Latgales Ener\u0123ija as the operator, and took steps in anticipation of, or with the deliberate intent to cause, Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s removal. The Claimant further claims that the Municipality\u2019s attempt to attract a new operator in the summer of 2007 is a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraphs 943 and 946 below.\n\n939.\n\nOn 13 September 2007 the Mayor of R\u0113zekne gave an interview to explain the situation two days after Latvijas G\u0101ze had stopped supplying natural gas.1396\n\nC-134, quoted in paragraph 251 above.\n\n940.\n\nThe interview purported to explain the current difficulties and allay the fears of the population.1397 However, in the process, Latgales Ener\u0123ija was vilified in the public eye; it was portrayed as a company that had failed to comply with its obligations whilst benefitting from a contract detrimental to the City\u2019s interests, and a company whose conduct had been improper in its attempted contacts with the Regulator.1398\n\n\"The City Council can easily pay the debt to Latvijas G\u0101ze. The debt amount is small (...) Tomorrow (14 September), six companies that provide heating in Latvia will receive letters (...) and an offer to take up provision of heating in our city (...) much has been done to solve the problem, but it lias not been publicly advertised. For three months. I have been negotiating with several companies persuading them that R\u0113zekne has a future (...) in case of necessity a new company, large, serious and reliable, would appear here\".\n\n\"Everybody knows that the lease agreement with the company Latgales energija is disadvantageous for the City (...) Latgales Ener\u0123ija is thus trying to impose a pressure on the Regulator (...) as of the beginning of operations Latgales Ener\u0123ija did not pay a santims for depreciation (...) [i]n relation to taking over the debt of R\u0113zeknes siltumtikli. Latgales energija did not take it over (...)\".\n\n941.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the interview was misleading in content as it was imbalanced in tone, and the fact that the interview was given in difficult circumstances for the Municipality is no excuse. The overall tone of the interview raises an inference that the Mayor of R\u0113zekne took the view that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was part of the problem.\n\n942.\n\nMoreover, the reference made by the Mayor to a new company ready to appear if need be may raise an inference that the replacement of Latgales Ener\u0123ija was already part of the Municipality\u2019s agenda, a point which the Tribunal will discuss in paragraph 944 below.\n\n943.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. In his interview of 13 September 2007 the Mayor of R\u0113zekne publicly displayed an utter lack of even-handedness towards Latgales Ener\u0123ija. Nevertheless, the Tribunal finds that such event does not reach the threshold of a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n944.\n\nAs to the specific claim that the Municipality attempted to attract a new operator in the summer of 2007, the Tribunal finds that such a claim is not supported by any evidence and must be dismissed.\n\nThe burden of proof is on the Claimant. The interview, given in circumstances which were difficult also for the Mayor, is not sufficient evidence in itself. The primary purpose of the interview was to reassure the public. The statement that the Mayor had been in contact with a number of companies for some three months may have been used to this effect, and may or may not be accurate, and would therefore need to be confirmed by further and more compelling evidence. However, there are no further elements on the record warranting a finding that the Municipality in fact attempted to attract a new operator in the summer of 2007.\n\n945.\n\nThe same is true of the offers which, the Mayor indicated, would be sent to several companies on 14 September 2007; nothing in the record confirms such declaration.\n\n946.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s claim that the Municipality attempted to attract new investors in the summer of 2007, and would send offers to several companies in September 2007 is unproven in point of fact.\n\n*c. The steps taken by the Municipality to set up R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija and to obtain a loan from the Treasury in an amount of LVL 4 million (28 September 9 October 2007)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n947.\n\nIn addition to the complaint mentioned in paragraph 938 above, the Claimant claims that the Municipality attempted to regain control of the heating system by incorporating R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija before declaring an energy crisis, which is a breach of good faith. The Respondent answered at the Hearing that as Latgales Ener\u0123ija had indicated that it had paid for the gas less than had been invoiced, there was a risk that Latgales Ener\u0123ija could end up in bankruptcy. Therefore the Municipality had a duty to adopt an alternative plan as a precaution and, accordingly, it went on to establish R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija.1399\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 949 below.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 118-119.\n\n948.\n\nOn 28 September 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council reportedly took the decision to establish R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija;1400 the Respondent did not challenge the information contained in this exhibit. On 2 October 2007 R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija was incorporated.1401 The R\u0113zekne City Council applied to the Local Government Loan and Guarantee Control and Monitoring Council, seeking approval of its decision to apply to the Treasury for a loan of LVL 4 million in order that R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija\u2019s capital could be increased; the Council granted the approval sought by the Municipality on 3 October 2007.1402 On 4 October 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council applied to the Treasury1403 which granted the loan on the following day.1404 On 9 October 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council decided to apply the loan to the capital increase of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija.1405\n\nC-142. see paragraph 258 above.\n\nC-206.\n\nR-20 [page 8].\n\nR-20 [page 9].\n\nR-20 [page 10].\n\nR-20 [page 1].\n\n949.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the establishment of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija is not in itself a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT, but the Claimant could succeed if it proved that such step was taken to pave the way for actions that contravene Article 3(1) of the BIT; this is a point which the Tribunal will examine in paragraphs 968 ff. below.\n\n*d. The attachment of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s assets obtained by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli (21 September 2007) and the failure by the R\u0113zekne City Council to have the attachment lifted*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n950.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the Respondent breached its expectations that the Municipality would not actively prevent Latgales Ener\u0123ija from operating its business and would comply with the undertaking to have the attachment lifted; that the attachment was an act of harassment on the part of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and later, in addition, by R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija; that due process was denied as the attachments were intended to paralyse Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s commercial activities; and, finally, that applying for the attachments and refusing to have them lifted was an act of bad faith, was arbitrary and discriminatory. The Respondent replies that the lawsuits brought by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija against Latgales Ener\u0123ija for *(inter alia)* unpaid natural gas were based on two commercial agreements entered into by two commercial companies which were not the arm of the Municipality; such lawsuits were the consequence of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to pay the full amount due for the natural gas received and used.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 952 below.\n\n951.\n\nThe Claimant has contended that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s claim was unfounded and that the bulk of the claim was represented by a dispute that had been simmering since 2006; the timing of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s action was calculated to disrupt Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s operations. The Respondent answered at the Hearing that after Latgales Ener\u0123ija had indicated that it had paid for the gas less than had been invoiced, there was a risk of bankruptcy.1406 R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli is a commercial company and not an arm of the Municipality which, as the sole shareholder, is entitled to act only in line with commercial principles, as opposed to political considerations.1407\n\nTranscript. Day 1, 118-119.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Argument. Slide 8.\n\n952.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the fact that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli applied for an attachment to secure its claims for payment against Latgales Ener\u0123ija arising under the Long-Term Agreement is not in itself a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT; neither is, in itself, the fact that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli applied for the attachment to be reinstated in breach of the undertaking contained in the October 2007 Agreement. However, the Tribunal will also have to determine whether these circumstances call for a different conclusion when considered as part of the wider context of the energy crisis (see paragraphs 964 ff. below).\n\n*e. The declaration of an energy crisis by the R\u0113zekne City Council on 9 October 2007*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n953.\n\nIn addition to the first complaint mentioned in paragraph 938 above the Claimant claims that the energy crisis was of the Municipality\u2019s own making and it was therefore declared in bad faith; moreover, the Municipality refused to have the attachment lifted, which would have enabled Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide heating to the City. Finally, the energy crisis was declared on 9 October 2007 before Latgales Ener\u0123ija had an opportunity to answer the Regulator\u2019s warning of 4 October 2007. The Claimant complains that the Municipality\u2019s actions in September and October 2007 were arbitrary and discriminatory, and the crisis was a tool used by the Municipality in an attempt to force Latgales Ener\u0123ija into relinquishing some or all of the heating system.\n\nThe Respondent takes the view that Latgales Ener\u0123ija caused the crisis by its own failure to pay for the natural gas used, and the Municipality had little choice but to act to protect the public interest in accordance with Latvian law.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraphs 961 and 973 below.\n\n954.\n\nThe energy crisis was declared by decision No. 388 of the R\u0113zekne City Council on 9 October 2007, which established the Energy Crisis Committee, chaired by the Mayor.1408 The decision is stated to be based on Sections 59(1), 62(1) and 70(1) of the Energy Act;1409 it does not contain any findings of fact, but simply sets out the statutory requirement set out in Section 59(1) of the Energy Act. This provision states that an energy crisis is declared when the supply of energy or fuel to energy supply merchants or energy users is jeopardized or disturbed to such an extent that energy supply merchants cannot forecast and eliminate such a danger or disturbance in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe investor alleges that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was not heard before the energy crisis was declared; decision No. 388 does not state otherwise; the Respondent has not rebutted the Claimant\u2019s allegation in this respect.\n\nC-24.\n\nCLA-48.\n\n955.\n\nThe first meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee took place on 9 October 2007 in the afternoon. The Mayor asked Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s representative, Mr. Melnikovs, whether Latgales Ener\u0123ija would be able to supply heating within 24 hours;1410 Latgales Ener\u0123ija answered that it needed to have the attachment lifted,1411 whereupon the Mayor requested Latgales Ener\u0123ija to supply heating within 24 hours, or the Municipality would apply to the Regulator to have Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences transferred to the Municipality. According to the minutes, Mr. Melnikovs reiterated that the bank account must be unblocked.1412\n\nDuring this meeting the Mayor announced that the Municipality was ready to provide heat supply through R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija, the company that the City Council had just set up and endowed with a capital of LVL 4 million loaned from the Treasury a few days beforehand (see paragraphs 258 and 948 above; see also paragraph 968 below).\n\nC-145 [page 4].\n\nMr. Melnikovs appears to refer to a \"counter-claim\" in C-145 [page 5]; however, that was the application for the discharge or the setting aside of the attachment, C-143. see also paragraph 304 below.\n\nC-145 [page 6].\n\n956.\n\nOn 10 October 2007 the Mayor confirmed in writing the Municipality\u2019s ultimatum in order that Latgales Ener\u0123ija provide heating within 24 hours.1413\n\nC-145 [page 1].\n\n957.\n\nThe Municipality\u2019s decision declaring an energy crisis was not challenged by Latgales Ener\u0123ija before the Latvian courts.\n\n958.\n\nThe Tribunal must first determine whether it was a reasonable course of action for the Municipality to declare an energy crisis.\n\n959.\n\nThe Claimant has confined itself to contending that the Municipality had requested the start of the heating season on 1 October 2007 in R\u0113zekne whereas the Municipality of Livani had started three days later, but there is no evidence that the decision to start the heating season in R\u0113zekne was arbitrary or otherwise taken in bad faith.\n\n960.\n\nThere is hardly any direct evidence as to the concrete effects of the interruption of heating services on the population. The period for which Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s difficulties have lasted *(i.e.* from 11 September to 17 October 2007) is based on an admission made by Latgales Ener\u0123ija (see paragraph 259 footnote 289 above) which was not challenged by the Respondent, which confined itself to alleging \"nonprocurement by SIA \u2018Latgales energija\u2019 at all or in substantially insufficient service level of heat to kindergartens, schools and the largest area of the R\u0113zekne city (and so, affecting adversely a huge population)\".1414 The decision declaring an energy crisis1415 provides no information in this respect; the Regulator\u2019s warning of 4 October 20071416 refers to information as to insufficient heating provided by the administration, *i.e.* the local Board of Education.\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.25.\n\nC-24.\n\nC-22.\n\n961.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the declaration of an energy crisis by the Municipality is not, in itself, an arbitrary decision, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s submissions. When it was declared on 9 October 2007, heating services had been insufficient as from 11 September 2007 and the Municipality\u2019s duty to act cannot therefore be reasonably doubted. The Claimant has failed to indicate in particular what other actions by the Municipality would have been more reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n962.\n\nThe Tribunal must next determine whether the energy crisis was declared in good faith and whether the Municipality complied with Article 3(1) of the BIT in that difficult situation. To answer those questions the Tribunal must consider three specific points: *(i)* the ultimatum issued to Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 9/10 October 2007, *(ii)* the fact that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank accounts were attached further to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s proceedings brought against Latgales Ener\u0123ija and *(iii)* the sudden emergence of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija.\n\n963.\n\nDuring the 9 October 2007 meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee Latgales Ener\u0123ija was summoned to provide heating within 24 hours. That was a measure that would hardly solve anything as Latgales Ener\u0123ija had stated during the meeting that it was unable to provide heating services unless its bank account could be freed and used again.\n\nThis calls for an examination of the attachment on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account and the rise of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija.\n\n964.\n\nThe fact that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had obtained an attachment on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account on 21 September 2007 needs to be carefully considered in the context of the Municipality\u2019s ultimatum of 9/10 October 2007. The question is whether the Municipality could in good faith request Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide heating within 24 hours whilst it was aware of the fact that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account had been attached further to the proceedings brought by the Municipality\u2019s wholly-owned R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and Latgales Ener\u0123ija would be unable to provide heating unless it was able to use its bank account.\n\n965.\n\nIt should be recalled that the Tribunal has already concluded that the Municipality directed R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli to bring a suit against Latgales Ener\u0123ija in paragraph 830 above. The Tribunal considers that it follows that the Municipality\u2019s ultimatum was not issued in good faith on 9/10 October 2007.\n\nThe Tribunal further considers that the breach of good faith on the part of the Municipality is compounded by the fact that on 25 October 2007 the Municipality and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli executed the October 2007 Agreement, which provided in its first clause that the attachment had to be lifted (or the decision lifting the attachment should not be challenged) as a matter of urgency.1417\n\nC-26, Clause *(a).*\n\n966.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Respondent\u2019s contention that the October 2007 Agreement did not give rise to enforceable obligations, but only to best-effort duties,1418 is without foundation as far as the duty to have the attachment lifted in accordance with Clause *(a)* is concerned. Such a contractual obligation was binding on the Municipality and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli in the Tribunal\u2019s view.1419\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 23.\n\nThe October 2007 Agreement was made in a situation of crisis by all interested parties and it contemplated the course of action to be followed; the first series of actions was to be taken within a week of its date of execution (\"Phase I\") and having the lifting of the attachment was the first item contemplated by the October 2007 Agreement, Clause *(a).* Insofar as the Respondent contends that the October 2007 Agreement made provision for further steps in Phase III which possibly included amendments to be made to the Long-Term Agreement, that contention is accurate in itself, but it is not dispositive in the present case, as the parties expressly agreed that the lifting of the attachment was the first thing to be made; such duty was on R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli as the party' having obtained the attachment and on the Municipality' as R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s sole shareholder, which was privy to the October 2007 Agreement.\n\n967.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is relevant that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli acted in breach of the October 2007 Agreement almost immediately after 25 October 2007 by challenging the court decision that had discharged the attachment (see paragraph 290 above).\n\nSuch conduct is evidence of the Municipality\u2019s readiness to take steps capable of harming the investor\u2019s position in R\u0113zekne.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s contention that no party brought any proceedings in the Latvian courts relating to the breach of the October 2007 Agreement is without merit.\n\n968.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal must consider the sudden emergence of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija, the Municipality\u2019s newly-constituted and wholly-owned subsidiary (see paragraphs 258 and 948 above). The Municipality announced in the afternoon of 9 October 2007 that \"[t]he Municipality has a mechanism to ensure heat supply - we are ready to provide heat supply with the intermediation of municipality SIA R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija\".1420\n\nC-145 [page 3].\n\n969.\n\nThe Respondent explains that resort to R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija was simply a precaution (see paragraph 947 above) intended by the Municipality to offer Latgales Ener\u0123ija an opportunity to continue the business (paragraph 991 below) and a measure which was within the Municipality\u2019s discretion as a matter of Latvian law.\n\nThis is not, however, the more plausible explanation for the Municipality\u2019s conduct in the Tribunal\u2019s view. One must consider, on the one hand, that the Municipality had endowed R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija with a capital of LVL 4 million a few days before it declared the energy crisis, and, on the other hand, that the Municipality\u2019s conduct in relation to the attachment on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account disclosed an intention towards the investor that was hostile. The decision to fund R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija with a capital of LVL 4 million represented a \"serious financial burden\" according to the Respondent\u2019s own words.1421 The establishment of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija was not, therefore, simply a precaution; it was part of the Municipality\u2019s plan to have another company ready to take over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s position practically at the same time when the Regulator issued its warning to Latgales Ener\u0123ija that the licences might be revoked.\n\nRespondent's Opening Argument, Slide 17.\n\n970.\n\nThe Tribunal finally considers that the Respondent has failed to explain in these proceedings how a newly-established company devoid of any track record could be considered as the most appropriate solution to bring the energy crisis to an end; all employees of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had in fact been taken over by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in 2005 (see paragraph 112 above). The Respondent did not call any witnesses from the Municipality or R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija to explain when the decision to incorporate R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija was first considered and to explain the policy pursued by the Municipality before and during the energy crisis.\n\n971.\n\nOne aspect of the discussions that preceded the finalisation of the heat supply development plan for the City further confirms that the R\u0113zekne City Council had considered replacing Latgales Ener\u0123ija before the energy crisis was declared, when two representatives of the Council suggested \"editorial changes\" in order to ensure that Latgales Ener\u0123ija should be mentioned by name only once in the heat supply development plan for the City, and that any further reference should be made anonymously to the \"operator\" (see paragraphs 224 and 227 above).\n\nThis circumstance raises yet another inference that the R\u0113zekne City Council had already considered replacing Latgales Ener\u0123ija in or about early September 2007, and that such prospect was concrete enough to influence the wording of the draft heat supply development plan for the City as early as 11 September 2007.\n\n972.\n\nWhen the declaration of an energy crisis was made on 9 October 2007 heating in some schools had not been provided by almost a week. The Tribunal finds that the fact that the Municipality declared an energy crisis without waiting until Latgales Ener\u0123ija had answered the Regulator\u2019s warning of 4 October 2007 is not *per se* a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n973.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the Municipality breached Article 3(1) of the BIT in October 2007, and especially after 25 October 2007, on the basis that the attachment of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account, considered in the context of the energy crisis, and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s repudiation of its duty to have such attachment discharged (or not to challenge a decision lifting the attachment) are attributable to the Municipality; the ultimatum issued by the Municipality to Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 9/10 October 2007 was a measure inconsistent with good faith and the announcement that its newly-established, wholly-owned subsidiary R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija was henceforth ready to provide heating services in the middle of the energy crisis appears to have been founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact, *i.e.* was arbitrary in a manner inconsistent with Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n*f. The Regulator\u2019s decision taking over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s zone (11 October 2007)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n974.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the Regulator\u2019s decision of 11 October 2007 to take over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s zone was based on circumstances created by the Municipality and the Regulator\u2019s previous unjustified decisions; that such a decision was an act of harassment against the investor; that such a decision was arbitrary and discriminatory and amounts to a denial of due process insofar as the Regulation did not wait until Latgales Ener\u0123ija had been able to answer the Regulator\u2019s warning of 4 October 2007. The Respondent takes the view that this decision was the consequence of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s inability to provide good-quality, uninterrupted heating services and that such a decision was in accordance with Latvian law.1422\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 982 below.\n\nThe Respondent regards this as a \"decision to suspend\" the licences (Resp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.21(2)). This is inaccurate; a decision to suspend the licence is based on Sect. 18(7) of the Energy Act whereas a decision to take over the territorial area of a service provider is based on Sect. 28 of the same Act; the Regulator's decision is stated to be based on the latter provision.\n\n975.\n\nOn 11 October 2007 the Regulator decided to take over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s zone under Section 28(1)(3) of the Public Utility Regulators Act1423.1424 The decision indicated that the Ministry or the Municipality in charge would have to appoint a person responsible for the utility under consideration in accordance with Section 28(2) of the Public Utility Regulators Act. As stated in the decision, such appointment is temporary according to this provision. The Regulator\u2019s decision is based on the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s application of the same day informing the Regulator that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had been unable to provide heating to six schools and/or kindergartens upon the Council\u2019s request of the previous day and that the Regulator had therefore to decide whether to take over the zone; that decision called for the respective interests of the public and Latgales Ener\u0123ija to be weighed, and the scales came down in favour of the public interest.\n\nSect. 28 of the Public Utility Regulators Act reads as follows (CLA-49) :  \n (1) The Regulator shall take a decision on the necessity to take over the territorial area of the licence of a provider of public utilities:  \n 1) if the licence of the provider of public utilities is to be cancelled (revoked);  \n 2) if the term of validity of the licence of a provider of public utilities expires in six months and the provider of utilities does not wish to continue the provision of such public utilities for which a new licence is required; or  \n 3) if a provider of public utilities for some reason is unable to ensure continuous, safe and qualitative public utilities.  \n (2) If the Regulator takes a decision to take over the territorial area of a licence of a provider of public utilities, the Regulator shall, within 10 working days, notify the responsible ministry of the relevant regulated sector or the relevant local government thereof. The responsible ministry of the relevant regulated sector or the local government in whose territory the provider of public utilities is located shall appoint temporarily a person responsible for the public utilities determined in the licence of the provider of public utilities in order to take the measures to encourage merchants to take over the provision of public utilities in the territorial area of the licence.  \n (3) In order to ensure the realisation of the activities determined in this Section, the person responsible for the public utilities determined in the licence of a provider of public utilities shall inform the Regulator or the local government regarding the performance of his or her tasks and is entitled to choose the methods for tendering, competition or selection of applicants.\n\nC-23.\n\n976.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s applications to have that decision set aside were dismissed by the Latvian courts.1425\n\nR-3, see paragraphs 402 ff. above.\n\n977.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s contention that the Regulator should have waited until it had received Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s answer to the warning of 4 October 2007 may have some merit, but it is not dispositive. The Regulator\u2019s 4 October 2007 warning did not relate to the taking over of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s zone and the Claimant\u2019s argument is not, therefore, compelling in the Tribunal\u2019s view.\n\n978.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija was not heard before the 11 October 2007 decision was made, which is a procedural irregularity in the Tribunal\u2019s view.\n\n979.\n\nThe decision to take over a licencee\u2019s zone is a measure that has considerable effects on the operator as a matter of Latvian law. This is shown not only by the requirements which have to be met under Section 28(1) of the Public Utility Regulators Act, which relate to situations in which the public interest is affected, but also by the consequences which follow from such a decision, as the licencee is replaced by another provider on a temporary basis. Such temporary appointment is made according to Section 28(2) of the Public Utility Regulators Act \"in order to take the measures to encourage merchants to take over the provision of public utilities in the territorial area of the licence\".\n\n980.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that although the Regulator\u2019s decision amounts to a significant interference with the operator\u2019s position, it is relevant that two successive Latvian courts dealt with Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s appeal or application for judicial review. The Tribunal therefore finds that the Regulator\u2019s 11 October 2007 decision does not amount to a breach of due process amounting to a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n981.\n\nThe Tribunal further finds that the Regulator\u2019s 11 October 2011 is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory and does not amount to a breach of good faith. It is relevant that Latgales Ener\u0123ija expressly admitted that the provision of heating was interrupted and/or that it was insufficient from 11 September to 14 October 2007, as the Tribunal has recalled.1426 Such circumstances squarely fall within Section 28(1)(3) of the Public Utility Regulators Act.\n\nSee paragraph 960 above.\n\n982.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal denies the Claimant\u2019s complaint that the Regulator\u2019s 11 October 2011 decision amounts to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n*g. The R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s decision to appoint R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as the person in charge of providing thermal energy (12 October 2007)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n983.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the appointment of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija was made in breach of good faith and due process, was arbitrary and discriminatory and was an act of harassment on the part of the Municipality. The Respondent replies that it was a reasonable decision to make under the circumstances, and one which was within the statutory discretion of the Municipality as a matter of Latvian law.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 987 below.\n\n984.\n\nOn 12 October 2007 the R\u0113zekne City Council appointed R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as the person in charge of providing heating services in the City of R\u0113zekne.1427 The appointment was temporary according to Section 28(2) of the Regulatory of Public Utilities Act.1428\n\nC-25.\n\nCLA-49, quoted in paragraph 975 footnote 1423 above.\n\n985.\n\nThe appointment of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija must be considered in the context of the energy crisis declared by the Municipality taking into account the Municipality\u2019s conduct as a whole. The Tribunal has found, first, that the Municipality\u2019s conduct on 9 and 10 October 2007 was not in accordance with Article 3(1) of the BIT (see paragraph 973 above); secondly, that the announcement in the middle of the energy crisis that its newly-established R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija was henceforth ready to take over the heating services was likewise not in accordance with Article 3(1) of the BIT (see paragraphs 973 above).\n\n986.\n\nThe appointment of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija by the Municipality is the continuation and achievement of measures that were not in accordance with Article 3(1) of the BIT. It follows that such appointment is likewise not in accordance with Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n987.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the Municipality\u2019s appointment of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija is a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n(vi) *The Claims Based on the Warning and the Revocation of the Licences by the Regulator (4 October 2007/3 June 2008)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n988.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the Regulator ought to have suspended the licences and granted Latgales Ener\u0123ija an opportunity to remedy any breaches of the licences as may have been suspected before issuing a warning; instead the Regulator issued a warning and then revoked the licences, which is a breach of due process. The Claimant asserts that the Regulator revoked the licences in bad faith as the revocation was based on events which did not amount to a breach of the licence conditions and had, in any event, been caused by the Municipality. Finally, the Claimant argues that the revocation of the licences was arbitrary and discriminatory. The Respondent replies that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was sanctioned for its failure to provide continuous and reliable heating services, and in accordance with the provisions of an investment regime which it had accepted; the Claimant has only itself to blame for its failure to carry out a proper due diligence with respect to the regulatory and commercial risks inherent in the investment it made.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s findings are set out in paragraphs 1000, 1004, 1024 and 1027 below.\n\n989.\n\nOn 4 October 2007 the Regulator sent Latgales Ener\u0123ija a warning stating that the licences might be revoked after 4 January 2008.1429 The Regulator\u2019s warning summoned Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide explanations by 4 November 2007 on the following breaches:\n\n(i) Latgales Ener\u0123ija had failed to submit the plan of operations for 2006 and 2007 in accordance with Clause 7.1 of the licence conditions;\n\n(ii) Latgales Ener\u0123ija had failed to submit the results of 2005 and 2006 in accordance with Clause 7.2 of the licence conditions;\n\n(iii) the draft guidelines submitted to the Municipality on 19 December 2006 were found to be incomplete and had not been approved, as a consequence of which Latgales Ener\u0123ija had also failed to comply with Clause 6.3 of the licence conditions; and\n\n(iv) the Municipality and the Board of Education had stated that there was no heating in three school institutions and heating problems in six other institutions.\n\nC-22. See also paragraphs 266 ff. above. The Regulator recalled that the licence holder had the following duties under the conditions of the licences:  \n (i) *Clause 1:* to provide uninterrupted and good-quality public utility services (C-22 \u00b61);  \n (ii) *Clause* 7.7; by 31 December of each year, to submit a plan of activity for the following year in accordance with its long-term development plan, including data about the planned amount of production, transfer, distribution and sale of thermal energy and measures to improve quality and safety (C-22 \u00b6 2);  \n (iii) *Clause 7.2:* by 31 March of each year, to submit a report regarding the results of the previous year (C-22 \u00b6 3);  \n (iv) *Clause 6.3:* to prepare a long-term development plan (C-22 \u00b6 4).\n\n990.\n\nOn 30 October 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija answered the Regulator\u2019s warning contending that the proceedings initiated with the warning should be brought to an end, vigorously denying that the first three points set out above amounted to a breach, but admitting in point of fact that it had experienced difficulties in providing uninterrupted heating services from 11 September to 17 October 2007.1430 Such difficulties could, however, be explained by the attachment obtained by the Municipality and by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli on its bank account which was a deliberate action.\n\nC-153.\n\n991.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s warning was sent on 4 October 2007 in the middle of the energy crisis; Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s answer was sent on 30 October 2007 after the supply of natural gas had been resumed on 17 October 2007. The October 2007 Agreement was made on 25 October 2007.\n\nIt is common ground that Latgales Ener\u0123ija in fact continued to provide heating services despite the Regulator\u2019s decision to take over Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s zone on 11 October 2007 and the appointment of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as the person in charge of providing those services on the following day. At the Hearing the Respondent explained that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was given an \"opportunity (...) to continue the business\" as R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija had been set up only to make sure that a solution would be available in case there had been further problems in the supply of heating services or Latgales Ener\u0123ija went bankrupt.1431 The Tribunal has already noted in paragraph 969 above that the Municipality\u2019s alleged intention to give Latgales Ener\u0123ija an opportunity to continue with the business was in fact contradicted by the Municipality\u2019s apparent readiness to take actions adversely affecting the investment in breach of good faith.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 118-119; 119/3-8.\n\n992.\n\nOn 29 November 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija informed the Regulator that it might find itself in a situation in which providing heating services would be difficult or even impossible due to the proceedings brought against it by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli which had resulted in an attachment of its bank account.1432\n\nC-158, see paragraph 293 above.\n\n993.\n\nOn 4 December 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija assigned its claims for payment against end-users to LE Remonts (see paragraph 298 above). On 11 December 2007 the Regulator objected to such assignment and requested Latgales Ener\u0123ija to explain the situation, pointing out that several laws and regulations had been breached on the basis that the invoices issued by Latgales Ener\u0123ija in November 2007 did not indicate Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account.1433 A further complaint related to the failure by Latgales Ener\u0123ija to maintain accurate payment records. The Regulator pointed out that such violations of applicable laws and regulations amounted to a further breach of the licence conditions and could be a further ground upon which the licences could be revoked. Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to provide its long-term development plan was pointed out again by the Regulator. Finally, the Regulator took the view that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had transferred profits to its parent company in breach of Clause 5 of the licences.\n\nC-162.\n\n994.\n\nOn 19 December 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija denied being in breach of any laws and regulations in a detailed letter.1434\n\nC-166.\n\n995.\n\nOn 20 May 2008 the R\u0113zekne City Council put Latgales Ener\u0123ija on notice, *inter alia,* that it had failed to invest the minimum amount of EUR 1.5 million in the first three years of operation;1435 R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had directed the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s and the Regulator\u2019s attention to such circumstance on 15 May 2007.1436 Latgales Ener\u0123ija replied that the Council\u2019s letter was incomprehensible if account was taken of the fact that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had not yet consented to the construction of the building of a cogeneration station.1437\n\nC-178.\n\nC-231, see also paragraph 891 above.\n\nC-179 [page 21.\n\n996.\n\nOn 3 June 2008 the Regulator revoked the licences as a matter of urgency.1438 The decision recalled the Regulator\u2019s warning of 4 October 20071439 and was stated to be based on the reasons set out therein and a dismissal of the explanations provided by Latgales Ener\u0123ija on 30 October 2007, in particular that the difficulties in providing uninterrupted heating services had been caused by third parties.1440\n\nC-29.\n\nC-22, see paragraph 989 above.\n\nC-153.\n\n997.\n\nIn addition, the Regulator rested its decision to revoke the licences on the following reasons:\n\n(i) Latgales Ener\u0123ija had continued to pay only part of the invoices for the gas used, which warranted the conclusion that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s performance fell short of its duty to provide good-quality and uninterrupted heating services;1441\n\n(ii) Latgales Ener\u0123ija had sold heating services at non-authorised rates;\n\n(iii) Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s invoice to the end-users indicated a bank account of a third party, which was a breach of the terms of the contract with end-users and of the Regulations on the Supply and Use of Thermal Energy [ *not in evidence]* and gave rise to multiple breaches of Latvian law; and\n\n(iv) Latgales Ener\u0123ija had failed to invest the minimum amount of EUR 1.5 million as stated in R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s letter of 15 May 2008.1442\n\nIt was therefore necessary to revoke the licences as a matter of urgency to protect the end-users\u2019 interest.\n\nC-29 \u00b6\u00b6 10.1; 12.1.\n\nC-231. see paragraph 333 above.\n\n998.\n\nOn 5 June 2008 Latgales Ener\u0123ija brought proceedings to have the Regulator\u2019s decision set aside; on 6 May 2010 Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application was finally dismissed.1443\n\nR-2. see paragraphs 390 ff. above.\n\n999.\n\nOn the Claimant\u2019s *first complaint* based on *breach of due process,* the Tribunal notes, as a preliminary point, that the revocation of a licence is the most radical sanction contemplated by the Public Utility Regulators Act1444 which makes a clear distinction between suspension (Section 18(7)) and revocation of a licence (Section 18(3)). Further to the 4 October 2007 warning the Regulator directly imposed the revocation of licences on 3 June 2008.1445\n\nHowever, it is relevant, and indeed dispositive in the Tribunal\u2019s view that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s complaint was considered and dismissed by two successive Latvian courts.1446\n\nCLA-49.\n\nSect. 18 of the Public Utility Regulators Act (CLA-49) reads as follows:  \n (1) A substantiated proposal to make amendments to the conditions of a licence issued or to cancel (revoke) a licence shall be submitted by a provider of public utilities to the Regulator in accordance with the procedure determined by the Cabinet.  \n (2) The Regulator shall amend the conditions of a licence issued if:  \n 1) amendments to the regulatory enactments concerning the type of regulated public utilities have come into force;  \n 2) economically substantiated provision of public utilities cannot be ensured in another way in the territorial area of the licence; and  \n 3) a provider of public utilities has submitted a substantiated proposal.  \n (3) The Regulator shall cancel (revoke) a licence issued to a provider of public utilities if the provider of public utilities:  \n 1) fails to comply with or violates the conditions of the licence issued to it;  \n 2) fails to comply with or violates the requirements for providing the public utilities determined by regulatory enactments;  \n 3) has been declared as being subject to liquidation;  \n 4) has submitted a substantiated proposal; or  \n 5) within 12 months from the day of issue of the licence has not commenced provision of public utilities (if the commencement date for the provision of public utilities has not been determined in the licence).  \n (4) The Regulator shall give a provider of public utilities a written warning notice regarding the amendments to the conditions of a licence at least 30 days in advance. In the case determined in Paragraph two. Clause 3 of this Section the Regulator shall determine the warning time period.  \n (5) The Regulator shall give a provider of public utilities a written warning notice regarding the cancellation (revocation) of a licence at least three months in advance. In the cases determined in Paragraph three, Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of this Section, as well as. when cancelling (revoking) the licence in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Law, the Regulator shall determine the warning time period.  \n (6) If a licence is cancelled (revoked), the State fee for the regulation of public utilities paid by the provider of public utilities in accordance with Section 30 of this Law shall not be reimbursed.  \n (7) The Regulator shall suspend the validity of a licence issued if there are justified suspicions regarding the fact that the provider of public utilities fails to comply with or violates the conditions of the licence issued to it or the requirements for provision of public utilities determined in regulatory enactments.  \n (8) The time period restrictions for the revocation of a lawful administrative act determined by the Administrative Procedure Law shall not be applied when making amendments to a licence or cancelling (revoking) a licence in accordance with this Law.  \n (9) The Regulator shall take a decision regarding the issue of a licence, cancellation (revocation) of a licence granted, refusal to grant a licence, regarding the amendments to the conditions of a licence or suspension or renewal of the validity of a licence within a month following the day of the receipt of the submission and all the documents determined in regulatory enactments or all the information necessary' for taking the decision.\n\nR-2, see paragraphs 390 ff. above.\n\n1000.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that insofar as the Regulator\u2019s decision to revoke the licences is based on reasons stated in the Regulator\u2019s warning, there was no breach of due process as Latgales Ener\u0123ija was put on notice of the Regulator\u2019s position on 4 October 2007.\n\n1001.\n\nA further point must be addressed at this juncture since the Regulator rested its decision to revoke the licences on further grounds than those set out in the warning (see paragraphs 997 and 989 above) and the Claimant regards this too as a breach of due process. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is relevant, again, that the Regulator\u2019s decision was reviewed by the Latvian courts. In addition, the Tribunal notes the following.\n\n1002.\n\nBasic requirements of transparency and fairness require in principle that the Regulator should set out the ground(s) on which it may ultimately revoke a licence in its warning in a comprehensive manner; this is all the more so where the Regulator decides not to suspend a licence and not to give the operator time to remedy a breach, but issues a warning that may directly result in the operator\u2019s licence being revoked. If further grounds of revocation are then added by the Regulator in informal correspondence, due process may be breached where the operator reasonably fails fully to appreciate the significance of such correspondence or is not given an opportunity to put its position before the Regulator as to such additional grounds for revocation.\n\n1003.\n\nHaving considered the detailed correspondence exchanged between the Regulator and/or the Municipality on the one hand, and Latgales Ener\u0123ija on the other, in the period between the warning and the revocation of the licences, the Tribunal must examine two questions, namely *(i)* whether the operator was adequately informed by the Regulator of any additional grounds capable of giving rise to the revocation of the licences and *(ii)* whether the operator was given an opportunity to put its case before the Regulator as to such additional grounds before the licences were revoked.\n\n1004.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. Subsequent to the Regulator\u2019s warning Latgales Ener\u0123ija put its case to the Regulator in a detailed manner.1447 The Tribunal therefore finds that the Regulator\u2019s decision to revoke the licences was not made in breach of due process as Latgales Ener\u0123ija was given an opportunity to answer the Regulator\u2019s letters as well as the Municipality\u2019s criticism. In addition, Latgales Ener\u0123ija had an opportunity to put its case against the Regulator\u2019s decision before two successive Latvian courts.\n\nC-162; C-166; C-174 ; C-175 ; C-231. C-178 ; C-179.\n\n1005.\n\nThe Tribunal must now turn to the Claimant\u2019s *second complaint* that the Regulator\u2019s decision to revoke the licences was made in *breach of good faith,* which calls for an examination of the reasons given by the Regulator for the revocation of the licences.\n\n1006.\n\nThe *first reason* given by the Regulator in its decision revoking the licences, already set out in the Regulator\u2019s warning, is the breach by Latgales Ener\u0123ija of its duty to provide the Regulator with the plans contemplated by Clauses 7 and 6 of the licences. There is no doubt that the Regulator has a duty to revoke a licence where the operator is found to be in breach of the licence conditions (Section 18(3)(1) of the Public Utility Regulators Act1448) and that the operator is bound to comply with the licence conditions and provide the Regulator with the information required by such conditions. The Regulator has also a duty to monitor compliance by the operator with the licence conditions (Section 16(5) of the same Act).1449\n\nCLA-49, quoted in paragraph 999 footnote 1445 above.\n\nSect. 16(5) of the Public Utility Regulators Act (CLA-49) reads as follows:  \n (5) The Regulator shall supervise the fulfilment of licence conditions and the conformity of public utilities with licence conditions.\n\n1007.\n\nThe licences were granted by the Regulator on 30 May 2005 and the information that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had to provide to the Regulator was in principle due by 31 December of each year (Clause 7.1 of the licences) and by the first quarter of the year (Clause 7.2 of the licences). Clause 6 of the licences does not set a time limit in relation to the operator\u2019s long-term development plan.\n\nIt is not in dispute that Latgales Ener\u0123ija failed to provide the Regulator with any of the plans required by the licence conditions in 2005 and 2006. However, the Regulator did not ask Latgales Ener\u0123ija to comply with the licence conditions, either in 2005 or in 2006. The year 2005 was significant also because on 19 December 2005 the Regulator set a new tariff further to Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application. Yet the Regulator did not mention Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to provide the plans contemplated by the licences until the 4 October 2007 warning.\n\n1008.\n\nThe Tribunal takes this to be an indication that the Regulator did not regard Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to provide the plans contemplated by the licences as a breach which would be sufficient *per se* to attract the revocation of the licences, but that such a failure was regarded as relevant only in the wider context of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to provide uninterrupted heating services from 11 September to 17 October 2007.\n\n1009.\n\nIn any event, the Regulator\u2019s complaint, contained in the 4 October 2007 warning, that Latgales Ener\u0123ija failed to provide the operator\u2019s long-term development plan under Clause 6 of the licences appears unreasonable if account is taken of the fact that the Municipality had issued its own development plan for the City only on 21 September 2007, with a delay which the Tribunal has found to be in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT. Latgales Ener\u0123ija was entitled to be granted reasonable time after 21 September 2007 in order to provide the Regulator with its long-term development plan. Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to provide a long-term plan could not, therefore, reasonably be considered on 4 October 2007 to be a ground upon which the licences could be revoked.\n\n1010.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to provide the Regulator with the documents contemplated by the licence conditions is therefore insufficient, in the circumstances described above, to warrant the revocation of the licences.\n\n1011.\n\nThe *second reason* given by the Regulator in its decision revoking the licences, already set out in the Regulator\u2019s warning, is Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to provide uninterrupted heating services. The warning contains limited factual information as to the extent of the interruption in the heating services1450 and so does the revocation decision.1451\n\nC-22 \u00b6 6.\n\nC-29 \u00b6 10.\n\n1012.\n\nAfter the Regulator\u2019s warning of 4 October 2007 Latgales Ener\u0123ija had in fact provided heating services for seven months and a half without any interruption, from 17 October 2007 onwards, until the licences were revoked on 3 June 2008 as a matter of urgency.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Regulator did not regard the interruption in the provision of heating services, which was the main potential ground for revocation set out in the warning, as a reason sufficient to revoke the licences; Latgales Ener\u0123ija would not otherwise have been allowed to continue to provide heating services for a period of seven months and a half.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to examine the further reasons, not set out in the Regulator\u2019s warning, on which the Regulator rested the decision to revoke the licences.\n\n1013.\n\nThe *first reason* for the revocation not mentioned in the warning is that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had continued to pay and was still paying only part of the price for the natural gas used, which had resulted in an interruption of the heating services and which might be the cause of further interruptions in the future (see paragraph 997(i) above).\n\n1014.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this was a ground on which the Regulator was reasonably entitled to revoke the licences.\n\n1015.\n\nAs found in paragraphs 935 and 936 above, the duty to pay for the natural gas delivered was on Latgales Ener\u0123ija. The energy crisis had been directly caused by Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to pay the full price for the natural gas received and used from June 2007 onwards.1452 Latgales Ener\u0123ija did not deny that it had failed to pay the full amount; it argued in its correspondence with the Regulator that the matter was pending in court and the arrangement in place for the supply of natural gas was illegal *inter alia* on the ground that R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija had not been licenced to sell natural gas.1453\n\nC-130.\n\nC-179 p. 3.\n\n1016.\n\nIn June 2008 the Regulator was therefore justifiably insecure as to whether Latgales Ener\u0123ija would be able, ready and willing to pay the full price for the natural gas.\n\n1017.\n\nThe *second reason* relied upon by the Regulator that was not set out in the warning was that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had been selling heating services at non-authorised rates on the ground that the tariff approved by the Regulator on 11 November 2007 had been revoked on 7 December 2007 and the 9 November 2007 tariff was therefore inapplicable (see paragraph 997(ii) above).\n\n1018.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed the Claimant\u2019s complaint that the Regulator\u2019s 7 December 2007 decision was made in breach of due process and was arbitrary and contrary to good faith in paragraphs 915 and 916 above. The Tribunal therefore finds that reliance by the Regulator on such decision cannot amount to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n1019.\n\nThe *third reason* relied upon by the Regulator in its decision revoking the licences that was not mentioned in the warning was that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s invoices to the end-users indicated a bank account of a third party, which was a breach of applicable regulations in itself, and caused a number of further technical breaches of Latvian law (see paragraph 997(iii) above).\n\n1020.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Regulator\u2019s position based on an alleged technical breach of Latvian law is not consistent with *bona fide* reliance on a rational policy. Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s assignment to LE Remonts was an attempt to overcome the effects of the attachment of its bank account which the Municipality and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had refused to have lifted, unreasonably and contrary to good faith as the Tribunal found in paragraphs 964, 967 and 973 above, in order to continue to provide heating services. The Regulator\u2019s position was tantamount to endorsing, if not indirectly supporting, the Municipality\u2019s and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s unreasonable conduct and could not therefore be a sound basis for a decision made in good faith and based on a rational policy.\n\n1021.\n\nThe *fourth reason* relied upon by the Regulator in its decision revoking the licences that was not mentioned in the warning was that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had failed to invest the minimum amount of EUR 1.5 million as stated in R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s letter of 15 May 2008.1454\n\nC-231, see paragraph 333 above.\n\n1022.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Regulator\u2019s decision falls short of the requirements of *bona fide* reliance on a rational policy since this was a purely contractual matter between Latgales Ener\u0123ija and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli.1455 In addition, the Regulator\u2019s decision does not indicate how such a failure would be relevant under the applicable law; nor does it indicate whether the Regulator made any findings of fact of its own and the basis for such findings of fact, as the decision simply quotes from a letter by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli.\n\nSee Clause 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement, C-4.\n\n1023.\n\nTo sum up, the Regulator was entitled to revoke the licences on 3 June 2008 on the basis of at least one sound reason, namely that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had failed to pay the full price for the natural gas used in the past twelve months. This is a separate and independent ground for revocation,1456 therefore the Regulator\u2019s decision does not amount to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija does not deny that it was still not paying the entire price charged for the natural gas in its letter to the Regulator of 2 June 2008. Such a failure had already been one of the main causes of the 9 October 2007 energy crisis. There was no reason for the Regulator to believe that such a failure could not trigger a new crisis again.\n\nSee the approach of the NAFTA tribunal *in* *Azinian v. Mexico,* RLA-8 \u00b6 104, in which the tribunal found that certain Mexican judgments having annulled a concession were not arbitrary on the basis that the cause of nullity could be rested on one ground.\n\n1024.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to pay the full price of the natural gas received and used was a sufficient reason upon which the Regulator was entitled to revoke the licences without infringing the requirements of good faith. The revocation of the licences is not therefore a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT in itself. The Claimant\u2019s claim must therefore be dismissed.\n\n1025.\n\nThe Claimant finally argues in a *third complaint* that the Regulator\u2019s decision to revoke the licences was *arbitrary and discriminatory.*\n\n1026.\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses this claim. The Regulator was entitled to revoke the licences, as found in paragraph 1023 above, on the basis that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to pay the full price for the natural gas represented a risk likely to give rise to further problems and disruption in the following winter season. That reason was clear and sound; the Claimant\u2019s complaint of arbitrariness and discrimination is without merit.\n\n1027.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Claimant\u2019s complaint that the Regulator\u2019s decision revoking the licences was arbitrary and discriminatory is dismissed.\n\n(vii) *The Claims Based on the Municipality\u2019s Conduct Subsequent to the Revocation of the Licences (From 3 July 2008 Onwards)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1028.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the Municipality\u2019s conduct subsequent to the Regulator\u2019s decision to revoke the licences is in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal will consider *(i)* the appointment of Mr. Locis by the R\u0113zekne City Council as the person in charge of organising district heating, and the appointment by Mr. Locis of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as the person temporarily in charge of the transmission, distribution and sale, and of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli as the person temporarily in charge of the production of thermal energy, *(ii)* the Municipality\u2019s decision directing Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide immediate access to the assets, *(iii)* the decision authorising the forcible recovery of the assets, and *(iv)* the forcible recovery of the buildings and the boilers.\n\n*a. The appointment of Mr. Locis by the Municipality as the person in charge of organising district heating (13 June 2008) and the appointment of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as the temporary producer, respectively provider and seller of thermal energy (13 June 2008)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1029.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the Municipality\u2019s attempts to appoint other individuals or entities it owned to provide heating services in place of Latgales Ener\u0123ija were acts of harassment and a breach of the Claimant\u2019s expectations that the Municipality would not seek to replace Latgales Ener\u0123ija and take over the heating system. The preconditions for the appointment of R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija were not met and such decision was made in breach of due process and in bad faith. The Respondent has not commented in detail on the different measures taken by the Municipality subsequent to the revocation of the licences; however, emphasis was placed by the Respondent on the fact that the Municipality was under a duty ultimately to appoint an interim provider for the heating in R\u0113zekne.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s findings are set out in paragraphs 1034 and 1036 below.\n\n1030.\n\nOn 13 June 2008 the R\u0113zekne City Council appointed its deputy executive director, Mr. Ivars Locis, as the person in charge of organising the provision of heating in the city of R\u0113zekne.1457 The decision indicated that such appointment was temporary, pending the appointment of a new provider.\n\nDecision No. 270, C-30.\n\n1031.\n\nOn the same day Mr. Locis, acting as the person in charge under the Council\u2019s Decision No. 270, made a decision (decision No. 1) as a matter of urgency and appointed *(i)* R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli as the person temporarily in charge of the production of thermal energy and *(ii)* R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as the person temporarily in charge of the transmission, distribution and sale of thermal energy.1458 The decision stated that it would take effect forthwith and an application for judicial review would not stay its enforceability.\n\nC-181.\n\n1032.\n\nThere is no evidence that those decisions were challenged by Latgales Ener\u0123ija (see paragraph 343 above).\n\n1033.\n\nThe Municipality\u2019s decision to appoint the person in charge of the provision of heating supply in the City of R\u0113zekne was stated to be based on Section 28(2) of the Public Utility Regulators Act1459 and was the consequence of the revocation of the licences, which is not in itself a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\nCLA-49. see paragraph 975 footnote 1423 above.\n\n1034.\n\nThis decision does not, therefore, in itself constitute a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n1035.\n\nThe appointment of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija by Mr. Locis was not only, however, one of the consequences following from the revocation of the licences.1460 It represents the extension and the further formalisation of the Municipality\u2019s initiative taken back in September 2007 to replace the investor by a local entity under the Municipality\u2019s control (see paragraphs 968-969 and 973 above). However, the Tribunal considers that since the decision to revoke the licences does not constitute a breach of Article 3(1) of the Treaty, the measures taken by the Municipality in June 2008 to implement that decision are not in themselves a breach of this provision.\n\nC-181.\n\n1036.\n\nTribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal dismisses the Claimant\u2019s claim.\n\n*b. The decision ordering Latgales Ener\u0123ija to provide immediate access to the leased assets (14 July 2008)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1037.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the Respondent breached its expectations that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would not be required to hand over the leased assets to the Municipality-owned companies. The Claimant complains that the Municipality\u2019s decision ordering Latgales Ener\u0123ija to hand over the assets represented an act of harassment; and that that decision was also made in bad faith. Finally, the decision was made by circumventing the procedure involving the \"responsible person\" and the Municipality relied on its public law powers to that effect, in breach of due process, with a view to regaining control over the heating system. The Respondent has not commented in detail on the different measures taken by the Municipality subsequent to the revocation of the licences; however, emphasis was placed by the Respondent on the fact that the revocation of the licences and the appointment of interim providers for the heating services meant that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had to return the assets.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 1047 below.\n\n1038.\n\nOn 14 July 2008 the R\u0113zekne City Council ordered Latgales Ener\u0123ija immediately to provide access to the boiler houses to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and transfer any other materials required for the production of heating to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija.1461\n\nDecision No. 316, C-33, see also paragraph 349 above.\n\n1039.\n\nThe R\u0113zekne City Council referred to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija as the \"lawful providers of heating services\" and recalled that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was no longer entitled to provide heating services further to the Regulator\u2019s decision revoking the licences and no longer able to perform the Long-Term Agreement, for the termination of which R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had sent a thirty-day termination notice on 28 June 2008. On 27 June 2008 Mr. Locis had requested Latgales Ener\u0123ija to transfer all leased assets on 7 July 2008 to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija, but Latgales Ener\u0123ija had refused to comply with that decision.\n\nThe Council concluded that, on the one hand, it followed from its duty to ensure public heating that it had to ensure access to the heating supply system if the interests of the residents of R\u0113zekne were jeopardised. On the other hand, the rights of use relating to public assets granted to Latgales Ener\u0123ija under the Long-Term Agreement were not absolute and could be limited in certain cases, provided that such limitation was justified by the public interest and complied with the principle of proportionality. The Court found that the existence of a direct threat to the public interest made it unnecessary to hear Latgales Ener\u0123ija on the basis that heating had been stopped on 3 June 2008, and both Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s views and prior conduct indicated that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was opposed to the idea that R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija should be allowed to run the heating system.\n\n1040.\n\nThe decision came into force forthwith, it was to be complied with as a matter of urgency and it expressly stated that any application for judicial review filed with the administrative courts would not stay its enforceability.\n\n1041.\n\nIt is common ground that Latgales Ener\u0123ija refused to comply with this decision of its free will.1462\n\nSee also CWS-4 \u00b6 30.\n\n1042.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s application to have the 14 July 2008 decision set aside was dismissed by the Administrative District Court on 25 May 2010.1463\n\nR-5. see paragraph 397 above.\n\n1043.\n\nThe Municipality decision of 14 July 2008 is not in itself contrary to Article 3(1) of the BIT; the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant\u2019s claim.\n\n1044.\n\nThe Claimant received no unqualified assurance from the Municipality that the Long-Term Agreement would last for a period of 30 years; the Long-Term Agreement contains in particular express terms under which it could be terminated by R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli. Similarly, the Claimant received no unqualified assurance from the Regulator that the licences would be in force for 20 years as they contained express conditions and were stated to be governed by certain Latvian laws and regulations; both the law and the express licence conditions contemplated events which might result in the licences ceasing to be effective before the expiry of the 20-year period. On this basis, the Claimant did not receive any unqualified assurance that the leased assets would not be taken over before such periods had expired. The Claimant\u2019s claim must therefore be dismissed insofar as it is rested on a breach of the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n1045.\n\nThe 14 July 2008 decision appears to be one of the consequences ultimately following from the Regulator\u2019s decision to revoke the licences. The Municipality did not act in bad faith in making that decision.\n\n1046.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s complaint that the Municipality sought to bypass the prerogative of the \"person in charge\" is without merit: by its decision of 27 June 2008 the \"person in charge\"1464 had in fact ordered Latgales Ener\u0123ija to transfer all assets to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija, to which the Municipality\u2019s decision presently under consideration refers. Latgales Ener\u0123ija expressly declined to comply with that decision as stated in its letter of 7 July 2008 on the basis that it had challenged both the Regulator\u2019s decision to revoke the licences and the Regulator\u2019s decision to take over its zone.1465\n\nC-31.\n\nC-32.\n\n1047.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal dismisses the Claimant\u2019s claim.\n\n*c. The Municipality's decision authorising the forcible recovery of the assets (15 September 2008)*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1048.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the Respondent breached its expectations that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would not be required to hand over the leased assets to the Municipality-owned companies and the Municipality\u2019s decision authorising the enforcement of such decision amounted to harassment in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 1050 below.\n\n1049.\n\nOn 15 September 2008 the R\u0113zekne City Council authorised the enforcement of its decision of 14 July 2008 by forcible means.1466 The Council rested its decision on Section 66 of the Administrative Procedure Act, stating that the use of force was necessary due to Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s refusal to comply with the 14 July 2008 decision of its free will, and considering that such was the only means to access the assets leased to Latgales Ener\u0123ija under the Long-Term Agreement; there were no other less intrusive means, and the resort to force was therefore proportionate.\n\nC-186.\n\n1050.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal dismisses the Claimant\u2019s complaint for the same reasons that are stated in paragraphs 1043-1045 above, *mutatis mutandis.* The Municipality\u2019s decision authorising the enforcement of its 14 July 2008 decision by forcible means is not in itself tainted by any breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT, and it relates to a decision which is unobjectionable in itself.\n\n*d. The forcible recovery of the buildings and boilers (16 September 2008)*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1051.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the use of armed police to enforce the Council\u2019s decision was an excessive and inappropriate exercise of public powers, especially considering the fact that the decision to be enforced had been appealed; such excess amounts to a breach of the standard of full protection and security under Article 3(1) of the BIT.1467\n\nThe Respondent counters that Latgales Ener\u0123ija had refused to comply with a decision ordering that the assets be transferred and the Respondent was therefore left with no choice but to enforce that decision; no actual force was used and no evidence was provided by the Claimant as to the alleged use of force.1468\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 1058 below.\n\nRfA\u00b6 114.\n\nResp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. \u00b6 3.25.\n\n1052.\n\nLatgales Ener\u0123ija complained to the Administrative District Court that the forcible enforcement of the 14 July 2008 decision was unlawful; the complaint was dismissed.1469\n\nR-6, see paragraph 396 above.\n\n1053.\n\nThe Claimant alleged that its personnel was forcibly evicted from Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s premises1470 and that \"these executive decisions were enforced by armed local and state police and the Municipality (through its wholly-owned company), who, on 16 September 2008, forcibly entered Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s premises, expelled its employees and appropriated all of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s assets used to operate the heating system\".1471 Counsel for the Claimant in his closing statement simply recalled that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s employees were \"forced off the premises, and you heard Ms. Uskane speak to that\".1472\n\nThe Tribunal notes, first of all, that such allegation was not made in the proceedings challenging the legality of the enforcement of the R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s decision No. 316 by forcible means.1473\n\nRfA \u00b6 119.\n\nCl.

In cross-examination Ms. Usk\u00e1ne confirmed that she was not threatened with a gun.1481\n\nMs. Usk\u00e1ne added that that had been an unpleasant moment with the police1482 and that they filed a complaint with the prosecutor\u2019s office.1483\n\nCWS-4 \u00b6 35.\n\nTranscript.

The Respondent has not challenged the Claimant\u2019s allegation that police officers were armed. No threats were made against any employee. Although it is understandable that such an experience may have alarmed, and perhaps frightened, law-abiding citizens not used to being confronted by police, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence of an excessive exercise of public powers. On the evidence before the Tribunal, the forcible recovery of buildings and boilers remained entirely within the confines of reasonable law enforcement.\n\n1058.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The forcible recovery of buildings and boilers does not, in itself, infringe the full protection and security standard of Article 3(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal dismisses the Claimant\u2019s claim.\n\n1059.\n\nAt this juncture the Tribunal will consider whether the Municipality\u2019s conduct in 2007 and 2008, considered as a whole including those individual measures which the Tribunal found unobjectionable, amounts to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n(viii) *The Cumulative Effects of the Respondent\u2019s Individual Actions*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1060.\n\nThe Claimant claims that if the cumulative effect of the individual measures taken by the Latvian authorities and the Municipality-owned companies is considered, the Tribunal should make a finding of a creeping breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT. The Respondent\u2019s defence is based on the proposition that the Claimant decided to make the investment without any thorough due diligence and must therefore be taken to have assumed identifiable risks in relation to certain aspects of the investment.\n\n1061.\n\nThe enquiry advocated by the Claimant by definition includes acts and measures which, seen in isolation, are not a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.1484\n\n*El Paso v. Argentina,* CLA-3 9 \u00b6\u00b6 515 ff.\n\n1062.\n\nIn the present case, the first acts and measures considered by the Tribunal, following the chronology, were found to be inconsistent with the obligations under Article 3(1) of the BIT (in particular the delay by the Municipality to coordinate and approve a heat supply development plan for the City, see paragraphs 886 ff. above; the Municipality\u2019s failure to direct R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli to have the attachment on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s bank account lifted, see paragraph 973 above; the Municipality\u2019s ultimatum in order that Latgales Ener\u0123ija provide heating services within 24 hours, see paragraph 973 above and the establishment of a new wholly-owned subsidiary with the intention to replace Latgales Ener\u0123ija, see paragraph 987).\n\nHowever, other measures were found by the Tribunal to be unobjectionable under Article 3(1) of the BIT as long as they were considered in isolation; the most important measure is the revocation of the licences (see paragraphs 1004 and 1024 above) and the decisions taken subsequently to implement the revocation and have the Assets returned to R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli.\n\n1063.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the approach advocated by the Claimant is appropriate as a matter of law and that it is therefore appropriate to revisit the facts according to a more global approach.\n\n1064.\n\nHowever, subject to the following paragraph, having considered the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal is disinclined to find a global breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT in the present case, as the Regulator\u2019s final decision to revoke the licences was based on a concern to protect the public interest and rested on at least one sound ground.\n\n1065.\n\nThe Claimant is nevertheless entitled to succeed on its claim that the Municipality\u2019s actions justifying the claims which the Tribunal granted in paragraphs 887, 973 and 987 above amount to arbitrary measures impairing the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of its investment. In the above paragraphs, the Tribunal has found that the conduct of the Respondent was arbitrary in a manner inconsistent with Article 3(1) of the BIT. As to impairment of the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the Claimant\u2019s investment (as defined in paragraph 521 above) the conduct for which the Respondent is responsible is one of the principal causes that ultimately resulted in the Claimant being unable to recover loans granted to Latgales Ener\u0123ija and having to pay a guarantee in respect of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s unpaid debts to third parties. The Tribunal finds that such conduct and measures on the part of the Municipality amount to arbitrary measures impairing the use, enjoyment or disposal of the Claimant\u2019s investment in breach of Article 3(1), second paragraph, of the BIT.\n\n(C) The Tribunal\u2019s Finding\n--------------------------\n\n1066.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the Respondent has breached Article 3(1) of the BIT based on the specific findings in paragraphs 887, 973, 987 and 1065 above.\n\n**(4) Claim for Expropriation Under Article 4(1) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1067.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the Municipality of R\u0113zekne combined with the Regulator, R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and R\u0113zeknes Ener\u0123ija to give rise to an energy crisis, for which the Regulator and the Municipality then sanctioned Latgales Ener\u0123ija over a period of some twelve months, the ultimate sanction being the revocation of the licences followed by the forcible recovery of buildings and boilers and the termination of the Long-Term Agreement. These actions destroyed the value of the Claimant\u2019s investment. In addition, the Claimant complains of an outright expropriation on 16 September 2008 as the Respondent forcibly took over the leased infrastructure. The Respondent denies any breach of the BIT; it replies that the recovery of buildings and boilers of 16 September 2008 was the lawful enforcement required after Latgales Ener\u0123ija had declined to comply with the 14 July 2008 decision and surrender the assets.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 1101 below.\n\n1068.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s definition of its investment covers two main points:\n\n(i) the shares in Latgales Ener\u0123ija, whose value was rendered worthless by the Respondent\u2019s actions and omissions; and\n\n(ii) the loans and guarantees provided to Latgales Ener\u0123ija, which were not reimbursed, as well as the payment of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli\u2019s debts and the transfer of know how.\n\n1069.\n\nThe Claimant contends that its investment in R\u0113zekne was expropriated by the Respondent in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT without prompt, adequate and effective compensation; such expropriation was not in the public interest and was discriminatory.\n\n1070.\n\nArticle 4 of the BIT reads as follows:\n\nArticle 4\n\nExpropriation and Compensation\n\n1. Neither Contracting Party shall expropriate, nationalize or take similar measures (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party in its territory, unless:\n\na) such expropriation is in the public interest and legal procedure is applied;\n\nb) such expropriation is carried out without discrimination;\n\nc) prompt, adequate and effective compensation is given.\n\n2. The compensation mentioned in point (c) of the paragraph (1) of this Article shall be equivalent to the market value of the expropriated investments immediately before the expropriation occurred or the impending expropriation became public knowledge and shall be paid without undue delay. The compensation shall include interest calculated on the LIBOR basis from the date of expropriation. The compensation shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable.\n\n3. Investors, whose assets are being expropriated, have a right to prompt review by the appropriate judicial or administrative authorities of the expropriating Contracting Party to determine whether such expropriation, and any compensation therefor conforms to the principles of this Article and the laws of the expropriating Contracting Party.\n\n4. Investors of one Contracting Party who suffer losses in respect of their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war, a state of national emergency, insurrection, riot or other similar events, shall be accorded by the other Contracting Party. treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investors of any third State. Any resulting compensation shall be paid without undue delay and shall be freely transferable.\n\n1071.\n\nThe Tribunal has to determine whether the Respondent expropriated the Claimant\u2019s investment directly, on 16 September 2008, or indirectly, in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\n(A) The Applicable Standard of Treatment\n----------------------------------------\n\n1072.\n\nA State may expropriate an investment directly under Article 4(1), by transfer of title (\"outright taking\"), or indirectly, by measures that fall short of a direct taking. This last point is made clear by the expression \"or similar measures\" in Article 4(1).\n\n1073.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Article 4(1) offers protection in the case of so-called \"creeping expropriation\", where the host State achieves \"the same result\" as with an outright taking of property.1485 As the *Generation Ukraine* tribunal observed, such form of expropriation takes place in a situation where \"a series of acts attributable to the State *over a period of time* culminate in the expropriatory taking of such property\".1486\n\nAmerican Law Institute, *Restatement (Third) Foreign Relations of the United* (1987) as quoted in: C. McLachlan, L. Shore, M. Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles,* Oxford 2007, CLA-8 \u00b6 8.78.\n\n*Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine,* CLA-30 \u00b6 20.22 (original emphasis).\n\n1074.\n\nIndirect expropriation requires a *certain degree of interference with the investment* on the part of the State. Commentators have used various formulae to express this requirement: in order to amount to expropriation, such interference has to be unreasonable, to cause the investment to be neutralized or useless and to cause the investor to be practically deprived, in whole or in significant part, of the use and enjoyment of its investment.1487\n\nL.Y. Fortier and S. Drymer, \"Indirect Expropriation and the Law of International Investment: I Know It When I See It\". 19 ICSID Review 293, CL A-10 p. 305.\n\n1075.\n\nThe arbitral decisions involving indirect expropriation have similarly focussed on the degree of State interference.1488 The test adopted by the *Tecmed* tribunal was whether the investor \"was radically deprived of the economical use and enjoyment of its investments, as if the rights related thereto (...) had ceased to exist (...) the measures adopted by a State, whether regulatory or not, are an indirect de fact expropriation if they are irreversible and permanent and if the assets or rights subject to such measure have been affected in such a way that \"... any form of exploitation thereof...\" has disappeared\".1489 The *Tecmed* tribunal added a statement which is relevant to shareholders\u2019 claims: \"Under international law the owner is also deprived of property where the use or enjoyment of benefits related thereto is exacted or interfered with to a similar extent (..,)\".1490\n\n*Pope & Talbot v. Canada,* RLA-13/CLA-43 \u00b6\u00b6 99-104, especially \u00b6 102.\n\nSee *Tecmed v. Mexico,* CLA-17 \u00b6\u00b6 115-116; see also *Siemens* v. *Argentina,* CLA-11 \u00b6\u00b6 267-273.\n\n*ibidem.*\n\n1076.\n\nTribunals have found that no indirect expropriation could be found to exist *(i)* where the State\u2019s interference with the investor\u2019s business was reasonable1491 or *(ii)* where the investor was still able to operate and benefit from its investment.1492 This approach was followed in the BG *Group* award.1493\n\n*Genin v. Estonia,* CLA-28 \u00b6 363; see also paragraph 1080 below on *\"regulatory expropriation'.*\n\n*Pope & Talbot v. Canada,* RLA-13/CLA-43 \u00b6\u00b6 99-104, especially \u00b6\u00b6 100-102.\n\nSee *BG Group v. Argentina,* CLA-12 \u00b6\u00b6 270-271.\n\n1077.\n\nIn any event, the fact that an investment has become worthless does not *per se* mean that there was an act of expropriation since investment always entails risk as observed by the *Generation Ukraine* tribunal.1494\n\n*Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine,* CLA-30 \u00b6 20.30.\n\n1078.\n\nCertain tribunals have highlighted as a further aspect of the degree of State interference the *duration* of such interference.1495\n\n*Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* CLA-14;*Tecmed* v. *Mexico,* CLA-17 \u00b6 116.\n\n1079.\n\nIn order to determine whether the measures taken by a State amount to expropriation, the *effect* of such measures on the investment is often regarded as a crucial test. Whereas it has been said that \"[t]he government\u2019s intention is less important than the effect of the measures on the owner of the assets\", some relevance must be attached to *intention,* as observed by the Tribunal in paragraph 829 above, and any evidence of expropriatory intention should be carefully weighed.1496\n\n*Tecmed v. Mexico,* CLA-17 \u00b6 116.\n\n1080.\n\nStates have often raised the defence that where a general regulation enacted in the public interest interferes with an investment, it is within the State\u2019s \"police powers\" and it does not amount to an expropriation under international law provided that it is not discriminatory. Such a defence has been raised by the host State both in cases in which the measure was in the form of a general regulation (such as in *Pope & Talbot)* and in cases in which it is an individual decision made in relation to one particular investor, such as a decision to revoke a licence or an authorisation (as in *Tecmed).*\n\n1081.\n\nThe tribunal in *Genin* v. *Estonia* found that the revocation of a banking licence, although it was stated to be based on very technical grounds, was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory and was justified considering the serious and reasonable misgivings expressed by the Central Bank of Estonia regarding the investor\u2019s management, its operations and its investments; the investor\u2019s claims made under the US-Estonia BIT were rejected, including a claim for unlawful expropriation.1497\n\n*Genin v. Estonia,* CLA-28 \u00b6\u00b6 361, 363, 365, 369-371.\n\n1082.\n\nThe NAFTA tribunal in *Feldman* v. *Mexico* stated that:1498\n\n[I]t is much less clear [than defining direct expropriation] when governmental action that interferes with broadly-defined property rights - an \"investment\" under NAFTA. Article 1139 - crosses the line from valid regulation to a compensable taking, and it is fair to say that no one has come up with a fully satisfactory means of drawing this line.\n\n*Marvin Feldmann v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/l, 16 December 2002, RLA-5 \u00b6 100 (no expropriation found).\n\n1083.\n\nIn spite of this difficulty, investment tribunals, in particular since *Saluka* and *Methanes,* have endorsed the principle that legitimate regulatory action cannot be regarded as compensable \"expropriation\". In this respect, in the *Saluka* case, the tribunal held with reference to the BIT between the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic that:1499\n\nIt is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner *bona fide* regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.\n\n*Saluka* v. *Czech Republic,* CLA-21 \u00b6 255.\n\n1084.\n\nIt further found that:1500\n\n[T]he principle that a State does not commit an expropriation and is thus not liable to pay compensation to a dispossessed alien investor when it adopts general regulations that are \"commonly accepted as within the police power of States\" forms part of customary international law today.\n\n*Saluka* v. *Czech Republic,* CLA-21 \u00b6 262.\n\n1085.\n\nAs a consequence, the tribunal focused on the permissibility of the regulatory State action which, in its view, removed it from the ambit of an indirect expropriation even though in effect it destroyed the value of the investment affected.1501 As a result, the forced administration of a bank in which the Dutch investor had invested was not considered a breach of the prohibition against expropriation contained in the applicable BIT.\n\n*Saluka* v. *Czech Republic,* CLA-21 \u00b6 276: \"(...) in imposing the forced administration of IPB on 16 June 2000 the Czech Republic adopted a measure which was valid and permissible as within its regulatory powers, notwithstanding that the measure had the effect of eviscerating Saluka\u2019s investment in IPB\".\n\n1086.\n\nThe *Saluka* tribunal largely relied on the reasoning of the NAFTA tribunal in the *Methanes* case which had held that:1502\n\n[A]s a matter of general international law. a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which affects, inter alios, a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.\n\n*Methanes Corporation* v. *United States of America.* NAFTA Arbitral Tribunal, Final Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 August 2005, RLA-31 Sect. IV D. \u00b6 7.\n\n1087.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that certain investment tribunals have considered that a balancing of interests may be required. For instance, in *LG&E* the tribunal held:1503\n\nIn order to establish whether State measures constitute expropriation (...), the Tribunal must balance two competing interests: the degree of the measure\u2019s interference with the right of ownership and the power of the State to adopt its policies.\n\n*LG&E v. Argentina,* CLA-31 \u00b6 189.\n\n1088.\n\nHowever, it then added (albeit, invoking a proportionality test, which is controversial):1504\n\nWith respect to the power of the State to adopt its policies, it can generally be said that the State has the right to adopt measures having a social or general welfare purpose. In such a case, the measure must be accepted without any imposition of liability, except in cases where the State\u2019s action is obviously disproportionate to the need being addressed. The proportionality to be used when making use of this right was recognized in *Tecmed,* which observed that \"whether such actions or measures arc proportional to the public interest presumably protected thereby and the protection legally granted to investments, taking into account that the significance of such impact, has a key role upon deciding the proportionality.\n\n*LG&E v. Argentina,* CLA-31 \u00b6 195.\n\n(B) Whether the Respondent Is in Breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1089.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider the Claimant\u2019s claim that the investment was expropriated on 16 September 2008 in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding is set out in paragraph 1098 below.\n\n1090.\n\nThe recovery of the buildings and boilers by personnel of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli and local police that took place on 16 September 2008 cannot be viewed in isolation as it was based on the R\u0113zeknes City Council\u2019s decision No. 449 of 15 September 20081505 that allowed the enforcement of the Council\u2019s previous decision of 14 July 20081506 ordering Latgales Ener\u0123ija to surrender the assets; this decision was in turn based on the Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 decision to revoke the licences.1507 The Claimant has itself relied on the date of 3 June 2008 as the \"primary date for the expropriation of its investment\" in support of its claim for damages.1508 One must therefore consider these decisions before deciding whether the 16 September 2008 events amount to an unlawful expropriation.\n\nC-186.\n\nC-33.\n\nC-33.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 344.\n\n1091.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was deprived of the right to provide heating services in the City of R\u0113zekne as a consequence of the Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 decision;1509 the subsequent decisions were required simply to implement that decision as Latgales Ener\u0123ija declined to surrender the assets of its own will. The question is therefore whether the Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 decision was valid and permissible as being within the Regulator\u2019s regulatory police powers despite the effects that it had on the Claimant\u2019s investment. The Respondent has not rested its defence on the concept of \"regulatory expropriation\"; however, that is in substance the defence advanced by the Respondent when it argues that the Municipality and the Regulator were entitled, as a matter of Latvian law, to take the measures they took due to Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to comply with the licence conditions and that such measures do not amount to an unlawful expropriation contrary to Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\nThe Council\u2019s 14 July 2008 decision states the following (C-33 [page 12]): \"Thus, as it results from Regulator\u2019s decision No 10 of 3 June 2008, together with cancellation of the licences the Operator has lost not only the legal grounds to provide heating, but it also cannot perform the activities included in the subject of the Agreement\". The Claimant relies on this date too as the primary date for the expropriation of its investment, Cl. Mem. \u00b6 344.\n\n1092.\n\nThe Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 decision revoking the licences, discussed in paragraphs 1006 ff. above, is based on six main reasons. The Tribunal has found that the revocation of the licences was not against good faith and that the Regulator was entitled to revoke the licences on the basis that *(i)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija had failed to pay the full price of the natural gas from June 2007 onwards, which is an admitted fact, and *(ii)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija had a duty to pay for the natural gas used. The Regulator\u2019s finding that such a failure to pay could give rise to further interruptions in the provision of heating services was not a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n1093.\n\nThe reasons for which the Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 decision does not amount to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT apply *mutatis mutandis* when one turns to the question whether this decision amounts to a breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\nHaving considered Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to pay the full amount for the natural gas over a twelve-month period, the Regulator was justifiably insecure that there would be no further interruptions in heating services in the future. The Tribunal therefore finds that the Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 revoking the licences does not amount to a breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\n1094.\n\nThe Tribunal has already noted that the Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 decision is stated to be based on a number of further reasons which the Tribunal finds not to be persuasive; the presence of such reasons in the Regulator\u2019s decision does not affect the validity of the reason which this Tribunal finds to be a sufficient and valid ground upon which the licences could be revoked.\n\n1095.\n\nThe decisions made by the Municipality further to the Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 decision revoking the licences, in particular the Council\u2019s 14 June 2008 and 15 September 2008 decisions, are mere implementation measures which do not constitute a breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT. The R\u0113zekne City Council\u2019s decision of 14 June 2008 ordering Latgales Ener\u0123ija to surrender the assets is stated to be based on the Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 decision revoking the licences1510 and the 15 September 2008 decision1511 orders the enforcement of the 14 June 2008 decision.\n\nCM3 pp. 1,3.\n\nC-186.\n\n1096.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s submission that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s shares were rendered worthless by the actions of the local Latvian authorities is unproven in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion. This submission is based mainly on the proposition that Latgales Ener\u0123ija was stripped of its licences and of its 30-year concession.1512 However, the Tribunal has found the revocation of the licences not to be inconsistent with Articles 3(1) and 4(1) of the BIT. The burden on the Claimant is to prove *(i)* that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s shares are \"worthless\" despite the continued existence of this company, and *(ii)* that such value is the result of the Respondent\u2019s actions which the Tribunal has found to be in breach of Art. 3(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to discharge that burden.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 342-343.\n\n1097.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s contention that the Respondent\u2019s action caused the loss of the value of the loans and guarantees issued in support of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s business has been dealt with by the Tribunal as a matter of Article 3(1) of the BIT (see paragraph 1140 below) and there is therefore no need to discuss this matter under the separate head of expropriation.\n\n1098.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion and Finding. The Regulator acted within its statutory discretion when it revoked the licences. The Respondent\u2019s measures did not therefore constitute an unlawful expropriation contrary to Article 4(1) of the BIT on 16 September 2008 when buildings and boilers were taken over, on 15 September 2008 when the forcible enforcement of the 14 July 2008 decision was ordered, on 14 July 2008 when Latgales Ener\u0123ija was ordered to surrender the infrastructure or on 3 June 2008 when the licences were revoked.\n\n1099.\n\nThe Tribunal further dismisses the Claimant\u2019s claim for unlawful expropriation insofar as it is based on an alleged creeping expropriation.\n\n1100.\n\nThe Claimant has relied on the measures taken by the Municipality and/or the Regulator, through action or inaction, from the beginning of 2006 until 16 September 2008. As the Tribunal found that the Regulator\u2019s 3 June 2008 decision revoking the licences and the Municipality\u2019s 14 June and 15 September 2008 decisions do not constitute a violation of Arts. 3(1) and 4(1) of the BIT, it may be doubtful whether there is any scope left, as a matter of law, in order for the Claimant to argue that the measures taken by the Respondent, considered as a whole, amount to a creeping expropriation. The Municipality\u2019s conduct in 2006 and 2007 and the Regulator\u2019s conduct in 2007 were unfair and inequitable in a number of respects and amount, in any event, to arbitrary measures impairing the enjoyment of the Claimant\u2019s investment. Such breaches did not, however, have an expropriatory effect; in particular, the Regulator\u2019s 13 October 2006 decision dismissing the new rates proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija was based *inter alia* on Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s failure to substantiate its costs. If the Tribunal considers the Municipality\u2019s and the Regulator\u2019s conduct in the wider context of a period ending on 16 September 2008, the conclusion is the same.\n\n(C) The Tribunal\u2019s Finding\n--------------------------\n\n1101.\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses the Claimant\u2019s claim based on a breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\n**(5) Claims for Breach of the Most Favoured Nation Clause Under Article 3(2) of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1102.\n\nThe Claimant finally complains of a breach by the Respondent of Article 2(2) and Article 3(1) of the Latvia-Romania BIT1513 which it considers applicable as a result of the Treaty\u2019s MFN Clause contained in Article 3(2) of the BIT.\n\nLatvia-Romania BIT, CLA-22.\n\n1103.\n\nArticle 3(2) of the BIT reads as follows:\n\nArticle 3\n\nProtection and Treatment of Investments\n\n2. Each Contracting Party, subject to its laws and international agreements, shall accord to the investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party' treatment no less favourable than that accorded to the investments made by investors of any third State.\n\n1104.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the Latvia-Romania BIT read as follows:1514\n\nArticle 2\n\nPromotion, Admission\n\n(1) (...)\n\n(2) When a Contracting Party' shall have admitted an investment in its State territory, it shall, in accordance with its national laws and regulations, grant the necessary permits in connection with such an investment, including authorisations for engaging top managerial and technical personnel of their choice, regardless of citizenship, on a non-discriminatory basis.\n\nArticle 3\n\nProtection. Treatment\n\n(1) Each Contracting Party' shall protect within its State territory investments made in accordance with its national law s and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party' and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale or liquidation of such investments. In particular, each Contracting Party' or its competent authorities shall issue the necessary authorisations mentioned in Article 2, paragraph (2) of this Agreement.\n\nLatvia-Romania BIT, CLA-22.\n\n1105.\n\nAccording to Article 2(2) and Article 3(1) of the Latvia-Romania BIT, the duty on the host State to grant the necessary permits in connection with an admitted investment is based on the law of the host State. Investment tribunals have interpreted similar provisions contained in BITs as meaning that \"[a]ll that an investor may expect is that the law be applied\".1515\n\n*MTD v. Chile,* CLA-18 \u00b6 205.\n\n1106.\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses the Claimant\u2019s claim based on the Latvia-Romania BIT.\n\n1107.\n\nFirst, it is doubtful that the concept of a \"necessary permit\" or \"necessary authorisation\" \"in connection with the investment\" is to be interpreted and construed so as to include the heat supply development plan for the City of R\u0113zekne, which is part of the management and planning duties of the Municipality; this document was not, in any event, issued by the Municipality as a permit and does not represent an authorisation allowing any particular action on the part of the Operator.\n\n1108.\n\nSecondly, it is similarly doubtful that the Regulator\u2019s decisions approving a new tariff proposed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija falls in the category of permits contemplated by the provisions prayed in aid by the Claimant. The Claimant\u2019s position has not been substantiated in this respect.\n\n1109.\n\nThirdly, any necessary permits have to be granted by the host State only \"in accordance with its national laws and regulations\". Therefore, the granting or issuing of permits has to be made only provided that it is in accordance with national law.\n\n1110.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has found that the Regulator was entitled to revoke the licences as a matter of Latvian law and that such decision does not amount to a breach of Article 3(1) and Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\n1111.\n\nThus, the Tribunal does not have to examine whether the MFN clause of the Treaty may be read so as to allow the Claimant to invoke Article 2(2) and Article 3(1) of the Latvia-Romania BIT.\n\n1112.\n\nThe Parties have abstained from addressing this issue and the Tribunal notes that, although the question does not concern the controversial *Maffezini* issue whether and to what extent procedural benefits can be imported via an MFN clause, the specific formulation of the MFN clause making a host State\u2019s obligation to grant MFN treatment \"subject to its laws and international agreements\" casts doubt whether it can be relied upon to import standards contained in other treaties at all because it may be limited to *de facto* treatment under national law.\n\n**E. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1113.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Respondent has breached of Article 3(1) of the BIT as found by the Tribunal in paragraph 1066 above.\n\n**VIII.** ***QUANTUM***\n-----------------------\n\n1114.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will first restate the Parties\u2019 prayers for relief on *quantum*\n\n(A) before summarizing the respective cases on *quantum* submitted by the Claimant\n\n(B) and the Respondent (C). The Tribunal will then state the reasons for its decision on *quantum* (D) before setting out its decision (E).\n\n**A. The Parties\u2019 Prayers for Relief on** *Quantum*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant**\n--------------------\n\n1115.\n\nThe Claimant sought damages in an amount of EUR 8,390,000.1516 After the Hearing the Claimant filed a third Expert Report in which this amount was reduced to EUR 7,800,000 (in case the appropriate control premium was found to be 20%), or, alternatively, EUR 7,440,000 (in case the appropriate control premium was found to be 10%), excluding pre-judgment interest.1517 This amount is broadly in line with the minimum amount set out in the Request for Arbitration (EUR 7,000,000);1518 the Claimant\u2019s submissions filed subsequent to the Request for Arbitration contain claims for higher amounts (EUR 9,820,0001519 and EUR 8,380,0001520).\n\nCl.

Recourse must therefore be had to the principles of customary international law and reliance is placed on the decision of the PCIJ in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case and on Articles 31 ff. of the 2001 ILC Articles. Because the BIT prohibits *prima facie* any expropriation and the Claimant\u2019s investment has been expropriated unlawfully, it follows that the compensation must not be limited to the value of the undertaking; the Claimant is entitled to \"full reparation\" for the injury caused by the Respondent\u2019s internationally wrongful acts.1521\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 326 ff.\n\n(A) Calculation of the Claimant\u2019s Loss dui to Unlawful Expropriation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1119.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its investment in Latvia has been rendered worthless by Latvia\u2019s breaches of the BIT, as a consequence of which Latgales Ener\u0123ija was stripped of its licences and its 30-year concession under the Long-Term Agreement. The measure of the loss is represented by the difference between the value of Latgales Ener\u0123ija, had those breaches not occurred, and Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s market value as at 3 June 2008 (or, alternatively, as at 16 September 2008).\n\n1120.\n\nThe Claimant relies on Dr. Hesmondhalgh\u2019s Expert Reports, based on a DCF analysis in order to value E energija\u2019s investment as at 3 June 2008; the total compensation for the expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s investment was of EUR 9,460,000 according to Dr. Hesmondhalgh\u2019s first Expert Report.1522 Dr. Hesmondhalgh reviewed Mr. Peer\u2019s first Expert Report and revised her estimate of damages downwards from EUR 9,240,000 to EUR 7,970,000 (when using a 10% control premium) in her second Expert Report; the amounts set out in Dr. Hesmondhalgh\u2019s third Expert Report are EUR 7,800,000 (when using a 20% control premium) and EUR 7,440,000 (when using a 10% control premium).\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 342 ff.  \nDr. Hesmondhalgh\u2019s first Expert Report calculates the full amount of compensation at EUR 9,820,000 and the amount of damages arising from the Regulator\u2019s refusal to accept a new tariff at EUR 320,000. The first Expert Report determined the market value of the Claimant\u2019s 58% shares in Latgales Ener\u0123ija at EUR 5,280,000 (based on a 20% control premium); in addition, compensation should include *(i)* the revenue attributable to the sale of excess carbon credits (EUR 70,000), *(ii)* compensation for the written-off loans and the called-upon guarantee in an amount of EUR 1,310,000 and EUR 1,860,000 respectively and *(iii)* the costs to keep Latgales Ener\u0123ija in existence (EUR 940,000).\n\n1121.\n\nThe Claimant made a number of specific points in its Reply Memorial on *quantum.* On the repayment of the loans, it contended that even if Latgales Ener\u0123ija had made no profits after June 2008, the loans would have been repaid in the ordinary course of business since the repayments were provided for by the heat tariffs.1523 In relation to the \"ongoing administrative costs\", they would not have been incurred if Latgales Ener\u0123ija had been permitted to continue with its business and operate the system. In its Memorial the Claimant explained that such costs were incurred because it was \"not possible to initiate insolvency proceedings\",1524 an explanation which was not restated in the Claimant\u2019s Reply.1525\n\nCl.

The Respondent further submits that the Claimant has failed to show that the remaining part of the alleged damage was caused by the alleged breach of the BIT, and objects that the Claimant\u2019s approach is further flawed by attempts at doublecounting and a disregard for the mitigation duty binding on any claimant.1529 The Respondent has not further dealt with the Claimant\u2019s case on *quantum* and has referred to KPMG\u2019s First and Second Expert Reports.\n\nResp.

P-H (PO8) \u00b6 23.\n\n**D. The Reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on** *Quantum*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Principles**\n----------------------\n\n1126.\n\nThe Tribunal found that there is no compensable expropriation in the present case, but that the Respondent has breached Article 3(1) of the BIT1531 in a number of respects.1532\n\nBIT, CLA-1.\n\nThe most important breaches are as follows: *(i)* the delayed approval of the heat supply development plan for the City in the period from 20 January 2006 to 20 September 2007; *(ii)* the Regulator\u2019s inability to consider Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s proposals for a new tariff in 2007 caused by the delayed approval of the heat supply development plan for the City: *(iii)* certain aspects of the Municipality\u2019s conduct during the October 2007 energy crisis.\n\n1127.\n\nThe provisions of the BIT deal with compensation in relation only to expropriation (Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT); they are silent, in particular, as to compensation for breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT amount to an internationally wrongful act as this provision gives rise to an international obligation on the Respondent and the Tribunal has found the breaches of this provision to be attributable to the Respondent (Article 2 of the ILC Articles1533).\n\nUnder Article 31 of the ILC Articles the State responsible for an internationally wrongful act must make \"full reparation for the injury caused\" by such act; that is also the principle set out by the PCIJ in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* decision.1534 In the present case it is common ground that reparation must take the form of financial compensation or damages.\n\nILC Articles, CLA-7.\n\n*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w,* 13 September 1928, PCIJ Series A, No. 17 *('Chorz\u00f3w\"),* CLA-23.\n\n1128.\n\nFinancial compensation of the damage caused by an internationally wrongful act \"shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established\" (Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles).\n\n1129.\n\nIn order to be recoverable, the damage must have been caused by the State\u2019s internationally wrongful act complained of by the investor, Article 31 of the ILC Articles. Causation is, similarly, a requirement in the PCIJ decision in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* decision as expressed by the formula \"as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\".1535 The requirement of causation has been applied in a number of awards in investment disputes.1536 The burden of proof in relation to causation is on the Claimant.1537\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w,* CLA-23 p. 47 (emphasis supplied).\n\nSee *e.g.* *Tradex Hellas* v. *Albania,* CLA-26 \u00b6 200, referring to *ELSI,* CLA-24 ; *Saluka v.

Clause 3 of this agreement provides that following such payment the Claimant \"shall have no claims to property\" of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s contention that the Parties settled all their differences \"under legal documents concluded up to that date\" and that this agreement \"gives a wide reference to settling all claims in general\"1539 is based on an impermissible reading of such agreement that does not contain any expression to the effect that all claims between the Claimant and R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli had been finally settled. The Agreement of 25 October 2007 has a subject-matter which is expressly and narrowly defined in relation to a payment intended to permit the cancellation of a note (akin to a charge, a lien or a mortgage) relating to land, and it settles any claims that the Claimant may have had against property of R\u0113zeknes Siltumt\u012bkli. There is no connection between this agreement and the claims made by the Claimant against the Respondent in this arbitration.\n\nResp. P-H (PO8) \u00b6 23 (original emphasis).\n\n1132.\n\nThe expert opinions relied upon by the Claimant are entirely based on the proposition that the Claimant was the victim of an unlawful expropriation in June 2008. The Tribunal finds that this approach is accordingly of little assistance given the finding that the revocation of the licences was justified and does not amount to a compensable expropriation.\n\nThe non-expropriatory damage was dealt with as a fraction of the overall damage caused by the alleged unlawful expropriation and the Regulator\u2019s refusal to accept a new tariff in the period from October 2006 to October 2007, corresponding to an amount of EUR 360,000 according to the Dr. Hesmondhalgh\u2019s first Expert Report.\n\n1133.\n\nThe Tribunal must next consider the Claimant\u2019s contentions that \"Latvia is in breach of various treaty obligations, all of which stem from the same set of facts and produce the same end result: E energija\u2019s investment in Latvia has been rendered completely worthless by the actions of the local Latvian authorities\"1540 and that, with specific reference to Latvia\u2019s breaches of the BIT provisions other than Article 4(1), \"the damages flowing from the expropriation of E energija\u2019s investment overlap to a large degree with those flowing from Latvia\u2019s other breaches of the BIT\"1541 and that \"Latvia\u2019s breaches of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard, including the obligation of full security and protection, and its application of arbitrary and discriminatory measures all resulted in the same outcome: Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s licences were stripped from it and the Long-Term Agreement terminated\".1542\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6 359.\n\n1134.\n\nThe Claimant thereby contends in essence that the damage it suffered is the same, whether the Tribunal finds that there was an unlawful expropriation or a creeping breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard having expropriatory effects, the assumption being that the Tribunal will find at least one or the other. The Tribunal finds this approach to be inconsistent with its findings whereby the Regulator\u2019s revocation of the licences was justified and whereby only certain actions or omissions of the Respondent breached Article 3(1) of the BIT; the Tribunal did not, in particular, find that the Respondent\u2019s actions were expropriatory if their cumulative effect was considered.\n\n1135.\n\nIt is a matter for the Claimant to prove the damage caused by the Respondent\u2019s breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n1136.\n\nThe Tribunal will first examine whether the Claimant has established that the Respondent\u2019s breaches of Article 3(1) caused its alleged lost profits.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered in particular the following facts: *(i)* the infrastructure of the heating system in R\u0113zekne was old and dilapidated (Mr. Strioga characterised the R\u0113zekne situation as being a \"terrible technical situation\");1543*(ii)* Latgales Ener\u0123ija admittedly did not replace the \"Soviet-type old boilers\" in R\u0113zekne,1544 apart perhaps from the installation of one new Viessmann boiler, but concentrated essentially on repairs and maintenance;1545*(iii)* the Municipality\u2019s heat supply development plan for the City contemplated the reconstruction of boiler houses, but spelled out that the operator\u2019s \"investment into the reconstruction of heating boilers should not affect the increase in tariffs\" as it was the Municipality\u2019s expectation that gas consumption for generation and auxiliary heating consumption would drop significantly after the reconstruction;1546*(iv)* the Long-Term Agreement and the February 2005 had opened a new page in the history of local administration which had not ever dealt with a private investor before 2005, and the contracts signed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija contained few specific assurances with respect to the Claimant\u2019s investment on the part of the Municipality, and none on the part of the Regulator that was not privy to such contracts; and *(v)* cogeneration was not covered by the contracts signed by Latgales Ener\u0123ija and the terms of such contracts do not warrant a finding that the Municipality was under a contractual duty to Latgales Ener\u0123ija to proceed with a cogeneration project, as the Tribunal has found.\n\nHaving considered the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant has not discharged its burden of proof in relation to the existence of future profits. The Tribunal has also found that the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proof in relation to the allegation that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s shares have become worthless due to the breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT found by the Tribunal (see paragraph 1096 above).\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 8/1-7.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 8/4-9/17 [Strioga].\n\nAs acknowledged in the 30 October 2007 letter to the Regulator, C-153 p. 6, \u00b6 21.\n\nC-213 p. 24.\n\n1137.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant is entitled to compensation for the actual proven losses *(damnum emergens)* suffered as a consequence of the Respondent\u2019s breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n1138.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the claim relating to the \"administrative costs\" to maintain Latgales Ener\u0123ija after 3 June 2008 or 16 September 2008. The Claimant has failed to give a compelling explanation for what appears to be essentially a commercial decision made in its own interest to continue to fund Latgales Ener\u0123ija, rather than a decision dictated by requirements of Latvian law; if any such requirements dictated such decisions, the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proof in this respect.\n\n1139.\n\nThe Claimant has considered the damage caused by the Respondent\u2019s breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT separately from the damage caused by the alleged unlawful expropriation only to a limited extent, namely under the heading of the \"2006/2007 damages\".1547 These damages are to compensate the Claimant for the losses allegedly suffered as a consequence of the Regulator\u2019s 13 October 2006 decision denying Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s proposal for a new tariff. However, the Tribunal found that the Regulator\u2019s 13 October 2006 decision does not amount to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this claim.\n\nER Hesmondhalgh I p. (iv), \u00b6\u00b6 11 ff.; 63.\n\n1140.\n\nThe Tribunal must next consider the amount of EUR 3,170,000,1548 represented by loans made to Latgales Ener\u0123ija in an amount of EUR 1,310,000,1549 and a guarantee paid to Danske Bank in respect of Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s debts, in an amount of EUR 1,860,000.1550 These figures were not challenged by the Respondent or the Respondent\u2019s expert.1551 The Respondent has objected that Latgales Ener\u0123ija would not have been able to repay the loan based on Mr. Peer\u2019s revised cash flow estimates1552 and that there was no evidence that the Claimant had paid the amount of the guarantee to Danske Bank.\n\nER Hesmondhalgh I p. iv \u00b6\u00b6 2(iii); p. 18 \u00b6 64; ER Hesmondhalgh II p.

The Respondent\u2019s first objection is therefore without merit insofar as it fails to take into account the distinction between actual losses and lost profits.\n\n1142.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s second objection relating to the payment by the Claimant of the amount of the guarantee provided to Danske Bank, such objection has already been dismissed by the Tribunal (see paragraph 410 above).\n\n1143.\n\nThe Tribunal must now determine whether the Claimant is entitled to a sum of EUR 3,170,000 in consideration of the fact that, on the basis of the totality of the evidence before the Tribunal, such loss arises from a conjunction of different causes. Whereas the Tribunal has found that the Municipality significantly contributed to the difficult situation in which Latgales Ener\u0123ija found itself, and did so deliberately and in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT, the Tribunal has also found that the Claimant\u2019s losses were caused by the fact that Latgales Ener\u0123ija\u2019s heating business came to an end due to its decision to stop paying the full price for the natural gas used and the revocation of the licences by the Regulator that followed, which the Tribunal found not to amount to a breach of Latvia\u2019s obligation under the BIT.\n\n1144.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore determine to what extent the Claimant\u2019s actual loss was caused by the Respondent\u2019s breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT. Having weighed all the evidence examined in the present Award, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant and the Respondent have contributed to the losses suffered by the Claimant to an extent that is, all in all, broadly equivalent and that the Claimant should therefore be awarded 50% of the actual losses mentioned above.\n\n1145.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore awards the Claimant a sum of EUR 1,585,000 (50% of EUR 3,170,000) as financial compensation for the damage caused by the Respondent\u2019s internationally wrongful act.\n\n**(2) Interest**\n----------------\n\n(A) The Claimant\u2019s Position\n---------------------------\n\n1146.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Tribunal should depart from Article 4(2) of the BIT insofar as this provision contemplates a calculation of interest based on the LIBOR basis with respect to the compensation to be paid by the Respondent for a lawful expropriation; the Claimant argues that a departure from this provision is justified on the basis that its claim is for unlawful expropriation.\n\n1147.\n\nThe date from which interest should be awarded is the date of expropriation1553 or the date on which the loss was incurred.1554\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 364.\n\nCl. Skeleton \u00b6 23(3).\n\n1148.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the LIBOR rate has dropped so considerably after 2008 as to be inappropriate for the calculation of interest. The Claimant suggests a rate of interest that reflects the interest that it must pay on its borrowings, to be compounded quarterly. Interest should be awarded at the following yearly rates and should be compounded quarterly: 6.58% for 2008, 4.36% for 2009, 3.73% for 2010, 4.13% for 2011 and 2.56% for 2012 until the date of the final award, and at the rate of 2.56%, compounded quarterly, from the date of the award until payment by the Respondent.1555\n\nCl.

Skeleton \u00b6 23.\n\n(B) The Respondent\u2019s Position\n-----------------------------\n\n1149.\n\nThe Respondent has not answered the Claimant\u2019s case on interest.\n\n(C) The Tribunal\u2019s Reasons\n--------------------------\n\n1150.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that interest on the sum awarded is due and the Tribunal is satisfied that the rates claimed by the Claimant are more appropriate than the LIBOR rate; the Respondent has not challenged those rates. In any event, the LIBOR rate applies to expropriation under Article 4(2) of the BIT and the Tribunal has found that there is no compensable expropriation in the present case, so that there would be no compelling reason to apply a LIBOR-based interest in the present case.\n\n1151.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case for compound interest has remained unchallenged throughout these proceedings. The Tribunal finds that simple interest would not represent reparation for the injury caused. The Tribunal will therefore award compound interest. The Tribunal notes, however, that the Claimant has not provided any substantive reasons in support of its claim that interest should be compounded quarterly other than the proposition that \"any interest should be compounded quarterly, since to award simple interest would not reflect commercial reality\".1556. In the absence of any reason that justifies granting quarterly compounding, the Tribunal takes the view that annual compounding would be appropriate in view of recent trends in investment arbitration.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 365.\n\n1152.\n\nThe date from which interest is awarded is 1 January 2008 as the Claimant has failed to indicate any interest rate for the year 2007.\n\n(D) Tribunal\u2019s Finding on Interest\n----------------------------------\n\n1153.\n\nThe Tribunal awards interest on the sum of EUR 1,585,000 as from 1 January 2008, to be compounded annually, at the following rates: 6.58% for 2008, 4.36% for 2009, 3.73% for 2010, 4.13% for 2011 and 2.56% for 2012 until the date of the final award, and at the rate of 2.56%, compounded annually, from the date of the award until payment by the Respondent.\n\n**E. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on** *Quantum*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1154.\n\nThe Tribunal awards the Claimant a sum of EUR 1,585,000 (one million five hundred eighty-five thousand Euro) with interest thereon as from 1 January 2008, to be compounded annually, at the following rates: 6.58% for 2008, 4.36% for 2009, 3.73% for 2010, 4.13% for 2011 and 2.56% for 2012 until the date of the final award, and at the rate of 2.56%, compounded annually, from the date of the award until payment by the Respondent.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n1155.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s prayer for relief with respect to its costs is set out in paragraphs 442 and 443 above. The Claimant sought an award of costs in a total amount of EUR 3,083,279.25, including a success fee, or, alternatively, an award of costs in a total amount of EUR 1,688,928.85, without a success fee.\n\n1156.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s prayer for relief with respect to its costs is set out in paragraphs 447 and 448 above. The Respondent sought an award of costs in an amount of no less than EUR 166,555.28.\n\n1157.\n\nThe Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n1158.\n\nArticle 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules states that the award shall contain any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceedings.\n\n1159.\n\nAbsent agreement between the Parties, the Tribunal has broad discretion under these provisions to decide which Party bears the costs of the arbitration and to which extent.\n\n1160.\n\nThe Tribunal must exercise its discretion judicially and consider the Parties\u2019 positions as a whole. Prof. Reinisch has set out the criteria which a tribunal should take into account in the exercise of its discretion in his dissenting opinion and the Tribunal is broadly in agreement with the presentation of such criteria. The main question arising for determination in the present case is not, however, what such criteria should be, but how they should be applied to the circumstances of the present case.\n\n1161.\n\nThe Claimant succeeded with its claim for a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT, but its claim for breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT as well as all other claims were dismissed. All claims were made to seek compensation for one and the same alleged damage. The Claimant\u2019s success on its Article 3(1) claim was clear-cut, especially in so far as the Municipality\u2019s delay in dealing with the heat supply development plan was concerned. The further aspects of this claim required a number of facts to be disentangled and analysed in relation to the conduct of the Municipality in the context of the October 2007 energy crisis, but the breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT by the Municipality found by the Tribunal was similarly a clear breach.\n\n1162.\n\nThe assistance which the Respondent provided to the Tribunal was limited, not only due to the brief pleadings which discussed the documentary evidence in the most perfunctory manner, but also to the absence of any witnesses presented by the Respondent to explain the Municipality\u2019s conduct.\n\n1163.\n\nThe Claimant succeeded with its claim for damages only to an extent of approximately 15-22% (depending on whether one considers the amount of the original claim for EUR 7 million or the higher claim for EUR 9.82 million, excluding the claim for costs).\n\n1164.\n\nEach Party has defended its case in good faith in these proceedings.\n\n1165.\n\nIn these circumstances and considering that the claims were not frivolous, were pursued and defended in good faith and with all due expedition, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant is in principle entitled to be awarded costs and finds that the Respondent should be ordered to pay a fair share of the Claimant\u2019s costs. The Tribunal determines that such fair share shall be 50% of the costs incurred by the Claimant, to the exclusion of any success fee, subject to an examination of the amounts claimed.\n\n1166.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\nArbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses\n\nDr. Paolo Michele Patocchi 439,869.94\n\nProf. Dr. August Reinisch 105,052.24\n\nMr. Samuel Wordsworth QC 54,372.88\n\nICSID\u2019s administrative fees 160,000.00\n\nDirect expenses 83,645.35\n\n**Total 842,940.41**\n\n1167.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.1557 As a result, each Party\u2019s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 421,470.21.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n1168.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant shall be entitled to 50% of the amounts of EUR 744,946 (legal fees and expenses of Salans/Vinson & Elkins), EUR 300,478 (legal fees and expenses of Sorainen), EUR 29,462 (Dr. Blumberga\u2019s Expert Opinion) and its share of the costs of the arbitration USD 421,470.21 (ICSID/Tribunal) plus the lodging fee (USD 25,000); *i.e.* a total amount of EUR 1,074,886.00 and USD 446,470.21. The Tribunal makes no award of costs with respect to the Expert Reports of Dr. Hesmondhalgh. This amount in turn represents 43% of the amount of costs and fees claimed by the Claimant excluding any success fee.\n\n**X. AWARD**\n------------\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction are denied; the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7(2) of the BIT.\n\n(2) The Respondent breached Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n(3) The Respondent shall pay the Claimant compensation in the amount of EUR 1,585,000 (one million five hundred eighty-five thousand Euro).\n\n(4) The Respondent shall pay the Claimant compound interest on the amount of EUR 1,585,000.00, compounded annually, at the following rates: 6.58% for 2008, 4.36% for 2009, 3.73% for 2010, 4.13% for 2011 and 2.56% for 2012 until the date of the present Award; and at the rate of 2.56%, compounded annually, from the date of the present Award until payment by the Respondent.\n\n(5) The Respondent shall pay the Claimant an amount of EUR 1,074,886.00 for the Claimant's costs and fees.\n\n(6) The Respondent shall pay the Claimant an amount of USD 446,470.21 for the Claimant's share of the costs of the arbitration plus the lodging fee.\n\n(7) All other claims are dismissed."}]}
