(Decision on Jurisdiction)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Introduction**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nAfter exchanging views with my distinguished colleagues in the manner described at paragraph 124 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, I have found that I do not agree with their interpretation of the Treaty. There are many points made in the Decision with which I agree, and other points with which I would have agreed had I concurred with their interpretation, but in the end I have a different view. I do however subscribe to the Decision\u2019s dispositions of the Second Objection, the rejection of the declaration sought in respect of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the deferral of the consideration of the \"contract claims and double recovery\" issue.1\n\nSee Sections X to XII of the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n2.\n\nI can readily see how my colleagues have formed a different view on the MFN issue. The reason why the MFN clause has been invoked of course is that the Respondent has agreed to different investment protection treaties with different arbitral regimes. Had it maintained a single treaty model, the MFN issue would not arise in the first place. Thus, when, as here, the basic treaty requires a claimant to submit the dispute to the respondent\u2019s local courts for a period of time while another treaty concluded by the respondent does not contain the requirement, it is not difficult to conclude that many, if not all, putative claimants would prefer the latter. Some tribunals, including the present one, have agreed, emphasizing the value of such a choice from the claimant\u2019s perspective.2\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 100.\n\n3.\n\nThere is also the pragmatic concern that when an objection such as the instant one is heard, the tribunal has been constituted, at least some pleadings on the merits have been filed, and often, as here, there is a substantial dispute between the parties. In the circumstances it could be seen as a waste of time and money to insist on compliance with the treaty\u2019s conditions on access to international jurisdiction.3 Accordingly, some tribunals have applied the relevant MFN clause and have concluded that their jurisdiction has been established, even though the claimant has not met the conditions stipulated in the treaty\u2019s arbitration clause. I fully appreciate this reasoning and can see the attractiveness of the result, but there are other issues that need to be considered.\n\nThis sentiment is expressed in the Decision at the end of paragraph 88 where the majority considers that: \"While not logically or legally decisive, the fact that adherence to the 18-month rule would bring no necessary benefit, and no necessary result other than the delay of the arbitration proceedings, is a fact from which the Tribunal derives some encouragement to believe that its decision is correct.\"\n\n4.\n\nIt is also the case that when MFN clauses have been invoked by claimants seeking to be relieved of compliance with the basic treaty\u2019s conditions for gaining access to international jurisdiction, tribunals have tended to form judgements about the merits of different treaty structures. The requirements of the basic treaty have sometimes been seen as unduly burdensome to would-be claimants.\n\n5.\n\nThis has been reflected in the majority\u2019s characterizing the \"prior recourse\u2019 step between consultations and international arbitration as \"pointless\", \"to some extent perfunctory and insubstantial\", the 18-month limit for litigation as \"arbitrary\", and the regime\u2019s giving \"no certain benefit\".4\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 51, 87-88.\n\n6.\n\nOne can wonder why the Contracting Parties decided to require the prior submission of a legal dispute to the courts of a Party for a period of 18 months before granting the investor/claimant an unconditional right of direct access to international jurisdiction. At first glance it seems odd that the requirement can be satisfied by the simple effluxion of time without its requiring a decision of at least a court of first instance before the dispute can be elevated to the international level. It is possible that a claim submitted to the local courts might never get to the merits, let alone result in a judgment, during the 18-month period. This would imply no apparent benefit from the prior submission of the dispute to the local courts and an attendant loss of time and expense. The Claimant has argued forcefully that this is the effect of Article 10(3)(a) and the majority accepts this to be the case.5\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 88.\n\n7.\n\nThe 18-month period is plainly a product of compromise between the States Parties. Bearing in mind that under Article 26, second sentence, of the ICSID Convention a Contracting State can require the exhaustion of local remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under the Convention, it is open to two States to agree to a limited recourse to local remedies as a condition of their consent to arbitration under their bilateral treaty. Their having made such a choice, the period selected had to be of sufficient time to permit a Contracting Party\u2019s legal system to at least have an opportunity to address the dispute. A prior recourse provision of say, 6 months would hardly permit any real opportunity for the parties to frame the issues, let alone permit a court to consider the dispute. On the other hand, from a claimant\u2019s perspective, a limited period of time is preferable to a requirement of full exhaustion of local remedies (and 18 months would be seen as preferable to 36 months or more).\n\n8.\n\nMoreover, there are reasons why a \"prior recourse\" stage in the dispute settlement process can contribute to a resolution of a dispute, or at least to a narrowing of the issues in dispute. One cannot rule out the possibility that the local court could uphold the investor\u2019s claim that the measures complained of violate municipal law or that a contested legal right claimed to exist under that law does in fact exist.6 Even if such findings did not lead to a settlement, they would enhance the prospects of success in any subsequent international claim.7 On the other hand, the local courts might find the measures at issue to be lawful. While this would not bind a subsequent international tribunal applying an international treaty, it might lead it to find that there has been no breach of the treaty. It might alternatively lead to a finding that the respondent\u2019s courts have compounded a treaty breach. There are many such examples in the cases.\n\nCampbell McLachlan QC, Laurence Shore and Mathew Weiniger, International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles, (Oxford University Press 2007), p. 257: \"It would be invidious for international tribunals to be finding... that host State adjudication of treaty rights was necessarily inferior to international arbitration.\" One can agree with this assertion about the general utility of local court proceedings even while acknowledging that there will be cases where the local courts cannot adequately adjudicate the dispute. The point is made by the majority in *Renta 4 S.V.S. A. et al v. Russian Federation*, SCC Arbitration V (024/2007), that: \"History is replete with examples of investment disputes which have overwhelmed the capacity of national institutions - in countries of all stages of development - for dispassionate judgment.\" (Award on Preliminary Objections, paragraph 100.)\n\nA claimant that enjoyed some success in the local courts would surely advert to that fact in support of any claimed breach of the treaty. Likewise, if the respondent demonstrated an obstructionist defensive posture in the local proceedings, that too would figure in the way in which a subsequent claim was formulated. It might lead to an additional cause of action.\n\n9.\n\nThe majority acknowledges the possible *res judicata* effect of a local court decision on a subsequent international proceeding but puts that to one side.8 This is an important issue that underlies the interaction between a \"prior recourse\u2019 proceeding and a subsequent international claim and helps to explain its rationale. The late Keith Highet\u2019s dissent in *Waste Management Inc. v. Mexico* set out how, through the application of *res judicata*, the decisions of the local courts can alter the scope of a subsequent international proceeding through the expansion or reduction of the international claim, depending upon how the local courts treat the investor\u2019s local law claim.9 In many investment treaty cases, prior proceedings between the disputing parties have been given *res judicata* effect by international tribunals.10 Thus, an invocation of prior remedies as contemplated in Article 10 can have significant constructive juridical effects for a subsequent international claim or may obviate the need for such a claim.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 49.\n\n*Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/2, Dissenting Opinion of Keith Highet of June 2, 2000, paragraphs 50-51. This analysis was based on a different regime for the initiation of an international claim. The analysis remains on point for the purposes of the current discussion.\n\nSee, for example, *Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Award of July 3, 2008, paragraphs 123-125, 143; *Malicorp Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award of February 7, 2011, paragraph 103.\n\n10.\n\nIt is one thing to determine, based on evidence, that the submission of a particular dispute to the local courts would be futile (an exercise that the Tribunal has not engaged in, although evidence on this point was led by both parties). It is, in my view, quite another thing to make a rather sweeping judgement as to a treaty provision\u2019s utility based on a \"worst-case\" scenario of an assumed useless and expensive recourse to the local courts. It is not the place of international tribunals to second-guess the choices of the States Parties even when one can envisage instances where such choices might lead to inefficiency and additional cost to a would-be claimant. One cannot avoid the fact that the Federal Republic of Germany and the Argentine Republic were satisfied with the inclusion of this provision in their Treaty. Hence, I believe that the majority\u2019s characterization of the prior recourse requirement devalues the States Parties\u2019 policy choice manifested in the Treaty.\n\n11.\n\nOne other point warrants mention at the outset. I agree with the prevailing view that the Treaty\u2019s dispute settlement provisions are to be interpreted neither broadly nor restrictively. As the *Amco Asia et al. v. Indonesia* Decision on Jurisdiction observed, a\n\n... convention to arbitrate is not to be construed *restrictively,* nor, as a matter of fact, *broadly* or *liberally.* It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties: such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle *pacta sunt servanda*, a principle common to, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law.\n\nMoreover, - and this is again a general principle of law - any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by *taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged*.11 [Emphasis in first paragraph in original; emphasis in second paragraph added.]\n\n*Amco Asia et al. v. Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction of September 25, 1983, paragraph 14(i).\n\n12.\n\nWhile the first paragraph of the *Amco Asia* tribunal\u2019s approach is often quoted with approval by investment tribunals, the second paragraph, which is equally relevant, tends not to be cited as frequently. The tribunal postulated a general approach to interpretation not confined to the interpretation of agreements to arbitrate. The Argentina-Germany Treaty\u2019s MFN clause likewise must be construed neither broadly nor restrictively and its interpretation should also take into account the commitments that the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.\n\n13.\n\nWith these introductory points in mind, I turn to the main issues raised in the First Objection.\n\n**The need for an agreement to arbitrate**\n------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nBefore examining the Treaty, I wish to note an important issue on which we are all agreed. At paragraph 22, the Decision correctly notes that the \"Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction depends upon the existence of an agreement between the two parties to the dispute - Hochtief and the Republic of Argentina.\" It is only if such agreement exists that the Tribunal is then vested with jurisdiction to apply the Treaty.\n\n15.\n\nIt is helpful to conceive of the issue in the terms put by the tribunal in *RosinvestCo UK Ltd. v. Russian Federation*, namely, \"Is there a binding consent to arbitration with the effect that a prospective party to the arbitration proceedings does not need the agreement of the other prospective party to start arbitration proceedings?\"12\n\n*RosinvestCo UK Ltd. v. Russian Federation*, SCC Arbitration V 079/2005, Award on Jurisdiction, paragraph 71(1). At paragraph 84 of the Decision, the majority asserts that on \"any interpretation of Article 10 of the Argentina/Germany BIT, an investor can ultimately exercise its rights so as to submit the dispute unilaterally to arbitration, without the need for the further specific consent of the State party to the dispute.\" This is only partly true in my view. It is correct that the investor/claimant can do so after having submitted the dispute to the local courts for a period of 18 months. On a plain reading of Article 10(3), however, it cannot do so before then, absent securing the agreement of the other party. This bears on my view of the majority\u2019s acquiescence point, discussed below.\n\n16.\n\nAs discussed below, two avenues to international arbitration are specified under Article 10(3) of the Treaty: (i) by agreement between the disputing parties (whereby the respondent\u2019s consent obviates the need for prior recourse to the local courts and the dispute can proceed directly to international arbitration); or (ii) by a party\u2019s submitting a claim to an international tribunal after having submitted the dispute to the local courts for 18 months. Absent the respondent\u2019s agreement to proceed directly to arbitration, unconditional access to international arbitration is permitted only after compliance with the 18 month prior recourse condition. To revert to *RosInvestCo*, at that point and only at that point, under this Treaty, the initiation of the arbitration proceedings depends \"solely on the unilateral decision by either party and the other party does not have to agree again in order to permit the arbitration to start.\"13\n\n*Id*., paragraph 72.\n\n17.\n\nIt is common ground between the parties, agreed by all members of the Tribunal, and well accepted in investment treaty arbitration that the State\u2019s prior treaty-based offer must be accepted by the claimant. The Decision correctly observes that, \"The question is whether the \"offer\u2019 and the \"acceptance\u2019 have resulted in an agreement which provides the basis for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\"14\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 24.\n\n18.\n\nWith no contemporaneous meeting of the minds, the existence of the agreement to arbitrate is determined by examining the two consents. Campbell McLachlan, QC observed in this respect:\n\n... Given the absence of a meeting of minds between investor and host State, consent has to be constructed from the standing consent given by the State by treaty, and the subsequent consent given by the investor at the time the claim is submitted to arbitration.15\n\nMcLachlan, Shore and Weiniger, *supra* note 6, p. 257.\n\n19.\n\nMany tribunals have examined the consent given in a claimant\u2019s request for arbitration in light of the State\u2019s prior treaty-based offer to consent to arbitration and have had little difficulty concluding that the two consents matched and an agreement to arbitrate was formed. The difficult issue arises when, as here, a claimant disavows the conditions attached to the respondent\u2019s offer expressed in the basic treaty and seeks to change or eliminate them by invoking the treaty\u2019s MFN clause.16\n\nAlthough one tends to focus upon a specific respondent\u2019s consent once a dispute arises, it is axiomatic that in an investment treaty context based upon reciprocity and equality of obligations undertaken by both States Parties, the conditions on consent stipulated in the treaty apply to either State Party.\n\n20.\n\nIn the pre-*Maffezini* days, it was clear that the offer and the acceptance must match. In the 2001 edition of his treatise, Prof. Schreuer commented that:\n\nWhere ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction is based on an offer made by one party, subsequently accepted by the other, the parties\u2019 consent exists only to the extent that offer and acceptance coincide. It is evident that the investor\u2019s acceptance may not validly go beyond the limits of the host State\u2019s offer. Therefore, any limitations contained in the. treaty would apply irrespective of the terms of the investor\u2019s acceptance. If the terms of acceptance do not coincide with the terms of the offer there is no perfected consent.17\n\nChristoph Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, (Cambridge University Press, 2001), para. 356, p. 238. The need for matching consents in order to form the arbitration agreement was also noted by Paul Szasz in an early article on the ICSID Convention entitled, \"The Investment Disputes Convention - Opportunities and Pitfalls (How to Submit Disputes to ICSID).\" In a section of the article entitled, \"Cautions\" the author noted: \"The related point to be observed when consent is expressed in diverse instruments, is the extent to which these overlap -for it is only in the area of coincidence that the consent is both effective and irrevocable.\"\n\n21.\n\nIn my view, the need for matching consents, once clear under the ICSID Convention, remains the case.\n\n**The situation in the case before the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nIn the case before us the disputing parties\u2019 consents do not match. The conditions stipulated in the offer to arbitrate expressed in Article 10 have not been met by the Claimant. Hochtief consented to arbitration under the Argentina-Germany Treaty yet simultaneously sought to vary the conditions attached to Argentina\u2019s consent by invoking the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause to bring into play the Argentina-Chile Treaty\u2019s access to arbitration provisions so as to \"displace\" the conditions stipulated in the basic treaty.18\n\nHochtief\u2019s Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction, paragraph 68.\n\n23.\n\nThe majority has characterized the Claimant\u2019s position as being that \"its agreement is contained in the Request for Arbitration which is intended, in effect, to be an acceptance of Argentina\u2019s offer contained in Article 10 *and* Article 3 of the Argentina-Germany BIT.\"19 [Emphasis added.] That is, they find the State\u2019s offer to arbitrate to lie in two articles (one which establishes the investor-State arbitration mechanism and the other being the MFN article).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 23.\n\n24.\n\nI have some difficulty in describing the MFN article as part of the offer to arbitrate under the Treaty. The offer to arbitrate set out in Article 10, it seems to me, expresses the entirety of the Treaty\u2019s investor-State arbitral mechanism.\n\n25.\n\nAt paragraph 25 of the Decision, the majority correctly records its agreement with both parties that \"it is necessary to establish a consensus: i.e., that it is necessary to demonstrate that Hochtief\u2019s Request for Arbitration was an acceptance of the offer to arbitrate on the terms on which the offer was made, and not a counter-offer on different terms.\"\n\n26.\n\nI find it difficult to see that the Claimant\u2019s invocation of a dispute settlement mechanism found in another treaty in order to vary the terms of the present Treaty is \"an acceptance of the offer to arbitrate on the terms on which the offer was made.\" If Hochtief accepted Argentina\u2019s prior offer in its terms by complying with Article 10(3)(a), the two consents would match, the prior offer would be accepted, and the agreement to arbitrate would thereby be established. But that is not what occurred. In my view, regardless of how one puts it, e.g., as the Argentina-Chile Treaty\u2019s \"displacing\" Article 10(3) (as the Claimant puts it) or as the Claimant\u2019s having accepted an offer contained in Articles 10 and 3 (as the majority puts it), there has been no true meeting of the minds in the sense of matching consents.\n\n27.\n\nIt appears to me that when a claimant seeks to change or eliminate the conditions attaching to the respondent\u2019s consent, the requisite mutuality of an offer and matching acceptance thereof is not present and, to use Prof. Schreuer\u2019s words, \"there is no perfected consent\".20 Rather, the Claimant has made a \"counter-offer on different terms.\" The only possible way out of this conundrum is to find (as the majority has found) that the MFN clause varied the terms of the offer, which revised terms were then accepted by Hochtief. But for that to occur, the Tribunal must necessarily apply Article 3, not in the sense of conducting an appraisal of whether the Claimant has the requisite standing to bring a claim that *prima facie* appears to fall within the scope of the Treaty, but rather to establish the very jurisdiction that is at issue.\n\nIn this respect, the legal issue raised in the instant case differs from that at issue in *RosInvestCo* and *Renta 4*, where the tribunals grappled with the impact of an MFN clause on an established jurisdiction. In the former case, the tribunal plainly had jurisdiction to determine the level of compensation for an expropriation and used the MFN clause to enlarge that established jurisdiction. In the latter, the tribunal found that the inclusion of the word \"due\" in the relevant treaty text permitted it to consider whether the predicate to an expropriation had been made out. In the instant case, I believe that the issue differs; lacking jurisdiction conferred by two matching consents, the Tribunal is using the MFN clause to create the agreement to arbitrate and thereby establish its jurisdiction.\n\n**The principal points of my disagreement with the majority**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe principal basis for my separate opinion is that I do not share the view that the MFN obligation stated in Article 3(2), as further elaborated by *Ad* Article 3 of the Protocol, interpreted in accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation, reaches the conditions attached to a State Party\u2019s consent to arbitration expressed in Article 10. I will go through the Treaty in some detail in order to develop the point.\n\n29.\n\nAs a subsidiary point, I also have reservations about what the Tribunal is actually doing when it gives effect to the MFN clause in this case. I accept that upon the Treaty\u2019s entry into force, unless otherwise indicated in its text, all of its provisions enter into force at the same time. The question in a jurisdictional challenge such as the present one is not whether some or all of the treaty\u2019s provisions are in force21, but rather whether in the specific case arising under this Treaty the Tribunal has been seised with jurisdiction. That requires the Tribunal to satisfy itself of the existence of an arbitration agreement and to do so it must see how such an agreement is formed under the Treaty\u2019s arbitration clause.\n\nI am not to be taken as arguing that the Tribunal has the power to interpret only Article 10 at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nThere is no doubt that, as observed in paragraph 11 of the Decision, when considering an objection to its competence, a tribunal plainly has the power to interpret the treaty as a whole in order to determine whether it is properly seised with jurisdiction. However, I do not believe that the *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* power can be used to create the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. In my respectful view the approach taken seems to elide the question of competence and the application of the provisions of the Treaty.\n\n31.\n\nThe disagreement manifests itself in another difference in view. The majority does not see Hochtief\u2019s noncompliance with Article 10 as going to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, but rather to the claim\u2019s admissibility.22 I disagree and prefer the view expressed by other tribunals, namely, that the prior recourse provision is both mandatory and is jurisdictional in nature.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 96.\n\n32.\n\nI will address these reservations in turn, beginning with an examination and discussion of the relevant provisions of the Treaty.\n\n**The terms of the Treaty**\n---------------------------\n\n**Article 10**\n--------------\n\n33.\n\nOne simple point can be made at the outset: Article 10 does not contain an MFN obligation within the article itself that would have made it perfectly clear that if one of the Contracting Parties agreed to a treaty containing more favourable conditions for access to international jurisdiction, those conditions would enure to the benefit of an investor bringing a claim under the Argentina-Germany Treaty. The absence of an explicit MFN undertaking in Article 10 of course is not dispositive of the interpretative issue, but it warrants noting as a point of departure. There are four additional inter-related points.\n\n34.\n\nFirst, Article 10 contemplates a three step process. In respect of the first two steps, the article is stated in mandatory terms, using the word \"shall\" rather than \"should,\" \"may\" or some other formulation of words that would suggest that the submission of the dispute to the local courts is anything other than obligatory if a party wishes to be in a position ultimately to proceed to international jurisdiction.23\n\nWhile expressing some doubt about the structure of Article 10 and whether it actually requires prior submission in order to permit a claimant to proceed to international arbitration, the Decision, at paragraph 55, proceeds on the assumption, and without deciding the point, that Article 10 imposes a mandatory 18-month submission to the national courts as a precondition of unilateral recourse to arbitration under the BIT.\n\n35.\n\nThe most recent discussion of the characterization of this type of provision (albeit worded slightly differently) is found in *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic*.24 That tribunal reviewed the analogous dispute settlement provision of the Argentina-Italy Treaty, concluding that the prior recourse provision was a \"general condition that must be complied with by the investor who wishes to submit the dispute to international arbitration.\"25\n\nSince *Impregilo*, the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Abaclat and others (Case formerly known as Giovanna Beccara and others) v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5 has been released. The majority of that tribunal did not find it necessary to address the characterization of Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy treaty and whether the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause entitled the claimants to rely on the allegedly more favourable dispute resolution clause in the Argentina-Chile BIT. (Decision on Jurisdiction of August 4, 2011, paragraph 589.) The dissenting opinion, which was said to be forthcoming, has not yet been published, so the views of the dissenting arbitrator cannot be ascertained.\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentina Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award of June 21, 2011, paragraph 90.\n\n36.\n\nThe tribunal described Article 8(3) of that treaty as a \"mandatory - but limited in time - *jurisdictional requirement* before a right to bring a case to ICSID can be exercised.\" [Emphasis added.] It found support for its conclusion in the decisions of the *Maffezini* and *Wintershall* tribunals.26 At the end of its analysis of the dispute settlement clause, the tribunal concluded that: \"In sum, Article 8(3) contains a jurisdictional requirement that has to be fulfilled *before an ICSID tribunal can assert jurisdiction*\" (my emphasis), observing further that this conclusion found support in the *Wintershall* award which found that \"Article 10(2) contains a time-bound prior-recourse-to local-courts-clause, which *mandates* (not merely permits) litigation by the investor (for a definite period) in the domestic forum\"27 (Emphasis added). After reciting that passage from *Wintershall*, the *Impregilo* tribunal added that this mandatory clause applies \"*before the right to ICSID can even materialize*.\"28 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Id*., paragraphs 91-94.\n\n*Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award of December 8, 2008, paragraph 118.\n\n*Impregilo*, paragraph 94.\n\n37.\n\nThe majority in *Impregilo* went on to hold that the MFN clause applied so as to relieve the claimant of having to comply with this mandatory jurisdictional requirement. For present purposes, I refer to the award because its characterization of the prior recourse provision as \"mandatory\" and \"jurisdictional\" in nature accords with my understanding of Article 10(3)(a) of the present Treaty. I also find its comment that compliance with the clause is required before the right to ICSID can even materialize to be correct. This is relevant to my analysis because it goes to the question of what the Tribunal can do when determining its competence.\n\n38.\n\nTo revert to Article 10 of the Argentina-Germany Treaty, as noted previously, Article 10(3)(a)\u2019s application can be avoided only by agreement of the two parties. This is an important point to bear in mind when considering the majority\u2019s admissibility analysis. At paragraph 94, they note in respect of questions of admissibility, that \"disputing parties are entitled to raise objections based upon questions of admissibility, but they are not bound to do so; and if they do not raise those objections, they will have acquiesced in any breach of the requirements of admissibility and that acquiescence will \"cure\u2019 the breach.\" The critical point is the next one: \"The tribunal, *if it has jurisdiction*, will proceed to hear the case.\" [Emphasis added.]\n\n39.\n\nThe majority considers that the Tribunal has such jurisdiction by virtue of the MFN clause\u2019s disapplication of Article 10; I see the Tribunal as having the jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction, but not as empowered to apply the Treaty\u2019s substantive terms (including the MFN clause) so as to *create* its jurisdiction. That drives the analysis back to whether the Claimant has met the mandatory conditions for establishing such jurisdiction, because as *Impregilo* notes, compliance with such conditions must occur before the right to ICSID (arbitration) can materialize.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s acquiescence analysis would moreover be more persuasive, in my respectful view, if Article 10(3)(b) was not present in the Treaty. By including the possibility for a respondent State to agree to waive the prior recourse requirement, the drafters have explicitly addressed the acquiescence point in the text. Why read in a power to acquiesce into the conditions stipulated in Article 10(3)(a) when the respondent\u2019s power to agree to proceed immediately to international arbitration is explicitly recognized in Article 10(3)(b)? I would have thought that the latter\u2019s presence in the Treaty should lead to the opposite conclusion, namely, that if the power to waive the requirement is expressed in one sub-paragraph, it ought not to be read into the other.\n\n41.\n\nIf both paragraphs are given effect, the logical conclusion would be that absent the Respondent\u2019s agreement, under the framework of this Treaty the 18 month prior recourse period is mandatory and jurisdiction cannot vest in the Tribunal until there is compliance therewith.\n\n42.\n\nOn this approach, as held in *Impregilo*, *Maffezini* and *Wintershall*, non-compliance with the mandatory terms of subparagraph 3(a) goes to jurisdiction rather than to admissibility and the Respondent\u2019s insistence on the Claimant\u2019s compliance with the condition expressed in the Respondent\u2019s offer is properly characterized as an objection to jurisdiction, not to admissibility.\n\n43.\n\nThe third and related interpretative point about Article 10 is that unlike some investment protection treaties where the States Parties unconditionally submit to investor-State arbitration, Article 10 is worded conditionally. That is, absent compliance with the 18-month recourse requirement, the claimant has no *unconditional* right to proceed to arbitration.29 Absent the respondent\u2019s waiving prior recourse, it is only when prior recourse has occurred that there is, to revert to *RosInvestCo*, a binding consent to arbitration with the effect that a prospective party to the arbitration proceedings does not need the agreement of the other prospective party to start arbitration proceedings.30\n\nObviously, proceeding directly to international arbitration pursuant to Article 10(3)(b) after having obtained the respondent\u2019s consent cannot be considered an unconditional right to arbitration. It arises from a specific consent from the respondent which is otherwise entitled to insist on compliance with the Treaty\u2019s mandatory terms.\n\nFor that reason, I do not share the majority\u2019s view that the \"jurisdiction of the Tribunal remains unaffected by\" the Respondent\u2019s acquiescing in the Claimant\u2019s non-compliance with the 18-month period. (Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 96.)\n\n44.\n\nFinally, Article 10 stands in contrast to the Treaty\u2019s other dispute settlement mechanism, Article 9. That is, while Article 10(3)(a) stipulates a condition that must be met before the claim can be elevated to the international level, Article 9 gives the Contracting Parties direct and immediate access to international arbitration to settle disputes arising between them (in providing that if a dispute cannot be settled amicably, \"it *will* be submitted to an arbitral tribunal upon the request of either Contracting Party\"). [Emphasis added.] In such a case, there is no question as to the Contracting Parties\u2019 unconditional consent to State-to-State arbitration and any tribunal created under Article 9 is vested with jurisdiction to claims related to the interpretation and application of the Treaty.\n\n**Article 3**\n-------------\n\n45.\n\nArticle 3 will be reviewed in detail because it contains a number of phrases which taken collectively lead me to conclude that it does not apply to Article 10.\n\n46.\n\nParagraph 1 deals with \"investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, or the investments in which the nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party have interests.\" Paragraph 2 addresses \"nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards its activities related to investments.\" The paragraphs thus differentiate between the investor and its investment.\n\n47.\n\nParagraphs 3 and 4 then set out two types of treatment that are not considered to be \"treatment\" at all within the meaning of Article 3. \"Treatment\", as understood in paragraphs 1 and 2, \"shall not include privileges which may be extended by either Contracting Party to nationals or companies of third States on account of\" preferential trade agreements, nor shall it \"extend to privileges accorded by a Contracting Party to nationals or companies of a third State by virtue of an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation or other tax agreements.\" In other words, paragraphs 3 and 4 deem two types of treatment that could otherwise be seen to be as less favourable as not even being \"treatment\" as that term is understood by the Contracting Parties.\n\n**Article 3(2) in particular**\n------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of Article 3 do not have the same coverage. Paragraph 1 applies to any less favourable treatment accorded to the investment without any specification of the universe of activities in which the investment might engage. Paragraph 2, in contrast, does not purport to capture any less favourable treatment accorded to the investor, but rather less favourable treatment \"as regards their activity in connection with investments in [the State\u2019s] territory.\" It is necessary to refer to the Protocol to gain further insight into the meaning of the word \"activity\" as used in Article 3(2). I will revert to this below.\n\n**What Article 3(2) does not contain**\n--------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIt is useful at this point to consider what Article 3(2) does not contain. Three points come to mind.\n\n50.\n\nFirst, Article 3(2) does not refer to Article 10, nor does it expressly include dispute settlement activities within its scope. (This stands in contrast to the United Kingdom\u2019s Model BIT which confirms that its MFN clause does apply to dispute settlement.)\n\n51.\n\nIt is equally true that dispute settlement under the Treaty has not been expressly \"carved out\" of Article 3(2)\u2019s coverage. The majority (in line with some other tribunals) has noted this.31 It is used to support the inference that dispute settlement is therefore covered (on the basis that the drafters knew how to exclude something from the Article\u2019s coverage and therefore anything not excluded must have been intended to be included).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 74.\n\n52.\n\nThis does not necessarily follow. In addition to examining Article 3 and other articles of the Treaty, I examine the Treaty\u2019s structure and the grouping of provisions within it because this can provide interpretative clues as to the meaning of particular provisions. If, as I conclude, the Contracting Parties conceived of Articles 8-12 as institutional provisions relating to the Treaty\u2019s application generally, there would have been no need to expressly list any of the matters addressed in those articles as matters to be carved out from Article 3\u2019s coverage. The Decision correctly observes at paragraph 77 that it is well understood that MFN clauses are subject to implicit limitations.\n\n53.\n\nMoreover, it is entirely plausible that the Contracting Parties did not specifically exclude the conditions for gaining access to dispute settlement under Article 10 from Article 3\u2019s application because it did not occur to them that the MFN clause could be used to modify Article 10\u2019s stipulations.32 Prior to *Maffezini*, that was not only a reasonable and legitimate view, it was the orthodox view33 (buttressed in the ICSID context by the commonly held view as expressed by Professor Schreuer that the consents of the two disputing parties under a treaty must coincide).34\n\nZachary Douglas observes that \"across hundreds of years of activity of international courts and tribunals\" until Maffezini there \"has only been judicial pronouncements against such a device.\" (i.e., using the MFN clause to override the State\u2019s conditions of consent). He notes further that prior to Maffezini, \"there does not appear to be any support in the writings of publicists for the extension of the MFN clause to jurisdictional matters.\" Zachary Douglas, The MFN Clause in Investment Arbitration: Treaty Interpretation Off the Rails, Journal of International Dispute Settlement, Vol. 2, No. 1 (2011), pp. 97-113, at 101. If this was the case, the drafters would see no need to exclude something from the MFN clause\u2019s reach because they would not consider it to be related to MFN in the first place. The clause would not be operating in regard to the subject-matter of Article 10.\n\nAn indication of the surprise with which *Maffezini* was received in many quarters is reflected by a distinguished tribunal\u2019s comment in *Salini v. Jordan* where, after reviewing *Maffezini* \u2019s analysis, the tribunal commented that: \"The current Tribunal shares the concerns that have been expressed in numerous quarters with regard to the solution adopted in the *Maffezini* case.\" *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Decision on Jurisdiction of November 29, 2004, paragraph 115.\n\nSee paragraph 20 *supra*.\n\n54.\n\nDrafters need not exclude matters addressed in another article of a treaty from the MFN obligation if they do not think that there is a relationship between the two articles. To revert to the words of *Amco Asia* quoted earlier, we are to take into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.\n\n55.\n\nSecond, it warrants noting that when Article 3(2) is compared to the other substantive obligations of treatment there is nothing in its formulation that suggests that it is any different from any of the other obligations in terms of its application. That is, Article 3 is like every other provision, to be applied by a tribunal, but only once it is properly seised with jurisdiction.\n\n56.\n\nThird, this Treaty  does not contain the \"all matters\" language that some tribunals have found to be highly relevant to their decision that the relevant MFN clause applies to access to international jurisdiction.35\n\nIn *Impregilo*, the majority observed at paragraph 104 of the Award that: \"The Arbitral Tribunal further notes that there is a massive volume of case-law which indicates that, at least when there is an MFN clause applying to \"all matters\" regulated in the BIT, more favorable dispute settlement clauses in other BITs will be incorporated. Relevant cases are *Maffezini*, *Gas Natural*, *Suez*, *Suez* and *Camuzzi*.\" [Footnotes omitted.] The dissenting arbitrator, Prof. Brigitte Stern, rejected the view that the \"all matters\" formulation reaches dispute settlement.\n\n57.\n\nI readily acknowledge the majority\u2019s point that if one focuses on the word \"activity,\" one can say that an investor\u2019s commencing a lawsuit or an arbitration in relation to its investment is an activity.36 I also accept that the word \"treatment\" in and of itself is capable of a broad meaning. But the interpretative exercise does not end with a consideration of the words \"activity\" and \"treatment\" in isolation of the rest of the Treaty and of general international law. Plainly, as the majority observes at paragraphs 61-70, an investor might engage in the activity of bringing a lawsuit in relation to its investment, but it does not necessarily follow that an international claim regulated by the terms of Article 10 is also an \"activity\" within the meaning of Article 3, as further interpreted by *Ad* Article 3 and when considered in light of the overall context of the Treaty and general international law.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 66-72.\n\n***Ad*** **Article 3**\n----------------------\n\n58.\n\nArticle 3 is supplemented by *Ad* Article 3 in the Protocol which forms an integral part of the Treaty. I believe that the Protocol\u2019s interpretation of Article 3(2) lends support to my analysis.\n\n59.\n\nThe Protocol clarifies the meaning of the word \"activity\" as used in Article 3(2). It defines \"activity\" (labelled as \"activities\" in the plural) through a non-exhaustive, but illustrative, list.37\n\nThere seems to be a slight drafting error here since Article 3 uses the phrasing \"their activity\" in the singular while *Ad* Article 3 uses \"activities\" in the plural. Nothing appears to turn on this.\n\n60.\n\nThe use of the phrasing \"in particular but not exclusively\" creates a focus in identifying what is covered by \"activities.\" The phrase \"[i]t will be considered in particular but not exclusively.\" signals to the interpreter that the drafters were concerned with some *genus* of activities as opposed to activities writ large. Otherwise, why include the \"will be considered in particular\" phrase in *Ad* Article 3 at all?38 If the meaning of \"activities\" was intended to capture all possible activities of the investor in relation to its investment, there would have been no reason to employ this phrasing. There must be a relationship between the particular types of activities expressly listed and those not expressly listed.\n\nThe majority and I differ on this point. Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 65-66.\n\n61.\n\nIt also warrants noting that while Article 3 simply used the general word \"activity\", the range of activities specified by the Protocol is narrower than that used in many other treaties. The Protocol does not, as many investment treaties do, apply the MFN obligation to the full range of an investor\u2019s activities from pre-establishment to the disposition of an investment. Rather, it focuses more on the day-to-day management and operation of the investment (its \"management, the exploitation, the use and the enjoyment.\").\n\n62.\n\nHaving regard to Article 3(2)\u2019s scope, therefore, the Protocol\u2019s drafting technique tends to narrow the range of an investor\u2019s activities related to its investment. But this too does not dispose of the interpretative issue.\n\n63.\n\nThe most important clue lies in the next part of the Protocol: Article 3\u2019s purpose is to protect investors or their investments, as the case may be, from less favourable treatment than that accorded to investors or investments of third States.39 It is of seminal importance that when taking the opportunity to give interpretative guidance as to what actually constitutes \"less favourable treatment\" within the meaning of Article 3(2), the examples used by the States Parties were far removed from the conditions of access to international jurisdiction stipulated in Article 10 of the Treaty.\n\nIt warrants noting parenthetically that in the last sentence of *Ad* Article 3 the Parties introduced an entirely new *genus* of measures that were not to be considered \"treatment less favourable\" within the meaning of Article 3. These sorts of measures (adopted for reasons of internal or external security or public order, public health or morality\") were not even mentioned in Article 3 itself.\n\n64.\n\nOnce again, the Protocol\u2019s drafters used the \"in particular but not exclusively\" drafting technique. The \"in particular\" examples of less favourable treatment given by the Parties (\"measures affecting the acquisition of raw materials and further supplies, energy and fuels as well as means of production and of exploitation of any kind or the sale of products inside the country or abroad\") all fall within a *genus* of less favourable treatments that are directly related to the management, the exploitation, the use and enjoyment of the investment in the host State\u2019s territory.\n\n65.\n\nIt warrants emphasizing that *all* of the listed types of measures are concerned with access to materials, the production and sales processes, and measures of governments that can adversely affect the competitiveness of investments, e.g. access to inputs within the host State as well as access to the internal and export markets. They are closely related types of less favourable treatment and they must provide a sense of what sort of \"activities\" the Contracting Parties had in mind, since logically there must be a connection between the investor\u2019s activities and the types of treatment that the Contracting Parties agreed would put it at a disadvantage *vis-\u00e0-vis* investors of the host State and investors of third States.\n\n66.\n\nTo be sure, the list is not exhaustive, but even considering the penumbra of less favourable treatments that are not specified \"in particular\", the Treaty\u2019s stipulation of the conditions for gaining access to international arbitral jurisdiction seems to me to be distant from the listed types of less favourable treatments.40\n\nI leave aside the question of whether a respondent\u2019s seeking to have the claimant comply with the Treaty\u2019s conditions for initiating arbitration thereunder even constitutes a \"measure\" that could give rise to less favourable treatment in the first place. See *Pope & Talbot Inc. and Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award by Arbitral Tribunal in relation to Preliminary Motion by Government of Canada to Dismiss Claim Because it Falls Outside the Scope and Coverage of NAFTA Chapter Eleven \"measure relating to investment\" Motion, 26 January 2000, paragraphs 36-37, for a NAFTA tribunal\u2019s differentiation between an international agreement between Canada and the United States, which did not constitute a \"measure\" within the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and the Canada\u2019s measures implementing that agreement that were being challenged in that case, which were held to be measures capable of falling within NAFTA Chapter Eleven.\n\n67.\n\nSince the Protocol\u2019s drafters were seeking to give the interpreter a better sense of the Parties\u2019 shared intent in respect of the kind of less favourable treatment covered by Article 3(2), Article 3, as clarified and elaborated by the Protocol (which forms an integral part of the Treaty), does not reach the Treaty\u2019s conditions applicable to an investor seeking access to international jurisdiction.\n\n**Article 4**\n-------------\n\n68.\n\nI will refer to Article 4 only in passing. It is not insignificant in my view that when it comes to \"full legal protection and security\", protection against expropriation, compensation for losses due to war or other armed conflict, etc. the drafters inserted an article-specific MFN clause. This too is not dispositive of the overall interpretative result, but the Parties\u2019 insertion of such an MFN clause for three types of State action lends weight to the idea that the MFN clause in Article 3 is concerned only with a specific *genus* of less favourable treatments and in relation to a specific *genus* of investor activities.41\n\nGiven the inclusion of two MFN clauses in Articles 3 and 4, one can ask why the drafters did not include an MFN clause in Article 10 itself if they intended to permit the terms of access in other treaties to flow through to claimants under this Treaty. Given the drafting technique used in this Treaty, that would be the logical place to put it.\n\n69.\n\nI now turn to consider the broader context of the Treaty.\n\n**The general structure of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe foregoing interpretation of Articles 3, 4, 9 and 10 should be grounded not only having regard to the ordinary meaning of a word or words, but to the words in their context which, under Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, includes the entire text of the Treaty. This leads me to consider the Treaty\u2019s general structure.\n\n71.\n\nLike many BITs, the Argentina-Germany Treaty is short, comprising a preamble, followed by twelve articles and a protocol. It does not employ article titles, nor is it divided into sections. However, a structure can be discerned from reviewing the Treaty as a whole:42\n\nPreamble\n\nArticle 1 [Definitions]\n\nArticle 2 [Encouragement and admission of investments in the territories of the Contracting Parties]\n\nArticle 3 [National treatment and MFN treatment]\n\nArticle 4 [Full legal protection, prohibition against uncompensated expropriation, and disciplines for losses suffered through armed conflict, revolution, *etc*.]\n\nArticle 5 [Transfers]\n\nArticle 6 [Subrogation]\n\nArticle 7 [Extension of more favourable treatment under domestic law or from obligations under international law not included in the Treaty and fulfillment of commitments made]\n\nArticle 8 [Application of the Treaty to matters arising under it but relating to pre-existing investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party]\n\nArticle 9 [Disputes between the Contracting Parties]\n\nArticle 10 [Disputes between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party]\n\nArticle 11 [Application of the Treaty in cases provided by Article 63 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]\n\nArticle 12 [Ratification, entry into force, and survival of Articles 1-11 for fifteen years after termination]\n\nFor purposes of illustrating its structure given the absence of article titles, I have inserted a description of each provision.\n\n72.\n\nA perusal of the Treaty suggests three subject-matter groupings: (i) Article 1, definitions; (ii) Articles 2-7, substantive obligations undertaken by the Contracting Parties and enjoyed by Argentinean and German investors, as the case may be, in the territories of the relevant Party; and (iii) Articles 8-12, institutional features of the Treaty (i.e., provisions addressing the Treaty\u2019s application to pre-existing investments, the creation of two dispute settlement mechanisms, the impact of the severing of diplomatic or consular relations on the Treaty, its entry into force and the basis for its termination together with the survival of rights for a certain time).\n\n73.\n\nIn my opinion, Article 10, when viewed in the context of the Treaty as a whole, is not *ejusdem generis* to the Treaty\u2019s substantive obligations of treatment of investors and/or their investments, including Article 3.\n\n**Summary**\n-----------\n\n74.\n\nIn sum:\n\n\u2022 Article 10 sets out a staged dispute settlement regime. Compliance with Article 10(3)(a) is as other tribunals have recognized mandatory and is a matter going to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u2022 Article 10 does not contain an MFN clause stating that more favourable treatment accorded by either Contracting Party to investors of a third State will flow through and apply to disputes brought under that article.\n\n\u2022 Article 3 does not expressly refer to Article 10, nor does it expressly include the subject matter of dispute settlement under the Treaty within its scope. Nothing in Article 3 explicitly states that the Contracting Parties intended it to apply to the procedures for the submission of disputes prescribed by Article 10.\n\n\u2022 Article 3(2) does not even specify that the MFN obligations apply to \"all matters subject to this Agreement\" as was the case in the treaty considered by, for example, the *Maffezini* and *Impregilo* tribunals. It uses the bare words \"activity\" in relation to the investor and \"treatment\" in relation to the measures of the State.\n\n\u2022 Of seminal importance, the Protocol\u2019s elaboration of what sorts of treatment considered by the Contracting Parties to be \"less favourable\" addresses State conduct that is entirely different in nature from the conditions governing access to international jurisdiction prescribed in the Treaty. While the less favourable measures are not listed exhaustively, those not covered under the \"particularly but not exclusively\" phrasing must logically be related to those which are expressly listed. Access to international jurisdiction regulated under Article 10 is simply not *ejusdem generis* to restrictions on availability of natural resources, the sale of products inside the country or abroad, etc.\n\n\u2022 The fact that Article 3 is silent in terms of whether it applies to dispute settlement, yet its paragraphs 3 and 4 contain matters (benefits accruing from preferential trade agreements and double taxation treaties43), which are explicitly carved out from being considered to be \"treatment\", does not inexorably support the argument that dispute settlement must therefore fall within its terms because the Parties knew how to exclude such matters as from Article 3\u2019s coverage. As noted, if one considers the orthodox view prior to *Maffezini* was that the MFN clause did not override the State\u2019s conditions of consent, it seems difficult to conceive that dislodging Article 10(3)(a) was a consequence of Article 3 which the Contracting Parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.\n\n\u2022 Finally, nothing in Article 3 or in *Ad* Article 3 confers any special temporal quality upon the MFN obligation; there is no indication that the MFN obligation, uniquely amongst the other standards of treatment contained in the Treaty, is to be given any kind of \"pre agreement to arbitrate\" status that would authorize a tribunal to use it to create an agreement to arbitrate.\n\nAs well as the exclusions from \"less favourable treatment\" set out in *Ad* Article 3(b) and (c).\n\n**International law's distinction between substantive obligations and jurisdiction-conferring provisions**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nUnder the general rule of interpretation set forth in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, the interpreter is mandated to examine the treaty in light of various elements which are, to use the International Law Commission\u2019s words, \"thrown into the crucible\" and from their interaction \"would give the legally relevant interpretation.\"44 The text of the Treaty is to be considered not simply in its own terms, but also having regard to other elements.45 Paragraph 3 of Article 31 adds that there should also be taken into account together with the context \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\" As Sir Ian Sinclair noted in his commentary on the Vienna Convention, \"Every treaty provision must be read not only in its own context, but in the wider context of general international law, whether conventional or customary.\"46 The Vienna Convention\u2019s preamble itself specifies that: \"disputes concerning treaties, like other international disputes, should be settled... in conformity with the principles of justice and international law.\"\n\nA/CONF.39/11/Add.2, 39, paragraph 8\n\n*Case concerning the Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989 (Guinea-Bissau v. Senegal),* ICJ Reports 1991, 53.\n\nIan Sinclair, The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, (Manchester University Press) (2nd ed.) p. 139.\n\n76.\n\nAt paragraphs 35-37, I expressed agreement with the prior tribunals that have characterized the \"prior recourse\" provision as being jurisdictional in nature. This leads me to consider the Treaty in light of the distinction between substantive obligations and jurisdictional provisions of treaties. In a number of cases where an objection has been taken against its jurisdiction to hear claims of alleged breach of treaties, the ICJ has considered that there is a clear distinction between a treaty\u2019s substantive obligations and its conferral of adjudicative jurisdiction.47\n\n*Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), Jurisdiction and Admissibility*, Judgment of February 3, 2006, ICJ Reports 2006, 6, paras. 64-65, where the Court noted that it had previously emphasized that the *erga omnes* character of a norm and the rule of consent to jurisdiction are two different things. See also the *Case Concerning East Timor (Portugal v. Australia)*, Judgment of 30 June 1995, ICJ Reports 1995, p. 90, where the Court stated:  \n \"26. The Court recalls in this respect that one of the fundamental principles of its Statute is that it cannot decide a dispute between States without the consent of those States to its jurisdiction. This principle was reaffirmed in the Judgment given by the Court in the case concerning *Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in* 1943 and confirmed in several of its subsequent decisions (see *Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jarnahiriyu/Malta), Application for Permission to Intervene, Judgment,* I. C. J. Reports 1984, p. 25, para. 40; *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua* v. *United States of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment,* I. C. J. Reports 1984, p. 431, para. 88 ; *Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Republic of Mali), Judgment,* I. C. J. Reports 1986, p. 579, para. 49; *Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras), Application to Intervene, Judgment,* I. C. J. Reports 1990, pp. 114-1 16, paras. 54-56, and p. 112, para. 73; and *Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru* v. *Australia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I. C. J. Reports 1992*, pp. 259-262, paras. 50-55).\"\n\n77.\n\nThis has been reaffirmed as recently as April of 2011, when the ICJ found that the preconditions established in Article 22 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination \"establish preconditions before the seisin of the Court.\"48\n\nArticle 22 of the Convention states: \"Any dispute between two or more States Parties with respect to the interpretation or application of this Convention, which is not settled by negotiation or by the procedures expressly provided for in this Convention, shall, at the request of any of the parties to the dispute, be referred to the International Court of Justice for decision, unless the disputants agree to another mode of settlement.\" Case concerning *Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination* (*Georgia v. Russian Federation*), Judgment of 1 April 2011. The Court makes the point about seisin at paragraph 141.\n\n78.\n\nProfessor Campbell McLachlan QC, among others, has adverted to this general distinction in his treatise co-authored by Shore and Weiniger:\n\n... As the ICJ pointed out in *East Timor (Portugal) v. Australia*, the scope of application of a substantive obligation is an entirely separate question to the conferral of jurisdiction upon an international tribunal, Jurisdiction in international law depends solely upon consent.49\n\nMcLachlan, Shore and Weiniger, *supra* note 6, p. 257. See also Douglas, *supra* note 32, at p. 103.\n\n79.\n\nThus, to treat the Treaty\u2019s dispute settlement provisions as being the same as the substantive obligations that precede it seems to be at variance with how general international law and practice has distinguished between the two.\n\n**The sequential issue**\n------------------------\n\n80.\n\nI have already alluded to my concern about the majority\u2019s application of the MFN clause in its interpretation of the Treaty pursuant to the *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* power. It seems to me that consistent with the approach articulated by the ICJ, just noted, there is a sequential issue in the establishment of a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under an investment treaty. During the hearing I asked both parties to comment on this issue because it seems to me to be bound up in the analysis of how the specific MFN clause at issue in this case can relate to the investor-State arbitration mechanism.50\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pp. 24-31, pp. 91-94\n\n81.\n\nThe sequential element comes into play as follows: to avoid Article 10\u2019s effects, the Claimant invokes an obligation contained in the Treaty to \"displace\" the Treaty\u2019s requirements for initiating an international claim.51 Seeking the application of a particular rule of treatment in the Treaty in order to create jurisdiction seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse.52\n\nHochtief\u2019s Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction, paragraph 68.\n\nRather than using the \"substantive/jurisdictional\" or \"substantive/procedural\" distinctions found in the literature, in her recent dissenting and concurring opinion in *Impregilo*, Professor Brigitte Stern distinguishes between \"rights and... fundamental conditions for access to the rights\". This accords with my understanding of the distinction between a treaty\u2019s protections and the means for enforcing such protections but I have used the term \"substantive\" to refer to obligations of treatment such as the duty not to expropriate except in accordance with the treaty\u2019s terms, the fair and equitable treatment standard, etc.\n\n82.\n\nIf one were to consider any other substantive provision of an investment treaty, such as the protection against an uncompensated expropriation, were a claimant to file a claim asserting that an expropriation had been effected in breach of a treaty without the claimant's having first consented to the arbitration in the manner specified by the treaty, the tribunal's response would be that absent an agreement to arbitrate it was without jurisdiction to entertain the claim. A tribunal cannot adjudicate someone's rights if they have not met the threshold jurisdictional requirements to be able to claim such rights. Yet the Decision on Jurisdiction is plainly applying this treatment clause in order to dis-apply the 18 month litigation period in Article 10(3)(a).53\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 82. The Treaty between Argentina and Germany has not been amended by the treaty between Argentina and Chile. Douglas makes the point in similar terms: \"The claimant must assert a right to more favourable treatment by claiming through the MFN clause in the basic treaty. It can only do so by instituting arbitration proceedings and thus by accepting the terms of the standing offer of arbitration in the basic treaty. At that point an arbitration agreement between the claimant and the host state comes into existence. And the existence of that arbitration agreement is critical to the viability of the arbitration regime envisaged by the investment treaty...\" *supra,* note 32, pp. 106-107. Correctly, in my view, Douglas argues that MFN clause does not automatically incorporate the terms of a third treaty into the basic treaty and for this reason HOCHTIEF's submission that the Argentina-Chile Treaty \"displaces\" Article 10 of the Argentina-Germany Treaty is misplaced.\n\n83.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons I cannot fully subscribe to the Decision. That said, I accept my colleagues' decision and agree that the objection has illustrated the difficulty of the question. As noted in paragraph 1, I do subscribe to the balance of the Tribunal's disposition of Argentina's objections."}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis claim is brought by Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft, a company incorporated in the Federal Republic of Germany (\"**Hochtief**\"), against the Argentine Republic (' **Argentina** '), under the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated 9 April 1991 (' **the BIT** ').\n\n2.\n\nHochtief and Argentina, the parties to the dispute and to this case, are referred to in this Decision as the (lower-case) 'parties'. Argentina and Germany, as the States Parties to the BIT, are referred to as the (capitalized) 'Parties'.\n\n3.\n\nThe authentic German and Spanish texts of the BIT, together with the English translation published in the *United Nations Treaty Series*1, are set out in Appendix I to this Decision. This Decision will refer to the English-language translation. The Tribunal has, however, taken full account of the fact that the authentic languages of the BIT are German and Spanish, and as will be seen it has at various stages reverted to the authentic texts where the translation is unsatisfactory.\n\nUNTS Vol. 1910, 171 (1996).\n\n4.\n\nThe claim arises from a dispute concerning a 25-year concession awarded to Hochtief and a consortium of construction companies in 1997 for the construction, maintenance and operation of a toll road and several bridges in Argentina between the cities of Rosario and Victoria. Hochtief and other members of the consortium incorporated a company, Puentes del Litoral SA (' **PdL** '), in Argentina in order to implement the concession. Hochtief owns 26% of the shares in PdL. Hochtief claims that it was injured by actions taken by Argentina in breach of its obligations under the BIT and under customary international law.\n\n5.\n\nThe claim was initiated by the Request for Arbitration dated 5 November 2007, addressed by the Claimant to the Secretary-General of ICSID (' **the Centre** '). The Claimant appointed the Hon. Charles Brower, and the Respondent appointed J Christopher Thomas QC, to the Tribunal. Judge Brower and Mr Thomas agreed to invite Professor Vaughan Lowe QC to chair the Tribunal. The Tribunal was constituted on 30 April 2009.\n\n6.\n\nBy agreement of the parties the First Procedural Meeting of the Tribunal, held by telephone conference, was begun on 19 June 2009, and resumed on 16 April 2010 at the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C. with the President of the Tribunal, prevented from flying by a volcanic ash cloud, participating by video link.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant's Memorial on the Merits was submitted on 29 April 2010, and the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Centre and the Competence of the Tribunal (including, as agreed, a brief outline of its defences on the merits) on 30 July 2010. The Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction was submitted on 15 October 2010, and the Respondent's Reply and Claimant's Rejoinder on 22 December 2010 and 10 February 2011 respectively.\n\n8.\n\nThe hearing on Jurisdiction was held at the World Bank's premises in Paris on 4-5 March 2011.The Claimant was represented by Mr Paul F Doyle, Mr Philip D Robben, Ms Mellisa E Byroade, and Ms Julia A Garza Ben\u00edtez of Kelley Drye & Warren LLP; and the Respondent was represented by Dr Angelina Abbona, Dr Gabriel Bottini, Dr Romina de los \u00c1ngeles Mercado, Dr Ver\u00f3nica Lavista, Dr Mat\u00edas Osvaldo Bietti, Dr Ariel Martins, and Mr Juli\u00e1n Santiago Negro, of the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n. Ms Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski acted as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**I The Parties' Submissions**\n------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe submissions of the parties are set out in detail in their written pleadings and were developed in their oral submissions at the hearing, a verbatim record of which was kept and made available to the parties and the Tribunal shortly after the end of the hearing on Jurisdiction. All of these submissions were taken into account, and the main points are summarized here in so far as is necessary for the purposes of this Decision.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent raises two main objections to jurisdiction. The First Objection is that the Claimant has failed to meet the requirements set forth in Article 10 of the BIT, and that the Tribunal is consequently without jurisdiction in this case. The Second Objection is that Hochtief is attempting in this case to bring a claim to enforce the rights of another person and has no legal standing to do so.\n\n11.\n\nIt is well established that the Tribunal has the competence to decide upon challenges to its jurisdiction. If it finds that it has jurisdiction, the position is unproblematic. If it finds that it lacks jurisdiction, a pedant might object that it had no right to determine even that question; but the Law has chosen to side with pragmatism rather than pedantry and *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* is a firmly established principle, adopted in Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal proceeds accordingly.\n\n**II The First Objection: BIT Article 10**\n------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nIn translation, Article 10 of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n\" ***Article 10***\n\n(1) Disputes concerning investments within the meaning of this Treaty between one of the Contracting Parties and a national or company of the other Contracting Party shall as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(2) If a dispute within the meaning of paragraph 1 cannot be settled within six months from the date on which one of the parties concerned gave notice of the dispute, it shall, at the request of either party, be submitted to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.\n\n(3) The dispute may be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal in any of the following circumstances:\n\n(a) At the request of one of the parties to the dispute where, after a period of 18 months has elapsed from the moment when the judicial process provided for by paragraph 2 of this article was initiated, no final decision has been given or where a decision has been made but the Parties are still in dispute;\n\n(b) Where both parties to the dispute have so agreed.\n\n(4) In the cases provided for by paragraph 3 above, disputes between the Parties within the meaning of this article shall be referred by mutual agreement, when the parties to the dispute have not agreed otherwise, either to arbitral proceedings under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 18 March 1965 or to an *ad hoc* arbitral tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.\n\nIf there is no agreement after a period of three months has elapsed from the moment when one of the Parties requested the initiation of the arbitration procedures, the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration procedures under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 18 March 1965 provided that both Contracting Parties are parties to the said Convention. Otherwise, the dispute shall be submitted to the above-mentioned *ad hoc* arbitral tribunal.\n\n(5) The arbitral tribunal shall issue its ruling in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, with those of other treaties existing between the Parties, with the laws in force in the Contracting Party in which the investments were made, including its rules of private international law, and with the general principles of international law.\n\n(6) The arbitration decision shall be binding and both Parties shall implement it in accordance with their legislation.\"\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent says that paragraphs 10(2) and 10(3)(a) of Article 10 impose a mandatory period of 18 months, for the duration of which the dispute must be submitted to the Respondent's courts, before the Claimant is entitled to submit the dispute to arbitration. It says that Article 10 thus establishes a mandatory condition upon which the jurisdiction of the Tribunal depends, and that the Claimant has not fulfilled that condition.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent makes no jurisdictional challenge based upon the requirement in Article 10(2) that six months must elapse after notice of the dispute is given, before the dispute may be submitted to the courts at the instance of either party.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant, for its part, invokes Article 3 of the BIT, which reads as follows:2\n\n\"*Article 3*\n\n(1) Neither Contracting Party shall subject investments in its territory by or with the participation of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments of its own nationals or companies or to investments of nationals or companies of any third State.\n\n(2) Neither Contracting Party shall subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their activity in connection with investments in its territory, to treatment less favourable than it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.\n\n(3) Such treatment shall not include privileges which may be extended by either Contracting Party to nationals or companies of third States on account of its membership in a customs or economic union, common market or free trade area.\n\n(4) The treatment under this article shall not extend to privileges accorded by a Contracting Party to nationals or companies of a third State by virtue of an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation or other tax agreements.\"\n\nSee paragraphs 63 ff and 104 ff below for certain problems with this translation.\n\n16.\n\nArticle 3 must be read together with the Protocol to the BIT, which reads in material part as follows:\n\n\"With the signing of the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Argentine Republic on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, the undersigned plenipotentiaries have agreed on the following provisions, which shall be regarded as an integral part of the said Treaty:\n\n(2) *Ad article 3* :\n\n(a) The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed \"activity\" within the meaning of article 3, paragraph 2: the management, utilization, use and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed \"treatment less favourable\" within the meaning of article 3: less favourable measures that affect the purchase of raw materials and other inputs, energy or fuel, or means of production or operation of any kind or the marketing of products inside or outside the country. Measures that are adopted for reasons of internal or external security or public order, public health or morality shall not be deemed \"treatment less favourable\" within the meaning of article 3.\n\n(b) The provisions of article 3 do not obligate a Contracting Party to extend tax privileges, exemptions and relief accorded only to natural persons and companies resident in its territory,\" in accordance with its tax laws, to natural persons and companies resident in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\n(c) The Contracting Parties shall within the framework of their national legislation give favourable consideration to applications for the entry and sojourn of persons of either Contracting Party who wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment; the same shall apply to nationals of either Contracting Party who, in connection with an investment, wish to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party and sojourn there to take up employment. Applications for work permits shall also be given favourable consideration.\"\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the effect of this MFN provision is to permit it to rely upon what it says is the more favourable provision in Article 10 of the Argentina-Chile Bilateral Investment Treaty dated 2 August 1991. That treaty, in its authentic language and in the English translation submitted in these proceedings, is set out in Appendix II.\n\n18.\n\nArticle 10 of the Argentina-Chile BIT reads as follows:\n\n**\"ARTICLE 10 Settlement of disputes regarding investments**\n\n1. Any dispute related to the investments under this Treaty, between a Party and a national or company of the other Party shall, as far as possible, be settled by friendly negotiations between the two parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If the dispute shall not have been settled within the term of six months as from the time it has been raised by either party, it may be submitted upon request of the national or company:\n\n- to the national jurisdictions of the Party involved in the dispute;\n\n- or to international arbitration in the conditions described in paragraph (3).\n\nOnce a national or company has submitted the dispute to the jurisdiction of the Party involved or to international arbitration, the election of either procedure shall be final.\n\n3. In case of election of international arbitration, the dispute may be submitted, at the election of the national or company, to one of the arbitration entities mentioned below:\n\nTo the International Center (*sic*) for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) created under the \"Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States\", opened to the signature in Washington on 18 March 1965, when each Member State which is a party to this Agreement has signed the said Convention. While this condition is not met, each Party may give its consent for the dispute to be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the Rules of the supplementary Mechanism of ICSID for the management of conciliation, arbitration or investigation proceedings;\n\nTo an \"ad hoc\" arbitration panel organized pursuant to the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n4. The arbitration panel shall render an award on the basis of this Treaty, the right of the Party that is a party to the dispute, including the rules regarding conflicts of laws and the terms and conditions of occasional private agreements reached in connection with the investment and also the principles of international law in that respect.\n\n5. Arbitration awards shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute.\n\n6. The Parties shall refrain from trying, through the diplomatic channels, arguments regarding arbitration or a judicial proceeding already pending until the relevant proceedings shall have been completed, unless the parties to the dispute shall have not discharged the arbitration award or the judgment rendered by the common court, pursuant to the terms for the discharge laid down in the award or the judgment.\"\n\n19.\n\nThe important point in the Argentina-Chile BIT is that it permits unilateral reference of a dispute to arbitration six months after the dispute has been raised. There is no equivalent of the '18-month litigation period' in Article 10(3) of the Argentina-Germany BIT.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the MFN provision in Article 3 of the Argentina-Germany BIT applies only to substantive protections under the BIT, which do not include the clauses on dispute resolution in Article 10.\n\n21.\n\nEach party referred to principles of treaty interpretation, decisions of other arbitral tribunals, and the writings of jurists in support of its position.\n\n**III The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal's jurisdiction depends upon the existence of an agreement between the two parties to the dispute - Hochtief and the Republic of Argentina. That agreement is not contained in a single document. The agreement of Argentina to accept the jurisdiction of the arbitral Tribunal in respect of a certain category of disputes is contained in the Argentina-Germany BIT. Article 10 of the BIT is, in effect, an offer to submit disputes to arbitration, which investors may accept.\n\n23.\n\nHochtief considers that its agreement is contained in the Request for Arbitration which is intended, in effect, to be an acceptance of Argentina's offer contained in Article 10 and Article 3 of the Argentina-Germany BIT.\n\n24.\n\nThe question is whether the 'offer' and the 'acceptance' have resulted in an agreement which provides the basis for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n25.\n\nBoth parties approached this question on the basis that is necessary to establish a consensus: i.e., that it is necessary to demonstrate that Hochtief's Request for Arbitration was an acceptance of the offer to arbitrate on the terms on which the offer was made, and not a counter-offer on different terms. The Tribunal shares this view.\n\n26.\n\nThe offer to arbitrate being contained in a treaty, it follows that the interpretation and analysis of its terms must be conducted in accordance with the law of treaties. The exercise is, accordingly, to be performed according to the principles set out in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ('VCLT'), to which both Argentina and Germany are Parties (and to which Article 11 of the BIT refers), and in particular in Articles 31-33 of the VCLT, which are familiar to all involved in investment arbitration.\n\n27.\n\nThe 'acceptance' is contained in the Request for Arbitration. There is no doubt as to the interpretation of the 'acceptance': it purports to accept the offer to arbitrate made in the BIT.\n\n**IV The interpretation of BIT Article 10**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe task of interpreting the BIT must be approached initially by giving the terms of the treaty their ordinary meaning in their context and in the light of the BIT's object and purpose. On this basis it is apparent that Article 10 of the BIT provides for a number of possible steps and for alternative procedures in the event of a dispute arising.\n\n29.\n\nArticle 10(1) provides that disputes shall as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute. There is no suggestion by the Respondent of any failure by the Claimant to comply with Article 10(1), which could affect the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; and the Tribunal sees no reason to suppose that the obligation imposed by Article 10(1) has not been fulfilled.\n\n30.\n\nParagraph (2) of Article 10 entitles either party - here, either Hochtief or Argentina -to require the submission of the dispute to the host State's courts:\n\n\"If a dispute within the meaning of paragraph 1 cannot be settled within six months from the date on which one of the parties concerned gave notice of the dispute, it shall, at the request of either party, be submitted to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.\"\n\nParagraph (2) refers to a 'request', but the request triggers an obligation ('shall... be submitted') to submit the dispute to the courts.\n\n31.\n\nNeither party takes any point concerning the six-month period to which Article 10(2) refers, and the Tribunal sees no reason to suppose that this obligation imposed by Article 10(2) has not been fulfilled.\n\n32.\n\nThe words \"shall be submitted\" are the only words in Article 10 paragraph 2 that are capable of imposing a legal obligation. The precise nature of the obligation set out in paragraph (2) is obscured by the phrasing of the provision. Instead of stipulating that 'one or other party shall submit the dispute' to the courts, it sets out the stipulation in the passive voice: the dispute shall be submitted to the courts.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent reads Article 10(2) as saying that in every case one or other party must submit the dispute to the domestic courts.3 The Respondent submits that \"the verbal expression 'shall be submitted' [makes] clear that it is an order\"4, so that one of the parties must submit the dispute to the domestic courts.5\n\nMemorial, paragraph 25.\n\nMemorial, paragraph 24.\n\nMemorial, paragraph 25.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimant, on the other hand, reads Article 10(2) as giving to each party a right to have recourse to the courts, but not as imposing upon either party a duty to do so.\n\n35.\n\nIt was not suggested that either party had made a request under Article 10(2) for the reference of the dispute to the courts in Argentina. This is a matter of some significance. The Respondent could have insisted upon the reference of the dispute to its courts under Article 10(2), but it did not do so.\n\n36.\n\nArticle 10(2) says that the dispute \"shall, at the request of either party, be submitted\" to the national courts. Article 10(2) thus obliges party B to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts if party A requests that the dispute be referred to the courts. The provision does not, however, explicitly impose a duty on either party A or party B to refer the case to the courts.6 Nor, in the view of the Tribunal, does Article 10(2) implicitly impose such a duty. Article 10(2) makes good sense interpreted without any such duty to refer implied into it. Recourse to the national courts is an important option. As far as investors are concerned, access to the host State's courts is a right that must surely be regarded as such an elementary part of the concept of legal protection that the right of access has little need of explicit statement. But under Article 10(2) it is not only the investor but also the host State that has the right to refer disputes to court.\n\nThe parties to the dispute will always be a Contracting Party to the treaty and a national or company of the other contracting party: Article 10(1).\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent could, if it had wished, have requested that the dispute be referred to its courts; and under Article 10(2) the Claimant would have been obliged to pursue the case in the national courts. The Respondent did not do so. Nor did the Claimant refer the dispute to the courts. The Respondent argues that in the absence of any reference of the dispute to the courts there can, under the scheme set out in Article 10, be no unilateral reference of the dispute to arbitration.\n\n38.\n\nArticle 10(3) provides that \"The dispute may be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal in any of the following circumstances\". There are two such circumstances.\n\n39.\n\nOne, in Article 10(3)(b), is \"Where both parties to the dispute have so agreed.\" There is no suggestion that there is any such agreement in this case apart from the agreement said to result from the offer in the BIT and the acceptance in the Request for Arbitration. No more need be said about specific agreements as a route to arbitration under the BIT, although the terms of the offer in the BIT and of the Request for Arbitration are, of course, central to the questions in this case.\n\n40.\n\nThe other circumstance, in Article 10(3)(a), is where \"[a]t the request of one of the parties to the dispute, after a period of 18 months has elapsed from the moment when the judicial process provided for by paragraph 2 of this Article was initiated, no final decision has been given or where a decision has been made but the Parties are still in dispute.\"\n\n41.\n\nFour points are to be noted about Article 10(3)(a). First, as in Article 10(2), it creates a right that may be exercised unilaterally: either the Claimant or the Respondent may refer the dispute to arbitration.\n\n42.\n\nSecond, reference to the courts does not entail a choice under a 'fork in the road' provision (and no such fork is created elsewhere in the BIT). Reference to the courts can be followed by a unilateral reference of the dispute to arbitration.\n\n43.\n\nThird, neither party is obliged to continue to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts for more than 18 months, whether or not the courts have reached a final - or any - decision in the case.\n\n44.\n\nFourth, the provision does not oblige either party to accept a decision of the court as the resolution of the dispute: either party may take the position that the parties are \"still in dispute\" despite any court decision.\n\n45.\n\nRespondent submits that the effect of Article 10(3) is that unless (i) there has been a reference to the courts under Article 10(2) and (ii) 18 months have elapsed since that reference, the circumstances envisaged in Article 10(3)(a) cannot arise and there can be no unilateral reference to arbitration. Claimant submits that the 18-month period is applicable only if there has in fact been a reference to the courts under Article 10(2), and that the provision has no application in circumstances where no such reference was made.\n\n46.\n\nBecause neither party is actually obliged to submit the dispute to the courts under Article 10(2), it cannot be supposed that every dispute not resolved by discussions will in fact be submitted to the courts. The question is in effect, therefore, whether the possibility of unilateral recourse to arbitration is altogether excluded in cases where there is no such reference to the courts.\n\n47.\n\nThe interpretation of Article 10(3) so as to require reference to the local courts as a precondition to recourse to arbitration in every case would, as the Respondent pointed out, have some features in common with a requirement to exhaust local remedies.7 Indeed, under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention the Respondent could have required the exhaustion of local remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under that Convention; but it did not do so.\n\nAs the Respondent noted: Memorial, paragraph 17.\n\n48.\n\nIn some ways, however, the effect of Article 10(3) as interpreted by the Respondent would be radically different from that of a duty to exhaust local remedies. There is no obligation under Article 10(3) to exhaust the remedies, or even to see a first-instance case through to its conclusion if that takes longer than 18 months. There would be no question under Article 10(3) of the effectiveness of the available remedies: recourse would be obligatory even in cases where it was perfectly clear that the courts could provide no remedy - for example, in cases where legislation has effectively left the court with no option except to decide the dispute against the Claimant.\n\n49.\n\nIf Article 10(3) were indeed interpreted so as to require in each and every case 18 months of litigation before any unilateral reference to arbitration, the effect of the resultant pattern of obligations would be as follows. A claimant might decide initially not to refer the dispute to the courts. The respondent might also decide not to 'request' (i.e., insist) that the dispute be referred to its courts under Article 10(2); and it might also decline to agree to a consensual reference to arbitration under Article 10(3)(b). A claimant could then refer the dispute to arbitration only if it first submitted the dispute to the courts. If the Claimant did indeed then proceed to submit the case to the courts, neither the Claimant nor the Respondent would be obliged by the BIT to accept any decision rendered by the court. (We put to one side the question whether such a decision could have effect as *res judicata* in any respect.) Equally, either party could simply abandon the litigation after 18 months. After 18 months had elapsed, either party could unilaterally submit the dispute to arbitration.\n\n50.\n\nIt is no doubt arguable that there is a duty on both parties to the dispute to act in good faith during the pursuit of a settlement of the dispute, so that that there is an obligation to enter into the litigation during the 18-month period in a manner that might lead to a resolution of the dispute by the courts. It is certainly valuable for each party (and perhaps particularly for the Respondent) that it has the right to insist upon reference of the dispute to the host State courts. It is also understandable that a six-month window for negotiations prior to any reference to the courts should be secured, as Article 10(2) does on one reading. But it is difficult to see the rationale for imposing, in the terms used in Article 10(3)(a), a duty to spend a period of 18 months with the dispute listed on the docket of domestic courts as a precondition for the reference to arbitration.\n\n51.\n\nTo oblige the parties to spend 18 months in litigation, where one or other (or both) of them might have decided in advance to reject any decision that might emerge from the courts, appears pointless. While the possibility of a requirement for pointless litigation may not be a decisive indication that this interpretation of the BIT is wrong, it must surely move some weight in that direction.\n\n52.\n\nThe problem does not arise from uncertainty as to the meaning of Article 10(3)(a) itself. Its meaning is clear. Article 10(3) supplements and follows on from Article 10(2). If either party requests that the dispute be submitted to the courts, it must be submitted to the courts. The dispute must then stay in the courts until either (i) a final decision is rendered by the courts or (ii) 18 months have elapsed from the initiation of the judicial process (Article 10(3)(a)), unless (iii) both parties agree before then to go to arbitration (Article 10(3)(b)).\n\n53.\n\nThe problem arises from the fact that there is no duty under Article 10(2) to refer the dispute to the courts, and that there is no provision in Article 10 that explicitly permits unilateral references to arbitration, except in circumstances where the dispute has in fact been referred to the courts. The only provision in Article 10 that clearly permits a reference to arbitration without prior litigation is Article 10(3)(b), which requires the agreement of both parties. Unless an additional implied right to have unilateral recourse to arbitration can be found, the result would be that litigation is always an essential precondition to the reference of a dispute to arbitration by one party acting unilaterally, but is not an essential precondition to a reference to arbitration agreed by both parties\n\n54.\n\nViewed in the light of the many provisions in other BITs that permit unilateral references to arbitration that result might be thought unusual; but it is not impossible, or wholly impracticable, or wholly unreasonable. The Tribunal is, however, not convinced that it is correct to interpret the BIT to mean that litigation is always an essential precondition to unilateral reference of a dispute to arbitration, and does not decide the point or rest its decision upon the rejection of this interpretation and the existence of an implied right of unilateral reference to arbitration. The Tribunal does not need to decide the point, because the Claimant has raised another argument, based on the MFN provision in BIT Article 3. That argument was the main focus of the parties' pleadings, and is a sufficient basis for the Tribunal's decision.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal thus proceeds on the assumption, and without deciding the point, that Article 10 of the Argentina-Germany BIT imposes a mandatory 18-month submission to the national courts as a precondition of unilateral recourse to arbitration under the BIT.\n\n**V The MFN provision**\n-----------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimant considers that the MFN provision in Article 3 of the BIT entitles it to rely upon the more liberal provisions on dispute settlement in the Argentina-Chile BIT. The Respondent, in contrast, considers that the Article 3 MFN provision applies only to 'substantive' rights, which in its view do not include the dispute settlement provisions, under the BIT.\n\n57.\n\nThe parties referred extensively to the jurisprudence and to writings of scholars on the effect of MFN clauses in BITs. The apparent inconsistencies in the case-law of arbitration tribunals on the question of the applicability of MFN clauses to dispute settlement provisions afforded each party the possibility of supporting its position by reference to earlier awards.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal has given very careful consideration to this jurisprudence, and is conscious of the advantages of consistency in the approaches of different tribunals to similar questions. It is also aware of the significance that other tribunals have attached to differences between the formulations of MFN provisions in various treaties. That said, it is the responsibility of this Tribunal to interpret to the best of its ability the specific provisions of the particular treaties that are applicable in this case, and not to choose between broad doctrines or schools of thought, or to conduct a head-count of arbitral awards taking various positions and to fall in behind the numerical majority.\n\n**VI Does the MFN provision apply to dispute settlement?**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe first question for the Tribunal is whether the MFN provision in BIT Article 3 is in principle capable of applying to dispute settlement provisions so as to modify BIT Article 10.\n\n60.\n\nArticle 3 contains provisions extending MFN treatment both to investments (Article 3(1)), and to investors (Article 3(2)). The obligation is the same in each case.8 The entitlement is to treatment that is not less favourable than the State accords to its own nationals or companies or to investments of nationals or companies of any third State. In the present case it is the entitlement of the investor that is relevant, because it is the treatment of the investor as a disputing party that is in issue.\n\nAs is clear in the authentic German and Spanish texts but not in the UN's English translation.\n\n61.\n\nArticle 3(2) does not provide that once one becomes an 'investor' under the Argentina-Germany BIT one has an entitlement to MFN or national treatment in every aspect of one's life, whether or not related to the investment. It does not, for example, give a right to join the 'nationals only' queue at immigration desks. Rather, Article 3(2) stipulates that the entitlement to demand MFN or national treatment from the State applies to investors \"as regards their activity in connection with investments in its territory.\"\n\n62.\n\nIs dispute settlement an 'activity in connection with the investment'? The Respondent argues that *ad Article 3* in the Protocol to the BIT indicates that it is not. *Ad Article 3* provides that\n\n\"(a) The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed \"activity\" within the meaning of article 3, paragraph 2: the management, utilization, use and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed \"treatment less favourable\" within the meaning of article 3: less favourable measures that affect the purchase of raw materials and other inputs, energy or fuel, or means of production or operation of any kind or the marketing of products inside or outside the country. Measures that are adopted for reasons of internal or external security or public order, public health or morality shall not be deemed \"treatment less favourable\" within the meaning of article 3.\"\n\n63.\n\nIn this English translation the opening phrase is unclear. It might be read as meaning that the listed examples (i) are deemed to be 'activities' but (ii) are not exclusively to be characterised as 'activities' and may also have another character. Alternatively, it might be read as meaning (i) that the following examples are deemed to be 'activities' but (ii) that the list is not exhaustive and there may be other examples of 'activities'.\n\n64.\n\nIn the authentic Spanish and German texts of the BIT the opening phrase is \"Por 'activitades' en el sentido del apartado 2 del art\u00edculo 3 se considerar\u00e1n, en especial pero no exclusivamente...\" and \"Als 'Betatigung' im Sinne des Artikels 3 Absatz 2 ist inbesondere, aber nicht ausschlieBlich...\" It is therefore clear that *ad Article 3* is setting out a non-exhaustive list of examples of 'activities' within the meaning of BIT Article 3.\n\n65.\n\nIt is suggested that the phrase \"the management, utilization, use and enjoyment of an investment\" should be read as an indication that the reference is to a range of activities concerned with the commercial operation of the investment, and that this does not include the pursuit of dispute settlement under BIT Article 10.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the phrase \"the management, utilization, use and enjoyment of an investment\" does include recourse to dispute settlement, as an aspect of the management of the investment. Indeed, the ('procedural') right to enforce another ('substantive') right is one component of the bundles of rights and duties that make up the legal concept of what property is.\n\n67.\n\nThis is clear if one considers the case of a claim to money or to performance having an economic value, both of which are stipulated by Article 1(c) of the Argentina-Germany BIT to be within the definition of an 'investment, or of intellectual property rights, addressed in Article 1(d). The argument that although a State could not cancel such claims or intellectual property rights without violating the BIT, it could cancel the right to pursue the claims or enforce the intellectual property rights through litigation or arbitration without violating the BIT is nonsensical. It is nonsensical because the right to enforcement is an essential component of the property rights themselves, and not a wholly distinct right.\n\n68.\n\nThis is a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the BIT. The BIT is an agreement both for the promotion and for the reciprocal protection of investments. It is an agreement between two States, which no doubt is intended to operate to the benefit of both States but which plainly confers benefits directly upon investors. The Tribunal considers that the provisions of Article 10, which on any interpretation confer upon investors the possibility of recourse to arbitration in addition to the right to have recourse to national courts, are a form of protection that is enjoyed within the scope of \"the management, utilization, use and enjoyment of an investment\". Unlike the inter-State dispute settlement provisions in Article 9, which safeguard the interests of the States parties in the event of a dispute regarding the interpretation or application of the BIT, Article 10 is a benefit conferred on investors and designed to protect their interests and the interests of a State Party in its capacity as a host State party to a dispute with an investor: it is a protective right that sits alongside the guarantees against arbitrary and discriminatory measures, expropriation, and so on.\n\n69.\n\nIf the investor submitted a dispute with a third party to the national courts in order to protect its legal interests - a simple claim for contractual payments from a customer would be an adequate example - it is difficult to see any reason why that litigation should not be regarded as a management activity to which the Article 3 MFN provision is applicable so as to supplement the entitlement to juridical security under Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n70.\n\nA court fee or bond requirement imposed on litigants who are nationals of State A but not on nationals of State B, for example, would appear to be caught by the MFN provision. So, too, would a requirement under national law to submit to conciliation prior to litigation, imposed upon nationals of A but not nationals of B.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no good reason to treat disputes between the investor and the State any differently from litigation between the investor and another private party, or to distinguish between the pursuit of remedies in the courts and their pursuit in arbitration, both of which are contemplated in Article 10 of the BIT.\n\n72.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied that the MFN provision is in principle applicable to the pursuit of dispute settlement procedures.\n\n73.\n\nIf there should be any doubt as to whether the pursuit of dispute settlement procedures falls within the scope of 'management', the Tribunal considers that there can be no doubt that the settlement of disputes is an \"activity in connection with investments\", to use the language of BIT Article 3 itself rather than the non-exhaustive phraseology of *ad Article 3*.\n\n74.\n\nThe fact that BIT Article 4(4) stipulates expressly that nationals or companies of either Contracting party are entitled to MFN treatment \"in respect of the matters provided for in this Article\", but that there is no express MFN stipulation in BIT Article 10 itself, does not change the position.9 There is similarly no express statement on MFN treatment in BIT Article 2 or BIT Article 5: but to the extent that those Articles are concerned with the treatment of \"investments\" or of \"nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their activity in connection with investments in its territory\", Article 3 paragraphs (1) and (2) make clear that the MFN provision is applicable. Moreover, Article 3 paragraphs (3) and (4) explicitly exclude certain matters from the scope of the MFN clause, but dispute settlement is not among them.\n\nIt is also arguable that the application of the MFN provision to dispute settlement procedures is an aspect of the enjoyment of full legal protection and security that is guaranteed by Article 4(1). The Tribunal takes no position on this point.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal is accordingly satisfied that the MFN provision in Article 3 of the Argentina-Germany BIT applies to dispute settlement under Article 10 of that BIT.\n\n76.\n\nAt this stage in the argument two further questions arise: (i) what effect does the entitlement to 'most favourable' treatment have upon the jurisdiction of a tribunal constituted in pursuance of the provisions of BIT Article 10? and (ii), is the requirement of 18 months prior litigation 'less favourable'?\n\n**VII MFN and jurisdictional limits**\n-------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nIt is well understood that MFN clauses are subject to implicit limitations. An example was given by the International Law Commission in its Commentary on its draft Articles on Most-Favoured-Nation clauses. It said that an MFN clause in a commercial treaty between State A and State B would not entitle State A to claim the extradition of a criminal from State B on the ground that State B has agreed to extradite such criminals to State C or voluntarily does so. The reason, it said, \"is that the clause can only operate in regard to the subject-matter which the two States had in mind when they inserted the clause in their treaty.\"10\n\nSir Arthur Watts, *The International Law Commission 1949-1998*, (Oxford, 1999), vol. III, p. 1821.\n\n78.\n\nThat proposition cannot seriously be challenged, and the principle is applicable to the present case. Having decided that the MFN provision is in principle applicable to the dispute settlement provisions of Article 10 of the BIT, it focuses attention on the need to ask precisely what rights are covered by the MFN obligation.\n\n79.\n\nIn the present case, it might be argued that the MFN clause requires that investors under the Argentina-Germany BIT be given MFN treatment during the conduct of an arbitration but that the MFN clause cannot create a right to go to arbitration where none otherwise exists under the BIT. The argument can be put more generally: the MFN clause stipulates how investors must be treated when they are exercising the rights given to them under the BIT but does not purport to give them any further rights in addition to those given to them under the BIT.\n\n80.\n\nThe question is, does the MFN clause in question here create new rights where none previously existed? And if not, is the right to have unilateral recourse to arbitration without the 18-month litigation period a distinct, new right or is it rather a matter of the manner in which those who already have a right to arbitrate are treated?\n\n81.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, it cannot be assumed that Argentina and German intended that the MFN clause should create wholly new rights where none otherwise existed under the Argentina-Germany BIT. The MFN clause stipulates a standard of treatment and defines it according to the treatment of third parties. The reference is to a standard of treatment accorded to third parties, not to the extent of the legal rights of third parties. Non-statutory concessions to third party investors could, in principle, form the basis of a complaint that the MFN obligation has not been secured. In contrast (to take an example comparable to the ILC example concerning commercial treaties and extradition), rights of visa-free entry for the purposes of study, given to nationals of a third State, could not form the basis of such a complaint under the BIT. The MFN clause is not a *renvoi* to a range of totally distinct sources and systems of rights and duties: it is a principle applicable to the exercise of rights and duties that are actually secured by the BIT in which the MFN clause is found.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal thus considers that the critical question is whether the absence of the 18-month litigation period in the dispute settlement provision of the Argentina-Chile BIT is a distinct right (in which case it would not be brought into the Argentina-Germany BIT by the operation of the MFN clause) or is a provision that concerns the treatment of investors in relation to the exercise of an existing right to arbitrate (in which case the MFN clause in the Argentina-Germany BIT could operate to disapply the 18 month litigation period in Article 10(3)(a)).\n\n83.\n\nThere is no established criterion to distinguish for this purpose between a 'right' and 'treatment in relation to the exercise of a right'. But there are several indications that the 18-month pre-arbitration litigation requirement should be regarded as a matter of the treatment of investors in exercising their rights in relation to dispute settlement and not as the subject of a distinct right.\n\n84.\n\nOn any interpretation of Article 10 of the Argentina-Germany BIT, an investor can ultimately exercise its rights so as to submit the dispute unilaterally to arbitration, without the need for the further specific consent of the State party to the dispute to proceed to arbitration. At worst, the investor (or indeed the State) could request the submission of the dispute to the courts under BIT Article 10(2) and then proceed 18 months later to arbitration under Article 10(3)(a). There is, therefore, a right under the Argentina-Germany BIT to submit an investment dispute to arbitration and to do so without the consent of the other party to the dispute.\n\n85.\n\nReliance on the Argentina-Chile BIT via the MFN clause would not give Hochtief a right to reach a position that it could not reach under the Argentina-Germany BIT: it would enable it only to reach the same position as it could reach, by its own unilateral choice and actions, under the Argentina-Germany BIT, but to do so more quickly and more cheaply, without first pursuing litigation in the courts of Argentina for 18 months.\n\n86.\n\nSecondly, the avoidance of the 18-month period in the Argentina-Germany BIT by reliance on the MFN clause would have no impact upon the scope of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It would not result in any case falling within its jurisdiction that could not eventually be brought before the Tribunal by the Claimant acting alone under Article 10 of the Argentina-Germany BIT. Nor would it remove the right of the Respondent to invoke Article 10(2) of the BIT in any dispute, and to require its submission to the national courts.\n\n87.\n\nThird, the 18-month litigation period gives no inherent benefit, other than the interposition of a period in which the parties may refine and reflect upon their respective positions, to the other party. Neither party is bound to continue the litigation for more than 18 months, whether or not the litigation has reached a conclusion. Neither party is bound to accept that the dispute has been resolved by any final court decision that is rendered within the 18 months period. Either party may, under BIT Article 10 paragraphs (3) and (4) bring the dispute before ICSID. That is very clear from Article 10 itself.\n\n88.\n\nWhile it is true that, as the Respondent noted,11 the 18-month period gives the courts the opportunity to resolve the dispute, the arbitrary limit upon the time allowed for litigation and the express removal of any duty to accept any judgment makes that opportunity, unlike a true duty to exhaust local remedies, to some extent perfunctory and insubstantial. There is no certain benefit of which the other party is deprived by allowing the MFN provision to render the 18-month period inapplicable. While not logically or legally decisive, the fact that adherence to the 18-month rule would bring no necessary benefit, and no necessary result other than the delay of the arbitration proceedings, is a fact from which the Tribunal derives some encouragement to believe that its decision is correct.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 4.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, to the extent that recourse to national courts is indeed considered to be a benefit to either party, each party has the right under BIT Article 10(2) to insist, unilaterally, that the dispute be referred to national courts. Indeed, from one perspective the question under consideration here is whether the Respondent, having chosen not to require a reference to the national courts under Article 10(2) may now raise the fact that there was no such reference as a bar to the arbitration of the dispute of which the Tribunal is seised.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that this approach to distinguishing between what is a new, independent, right to arbitrate and what is simply a manner in which an existing right to arbitrate must be exercised reflects the distinction between questions of jurisdiction and questions of admissibility. Jurisdiction is an attribute of a tribunal and not of a claim, whereas admissibility is an attribute of a claim but not of a tribunal. A distinction may also be drawn between questions of admissibility and questions of receivability. A tribunal might decide that a claim of which it is seised and which is within its jurisdiction is inadmissible (for example, on the ground of *lis alibi pendens* or *forum non conveniens*); or it might refuse even to receive and become seised of a claim that is within its jurisdiction because of some fundamental defect in the manner in which the claim is put forward *.*\n\n91.\n\nIn broad terms, the Tribunal considers that the question in this case is not whether the MFN clause can alter the jurisdiction of tribunals established under the BIT but whether it can affect the prescribed procedures for accessing that jurisdiction. The reason can be expressed in terms of the distinction between rights and the manner in which rights are required to be exercised.\n\n92.\n\nThe reason might also be based upon the fact that the Contracting Parties to the BIT (Argentina, Germany) are not the same as the parties to the dispute (Argentina, Hochtief). If a tribunal is established by or under a treaty made by States, its jurisdiction is fixed by that treaty. Its jurisdiction can be altered by the agreement of the States Parties to treaty; but it cannot be altered by the parties to disputes who present themselves to the tribunal. So, for example, the ICJ could not hear a claim from an individual claimant against a State, even if the 'Respondent' State agreed to appear before the Court and defend the claim. If the Court purported to hear the case, it would not be functioning as 'the ICJ' under the ICJ Statute.\n\n93.\n\nSimilarly, if this Tribunal were asked by both parties to the present dispute to decide upon, say, a dispute which arose before the treaty entered into force, and were to accede to that request, it would not be functioning as an Article 10 tribunal under the Argentina-Germany BIT. Argentina and Germany agreed, in Protocol *ad Article 8*, that the Treaty shall in no case apply to disputes which arose before it entered into force. Argentina and Hochtief cannot by agreement between themselves vary the terms of that agreement between Argentina and Germany. In such a hypothetical case it may be that, because the disputing parties had consented to put the matter to this tribunal, the tribunal would have the legal competence to hear and decide the preexistent complaint case: but if it did hear and decide the case it would be functioning as an *ad hoc* tribunal, and not as an Argentina-Germany BIT tribunal.\n\n94.\n\nQuestions of admissibility, on the other hand, are different from questions of jurisdiction. The disputing parties are entitled to raise objections based upon questions of admissibility, but they are not bound to do so; and if they do not raise those objections, they will have acquiesced in any breach of the requirements of admissibility and that acquiescence will 'cure' the breach. The tribunal, if it has jurisdiction, will proceed to hear the case.\n\n95.\n\nIn the ICJ, for example, rules on admissibility include such matters as the rules on the nationality of claims and the exhaustion of local remedies. The ICJ may have jurisdiction to decide whether State A had injured corporation B in violation of international law; but it may be that the claim actually filed is inadmissible because it has been brought by the wrong State,12 or because local remedies have not yet been exhausted.13 But if no objection is raised on such grounds, the Court will not raise the matter *proprio motu*.14 If, on the other hand, the objection based upon admissibility is raised and upheld, the very same claim (*mutatis mutandis*) could be brought by another State or brought after the exhaustion of local remedies (to pursue the examples used above), because the Court has jurisdiction in respect of the claim. Defects in admissibility can be waived or cured by acquiescence: defects in jurisdiction cannot.\n\n*Case concerning the Barcelona Traction*, *Light and Power Company*, *Limited (Belgium v. Spain),* Judgment, Feb. 5, 1970, ICJ Reports 1970, p. 3.\n\n*Interhandel Case (Switzerland v. United States)*, Judgment of March 21, 1959, ICJ Reports 1959, p. 6.\n\nSee *Case concerning the Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States v. Italy)*, Judgment, July 20, 1989, ICJ Reports 1989, p. 15.\n\n96.\n\nViewed from this perspective the question in the present case is whether the 18-month period is a requirement of the kind in respect to which the Respondent could accept or acquiesce in non-compliance, and whether it has done so. The Tribunal considers that the Respondent can indeed accept or acquiesce in such non-compliance and that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal remains unaffected by it. It regards the 18-month period as a condition relating to the manner in which the right to have recourse to arbitration must be exercised - as a provision going to the admissibility of the claim rather than the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n97.\n\nIn this case there are two sets of conditions for access to arbitration: those in the Argentina-Germany BIT and those in the Argentina-Chile BIT. As explained above, the Tribunal considers that those sets of conditions are provisions relating to the protection of investors and to the management, utilization, use and enjoyment of an investment, and accordingly covered by the Article 3 MFN provision.\n\n98.\n\nThe MFN provision does not permit the selective picking of components from each set of conditions, so as to manufacture a synthetic set of conditions to which no State's nationals would be entitled. The Claimant in this case cannot rely upon the lack of an 18-month litigation period in the Argentina-Chile BIT and ignore the fact that Article 10(2) of the Argentina-Chile BIT imposes a 'fork in the road' provision: it must rely upon the whole scheme as set out in either Article 10 of the Argentina-Chile BIT or Article 10 of the Argentina-Germany BIT. In this case it has chosen to rely upon Article 10 of the Argentina-Chile BIT.\n\n99.\n\nThe resulting position should be spelled out, as should the scope of the Tribunal's decision. The Tribunal notes the limits of its jurisdiction as set by the Argentina-Germany BIT. It accepts that the procedures relating to the bringing of a dispute to the Tribunal are covered by Article 3 of the Argentina-Germany BIT. And it accepts that the Claimant can therefore rely upon the procedures set out in Article 10 of the Argentina-Chile BIT (including the 'fork in the road' provision). The MFN provision thus operates in this case within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as set by the Argentina-Germany BIT, and operates so as to modify the procedures applicable to the seising of the Tribunal. It is not necessary to decide what the position would have been if the Argentina-Chile BIT had established a wider jurisdiction for tribunals than is established in the Argentina-Germany BIT, and the Tribunal takes no position on this question.\n\n**VIII Is Article 10(3) 'less favourable'?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that it is wrong to presuppose that, for example, litigation in national courts is any less favourable than arbitration, or that a right to arbitrate after 18-months of litigation in national courts is less favourable than a right to arbitrate immediately. The Tribunal does not share that view. It considers that whatever the substantive merits of litigation and of arbitration, it is always more favourable to have the choice as to which to employ than it is not to have that choice.15 This implies no criticism whatever of the national courts.\n\nThere are, no doubt, value judgments concerning the desirability of choice and the existence of free will presupposed in that proposition. The Tribunal is, however, content to accept it as a premise.\n\n**IX Other issues: the location of the 'treatment'**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nIt was argued by the Respondent, on the basis of the wording of BIT Article 3, that the MFN provision applied only to treatment that is meted out in the territory of the State, and that its application in these proceedings was not treatment within the territory of the State. Further, it was said that because the practice in investment arbitrations is for the tribunal not to sit in the host State, this was a further indication that Article 3 is inapplicable to the Article 10 procedures.16\n\nTranscript, day 1, pp. 26 - 33\n\n102.\n\nThe consequence of this argument, if correct, is said to be that the duty to accord MFN treatment was not engaged in this case, so that the Claimant cannot rely upon the MFN obligation in order to establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n103.\n\nArticle 3(1) and (2) of the BIT as it is translated in the *United Nations Treaty Series* read as follows:\n\n\"(1) Neither Contracting Party shall subject investments in its territory by or with the participation of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments of its own nationals or companies or to investments of nationals or companies of any third State.\n\n(2) Neither Contracting Party shall subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their activity in connection with investments in its territory, to treatment less favourable than it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.\"\n\n104.\n\nThe phrase translated as 'in its territory' is placed differently in the corresponding and authentic German and Spanish texts, which read as follows:\n\n\"(1) Jede Vertragspartei behandelt Kapitalanlagen von Staatsangehorigen oder Gesellschaften der anderen Vertragspartei oder Kapitalanlagen, an denen Staatsangehorige oder Gesellschaften der anderen Vertragspartei beteiligt sind, in ihrem Hoheitsgebiet nicht weniger g\u00fcnstig als Kapitalanlagen der eigenen Staatsangehorigen und Gesellschaften oder Kapitalanlagen von Staatsangehorigen und Gesellschaften dritter Staaten.\n\n(2) Jede Vertragsparei behandelt Staatsangehorige oder Gesellschaften der anderen Vertragspartei hinsichtlich ihrer Betatigung im Zusammenhang mit Kapitalanlagen in ihrem Hoheitsgebiet nicht weniger g\u00fcnstig als ihre eigenen Staatsangehorigen und Gesellschaften oder Staatsangehorige und Gesellschaften dritter Staaten.\"\n\n\"(1) Ninguna de las Partes Contratantes someter\u00e1 en su territorio a las inversiones de nacionales o sociedades de la otra Parte Contratante o a las inversiones en las que mantengan participaciones los nacionales o sociedades de la otra Parte Contratante, a un trato menos favorable que el que se conceda a las inversiones de los propios nacionales y sociedades o a las inversiones de nacionales y sociedades de terceros Estados.\n\n(2) Ninguna de las Partes Contratantes someter\u00e1 en su territorio a los nacionales o sociedades de la otra Parte Contratante, en cuanto se refiere a sus actividades relacionadas con las inversiones, a un trato menos favorable que a sus propios nacionales y sociedades o a los nacionales y sociedades de terceros Estados.\"\n\n105.\n\nThe phrase 'in its territory' appears to be linked to the treatment, rather than to the investment; and the material words would be more precisely translated as \"... shall subject in its territory investments...\" or \"... shall in its territory subject investments...\". The result would be that the subjection of investments or investors to treatment outside Argentina could not engage liability under Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n106.\n\nGiving this phrase its full weight and assuming, *arguendo*, that actions of the Respondent outside Argentina with respect to investments made by a claimant would not covered by the BIT, the question would be whether the invocation of the 18-month period under Article 10(3) in this case is treatment 'outside the territory' of the State. The Tribunal does not consider that it is.\n\n107.\n\nThe investment was made in Argentina. The Respondent's decision to invoke the challenge based upon Article 10(3) of the BIT is an act which was located in the seat of the Respondent's Government, and which would be implemented in Argentina by requiring the Claimant to engage in litigation before the courts in Argentina. Thus far, no extraterritorial element is evident.\n\n108.\n\nThe only extraterritorial elements appear to be that the jurisdiction challenge is raised in a session held outside Argentina by a Tribunal that is characterised by the Respondent as having an institutionally extraterritorial nature because it is an international tribunal expected to sit outside the Respondent State.17\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 33; and Day 1, p. 4.\n\n109.\n\nThe critical question is, what is the 'treatment' to which the MFN obligation applies. The relevant treatment in this case is not constituted by the act of the reading or hearing by the Tribunal of the Respondent's challenge based upon BIT Article 10(3). The place where that happens is not the location of the treatment: it is the location of the consequences or the effects of the treatment (and, furthermore, the actual location of the reading or hearing is purely contingent, and may differ as between members of the Tribunal). The treatment of which the Claimant complains is the Respondent's insistence upon the '18-month' requirement and insistence by way of a jurisdictional challenge upon the pursuit of litigation in the courts in Argentina.\n\n110.\n\nThe 'international' nature of this Tribunal does not alter the position. It does not deprive the conduct of the Respondent of its intra-territorial character.\n\n111.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the relevant treatment is the reliance by the Respondent, not having invoked Article 10(2), upon Article 10(3) and the refusal of the Respondent to submit to immediate arbitration as the Claimant wishes. That conduct cannot be said to be conduct outside the territory of the Respondent for the purposes of Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n**X The Second Objection: Hochtief's Standing**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe second objection is that Hochtief lacks the standing to present this claim because the rights belong to a different juridical person. The argument is in essence that because Hochtief operated through a locally-incorporated subsidiary, PdL, and that subsidiary is the party that was allegedly injured, Hochtief has no right to bring this claim.\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent referred to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention in this connection and argued that its effect was that PdL should have brought the claim, and that for it to be entitled to do so it would have to show that Argentina had agreed to accord PdL the same rights as a foreign investor and that PdL was in fact under foreign control.18 It argued that claims by shareholders ('derivative claims') are only allowed where they are specifically provided for in the BIT, and it contrasted the Argentina-Germany BIT with the Argentina-US BIT in this respect.19\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 43-44.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 45-46.\n\n114.\n\nThe Respondent pointed out that *ad Article 4* in the Protocole to the BIT provided for compensation \"also\" in the event of the taking of measures \"against the company in which the investment is made\" (i.e., the locally-incorporated subsidiary; in this case, PdL), drawing the inference that in other cases no action lies in respect of injury to the company in which the investment is made.\n\n115.\n\nWhatever the thinking behind the drafting of *ad Article 4* might have been, Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT is unequivocal in stipulating that an investment includes \"shares, stocks in companies, and other forms of participation in companies.\" The States Parties to the BIT could, had they wished, have limited the scope of the term 'investment' to cases where the foreign investor holds a controlling shareholding or even a 100% shareholding in a locally-incorporated subsidiary in the host State. They did not do so.\n\n116.\n\nHochtief owns 26% of the shares in PdL, to which it has contributed capital and made loans totalling over USD 34 million.20 Given the scale of what would be regarded in any commercial context as an investment, and given the likelihood of consortium funding for large-scale projects, it is not surprising that the States Parties to the BIT agreed upon a definition of 'investment' that includes configurations such as those in the present case. Moreover, the terms of the tender document under which Hochtief bid for the right to engage in this project stipulated that the successful bidder would have to operate through a company incorporated in Argentina.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paragraphs 4, 100. The total contribution including interest up to May 2007 is said to be almost USD 50 million: ibid., paragraph 102.\n\n117.\n\nThe fact that Hochtief agreed, under Article 5 of the Concession contract, to assign all of its rights and obligations to PdL does not alter the position. Indeed, it confirms that Hochtief's investment consisted precisely in its shares in PdL and other forms of investment recognized in BIT Article 1(1).21\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 55-56\n\n118.\n\nSimilarly, the fact that there are jurisdictional clauses relating to disputes under the concession contract, providing for litigation or arbitration in Argentina,22 does not alter the position. Those provisions govern the manner in which PdL must pursue dispute settlement; but they do not alter the character of Hochtief's participation in PdL as an investment.\n\nSee Transcript, Day 1, p. 59.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that Hochtief has made an investment in Argentina, in PdL, and that it is an investor under the BIT.\n\n**XI Jurisdiction of the Centre**\n---------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent sought a declaration that the dispute was not only outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal but also outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. The Tribunal does not accept that this is so. The dispute plainly concerns a dispute between a State Party to the BIT and an investor of the other State Party, both States being Contracting Parties to the ICSID Convention. The dispute arises out of an investment; and the parties to the dispute have, as explained above, consented to submit it to arbitration. The Tribunal accordingly considers that the requirements of the ICSID Convention and in particular Article 25 thereof, are met.\n\n**XII The contract claims and double recovery**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent argued that Hochtief's claim overlapped with contractual claims being pursued in the courts in Argentina, and that Respondent was being put at risk of having to pay twice for the same alleged injury.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of this risk, but does not consider that it is a matter that goes to the question of jurisdiction. It will, if necessary, be addressed at a later stage in these proceedings.\n\n**XIII Costs**\n--------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent requested an order that costs and fees be taxed against the Claimant. The Tribunal reserves this question for decision along with the merits of this dispute.\n\n**XIV Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal has reached this Decision on Jurisdiction by a majority. It has done so after a great deal of thought and detailed discussion, reflecting the difficulty of the question.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 7 November 2007, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 5 November 2007 from Hochtief against Argentina (the \"Request\" or \"RFA\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 18 December 2007, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 19 February 2008, Claimant elected to submit the arbitration to a Tribunal constituted of three arbitrators, as provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n9.\n\nOn 23 April 2008, Claimant appointed Judge Charles N. Brower, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator. On 2 May 2008, Respondent appointed Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C., a Canadian national, as arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 24 April 2009, the Centre informed the Parties that in accordance with the method agreed by the Parties, Judge Charles N. Brower and Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C. had agreed on the appointment of Professor Vaughan Lowe, a national of the United Kingdom, as the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nOn 30 April 2009, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Sergio Puig, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 19 June 2009, the Tribunal held a procedural session with the Parties by telephone conference and, pursuant to the Parties' agreement, on 16 April 2010, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and reached agreements on several procedural matters, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in force since 10 April 2006, and that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish.\n\n13.\n\nDuring the First Session, the Parties further agreed that Claimant would file a memorial on the merits on 29 April 2010, and that Respondent would file a memorial on jurisdiction within 120 days from its receipt of Claimant's memorial on the merits. It was also agreed that the Tribunal would promptly instruct the Parties on the timetable for the further submissions. The Minutes were signed by the President of the Tribunal and Mr. Gonzalo Flores on behalf of the ICSID Secretariat, and circulated to the Parties.\n\n14.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits was submitted on 29 April 2010, and Respondent submitted its Memorial on Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Centre and the Competence of the Tribunal on 30 July 2010. Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction was submitted on 15 October 2010.\n\n15.\n\nOn 25 June 2010, Respondent submitted a request for production of documents, followed by Claimant's observations on Respondent's request, on 21 July 2010.\n\n16.\n\nOn 2 November 2010, after having considered the views of the Parties, the Tribunal decided, to deal with the objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question, and decided on Respondent's request for production of documents.\n\n17.\n\nOn 10 November 2010, the Centre informed the Tribunal and the Parties that Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Mr. Sergio Puig as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nOn 22 December 2010, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction, and on 10 February 2011, Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n19.\n\nA hearing on Jurisdiction took place at the World Bank's Conference Centre in Paris on 4-5 March 2011.

A number of governmental regulations were in place that restrained or prohibited foreign investments in Argentina.1\n\nCl. Mem.\u00b6\u00b6 65-66, Cl.

PHB\") \u00b6 19.\n\nb) The Convertibility Regime and overview of the legal framework\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nBeginning in 1991, the Government of Argentina (\"the Government\"), enacted a variety of economic reforms to change its policy toward foreign investors, took steps to privatize many of its services, and created laws to encourage foreign investment.2\n\nCl. Mem.\u00b6 67, Cl. PHB \u00b6 19.\n\n55.\n\nLaw 23,928, known as the \"Convertibility Law\", became effective on 1 April 1991, and pegged the Argentine peso to the US dollar by providing that the Argentine peso was convertible by law at a rate of US$ 1:AR $ 1, and that the Argentine Central Bank was obliged to sell dollars at that rate of exchange. The Convertibility Law also provided that contracts could be denominated and legally enforced in Argentina in US dollars.3\n\nCl. Mem.\u00b6 68, Cl. Rep. \u00b6 37, Cl. PHB \u00b6 21. Convertibility Law, Art. 7 (Exh. CX-9).\n\n56.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Argentina promoted its reforms to potential foreign investors. It created an Undersecretariat of Investment as part of its Ministry of Economy and Public Works and Services to facilitate the entry of foreign investment, which prepared and distributed a publication in English entitled \"Argentina, a Growing Country, A Compendium for Foreign Investors,\" dated November 1993. Claimant further asserts that in this Compendium Argentina made several representations, amongst them, that the Convertibility Law, which was described in the Compendium as the \"cornerstone of a very strict stabilization plan\" had \"virtually removed currency risk\",4 and that, under Argentine law, \"[c]ontracts can be denominated and legally enforced in foreign currencies.\"5 According to Hochtief, it relied upon the representations contained therein in making its decision to invest.6\n\n*Argentine Investment Compendium*, at 8-9 (Exh.

Mem. \u00b6 75.\n\n57.\n\nOn 9 April 1991, Argentina and Germany signed the Treaty. It entered into force on 8 November 1993. The Preamble of the Treaty provides that it is intended \"to create favourable conditions for investments\" and that it recognizes \"that the encouragement and contractual protection of such investments are apt to stimulate private business initiative...\"7 Claimant cites the Executive Letter, dated 9 January 1992, through which Argentina sought legislative approval of the Treaty, which stated that \"under the said agreements, the States undertake to maintain unchanged during the life thereof some rules on treatment of investments, with which they hope to establish an atmosphere of stability and trust to attract investments\".8\n\nCl.

The other shareholders made similar equity contributions in proportion to their shareholdings. Also, in addition to the initial contribution of US $30 million made by the PdL shareholders, in January 2001 PdL's shareholders made an additional equity investment of US $13.65 million.

Professor Eichengreen expressed that the crisis was the result of a series of external factors that were difficult to predict.68 Professor Nouriel Roubini, who was not cross-examined during the hearing, had referred in his report to the external shocks affecting the Argentine Republic since 1998, which caused exchange parity to become increasingly difficult to sustain. Dr. Edwards expressed his disagreement with Prof. Eichengreen and Prof. Roubini with respect to the impact of external shocks, and asserted that the analysis that both have provided \"is incomplete and thus incorrect.\"69 According to Dr. Edwards, \"there [were] a number of ways of dealing with [the crisis],.that did not require pesification\"70.

According to Argentina, it stopped payment because a subcontractor, who had worked on the Project, made a claim against PdL for unpaid work, to which PdL replied that it had been unable to pay the subcontractor because of the loss of the third party funding resulting from Argentina's failure to timely pay the Subsidy.92\n\nCl.

It modified the applicable interest rate; interest was to be compounded on a daily basis; maintenance and operation expenses were pesified and would be deemed equal to the pesified amount of the projected costs in 1997; collections under the loan would be made on a daily basis; amounts that PdL could not pay would be added to the principal amount of the loan on a daily basis.

(\"Boskalis\") formed a joint venture (the \"Joint Venture\") that entered into a dredging subcontract with PdL dated 18 December 1998116.

The consequences thereof, if any, in respect of the issue of causation of PdL's claimed losses is a matter of dispute between the Parties.\n\n126.\n\nAccording to Claimant, it was not involved in the ownership or management of Ballast Nedam Baggeren when the Joint Venture commenced ICC arbitration. Hochtief asserts that in November of 2001, Ballast Nedam Baggeren merged with a subsidiary of Hollandsche Beton Groep N.V. (\"HBG\"), to form a new company, Ballast HAM Dredging (\"BHD\"). Claimant further asserts that Ballast Nedam sold its interest in BHD in late 2002120, and that Hochtief had no interest in Ballast Nedam after 2004.121 Claimant concludes that Hochtief's one-time ownership in Ballast Nedam has no relevance to any claim or defense in this proceeding.122\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 305.

Claimant notes that this agreement could be terminated by either party if it was not implemented within 60 days (i.e. by 15 February 2010), and that, like the May 2006 and February 2007 CdEs, the December 2009 Transitory Agreement required PdL to waive the rights against Argentina of two-thirds of its shareholders, but it did not contain an indemnification requirement.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n--------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction dated 24 October 2011, the Tribunal decided by a majority:\n\n\"(i) to reject the Respondent's submission that the Centre has no jurisdiction and the Tribunal has no competence over this case;\n\n(ii) to assert that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal has competence over this case; and\n\n(iii) to decide upon the question of costs and fees at a later stage, along with the merits of the dispute.\"\n\n149.\n\nThe reasoning of the majority in that Decision distinguished between questions of jurisdiction and questions of admissibility.157 The Decision settled the question of jurisdiction in the present case, but did not address questions of the admissibility of each element of the claims except in so far as that was necessary in the course of the analysis of the question of jurisdiction. Accordingly, this Decision on Liability begins with an analysis of the challenges that were raised by Respondent to the admissibility of Claimant's case. Those objections fall under five broad headings: (A) matters arising from the separate personality of PdL; (B) temporal limitations upon the claims; (C) Claimant's recovery under political risk insurance; (D) Claimant's claims *qua* creditor; and (E) the 'Ballast Nedam' arguments.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 90 ff.\n\n(A) The 'PdL Questions'\n-----------------------\n\n150.\n\nRespondent raised three arguments that bear upon the admissibility of the claims, and which are rooted in the relationship between Claimant and PdL. They flow from Respondent's contention that this case is based upon Claimant's allegations that Respondent acted unlawfully towards PdL as the holder of the Concession and, in essence, that PdL stood between Claimant and Respondent.\n\n151.\n\nSpecifically, Respondent argued: (i) that the Tribunal should not admit a claim made by Claimant in respect of rights that belong to PdL;158 (ii) that the Tribunal should not admit a claim made by Claimant in respect of measures that were consented to by PdL;159 and (iii) that a ruling in favour of Claimant would, in light of the agreement reached between Respondent and PdL, lead either to double recovery or to recovery by a shareholder (Claimant) at the expense of the company (PdL) and its other creditors and shareholders.160\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 18-24.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 1.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 2.\n\n152.\n\nBefore turning to these three specific arguments, the Tribunal will set out its analysis of the relationship between PdL's rights and Claimant's rights.\n\na) PdL's Rights and Hochtief's Rights\n-------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided in the context of its Decision on Jurisdiction that Hochtief is an investor. It is a shareholder in PdL, and it can bring a claim for any breach of the terms of the Treaty that has damaged its shareholding in PdL. That follows from the definition of an 'investment' in Article 1.1 of the Treaty, which includes \"shares, stocks in companies and other forms of participation in companies.\" But in the present case all of the alleged breaches arose from Respondent's conduct in its dealings with PdL, and not from Respondent's conduct in its dealings directly with Claimant or other shareholders in PdL or with their shareholdings. The question is whether that renders Claimant's claim inadmissible.\n\n154.\n\nThe harm for which Claimant seeks redress is the \"losses to Hochtief AG's investments in PdL\", to use the words of the title of the LECG First Report, dated 29 April 2010. In other words, the harm to Claimant alleged to have resulted from Respondent's breach of the Treaty is the diminution in the value of Claimant's investments in PdL caused by Respondent's treatment of PdL: it is what is sometimes called 'reflective loss'.161\n\nSee the LECG Report, 29 April 2010, \u00b6 44 and Executive Summary, \u00b6 1.\n\n155.\n\nPdL has signed what might be characterized as a settlement of its claims against Respondent: the 2012 Transitory Agreement. Respondent argues that the Treaty obligations were owed to PdL,that any harm suffered was suffered by PdL and that, as a shareholder in PdL, Claimant has no right to opt out of the settlement accepted by PdL. On this view, redress has been offered by Respondent and accepted by the injured party, PdL; and Claimant as a minority shareholder in that injured party is bound by that settlement.\n\n156.\n\nWere those the only material facts there would be a strong argument for concluding that Claimant has no basis to protect its rights and interests as a minority shareholder in PdL by rejecting the settlement that was reached by a majority of PdL shareholders with Respondent and pursuing a separate claim. This is the conclusion that would appear almost axiomatic from the perspective of company law. Anyone who invests as a minority shareholder runs the risk that the decisions properly taken by majority shareholders will be undesirable, or even inimical, to them: that is a consequence of shareholder democracy, and a price of being a minority shareholder.\n\n157.\n\nIn the present case, however, the analysis does not focus on the question of whether the company - PdL - is a separate legal entity (which it plainly is) and on what rights are held as a matter of Argentine law by the company and what rights are held by Claimant as a shareholder. The analysis starts instead with the question of what rights Claimant has as a matter of treaty law as an investor under the BIT; and that question must be addressed within the particular context of the BIT, and not by proceeding from principles of municipal company law, no matter how widely or how firmly those municipal law principles are established or may otherwise be relevant to issues of corporate governance that may arise in the course of considering a treaty claim. In this context, the Tribunal attaches particular importance to two material facts.\n\n158.\n\nFirst, the initial investment was made by members of a consortium, which bid for the Project as a consortium. The Concession was awarded by Respondent to that consortium: not to PdL or to some other single company, but to the members of the Consortium. The incorporation of PdL was required by the terms of the bid offer in order to implement the terms of the Concession.\n\n159.\n\nThe Concession Contract162 was signed by each one of the Consortium members, including Claimant, on 28 January 1998. The Ministry, too, signed on that day, and time then started to run on the obligations under the Concession Contract.163 The Tribunal considers that the investment was made no later than that date, and that the Claimant's own investment at that time took the form of the obligations under the Concession Contract accepted by Claimant in return for the right to participate in the Consortium Project as agreed with the Respondent.\n\nExh. CX-32.\n\nCf., Villagi's Testimony, Tr. Day 4, p. 725.\n\n160.\n\nClaimant's rights as an investor were at that time *its own rights in relation to the Project as a member of the Consortium*, and not its rights *qua* shareholder in PdL; and Respondent's obligations to Claimant under the BIT date from that time. Among Claimant's rights at that time was the right to be treated fairly and equitably.\n\n161.\n\nPdL was incorporated on 1 April 1998; and on 17 June 1998 all the rights and duties set out in the Concession Contract were transferred by and from the Consortium to PdL ('the transfer').164 On 17 June 1998, as a result of the transfer, Claimant's investment changed its legal form; but Claimant nonetheless continued to hold an investment in Argentina.\n\nExh. CX-36; Exh. RA 126.\n\n162.\n\nThis is not a case where the State has dealt with a single company throughout the relevant time, and a claimant shareholder has subsequently emerged from behind a hitherto-intact corporate veil and announced that it is seeking redress for alleged injuries to the company.\n\n163.\n\nNor is this a case where it can be said that Claimant is trying to obtain the benefits -chiefly, limited liability - of the corporate form while seeking to avoid its disadvantages. The Concession Contract itself ensured that the Consortium members would secure the transfer to PdL of what the Parties to the Concession Contract regarded as adequate financial resources for the Project, so that the incorporation of PdL cannot be regarded as an improper attempt to avoid financial liability.\n\n164.\n\nSecondly, the Concession Contract itself (in Article 5.2) stipulated that PdL would assume all obligations and rights of the Consortium members under the Concession Contract. Both Respondent and Claimant entered into the Project knowing that for the purposes of pursuing the Project PdL would be the vehicle and the nominal actor, while behind PdL the commercial interests would remain in the hands of the individual members of the Consortium. The legal form of the investments would change; but the underlying commercial reality would not.\n\n165.\n\nIt is plainly possible in circumstances such as these to transfer to a locally-incorporated corporation all of the substantive contractual rights (here, the rights under the Concession Contract) initially held individually by the investors who collectively own that locally-incorporated corporation. Indeed, that is what was done when PdL was established. Equally, the Tribunal does not doubt that in the context of BIT rights a State and an investor can, by agreement between them, extinguish the right of an investor, as a member of a consortium, to take action in its own name to enforce against the State the rights that it had previously possessed under the BIT.165 But the question here is different. It is whether the individual investors can transfer to the local corporation their rights under an applicable BIT166 to protect their substantive rights under the Concession Contract; and if so, whether they did so transfer their rights.\n\nThe rights in question under the BIT are those of the investor, so that there is no question of an attempt by an investor to waive the right of its national State to exercise diplomatic protection on its behalf.\n\nOf all of the Consortium members, Hochtief alone was German. The balance of the Consortium therefore had no rights under the Germany-Argentina BIT.\n\n166.\n\nIt is evident that there can be no simple substitution of PdL for the individual Consortium members. In the present circumstances, for example, the transfer could not confer upon PdL (an Argentine company most of whose shares were owned by investors of other, non-German nationalities) the rights that the Germany-Argentina BIT conferred on German companies, including the Claimant. That effect cannot be brought about within the provisions of the Germany-Argentina BIT. At most, the procedural rights of the Consortium members under the BIT could be extinguished, and supplanted by whatever procedural rights were available to PdL.\n\n167.\n\nThere is no evidence that Claimant's rights under the BIT were extinguished here. There is no indication in the terms of the invitation to bid, or in the Concession Contract, or in the various unimplemented settlement agreements, that the legal right and capacity of each investor under an applicable BIT to sue to uphold its substantive BIT rights was altogether extinguished by the very fact of the creation of PdL. Section 5.2 of the Concession Contract refers only to the assumption by PdL of \"all obligations, liabilities and rights *hereunder* as well as all loans and guarantees applied for and obtained by the Successful Bidder in connection herewith\" (emphasis added). Rights and obligations *under the Concession Contract* were transferred to PdL: but there is no provision that purports to transfer to PdL Claimant's rights and obligations under the Germany-Argentina (or any other) BIT or to extinguish such treaty rights.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly considers that Claimant retains its standing to bring claims in respect of the treatment of its shareholding in PdL in a situation such as the present, where (i) the investment was clearly made at a date before the establishment of PdL and the Claimant acquired rights under the BIT at that date, and (ii) the bidding terms required the transfer of consortium rights to a company to be established and maintained for the purpose of holding the concession rights so transferred, and (iii) the actual commercial obligations (of financing, of commitment of materials, technology, labour and skills, and of organization of work, etc) remained unchanged by the transfer of rights to PdL, and (iv) there is no evidence that the Claimant had waived or renounced its rights of action against Respondent under the BIT.\n\n169.\n\nThis is the general reason in principle why the Tribunal does not regard the claims in this case as inadmissible by reason of Respondent's arguments based upon the separate legal personalities of Claimant and of PdL.\n\n170.\n\nAgainst the background of this explanation of its reasoning, the Tribunal now turns to the three specific arguments noted in paragraph [151] above.\n\n**(i) Claimant's investment as shareholder in PdL**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the argument that the Tribunal should not admit a claim made by Claimant in respect of rights that belong to PdL. As was noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction,167 Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT is unequivocal in stipulating that an investment includes \"Shares, stocks in companies and other forms of participation in companies.\"168 Further, the Protocol to the BIT specifies that the definition of an investment includes \"specifically those capital investments that do not entitle their holders to voting or control rights.\"169 Minority shareholdings are thus clearly included.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 115.\n\nThis is the English translation in the United Nations Treaty Series ('UNTS'). Vol. 1910, at p. 198. The English translations submitted by the Parties differ in certain details from that in the UNTS, but the Tribunal has examined the authentic German and Spanish texts and is satisfied that there are no material differences.\n\nProtocol, Ad Section 1(c).\n\n172.\n\nClaimant owns 26% of the shares in PdL and is plainly entitled to bring a claim in respect of that shareholding,170 which constitutes an 'investment' in Argentina within the meaning of the BIT. The question of the extent of those rights - the question of precisely what rights attach to the shareholding - is distinct; and it is raised also by the second of the arguments distinguished in paragraph [151], above.\n\nWhich distinguishes the situation in this case from that in *Barcelona Traction* : see Resp. PHB, \u00b6 54.\n\n173.\n\nIt is said that under Article 5 of the Concession Contract, Claimant assigned to PdL all of its rights and obligations in respect of the Project, and that Claimant therefore retains no rights for which it can seek protection under the BIT. The Tribunal does not accept that argument.\n\n174.\n\nThe rights and obligations under the Concession Contract may belong to PdL to the exclusion of the Claimant; but the claim in this case is not made in order to vindicate any of those rights but in order to vindicate rights under the BIT that attach to Claimant's investment in the shares of PdL. The precise extent of PdL's own rights and obligations under the Concession Contract will plainly affect the value of Claimant's investment in the shares of PdL; but, whatever the extent of PdL's rights under the Concession Contract may be, Claimant as a shareholder in PdL has an interest in the shares of PdL which it is entitled to protect under the BIT.\n\n**(ii) PdL and the March 2012 Transitory Agreement**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe second argument is that the Tribunal should not admit a claim made by Claimant in respect of measures that were consented to by PdL. This argument focuses not on the initial assignment of rights by Claimant to PdL but on PdL's subsequent agreement with the Respondent on the settlement of outstanding claims, in the March 2012 Transitory Agreement (' *Acuerdo Transitorio* ').171\n\nSee above, \u00b6 155.\n\n176.\n\nRespondent's argument here is that since PdL held all of the rights that were allegedly violated, PdL was competent, and PdL alone was competent, to agree upon a settlement of any and all claims concerning the violation of those rights, and that PdL did so in the March 2012 Transitory Agreement.172\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 42-55.\n\n177.\n\nFor its part, Claimant asserts that the March 2012 Transitory Agreement has not been implemented, and in any event contains no waiver of its Treaty claims.173\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 276 - 279.\n\n178.\n\nAt this point in the analysis we are concerned only with the question whether the argument is applicable as a bar to the admissibility of the claims in this case. We are not concerned at this stage with the question of the implications of PdL's signature of the March 2012 Transitory Agreement for the substantive question of Respondent's liability: that is a merits question, not a preliminary question of admissibility.\n\n179.\n\nWhatever those implications might be, PdL's signature of the March 2012 Transitory Agreement cannot operate *in limine* to bar the admissibility of the claim and prevent its consideration by the Tribunal. Claimant contends that PdL was not entitled to settle claims concerning the violation of Claimant's rights, and that it was unfair and inequitable of Respondent to purport to settle those rights of Claimant by means of its agreement with PdL. That contention is put forward by Claimant in respect of its investment in PdL. It is a contention that Claimant is entitled to have considered, and which can be appraised only in the context of a consideration of the merits of the case.\n\n**(iii) 'Double Recovery'; Claimant's profits as construction contractor**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThird, Respondent argues that there is a possibility of double recovery.174 Even assuming that such a possibility exists, however, that is a matter concerning the remedy rather than the claim. It is not a bar to the admissibility of a claim - unless, perhaps, it arises as an aspect of an argument based upon the principle of *res judicata,* which is not the case here. To the extent that there may be a possibility of double recovery, that is a matter to be taken into account in the context of the need to prove and to quantify loss, and in the drafting of any Order by the Tribunal *.* The Tribunal accordingly rejects this objection to the admissibility of the claim.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 2.\n\n181.\n\nSimilarly, Respondent submits that the fact that Claimant derived benefits from its involvement in the actual construction of the highway and bridge bears upon the admissibility of its claim.175 The Tribunal does not consider that submission to have any legal basis. The fact that an investor has earned profits in the capacity of a contractor working on the physical construction of the project in question cannot operate to bar the admissibility of that investor's claim, although it may bear upon the merits of the claim and / or upon questions of quantum. The Tribunal accordingly rejects this objection to the admissibility of the claim.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 13, 183-186, 194-196; Sandleris and Schargrodsky Valuation Report, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 43, 104; Sandleris and Schargrodsky Supplementary Valuation Report, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 138-139, 269, where the experts observed that Hochtief had failed to provide access to information pertaining to the revenues it received as a contractor during the construction phase.\n\n(B) The temporal limits of the dispute\n--------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nOver the course of the proceedings, Hochtief supplemented its claims by reference to the continued unfolding of events in Argentina. Respondent asks the Tribunal to limit its consideration to the claims as they stood at 18 December 2007, which is the date of the registration of the Request for Arbitration (the Request for Arbitration itself being dated 5 November 2007).176\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 231.\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it to be axiomatic that the scope of the claims that Respondent is called upon to answer is fixed by the terms of the Request for Arbitration and the Submissions set out in the Memorial. Subject to the possibility of the making of ancillary claims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute,177 those instruments define the case that the Respondent has to answer, and the case in respect of which Preliminary Objections must be made.178 No ancillary claims have been made in this case; and the difference between the date of the Request for Arbitration and the date of its registration by ICSID is not material. Nor is there any suggestion that the scope of the claims as set out in the Memorial differs from that set out in the Request for Arbitration.\n\nICSID Convention Article 46; ICSID Arbitration Rules (2006), Rule 40.\n\nICSID Convention Articles 36, 41; ICSID Rules (2006), Rule 41.\n\n184.\n\nAs long as the claims remain within the limits thus described, the facts that a tribunal may take into account in order to decide the claims are not confined to those facts that occurred prior to the date of the signature or registration of the Request for Arbitration and / or the Memorial. The *quantum* claimed may clearly need to be updated in the light of later events; and even matters bearing upon liability may be affected by developments up to the date of the hearing - for example, if action by the Respondent amounts to timely reparation for an earlier action that had caused injury to the Claimant.179 As long as Respondent has been given a proper opportunity to respond to all factual allegations, the consideration of events occurring after the filing of the Request for Arbitration and the Memorial is permissible, and it will be for the Tribunal to determine the relevance of such references for the claims that are properly before it. Respondent had that opportunity to respond in the present case. This appears not to be contested.180 This objection to the admissibility of the claims is accordingly dismissed.\n\nSee, for example, *Swisslion DOO Skopje* v *Macedonia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/16), Award, 6 July 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 133-139 .\n\nSee Resp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 231- 232.\n\n(C) Claimant's political risk insurance\n---------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nRespondent asserts that on 7 December 2007, the German Government agreed to pay Claimant EUR 11,359 million under a political risk insurance policy that covered the losses encompassed within the claims made in the present case, and that in consequence, by virtue of Article 6 of the BIT, Germany is now subrogated to the rights of Hochtief so that Claimant can no longer pursue its claim.181\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 233.\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with that analysis. Article 6 is phrased in terms that do not require that the insuring State succeed to and extinguish the rights of the insured investor once payment is made on the insurance policy. Much less does Article 6 itself bring about that legal result. Article 6 merely obliges the respondent State to recognize or admit (' *reconocer\u00e1*, ' *erkennt* ') such a transfer of rights if and when the transfer is in fact effected by provision of law or by a legal act. In the present case no such transfer has been shown to have occurred. The Tribunal accordingly dismisses this objection to the admissibility of the claim.\n\n(D) Claimant's claims as creditor\n---------------------------------\n\n**(i) Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nRespondent raises objections to the elements of the claim that arise from Claimant's position as a creditor of PdL. The first objection concerns Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract.182 Respondent submits that this provision bars claims against Argentina by lenders to PdL, despite the arbitration clause in the Treaty.183 In so far as the claims in this case relate to Claimant's loans to PdL, it is said that the claims are made by Claimant as a creditor of PdL.\n\nExh. RA 12.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 214, 275; Resp. PHB \u00b6 19.\n\n188.\n\nArticle 22.2 provides that:\n\n\"Loans entered into by the Successful Bidder and Concessionaire, as the case may be, to finance the construction, maintenance and operation of the Project shall not be secured by Grantor, nor shall the lenders be entitled to any claim against Grantor or the Provinces, all of which shall be indicated in the relevant agreements.\"\n\nThe evident purpose of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract is to limit the extent of Respondent's liability for loans procured by the Concessionaire. It is a means of ensuring that the State (the Grantor) makes its agreed financial contribution to the Project and that thereafter it faces no further financial exposure: it is for the concessionaire, through what was plainly expected to be a mix of equity and loan financing, to contribute the remaining finance needed for the Project. It may be that Article 22.2 was drafted with third party lenders, rather than inter-company loans, in mind. But the provision does not express any such limitation upon its scope of application, and the majority of the Tribunal sees no basis for reading such a limitation into Article 22.2.184\n\nIt is noted that other sections of the Concession Contract, such as Sections 11.1 and 11.3, do expressly provide for the position of third parties.\n\n189.\n\nArticle 22.2 provides that lenders are not entitled to \"any claim against the Grantor or the Provinces.\" The question is whether \"any claim\" includes both claims under the law applicable to the loan contract and claims under the BIT. 'Any claim' means, on the face of it, *any* claim. The precise legal basis of a claim is not material. The question is whether this is effective to bar BIT claims.\n\n190.\n\nIt is necessary to decide if an investor can be bound by an agreement with a host State that it will not invoke the protection of the Treaty in relation to a limited and specified range of issues. In the present case, the issues in question are loans by Claimant to PdL, which are legal arrangements to which Respondent is not a party, and whose terms were not agreed by Respondent.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that there is no legal reason why effect should not be given to an agreement between an investor and a host State either to limit the rights of the investor or to oblige the investor not to pursue any remedies, including its BIT remedies, in certain circumstances. Such an agreement does not purport to alter the terms of the Treaty. Nor does it necessarily purport to bar action in respect of extant responsibilities of the Grantor: it may constitute an agreement by a particular investor to limit the range of matters for which the Grantor carries the risk and responsibility. It may also be regarded as an agreement by the investor not to rely upon certain treaty provisions and extant rights in the specified circumstances.\n\n192.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal considers that Article 22.2 is such a provision, and that it operates so as to bar \"any claim\", including claims under the Treaty, by a signatory to the Concession Contract, such as Claimant, against the Respondent *in so far as the claim is made by the signatory in its capacity as a lender*. Neither the Concession Contract nor the BIT contains any provision that expressly nullifies Article 22.2 or subordinates it to the protections afforded by the Treaty. The Concession Contract is governed by Argentine law,185 and there is no suggestion that Argentine law imposes any such nullification or subordination upon Article 22.2.\n\nConcession Contract, Article 35.1; and the Bilateral Investment Treaty, Article 10(5).\n\n193.\n\nIn the view of the majority, Article 22.2 takes effect so as to limit the range of matters for which the Grantor carries the risk and responsibility. Under the Concession Contract, the Grantor was to provide a subsidy to the Project and once that subsidy was paid in full, the Grantor bore no further financial exposure. In the case of loans, the parties to the Concession Contract agreed that the Lender and the Successful Bidder and Concessionaire, and not the Grantor, should carry that business risk and responsibility. The Successful Bidder and Concessionaire agreed in the Concession Contract that the Grantor will not carry any liability to any lender for any loans covered by Article 22. In this way, the Concession Contract underlined the basic principle that, having paid the totality of its promised subsidy, Respondent had no further financial exposure: the obligation to arrange finance for the Project lay with the Successful Bidder and Concessionaire, whether by capital contributions, third-party loans, inter-company loans or other arrangements made by the Successful Bidder and Concessionaire.\n\n194.\n\nArticle 22.2 relates only to claims made by 'lenders', which the Tribunal understands to mean claims made by lenders in their capacity as such, relying upon their rights under the relevant loan agreement. The Tribunal accordingly decides, by a majority, that claims made in this arbitration by Claimant in its capacity as a lender to PdL are precluded by the terms of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract. When valuing Claimant's interests as a shareholder in PdL, however, it will take into account all of the inter-company loans made by Claimant in the same way that all other financial transactions are counted on the balance sheet as corporate assets or liabilities of PdL; but they will not be counted as individual interests of particular lenders.\n\n**(ii) Conformity of the loans with Argentine financial regulations**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nRespondent argues further that Claimant's loan transactions were not all recorded as required by Argentine financial regulations,186 and that the loans were accordingly not made in accordance with the laws and regulations of Argentina and are excluded from the scope of the Treaty protection by Article 2(2) of the Treaty.187\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant reported only one foreign-currency loan transaction to the Argentine Central Bank: Resp. PHB \u00b6 21; Exh. RA 451.\n\nSee Tr., Day 11, pp. 2694 - 2695.\n\n196.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's prior finding, strictly speaking it is not necessary to dispose of this objection. However, the Tribunal will make a few comments because the questions raised by the objection are important ones.\n\n197.\n\nArticle 2(2) reads as follows:\n\n\"Investments made by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter Party shall enjoy full protection under this Treaty.\"188\n\nEnglish translation from the version in vol. 1910 of the *United Nations Treaty Series.*\n\n198.\n\nClaimant suggested that the loans were not subject to the reporting requirement because PdL was not a financial institution. Respondent did not accept that view; but the Parties did not adduce expert evidence focused on the regulatory requirements, nor did they make detailed submissions on the legal consequences of any failure to make reports required by Argentine regulations. It is also notable that Respondent did not suggest that the loans violated Argentine law in any respect other than a failure to fulfil the reporting requirement that was said to apply to them.\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in previous cases, tribunals have focused upon compliance with \"fundamental principles of the host State's law\".189 This Tribunal considers that to be the correct focus when the question is addressed in the context of questions of jurisdiction and admissibility. Investments that are forbidden, or dependent upon government approvals that were not in fact obtained, or which were effected by fraud or corruption can be caught by a provision such as Article 2(2) of the Argentina-Germany BIT. But not every technical infraction of a State's regulations associated with an investment will operate so as to deprive that investment of the protection of a Treaty that contains such a provision.\n\nThe term used in *Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17), Award, 6 February 2008, \u00b6 104, citing *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26) and *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25) *.*\n\n200.\n\nHaving considered the facts in the present case, and the submissions of the Parties on this point, the Tribunal does not consider that there is a sufficient basis for rejecting the claims concerning the loans on the basis of their non-registration under Argentine regulations. This decision concerning the effect of the alleged breaches of reporting requirements in Argentina's financial regulations on the question of the admissibility of the claims is, however, taken without prejudice to the possibility that such breaches might, by virtue of Article 2(2) of the Treaty, limit the substantive rights enjoyed by the Claimant.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision concerning the admissibility of claims in respect of Claimant's loans to PdL thus remains based upon the majority decision concerning Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract, as explained above. The Tribunal accordingly concludes, by a majority, that claims made by Claimant in its capacity as a lender to PdL are inadmissible in this arbitration.\n\n(E) The 'Ballast Nedam' argument\n--------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nBallast Nedam, a Netherlands company, was part of a joint venture (with Boskalis International BV, another Netherlands company) which was the main subcontractor of PdL on the Rosario-Victoria Project. Respondent argues that Claimant attempted to conceal the true nature and extent of its relationship with Ballast Nedam, as part of a plan to recover as much as possible of its investment in Argentina by means that would remain outside the purview of this arbitration and the sight of this Tribunal.\n\n203.\n\nIn essence, Respondent suggests that Claimant had a financial interest as a shareholder in Ballast Nedam, and that Ballast Nedam colluded in threatening to force PdL into insolvency in order to put pressure on Respondent to provide financial benefits to PdL. Further, there is some suggestion that the plan was that Ballast Nedam, in its ostensible capacity as a third-party creditor of PdL, would recover sums from PdL which would enure to the benefit its shareholders, including Claimant.\n\n204.\n\nRespondent argues that these arrangements and plans amount to an improper attempt by Claimant to mislead observers, including the Tribunal, as to the real economic interests in play in this case.190 It argues that Claimant should, in consequence, be deprived of the protection of the Treaty by having its claim declared inadmissible.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 99-157.\n\n205.\n\nThe facts underlying these allegations and arguments are complex. They also emerged at a late stage: Respondent asserts that it was only on the fifth day of the merits hearing that it became aware that Claimant held 48% of the shares in Ballast Nedam.191 The matter was, however, addressed during that hearing and in post-hearing submissions, and the Tribunal is satisfied that it has sufficient information on this matter for the purposes of reaching a decision in this arbitration.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 99.\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the principles governing the admissibility of claims are rooted not only in the notion of a claim that is inherently ripe and properly made, but also in the proper administration of justice. Admissibility is concerned both with the claim itself and with the arbitral process. In a case where an allegation of impropriety, made in the context of a plea of inadmissibility, is based upon facts that are inextricably bound up with the range of facts upon which the substantive claim is based, it will usually not be practicable to decide upon the question as a preliminary issue. If the tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the case, it should in such circumstances do so.192\n\nCf., the approach of the International Court of Justice to this general issue: *Avena,* *I.C.J. Reports 2004*, p. 12, \u00b6\u00b6 45 - 47.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal considers this to be the case in these proceedings, and accordingly rejects the argument that the claim be dismissed *in limine* on the ground that it is inadmissible because of the relationship between Claimant and Ballast Nedam.\n\n(F) CONCLUSIONS ON ADMISSIBILITY\n--------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Tribunal, having already determined (by a majority) that it has jurisdiction over the claims in this case, rejects all except one of the objections to their admissibility. That one exception concerns claims made in this arbitration by Claimant in its capacity as a lender to PdL: these are precluded by the terms of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract. The Tribunal will identify the precise scope of those 'creditor claims' at the points in its analysis where the matter arises and can most clearly be addressed.\n\n**V. MERITS**\n-------------\n\n209.\n\nClaimant invokes several provisions of the Treaty: (A) Fair and Equitable Treatment ('FET') under Article 2(1) of the Treaty); (B) Full Protection and Security, under Articles 2(1) and 4(1)); (C) Expropriation (Article 4(2)); (D) the 'observance of obligations' or 'Umbrella Clause' (Article 7(2)); (E) Arbitrary or Discriminatory Measures (Article 2(3)). In addition, Claimant asserts (F) that Respondent breached binding unilateral declarations in violation of international law. These are considered in turn.\n\n210.\n\nIt may assist in the reading of the following paragraphs to say at this point that, in broad terms, the majority of the Tribunal has decided that the initial steps taken by Argentina to address the financial crisis by the pesification process do not amount *in themselves* to a violation of the Treaty but that Argentina's failure to renegotiate the contract with PdL, as provided for in Argentine law, in a timely and final fashion does amount to a breach of the FET standard, for which reparation is due. Argentina's actions in respect of the payment of the Subsidy agreed with PdL do not amount to a breach of the FET standard. The terms of the 'Emergency Loan' made by Argentina to PdL, however, are not compatible with the FET standard. The Tribunal does not find that any other independent breaches of the BIT have been established.\n\n(A) FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT: Article 2(1)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe claim based upon the FET principle has four components, each based upon a different aspect of conduct for which Respondent is said by Claimant to be responsible. They are (1) the failure to pay the Subsidy on time; (2) the 'pesification process'; (3) the 'Emergency Loan'; and (4) the failed renegotiation attempts. These are considered in turn.\n\na) The failure to pay the Subsidy on time\n-----------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nA central element of Claimant's case is the argument that Respondent failed to make the Subsidy payments as and when they were due; that this failure violated the fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") provision in the Treaty; and that this violation caused Claimant financial loss. The Subsidy was intended to finance the first stages of the Project up to a capped amount, with the balance to be financed by the Concessionaire.193 According to the Concession Contract, the Subsidy was to be paid out in full, in scheduled monthly instalments, before the duty to finance the continuation and completion of the Project passed across to the Concessionaire.194\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 14.\n\nConcession Contract, \u00a77.2; Final Technical Document (Exh. CX-33), \u00a736.2.\n\n213.\n\nIt is not disputed that there were in fact delays in the payment of the scheduled instalments of the Subsidy.\n\n214.\n\nRespondent's position is that the acknowledged delays do not constitute a breach of the Treaty because (i) Respondent complied with its contractual obligations by paying interest in respect of those delays,195 and (ii) the obligations were a purely contractual matter and a breach of them could not rise to the level of a breach of the Treaty.196\n\nResp. C-M. \u00b6\u00b6 117, 135; Resp. PHB \u00b6 10\n\nResp. C-M. \u00b6\u00b6 388- 389.\n\n215.\n\nIt is evident that, in this part of its claim, what Claimant relies on to establish a breach of its rights under the Treaty is the alleged breach by Respondent of an obligation based in contract. Respondent was initially under no obligation other than the obligation under the Concession Contract to make those Subsidy payments. There is no suggestion that PdL was without access to the normal legal procedures for the enforcement of contracts. Moreover, Respondent paid interest on the late instalments in accordance with the Contract.197\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 10.\n\n***Contractual breaches are not ipso facto treaty breaches***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that a contractual breach necessarily amounts to a breach of the Treaty's FET standard. In the particular circumstances of the present case, having regard to the 2000 *Acta Acuerdo* and to the payment by Respondent of interest in respect of delays in the payment of instalments of the Subsidy, the Tribunal does not consider that Respondent's failures to meet the contractual dates for payments of the Subsidy rise to the level of a violation of the FET standard.\n\n217.\n\nClaimant argues that the FET standard requires more than the 'minimum standard' of protection prescribed by customary international law, and that it requires 'stability, predictability and consistency' and the protection of an investor's 'legitimate expectations'.198\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 188-206.\n\n218.\n\nIn *Waste Management II* the tribunal (there addressing the FET standard in NAFTA Article 1105) said that even the persistent non-payment of contractual debts by a municipality was not to be equated with a violation of Article 1105, provided that it did not amount to \"an outright and unjustified repudiation of the transaction and provided that some remedy is open to the creditor to address the problem.\"199 The *Waste Management II* tribunal observed that otherwise the treaty \"would become a mechanism of equal resort for debt collections and analogous purposes in respect to all public (including municipal) contracts, which does not seem to be its purpose.\"200\n\n*Waste Management, Inc.* v. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3) *,* Award, 30 April 2004, \u00b6 115; and cf., *ibid*., \u00b6 98. (*Waste Management II)*\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 116.\n\n219.\n\nThis Tribunal agrees with the approach taken in the *Waste Management II* award. The Tribunal is mindful of the controversy concerning the precise definition and content of the FET standard. The Treaty does not define the FET standard, and the decisions of other tribunals (to which both Parties referred) are not in themselves binding sources of international l aw.201 But the Tribunal notes that the threshold for a treaty breach set by *Waste Management II* is representative of the approach taken by investment tribunals to this question, and agrees that this is the proper approach to the interpretation of the FET obligation. The *Waste Management II* approach is particularly apposite in a case where the treaty breach is said to be constituted by a breach of contract. The conduct in this case falls, in the view of the Tribunal, very clearly short of a violation of that threshold.\n\nResp. C-M. \u00b6\u00b6 335-339. Cl. Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 196-203. Such decisions are only \"subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.\"\n\n220.\n\nThat is sufficient reason for dismissing the claim that the failure to pay the instalments of the Subsidy on time violated Claimant's Treaty right to Fair and Equitable treatment; and it is not necessary to consider additional arguments leading to the same conclusion.\n\n***The wider consequences of late subsidy payments did not cause the collapse of the Project***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nIt might be argued that although the simple failure to pay Subsidy instalments according to the contractual timetable is not a breach of the FET standard under the BIT, the late payment of the Subsidy caused the failure of the first IDB loan disbursement,202 and that this had a domino effect that led to the problems encountered by the Project, and that these wider consequences constituted a breach of the FET standard.\n\nSee letter from PdL to IDB dated 26 February 2001 (Exh. CX-166).\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal does not understand the evidence in that way. It does not consider that Claimant has shown that it was the delay in paying the Subsidy that caused the IBD to withdraw its support. On the contrary, it considers that the evidence on the record strongly points to the fact that there were \"many issues\" that prevented the IBD from disbursing the loan in the manner anticipated by the Consortium.\n\n223.\n\nParticularly significant, in the view of the Tribunal, were the doubts generated by the results of a traffic study undertaken in 2001 (well prior to the enactment of the Emergency Law) with a view to confirming the financial projections that had been made by PdL to support its application for the loan.203 A traffic study was deemed to be critically important to disbursing the loan proceeds because it would assist the lending parties in ascertaining the prospects of their being repaid if they were to permit the loan to be disbursed. The IDB thus explicitly made its offer of finance subject to there being \"no material adverse change in the financial condition, operations or prospects of the Rosario-Victoria Bridge Project prior to the execution of... final commitment by the Bank.\"204\n\nLetter from the IDB to the President of PdL, dated 28 February 2002: Lommatzsch Stmt., Exh. R. Article 5 of the IDB loan agreement with PdL (Exh. CX-46) set out the conditions precedent to disbursement, which included (Section 5.1.(t)) the delivery to IDB of a traffic study demonstrating that the Debt Service Coverage Ration following Technical Completion would be not less than 1.5 at any time.\n\nIDB letter to Financial Director, Impregilo S.p.A. and General Manager PdL, dated 4 August 1999 (Exh. RA 143).\n\n224.\n\nThe position is well illustrated by the terms of the letter from the IDB to PdL dated 28 February 2002.205 That letter is sufficiently important to warrant its quotation in full:\n\n\"Thank you for your letter dated February 1, 2002, in which you outline your concerns regarding the disbursement of the loan from the Bank and its participating banks. We can assure you that the Bank has employed good faith efforts. We have tried to address in a mutually satisfactory manner among all parties the various issues that have been identified over the course of negotiating the remaining documentation and the satisfaction of the Conditions Precedent for disbursement. Therefore, it is unfortunate that all of our efforts have been perceived by Puentes del Littoral and its Sponsors as simply delay tactics.\n\nAs you are aware, the Loan Agreement executed in July of 2000 contemplated that certain financial projections had to be confirmed at the time of the disbursement by a traffic study. The results of the traffic study called into question the Company's economic and financial viability. The Bank has undertaken considerable effort to restructure the financial plan to address this issue. Moreover, all of the Bank's and the Borrower's hard work to ensure the Borrower's compliance with the Disbursement Conditions have been further complicated by the enactment of the Emergency Law No. 25561 by the Argentine government on January 6, 2002 (the \"Emergency Law\") as well as other related governmental measures. At a minimum, the Emergency Law has complicated the Borrower's ability to meet a number of Disbursement Conditions.\n\nFollowing the successful re-negotiation of the Concession Agreement, the Bank and the participating banks will be in a better position to evaluate the Company's economic and financial viability. In this regard, we have just received your proposal of February 27, 2002, are in the process of analysing it and will revert to you shortly.\n\nAs we have indicated on numerous occasions, we would welcome reaching a conclusion with the Borrower and the Sponsors regarding the many issues that have prevented the Bank from disbursing to date. \"206[Emphasis added.]\n\nExh. CX-70.\n\nLetter from the IDB to the President of PdL, dated 28 February 2002: Lommatzsch Stmt., Exh. R. A similar impression was given in the evidence of Mr Martin Bes, the only witness with direct knowledge of what transpired within the IDB in relation to PdL: see Tr., Day 11, pp. 2604-2612.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal draws from this letter the conclusions: (i) that not only the non-payment of the Subsidy but \"many issues\", including in particular the results of the traffic study, led the IDB not to make the disbursements of the loan as planned, (ii) that the position was at that time recoverable and that the IDB remained willing to make loans to the Project, albeit on renegotiated terms,207 and (iii) that the one act of Respondent that was particularly identified as further complicating disbursement was not the non-fulfilment of the planned timetable to Subsidy payments but rather the adoption of the Emergency Law and related governmental measures.\n\nIt may also be noted that even in Section 6 of the 'Financial Aid' Loan signed on 21 February 2003, it was still envisaged that the IDB might make a loan to PdL (Exh. CX-78).\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly considers that the failure to pay the Subsidy on time did not violate the FET standard established by the BIT. The Emergency Law and other measures adopted during the 'pesification process' are considered in the next section of this Decision.\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimant's inability to demonstrate that the late payments were in themselves a breach of the FET standard, or that the late payments caused the collapse of the Project, is sufficient reason for dismissing the claim that the failure to pay the instalments of the Subsidy on time violated Claimant's Treaty right to Fair and Equitable treatment. It is not necessary to consider additional arguments leading to the same conclusion.\n\n***Respondent's argument based on Claimant's alleged breach of contract***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, it should be said that Respondent also asserts, by way of a defence, that PdL acted in bad faith and was itself in breach of its contractual obligations in the performance of the Concession Contract, notably by failing to obtain the Firm and Irrevocable Financing Agreements (variously described as 'FIFAs' or 'AFFIs') required by Section 22.1.a) of the Concession Contract.208 Respondent says that Claimant was consequently not entitled to rely upon its rights under the Concession Contract.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 65.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in Clause 1 of the *Acta Acuerdo* of 20 October 2000, Respondent agreed to deem \"the obligation under Section 22.1.a) of the Concession Agreement to have been fully met.\"209 The 2000 *Acta Acuerdo* was a settlement of the dispute between the Parties as to whether or not PdL had provided the necessary FIFAs; and the effect of the settlement is that as between Respondent and Claimant, Claimant cannot be regarded by Respondent as being in breach of Section 22.1.a). In making this finding, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's relying upon the *Acta Acuerdo*. It was entered into by a senior official of the State and in the circumstances of this case there is no basis for its now being repudiated. The *Acta Acuerdo* did not merely provide that Respondent would take no action in respect of any breach of Section 22.1.a) that might have occurred: it provided that the Parties agreed as of the date of the *Acta Acuerdo* that any such breach had been cured. Respondent cannot, therefore, rely upon any alleged breach by PdL of Section 22.1.a) as a justification for any of Respondent's own acts that took place after 20 October 2000.\n\nExh. CX-48, Exh. CX-137.\n\n230.\n\nThat does not necessarily mean that Respondent's actions prior to 20 October 2000 could not be justified by reference to any failure by PdL to comply with Section 22.1.a) of the Concession Contract; but it is not necessary to decide this question because the Tribunal has determined that in any event the late payment of the Subsidy was not a breach of the FET obligation under the BIT.\n\nb) The pesification process\n---------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe next body of conduct to be considered is the 'pesification process': i.e., the departure of the Argentinian peso from the statutory regime which secured parity with the US dollar. That process rested on the enactment on 6 January 2002 of Law 25,561, the Public Emergency and Foreign Exchange System Reform Law (\"the Emergency Law\"), and the adoption on 3 February 2002 of Decree No. 214/02. Those measures abrogated the Convertibility Law and converted into Argentine pesos money obligations that had previously been expressed in foreign currency, and abrogated indexing mechanisms tied to foreign currencies or economies. They also provided for the renegotiation of public works contracts in order to mitigate the detrimental effects of this pesification.210\n\nSee below, \u00b6\u00b6 241, 248.\n\n232.\n\nIt may be helpful to outline at the outset of this section of the analysis the broad approach of the Tribunal to the pesification question. The pesification process was part of a major economic and commercial upheaval. There is much that can be said about its causes and much that can be said about its consequences, both generally and in the context of this particular case. But the question to be addressed here is straightforward: as a matter of legal principle, does the Argentinian pesification process amount to a violation of Argentina's BIT obligations?\n\n233.\n\nThere are three layers of legal analysis involved in that question. Taking the matter for the moment in the context only of FET, the first is the question whether pesification is *prima facie* incompatible with the FET standard in circumstances where it has been represented to investors by the Government that dollar-peso parity would be maintained (or to put it in another way, represented that pesification would not take place). If it is, the second question is whether there is any provision within the Treaty itself that can affect the question whether pesification is in principle a breach of the Treaty. The third question, which arises only if pesification is in principle a breach of the Treaty, is whether the wrongfulness of pesification under the Treaty can be precluded by the plea of necessity under customary international law.\n\n***Was pesification in itself a breach of the BIT?***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe first question is whether the pesification was in itself a breach of the FET standard secured by the BIT.\n\n235.\n\nClaimant pointed to many statements by the authorities in Argentina, and to reports of such statements, made prior to and after Claimant made its investment, to the effect that parity between the peso and the dollar would be maintained.211 There can be no serious doubt that all of the Parties to the Contract (including the Government of Argentina) assumed that dollar / peso parity would continue.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 75- 88.\n\n236.\n\nOn the other hand, neither the Bidding Terms212 nor the Concession Contract stipulated that there could be no departure from dollar / peso parity.213 Rather, the position of the Concessionaire was protected by provisions that in effect tied the Concessionaire's revenues to US dollars and the US economy. Thus, Section 24 of the Contract stipulated that \"In consideration of all its obligations hereunder, Concessionaire shall receive only the toll rates set forth in the following Section, the Subsidy granted by the National Government, and the contributions of the Provinces of Santa Fe and Entre R\u00edos.\" Those toll rates were, according to Section 25.2 of the Contract, to be adjusted by \"the percentage change in the United States All Items Consumer Price Index (hereafter CPI) officially published by the United States Department of Commerce (Business Statistics Branch).\" In this way, the commercial balance of the Contract was secured, with the value of the tolls being tied, in effect, to the value of the US dollar.\n\nExh. CX-31.\n\nSection 3(i) of the Bidding Terms, and Section 2 of the Contract, set out the laws that govern the Agreement, and do not include the Convertibility Law, Law 23,928, which established parity between the dollar and the peso.\n\n237.\n\nFurther, Section 25.3 of the Contract provided that:\n\n\"The Toll Rate to be collected by Concessionaire from users shall be stated in Pesos and be calculated as follows:\n\na) The toll rate, stated in United States dollars, shall be translated into pesos on a monthly basis with the assistance of the Oversight Agency, using the dollar/peso parity based on the average bid/offered exchange rate quoted by Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina FIVE (5) days prior to the application date. If the peso/dollar parity based on the quote of Banco de la Naci\u00f3n varies upward or downward by more than ONE PERCENT (1%) of the parity used to calculate the Basic Toll Rate in effect, the latter shall be readjusted by the total percentage of such excess commencing on the first day of the following month.\"\n\n238.\n\nIn these circumstances, the majority of the Tribunal considers that what Respondent promised, and what Claimant had the right to expect, was the maintenance of the value, in dollar terms, of the revenues under the Contract. Precisely *how* that value was maintained was, in the view of the majority of the Tribunal, not specified. Claimant did not have a legal right specifically to have that value maintained by means of constant adherence to peso-dollar parity. If parity were abandoned but Claimant was compensated fully and timeously for the fall, in dollar terms, in the value of its revenues, Claimant's rights and expectations would have been fulfilled, and Claimant could not complain that it had been treated unfairly or inequitably in violation of the BIT.\n\n239.\n\nIn the view of the majority of the Tribunal, this analysis accords with the facts and the practical realities of the situation. While there was a clear expectation that the commercial balance of the Contract would be maintained by the continuation of peso-dollar parity, no specific promise or undertaking to maintain that parity was explicitly made by Respondent to Claimant. Neither the Bidding Terms nor the Concession Contract, nor any other instrument presented to the Tribunal, contains any specific and absolute undertaking not in any circumstances to pesify the Contract.\n\n240.\n\nThere can be no doubt of Claimant's intention to secure and to rely upon binding guarantees that the dollar-value of its revenues would be maintained. But equally, there is insufficient factual evidence upon which to base a finding that it would be unfair and inequitable to Claimant to fulfil that obligation to maintain of the dollar value of Claimant's revenues by some mechanism that involved a change in the peso-dollar exchange rate. Indeed, there are indications in Claimant's pleadings that it would have accepted some such change, although not a change involving pesification.214\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 224- 225.\n\n241.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal has therefore concluded that while the Claimant had the right to the maintenance of the commercial balance secured by the Contract on the supposition that peso-dollar parity would continue, it had no absolute right to have that commercial balance maintained specifically by the continuation of peso-dollar parity in all circumstances. If parity ceased to exist, Claimant had the right to expect that the resulting disruption of the commercial balance would be corrected fully and timeously, so that it would not be materially disadvantaged. Indeed, that expectation was reflected in the right to apply for renegotiation set out in Section 31.2 of the Contract. But Claimant did not have the right to expect that there would never, in any circumstances, be any departure from parity.215\n\nSection 25.3 of the Contract in fact provides for (minor) variations in the exchange rate: \"The toll rate, stated in United States dollars, shall be translated into pesos on a monthly basis with the assistance of the Oversight Agency, using the dollar/peso parity based on the average bid/offered exchange rate quoted by Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina FIVE (5) days prior to the application date. If the peso/dollar parity based on the quote of Banco de la Naci\u00f3n varies upward or downward by more than ONE PERCENT (1%) of the parity used to calculate the Basic Toll Rate in effect, the latter shall be readjusted by the total percentage of such excess commencing on the first day of the following month.\"\n\n242.\n\nThe majority has thus concluded that pesification of debts alone did not breach the treaty, and that if appropriate and timely steps had been taken by Respondent to restore Claimant to the position (in terms of the commercial balance of the Contract) that had been secured in the Contract, there would have been no breach of the duty to treat Claimant fairly and equitably.\n\n243.\n\nThe position might have been different if Respondent had made a deliberate choice to abandon peso-dollar parity in circumstances in which parity could have been maintained and Respondent had freedom of choice in determining its exchange-rate policy. But in the view of the Tribunal,216 that was not the case in Argentina during the period in question. The majority of the Tribunal accepts that although the abandonment of parity was obviously effected by a deliberate act of the Respondent - the enactment of the pesification law - and was in that narrow sense Respondent's 'choice', that act was an acceptance of what foreign exchange markets had already shown to be an economic fact: the unsustainability of parity.217 The IMF had endorsed the economic policies pursued by Argentina prior to the crisis;218 and the Emergency Law adopted in January 2002 by the Respondent was regarded by a range of expert commentators219 as a sound and coherent approach to the unavoidable facts of the extraordinary financial crisis then confronting Argentina.220\n\nAnd other tribunals: see, e.g., *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1), Decision on Liability, 27 December 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 160, 163 (Exh. AL RA180).\n\nThe Tribunal notes the chart at \u00b6 26 of Resp. C-Mem, which shows the peso-dollar exchange rate in the foreign exchange market of the Montevideo, Uruguay, Stock Exchange. That chart shows that the dollar-value of the peso was falling in Uruguay from the first week of December 2001 onwards, several weeks before the enactment of the Emergency Law in Argentina. Cf, Roubini Report, 7 March 2012, \u00b6 15: \"Effectively, the Argentine government did not 'choose' to abandon convertibility and repeal the currency board as there was no effective economic choice or means or option left to maintain such regime. Rather, the economic facts on the ground led to its effective demise and abandonment in December 2001 and its formal legal abandonment in January 2002.\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund, News Brief 99/24, 26 May 1999, cited in Andr\u00e9s Velasco, Ricardo Hausmann, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University - Hard Money's Soft Underbelly: Understanding the Argentine Crisis, 2002 (Exh. RA 500); Eichengreen Report, 3 September 2012, \u00b6 10; Roubini Report, 7 March 2012, \u00b6 23.\n\nSee Roubini Report, 7 March 2012, especially \u00b6\u00b6 31- 49, 53-55, and Eichengreen Report, 3 September 2012, especially \u00b6\u00b6 26- 40.\n\nTo avoid any possible doubt, it should be emphasized that although these factors are similar to those that would be taken into account in the context of a consideration of the defence of necessity, they are here wholly independent of the necessity defence. The factors do not bear upon the issue raised in the context of necessity: namely, whether in the circumstances the Respondent should be excused for what is on the face of it a breach of its international obligations. Here they bear on the question whether, in order to treat the Claimant with fairness and equity, it was absolutely essential that Respondent maintain parity at all costs. That is a question as to the precise scope of the obligation that was owed by Respondent to Claimant. Was it unfair or inequitable to Claimant for Argentina to depart from parity? In particular, was it unfair to do so in circumstances where Respondent undertook to rebalance the commercial contract in order to address the losses sustained by Claimant as a consequence of pesification?\n\n244.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal accordingly does not find that the adoption and pursuit of the policy of pesification was *per se* a breach of the FET standard. The policy was not in itself unfair, and it was not in itself inequitable, to the Claimant.\n\n245.\n\nIn view of that decision, it is not necessary to consider whether the position in respect of the abandonment of parity is affected by any other provision in the Treaty,221 or by the plea of necessity in customary international law.\n\nSuch as Article XI of the US-Argentina BIT, which provides that the provisions of the BIT do not \"preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order. or the protection of its own essential security interests\": http://unctad.org/sections/dite/iia/docs/bits/argentina\\_us.pdf. The effect of any such provision would have to be considered before the effect of the defence of necessity in customary international law is considered. There is, however, no such provision in the Germany-Argentina BIT.\n\n246.\n\nThat is, however, not an end of the matter. As has been indicated above, while the act of pesification was, in the view of the majority of the Tribunal, not *per se* a violation of the FET standard, it was the direct cause of financial losses to the Claimant. That leads to the question whether the manner in which the pesification process was implemented amounted to a breach of the FET standard.\n\n***Was the manner in which the pesification process was implemented a breach of the BIT?***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nIt has been noted above that the preservation of the US dollar value of Claimant's revenues was undoubtedly a premise upon which the investment was made, and both Parties entered into the Concession Contract; and it was a principle to which the provisions of the Concession Contract222 were intended to give effect.\n\nNotably Sections 6, 13, 24-33 and 31.2 of the Contract.\n\n248.\n\nRespondent recognized from the outset the enormously disruptive effect that pesification would have on public works contracts that had been concluded upon the basis of the premise of constant dollar-peso parity or payment in dollars. Respondent provided, in the Emergency Law itself, for the renegotiation of such contracts.223 The Tribunal considers that provision to be a wholly appropriate, and necessary, response to the inevitable results of pesification upon dollarized contracts. If those contracts were left unrevised, one party would suffer a radical deterioration in the commercial position that it had secured by means of the express terms of the contract.\n\nEmergency Law, Section 9 (Exh. RA 187).\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the terms of the commitment that Respondent had made to Claimant did not require Respondent to take action during the time of the crisis actually to restore the commercial balance secured by peso-dollar parity. But it did require Respondent to make provision for restoring the commercial balance after the crisis had ended (as, indeed, it did, in the Emergency Law itself); and restoration of the commercial balance required that Claimant be compensated for losses incurred during the crisis, as well as thereafter.\n\n250.\n\nAs is explained below, in the section dealing with the renegotiation process,224 the process provided for in the Emergency Law has not in fact led to the rebalancing of the commercial relationship between Claimant and Respondent in this case. Due to Argentina's failure to timeously adjust the contract in a manner satisfactory to PdL, Claimant was accordingly deprived of the protection that the dollarization of PdL's tariffs was designed to secure, and the value of its interest in PdL was thereby reduced, causing it financial loss.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 268-287, below.\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that the manner in which the process for agreeing on the contractual adjustment to offset the effects of pesification was implemented, and specifically Respondent's failure to implement the promised renegotiation process timeously, constitute a breach of the FET standard under the BIT, for which Respondent is liable to make reparation. More precisely, the pesification caused the Claimant to sustain losses; and the breach of the FET in the BIT consists in the failure to implement within a reasonable period of time a renegotiated agreement to replace the security that had been provided by the dollarization provisions in the original Concession Contract and thereby restore the commercial balance of the Concession Contract between Respondent and the members of the Consortium, including Claimant, and to remedy the losses already sustained.\n\nc) The 'Emergency Loan'\n-----------------------\n\n252.\n\nAt the time when the funding for the Project ran out, construction of the bridge span was not complete. Both parties agreed that it could not be left in its incomplete state because of the danger of collapse. At this point in time, funds were needed to complete the Project and without a completed Project, PdL was not yet in a position to collect the toll revenues on which the payment of its share of the financing as well as any profit could be realized.\n\n253.\n\nClaimant argued that if an adequate renegotiation had been agreed during the first half of 2002, work on the Project could have been completed on time, and that the failure to secure such a renegotiation obliged it to accept a loan from Respondent to enable it to complete the Project. The Tribunal notes, however, that there is evidence that PdL was in financial difficulties even before pesification occurred. In particular: (i) PdL was informing the Grantor in August 2001, four months *before* pesification, that it was going to have to suspend construction of the bridge at the end of the month225; (ii) PdL appeared to be unable to pay its creditors (Boskalis/Ballast Nedam)226; (iii) PdL told the IDB in October 2001 that it could be petitioned in bankruptcy by its creditors227; and (iv) PdL's smaller shareholders' were apparently unable or unwilling to make further capital contributions in September 2001.228\n\nExh.

It appears that at this time alternative loan funding was scarce in Argentina.\n\n258.\n\nIt was the responsibility of the Consortium and then of PdL to arrange financing for the Project beyond the Subsidy provided by Respondent.233 PdL was at liberty to obtain finance from other sources on better terms, if it could find them. Claimant says that in fact PdL had no alternative source of funding available from third party banks,234 and that it was the drastic reduction in toll revenues, resulting from the Pesification Law, Law 25,561, that undermined PdL's creditworthiness and was the cause of its inability to obtain finance elsewhere.235\n\nConcession Contract, Sections 8, 22, 30.3.b).\n\nCl.

Cf., Lommatzsch Stmt., \u00b6 134.\n\n259.\n\nClaimant asserts that in early July 2003, following a change in the Government of Argentina, it received notice that the terms of that emergency loan had been unilaterally altered by the Secretariat of Public Works through the adoption of Public Works Resolution 14 ('Resolution 14') on 30 June 2003.236 Claimant says that Resolution 14 had three material effects: (i) it changed the repayment terms from \"those prevailing in the local market for similar loans\"237 to a rate (which Claimant says was higher) charged for 30-day unsecured loans; (ii) it provided for the repayment of the loan through the daily collection of toll revenues; and (iii) it pesified the operation and maintenance costs which PdL was entitled to deduct from the toll revenues.238\n\nExh. CX-79.\n\nExh. CX-78, Section 2.

PHB \u00b6\u00b6 86 -90; Exh. CX-79.\n\n260.\n\nClaimant's case is that the terms stipulated in June 2003 by Resolution 14 left PdL in an unsustainable financial position. The daily revenues appropriated to repayment of the loan were inadequate to cover interest payments and PdL's operating expenses; and the interest owing was capitalized, so that the sum owed was constantly increasing.239 Claimant says that because of PdL's repayments under the loan from Respondent, PdL was unable to maintain the Project or pay daily expenses. In 2004 and 2005 those expenses were largely funded through inter-company loans made by Claimant and Impregilo. Claimant made loans totalling US $5,481,833 in 2004, and US $297,000 in 2005.240\n\nCf., the evidence of Mr Andr\u00e9s Aner, Transcript, Day 5, pp. 1018-1030.\n\nCl.

Rej., \u00b6 142.\n\n262.\n\nFrom a comparison of the wording of the Loan Agreement and Resolution 14, it appears to the Tribunal that Resolution 14 purported to give specificity to the vague terms in the 21 February 2003 Loan Agreement regarding interest rates. Resolution 14 identified the repayment terms that were to be treated as corresponding to the \"the terms prevailing in the local market for similar loans\", as it was put in Section 2 of the Loan Agreement. Those terms corresponded to the interest rates paid by top-tier companies on 30-day *unsecured* loans.\n\n263.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the specification under Resolution 14 of an interest rate appropriate for 30-day unsecured loans to the radically different case of a loan secured by the assignment of tolls from a public highway operating under a long-term concession, can reasonably be regarded as an implementation of a contractual provision stipulating the application of \"the terms prevailing in the local market for similar loans.\" The circumstances of the loans are not 'similar'. No clear justification was offered for application of the 30-day unsecured loan rate to the 2003 loan to PdL,244 although it was said that one constraint was the inability of Respondent to engage in a transaction that would, by charging too low an interest rate, in effect increase the Subsidy to the Project provided by the Government beyond that settled when the Consortium's bid was accepted.245\n\nSee the testimony of Mr. Aner, Transcript, Day 5, pp. 1026-1034.\n\nLommatzsch Stmt. \u00b6 110. Cf., Resp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 10-13, 56-58.\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the use of rates for unsecured loans as the comparator for the interest rate charged under the Loan Agreement was inappropriate, and that it is likely that, at least at some points, the interest rate charged was excessively high. The Tribunal notes, however, that the rate of interest charged was not uniformly high. It dropped from the high of 30% to 18.85% as from 26 September 2003,246 and stayed around that lower rate until the commencement of insolvency proceedings in May 2007. (During the period 2001-2005, all the inter-company loans made by Claimant and other PdL shareholders were set at the significantly lower rate of 15%.247) Furthermore, the evidential record does not provide sufficient data to enable the Tribunal to determine by how much (if at all) the actual rate of interest charged day-by-day under Resolution 14, compared with an appropriate Argentine market rate for secured long-term debts, exceeded the maximum interest rate that would have been fair and equitable.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 140. Resp. notes that Hochtief itself already talked of an annual 20% rate in a document it submitted to the German government on 5 March 2007 (Request for Compensation from Hochtief to the German government, 5 March 2007, p. 3 (Exh. RA 358)), and not the 30% rate contended by Claimant in its Reply of 5 June 2012. Cl. Rep., \u00b6 69: Resp. Rej., fn 200.\n\nLECG First Report, \u00b6 57; and Exh. 034, p. 85\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the use of an inappropriate comparator for the determination of interest rates under Resolution 14 was not compatible with Claimant's rights under Article 2 of the Treaty, but the majority of the Tribunal also considers that Claimant has not proved a quantifiable loss under this heading. The majority of the Tribunal accordingly decides not to make an award of damages specifically to compensate Claimant for losses arising from any excessive interest rates charged under the Emergency Loan.\n\n266.\n\nTurning to the treatment of PdL's expenses, the Tribunal does not consider that the pesification of operation and maintenance costs which PdL was entitled to deduct from its toll revenues was a step that had been agreed in (or was compatible with) the Loan Agreement of 21 February 2003. The text of the Loan Agreement does not evidence any such agreement. This was a further step taken in Resolution 14 on 30 June 2003, which adversely affected PdL, and hence adversely affected the value of Claimant's investment.\n\n267.\n\nIt is clear that the pesification of operation and maintenance expenses, much of which required the importation of expensive equipment involving expenditure in US dollars,248 reduced the value of the expenses that PdL was entitled to deduct before making its loan repayments and left it making a loss on the maintenance and operation of the Project. The Tribunal thus finds that the pesification of operation and maintenance expenses was a violation of Article 2 of the BIT, for which reparation is due.\n\nCl. PHB, fn. 160.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly considers that the specific terms imposed by Resolution 14 on 30 June 2003 cannot reasonably be said to have been previously agreed in the February Loan Agreement or to be consistent with it. When those terms are considered in the context of PdL's frozen tariffs, pesified and not adjusted for inflation, they are, in the view of the Tribunal, unfair and inequitable and a violation of Article 2 of the BIT.\n\nd) The renegotiation process\n----------------------------\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that the manner in which the pesification process was implemented, and in particular Respondent's failure to implement the promised renegotiation process timeously, constitute a breach of the FET standard under the BIT for which Respondent is liable to make reparation.249\n\n\u00b6 251, above.\n\n270.\n\nIt is more accurate to speak of the unacceptable delay in the implementation of the renegotiation process, because even now it remains possible that the process might be implemented in the future. Renegotiation of many public contracts inevitably takes time; and some will be renegotiated before others. The limit of what would be an acceptable delay in the context of an alleged breach of the FET standard is a matter of appreciation. Some delay would not have been incompatible with Fair and Equitable Treatment; but at a certain point, the to-be-expected time that it takes for a complex renegotiation to occur becomes unacceptably unfair and inequitable. Claimant pointed to the recent award in *EDF International SA & Ors* v. *Argentine Republic*,250 in which liability for breach of a BIT was founded upon delays in renegotiation; but each case turns on its facts251 and must be appraised separately.\n\n*EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23), Award, 11 June 2012; CLA 238.\n\nIn *EDF* the renegotiation was the responsibility of a provincial government within Argentina, rather than of the federal Government of the Republic.\n\n**(i) The unimplemented renegotiations**\n----------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nIt was in January 2002 that Law No. 25,561252 provided, in Article 9, for the renegotiation of public works contracts, a category that included the Concession Contract. Claimant's witness, Mr Lommatzsch, recalled in his first Witness Statement253, dated 29 April 2010, that he had been a director of PdL since 1998 and its President from March 2005 to August 2007.254 He referred to his personal involvement in numerous discussions and other meetings between PdL and the Argentine Government between 2003 and 2009. He testified that PdL had continually tried to engage Respondent in \"negotiations aimed at reaching agreement on a renegotiated contract that would compensate PdL for its losses and re-establish the toll rates so that the concession will earn PdL and its shareholders the expected return that Argentina's actions have prevented them from receiving.\"255\n\nExh.

Mr Lommatzsch said that it was not a perfect solution, and not sufficient fully to compensate PdL for all of the losses attributable to Law No. 25,561, but that PdL had nonetheless signed it and awaited the approval of the new terms by the Government.257\n\nLommatzsch Stmt., Exh. JJ.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 145 - 146.\n\n273.\n\nThe necessary Government approvals for the May 2006 CdE were not obtained and it was not implemented. A second CdE was sent to PdL by Respondent in February 2007 (the 'February 2007 C dE').258 According to Mr Lommatzsch, its terms were less favourable to PdL than the terms of the May 2006 CdE: nevertheless, in his words, \"desperate to finalize a renegotiation, and moderate the financial squeeze it had been put in due to Argentina's actions, PdL signed the February 2007 CdE on February 27, 2007.\"259 The February 2007 CdE also remained unimplemented.\n\n*Ibid.*, Exh.

The question is whether there is anything in the particular treatment of the PdL that breaches the FET standard. The Tribunal considers that there is.\n\nLommatzsch Stmt., \u00b6 158.\n\n**(ii) The excessive delay in the renegotiation**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe most salient of the particular factors that mark out this case are (i) a need for renegotiation both occasioned by, and recognized and provided for, by Respondent's own pesification legislation, (ii) Respondent's awareness of the precarious position of the Project and of PdL, evident at least from the time of the conclusion of the Loan Agreement on 21 February 2003; (iii) Respondent's awareness of the damages claim in this case, whose registration by ICSID was notified to the Parties on 17 December 2007; and, against this background, (iv) Respondent's repeated failure to implement the agreements on renegotiation that had been signed by PdL in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n\n281.\n\nThe renegotiation process was a necessary element - the key element - of the fulfilment of Respondent's obligation under the Treaty to treat PdL in a fair and equitable manner following the 2002 pesification and the complete disruption of the premises upon which the Concession Contract was based.272 The failure to proceed expeditiously to implement the renegotiated terms agreed with PdL, in a situation where the urgency of the rebalancing of the economic relationship after the Respondent's legislative intervention was clear, and in particular when the Claimant's Memorial in this case focused attention upon the compatibility or lack thereof of the continuing delays and abandonments of agreed terms with Respondent's obligations under the Treaty, all combine to persuade the Tribunal that Respondent's failure to secure the implementation of the renegotiated terms was unfair to PdL.\n\nThe preamble to Decree 214/02 refers to the \"strong interference with the legal relationships, both of public law and of private law\" that resulted from the crisis (Exh. CX-68).\n\n282.\n\nRespondent's conduct amounts to more than the disappointment of the hopes and expectations of the Project Consortium. It crosses the line between what is merely suboptimal administration and bureaucratic delay, and it becomes a failure to remedy the adverse consequences of governmental measures that is so prolonged and so complete as to infringe the investor's rights under the Treaty.\n\n283.\n\nIt is not easy to identify a precise date by which renegotiation should have been completed, but there are three indications that the renegotiation was not completed within what was a reasonable time in the context of the Argentine laws.\n\n284.\n\nFirst, renegotiation was mandated by the Emergency Law, Law No. 25,561273 in January 2002. Title IV (and in particular Article 9) of the Emergency Law provided for the renegotiation of public works contracts, and Article 8 of Decree 214/02 provided for adjustments of contracts to be made annually (and in some circumstances, more frequently) so as to \"preserve the continuity of the contractual relationship in a way equitable for the parties.\"274\n\nExh. CX-63.\n\nExh. CX-68.\n\n285.\n\nSecondly, during the PdL insolvency proceedings, in June 2008, the Argentine Court took the view that UNIREN's refusal to continue the renegotiation of the concession agreement was contrary to the aims of Argentine law, and that more than six years after the enactment of Emergency Law 25,561 \"the grave imbalance in the terms of the [Concession] agreement persists\".275\n\nExh. CX-106.\n\n286.\n\nThird, the Tribunal notes that it was practicable for the Parties to conclude a negotiated settlement by 2006 or 2007 at the latest. PdL was prepared in 2006 to accept - and, indeed, did accept - a negotiated settlement, and the Claimant was also willing to accept that settlement as a shareholder in PdL. But the 2006 CdE was repudiated by the presentation of the 2007 CdE to PdL by Respondent on 12 February 2007.276\n\nCl. Rep. \u00b6 85; CdE (February 2007) (Exh. CX- 100).\n\n287.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Respondent's failure to conclude an agreement on renegotiation was a violation of the FET standard in the BIT. While the Tribunal is satisfied that the violation had occurred by 26 February 2007, when Claimant sent to Respondent its notice regarding the existence of a dispute under the BIT,277 that is not the date that will be relevant to the calculation of the reparation due in respect of injury caused by the breach. The breach consists in the failure to redress the commercial balance that had been disrupted by the pesification Law, Law 25,561 on 6 January 2002; and the injury for which reparation is due includes losses suffered on and after 6 January 2002.\n\nExh. CX-101.\n\ne) Conclusion on FET\n--------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Tribunal has thus concluded that there were violations of the FET standard in Article 2 of the BIT, in respect of which reparation is due, constituted by:\n\n(1) the failure to restore and redress the commercial balance that had been secured by the Concession Contract, after that balance had been disrupted by the pesification Law, Law 25,561, on 6 January 2002; and\n\n(2) the pesification of operation and maintenance expenses in Resolution 14 of 30 June 2003.\n\n(B) FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY: Articles 2(1) and 4(1)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n(C) EXPROPRIATION: Article 4(2)\n-------------------------------\n\n(D) THE 'OBSERVANCE OF OBLIGATIONS' OR 'UMBRELLA CLAUSE': Article 7(2)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(E) ARBITRARY OR DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES: Article 2(3)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n(F) BREACH OF BINDING UNILATERAL DECLARATIONS\n---------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nHaving considered and decided upon Respondent's liability for breach of the FET standard in Article 2 of the BIT, the Tribunal now turns to the other BIT standards upon which Claimant relied.\n\n290.\n\nNot all BIT standards are the same; nor is the FET standard, despite its undoubted breadth, capable of subsuming every other BIT standard. As a matter of fact, however, it may be evident that where the same facts are said to constitute breaches of more than one BIT standard, and where the alleged losses are the same in each case, equally detailed analysis of the application of each of the treaty standards to the facts of the case is redundant.\n\n291.\n\nSo it is here; and especially because the terms of the protections accorded under Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the BIT appear to overlap. The claims concerning Full Protection and Security [BIT Articles 2(1) and 4(1)],278 the claims concerning expropriation [BIT Article 4(2)],279 the claims concerning arbitrary or discriminatory measures,280 and the claims concerning the 'observance of obligations' or 'umbrella clause',281 are all based on essentially the same facts and same arguments as the claims based upon the FET standard. It is not argued that these other standards entail a different approach to causation or to determination of quantum, or to liability for a different range of losses;282 and the Tribunal considers that these additional grounds for the claims are adequately addressed by its decisions in respect of the FET standard. The same is true of claims based upon general international law obligations and the breach of binding unilateral commitments made by Respondent.283\n\nSee Cl.

Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 528- 536.\n\n(G) THE DURATION OF THE EMERGENCY AND THE OPERATIVE DATE OF THE BREACHES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that (1) Respondent's failure to implement timeously the renegotiation process (i.e., by 2006 or 2007, but taking account of prior losses: see paragraph 286 above) and (2) the adoption of Resolution 14 in June 2003, violated the BIT. The next question is whether either breach might be excused or rendered unlawful by the defence of necessity. That would be possible only if the emergency persisted at the relevant time.\n\n293.\n\nFixing a date for the 'end' of an economic crisis is a highly subjective exercise, overwhelmingly influenced by the precise factors or indicia upon which one focuses and the degree of change or stability that one regards as qualifying as a return to a normal, non-crisis situation.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal found persuasive the expert evidence suggesting that 2003 saw a resumption of growth in the economy284 and that the worst of the crisis in macroeconomic terms was over by mid-2003 (although the Tribunal accepts that the social and other effects on Argentine society identified by Dr Kliksberg persisted well after that time).285 Other tribunals have found significant dates in this period, such as the date of the election of President Kirchner on 26 April 2003.286 The selection of such a date does not signify the possibility of making a precise objective determination of a date on which the economic crisis ended: rather, it signifies the exercise by a tribunal of its power to decide a case on the evidence before it, and the need to stipulate a particular date in order to give effect to the tribunal's reasoned judgment. No more and no less can be expected than a serious attempt by a tribunal to identify a suitable date on the basis of the evidence provided by the Parties.\n\nEichengreen Report, \u00b6 26.\n\nEdwards Report, \u00b6 208.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 229-230.\n\n295.\n\nThe evidence presented by the respective experts, for both Parties,287 in this case indicates that the crisis was over by the mid-2003, the time during which President Kirchner was elected. Bearing in mind the practicalities of financial accounting and calculation, this Tribunal accordingly fixes May 1, 2003 as the date at which the crisis ended.\n\nEdwards Report, \u00b6 208, and Tr., Day 6, p. 1140. Eichengreen Report, \u00b6 26, and Tr. pp. 2122-2123.\n\n296.\n\nThe road and the bridges were opened to toll-paying traffic on 23 May 2003.288 The Tribunal has found no compelling evidence that the delay in the opening of the Project was caused by conduct that is attributable to Respondent and is in breach of the BIT. PdL's income stream accordingly began to flow on 23 May 2003; and it was that income stream whose dollar value is protected by the FET provision in Article 2 of the BIT. But that flow begins after the end of the crisis, as determined by the Tribunal.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 4.\n\n297.\n\nTo be precise, the actions of Respondent, in breach of its obligations under the BIT, that produced the reduction in value of PdL's income stream were the failure to correct the imbalance caused by the pesification introduced by the Emergency Law, Law No. 25,561 in January 2002, and the imposition of the terms of the Emergency Loan by Resolution 14 on 30 June 2003.\n\n298.\n\nThe effects of the non-correction of the Emergency Law upon which the Tribunal bases its calculation of reparation due to PdL are in principle all losses sustained after and as a result of the enactment of the Emergency Law on 6 January 2002. In practice, the majority of the Tribunal has found no quantifiable losses of this kind that arose prior to 23 May 2003. It was after the opening of the road and bridges to toll-paying traffic on that date, that the impact of the pesification and the Emergency Loan upon PdL's income stream from tolls began to be felt. The Tribunal accordingly decides by a majority that while the renegotiation and 'rebalancing' should have occurred by 2006 or 2007,289 the duty to restore the balance extended back to cover all 'unbalancing' losses resulting from the 2002 Emergency Law, and thus covered the losses arising after 23 May 2003.\n\nSee above, \u00b6\u00b6 286-287.\n\n299.\n\nWhile it is theoretically possible that some type of damage arose prior to 23 May 2003 -for example, the value of the difference between the terms of the Emergency Loan granted by Argentina to PdL and whatever loan or other financing might have been available to PdL had it been able to show the lender that the Contract had been satisfactorily readjusted to offset the effects of pesification - the majority of the Tribunal finds that no such losses have been proven.\n\n300.\n\nThe adoption of Resolution 14 occurred after 23 May 2003. Its impact similarly postdates both the end of the economic crisis and the opening of the road and bridges to toll-paying traffic.\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly rejects the submission that either breach can be excused or exculpated by reason of the economic crisis and the doctrine of 'necessity' under customary international law. That rejection inevitably follows from the chronology of the facts in this case. The economic crisis had ended by the time that the losses for which reparation is due were sustained.\n\n(H) CLAIMANT'S SHARE OF THE REPARATION\n--------------------------------------\n\n302.\n\nThe analysis has proceeded thus far by focusing on the reparation due in respect of the breach of the FET standard in the BIT, but without addressing the question of Claimant's entitlement to a part of that reparation.\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal has found, in summary, that Claimant is entitled as an investor within the meaning of the BIT to sue in respect of breaches of the BIT committed by Respondent in its dealings with PdL, in which Claimant had an investment at the material times. Further, the Tribunal has determined that the adoption of Resolution 14 on 30 June 2003 and Respondent's failure to implement the renegotiated agreements timeously violated the BIT.\n\n304.\n\nIt does not follow that just because Claimant is entitled to sue in its own name, without bringing PdL into the proceedings, it is also entitled to take away all or part of the reparation without bringing PdL into the picture. As a shareholder in PdL, Claimant has obligations as well as rights; and one of those obligations is to accept that the assets of PdL would be properly applied to satisfy the legitimate demands of all PdL's creditors and all PdL's shareholders, according to the priorities laid down by law.\n\n305.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, it cannot be assumed that Claimant has an unencumbered right to a share of the reparation due to PdL that corresponds to the share of the stock in PdL held by Claimant. Other shareholders and creditors of PdL may have claims on sums paid by way of reparation. The question is, whether this is a matter for the Tribunal in this case, or whether any such claims are a matter between Claimant and persons not party to these proceedings.\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that it is beyond both its responsibilities and its powers to make dispositive orders in this respect. Neither PdL nor any other persons are parties to this arbitration or subject to its jurisdiction. The Tribunal accordingly proceeds on the basis of the approach adopted by other tribunals, and makes an award for reparation of which Claimant will be entitled to a share corresponding to the proportion of its shareholding. But it does so with the provison that Claimant must disclose this award to the board of PdL, drawing the board's attention specifically to this Section (H).\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal has accordingly decided that Claimant is entitled to 26% of the damages caused to PdL by Respondent, as the share corresponding to its share in the equity of PdL.\n\n308.\n\nClaimant asks for full reparation for all of its losses caused by Respondent.290 It submits that there should be no deduction made in respect of the payment that it received under the political risk insurance that it had arranged with the German Government.291\n\nCl. Rep., Section XIV, 'Damages'.\n\nCl. Rep., \u00b6 435 ff.\n\n309.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that the insurance payment, which is understood to amount to EUR 11,359 (US$ 17.7 million292) should not be deducted from the amount due to Claimant. The insurance payment is a benefit which Claimant arranged on its own behalf, and for which it paid. It does not reduce the losses caused by Respondent's actions in breach of the BIT: it is an arrangement that had been made by Claimant with a third party in order to provide a hedge against potential losses. The Tribunal does not consider that any principle of international law requires that such an arrangement, to which Respondent was not a party, should reduce Respondent's liability.293 It may be that under such insurance policies the protected investors are obliged to hand over to the insurer all or part of any sums recovered as damages: but that is a matter of private contract, into which the Tribunal has no cause to inquire.\n\nSee the Sandleris and Schargrodsky Valuation Report, \u00b6 173.\n\nCf., *Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v. Georgia* (ICSID Cases Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15), Award, 3 March 2010, \u00b6 691 (a decision on third party funding and liability for costs.)\n\n310.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that amounts received by Claimant in its capacity as a contractor on the Project do not affect its entitlement to compensation for injury to its investment in the Project.294\n\nAbove, \u00b6 181.\n\n(I) THE APPROACH TO THE DETERMINATION OF QUANTUM\n------------------------------------------------\n\n***The general approach: the reduction in value of Claimant's shareholder interest in PdL***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered carefully the arguments in the reports of the Parties' respective experts, and their respective approaches to the determination of quantum. In their 2010 report Claimant's experts Messrs Abdala and Spiller of LECG (later Compass/Lexecon) estimated damages as of 31 December 2009, at US$ 74.6 million, using the Discounted Cash Flow ('DCF') approach, and at US$ 109.0 million using the Net Capital Contribution ('NCC') approach. Those figures were revised in their 2012 report to US$ 109.4 million and US$ 157.2 million respectively, as of 31 May 2012. Respondent's experts Messrs Sandleris and Schargrodsky estimated damages as of late December 2010 at sums within a range from negative US$ 3.83 (i.e., damages owed *to* the Respondent)295 to a positive US$ 1.07 million.\n\nSee the explanation in Resp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 77-80.\n\n312.\n\nThe wide gap between the experts' estimates is largely attributable to the different assumptions concerning key issues on which they based their work. For example, Claimant's experts valued damages as at later dates (2010, 2012), and on the basis that sums recovered under the political risk insurance that Claimant had taken out should be disregarded, that but for Respondent's measures tariffs and expenses would have been dollarized and revised, so that Respondent is responsible for losses resulting from pesification, and that Respondent was responsible for the non-payment of the IDB loan and for delays in completing the Project and that Respondent is liable to repay the loans advanced to PdL by Hochtief. Claimant's experts also assume that but for Respondent's actions PdL would have been profitable, and that Claimant would have received dividends and have seen the value of its equity share in PdL increase, and would have had its loans to PdL repaid.\n\n313.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent's experts assumed that the date for valuation should have been early 2002, when the pesification measures were enacted; that Claimant's receipts under the political risk insurance should be deducted; that there was no possibility of maintaining dollarized tariffs after 2002, even in a 'but for' scenario; and that Respondent was not responsible for the non-payment of the IDB loan (and Claimant was therefore in breach of its contractual obligation to obtain FIFA) or for delays in completing the Project. Respondent's experts assume that PdL would not have been profitable and that no dividends could have been paid to the shareholders.\n\n314.\n\nThere is little common ground between the experts; and the Tribunal finds that the approach of neither set of experts is entirely satisfactory. Indeed, where there were great differences between the scenarios contemplated by the experts, comparison of their reports was an exercise of regrettably limited utility. The Tribunal does, however, have a clear view on the losses for which compensation is due.\n\n315.\n\nIn broad terms, the measure of the damage is the amount by which the value of Claimant's 26% shareholding in PdL was reduced by Respondent's conduct in violation of the BIT. It is to be assumed that this amount is equivalent to 26% of the reduction in value of PdL caused by Respondent's breaches of the BIT.\n\n316.\n\nThe main element in the reduction in the value of PdL is the difference between the sums that PdL actually received from tolls and the sums that it should have received if pesification had not occurred and if the toll rates had been revised annually in line with the US Consumer Price Index, as the Concession Contract provided.\n\n317.\n\nClaimant's experts have taken a relatively conservative approach to the determination of toll receipts. They have, of course, the actual figures for receipts up until recent months; and in calculating the toll revenues as they would have been 'but for' the pesification and toll freeze they have assumed that the higher 'dollarized' tolls would have reduced demand, and therefore toll income, because of the elasticity of demand.296 Respondent's experts challenge, *inter alia*, the elasticity values, and the validity of any assumption that PdL could (even in the absence of Respondent's actions) have maintained dollarized tariff rates after 2002.\n\nLECG First Report, \u00b6\u00b6 138-151.\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the approach of Claimant's experts to the estimation of the estimation of toll receipts in the 'but for' scenario to be persuasive. In their Second (2012) Report,297 Claimant's experts revised their estimate of toll receipts in the 'but-for' scenario, in the light of the analysis of elasticities in the study 'Rosario to Victoria Bridge Traffic and Revenues' (1 June 2012), by Mr Philip Bates of Buro Happold. Mr Bates proposed an 'envelope' of elasticity values. The initial values used by Messrs Abdala and Spiller lay comfortably within the envelope; but the Tribunal considers that it is appropriate, given the burden that lies upon Claimant to prove its case, to prefer the experts' calculations based on Mr Bates' lower bound figures.298\n\nCompass Lexecon, Second Report, 5 June 2012, Section III.1.6.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 109.\n\n319.\n\nThe other element driving the reduction in value of PdL is the pesification of operation and maintenance expenses imposed by Resolution 14.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal has given careful consideration to the question of the claims for consequential costs. Claimant claimed for losses flowing from its inability to obtain the IDB loan, and the delay in beginning operations.299 These include the extra costs incurred as a result of the failure of the IDB loan to materialize, and the allegedly excessive costs of the 2003 Emergency Loan.\n\nSee e.g., the LECG Report, \u00b6 2.\n\n321.\n\nThe factual evidence is, in the view of the Tribunal, not adequate to support the conclusion that Respondent is responsible for the non-materialization of the IDB loan. Nor is the evidence of the market rate for loans to companies in the position of PdL in Argentina in 2003 sufficiently clear to warrant the making of an order for compensation specifically related to the alleged increases in PdL's costs of borrowing.\n\n322.\n\nThe pesification of operation and maintenance costs in Resolution 14, in contrast, is a clear departure from the basic principles on which the Concession Contract was concluded, and notional reparation for those losses is to be counted in the 'but for' scenario, from which Claimant's entitlement to reparation will be calculated.\n\n323.\n\nClaimant also asserts that it suffered damage to its investment as a result of the fall of PdL towards bankruptcy. The evidence on this point is not clear. Prior to the onset of the financial crisis, the Consortium's members' own invoices as contractors were paid,300 evidently enabling them to recoup their own capital contributions; but PdL's principal subcontractor, the Boskalis-Ballast Nedam joint venture, was not paid, setting in motion the events that led to the ICC award against PdL rendered on 28 November 2003 and the insolvency proceedings initiated against PdL in April 2007, first by Boskalis-Ballast Nedam on the ground of non-payment of the ICC award and then by PdL's own board. But evidence is lacking to prove that PdL did not receive sufficient monies from Respondent to have been able to pay the invoices received from Boskalis-Ballast Nedam if PdL had chosen to give priority to the payment of those invoices.\n\nIn a letter dated 4 December 2002 from the Boskalis International BV-Ballast Nedam Baggeren BV joint venture to the Argentinean Ministry of Economy, it was alleged that PdL gave priority to paying its own shareholder/contractors before paying its principal subcontractor, the joint venture. (Exh. RA 460)\n\n324.\n\nGiven the Project's difficult financial straits in the deteriorating financial conditions of Argentina in the months leading up to the Emergency Law's enactment, the Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion that the bankruptcy proceedings against PdL were caused by the pesification process or any other breach of the BIT for which Respondent was responsible; and it declines to order the payment of any reparation in respect of PdL's fall towards bankruptcy. Indeed, the Tribunal's assumption must be that if it requires a revenue stream to be calculated in dollars, in order to avoid any unjust enrichment, it must equally assume that all of PdL's liabilities are similarly to be calculated in dollars. On this basis, and having regard to the normal priority of creditors over shareholders, PdL must be assumed to have been placed in a position to fully repay all of its debts, including to Boskalis-Ballast Nedam, to Argentina (for the Emergency Loan), and to those shareholders such as Hochtief who advanced loans to the company. It follows that the valuation exercise must assume no insolvency and the full repayment of sums owing to creditors without any discount.\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal has accordingly decided that for the purpose of calculating the reparation due to Claimant in this case, the reduction in value is to be Claimant's 26% share of the difference in US dollars between the actual value of PdL at the date of this Decision, and the value that PdL would have had if all other factors had remained as they stand in the 'actual scenario' except that:\n\na) Peso-dollar parity had been maintained; and\n\nb) The tolls had been revised in accordance with the US Consumer Price Index, as provided in Article 25 of the Concession Contract;\n\nc) The numbers of each kind of toll payments had been the actual numbers reduced to take into account the impact of the elasticity of demand as estimated in the lower bounds of Mr Bates' report, as indicated by Claimant's experts in paragraph 109 of their Second Report (2012) ; and\n\nd) The actual operation and maintenance costs and all other financial liabilities incurred by PdL, including all of its debts, had not been pesified or reduced in the insolvency proceedings.\n\n***Temporal limitations on recovery***\n--------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nAs far as the temporal limitations on damages are concerned, as noted above, since the Respondent has not effected a proper readjustment of the Concession Contract, the actual losses in the present case begin when the income stream began to be affected, on 23 May 2003, because no earlier loses have been proven. Respondent's liability arises from its failure after the end of the economic crisis to restore PdL to the economic position upon which the Parties had agreed at the beginning of the Project, and to maintain PdL in that position. That is a continuing failure, and the losses resulting from it continue to accrue. The Tribunal accordingly decides by a majority that damages are to be assessed as at the date of this Decision.\n\n327.\n\nThe calculation is therefore to be effected by reference to the reduced value of PdL as it stands at the date of the Decision. The Tribunal would reject the claims for the recovery of anticipated losses that may arise after the date of the Award, because the Tribunal has no reason to suppose that Respondent will ignore the implications of this Decision for its continuing obligations towards PdL and Claimant.301 The approach adopted here does not violate that principle. It is the *present* value of PdL that has been reduced, albeit by taking into account present expectations as to the future treatment of the Project. It is that loss in the present value of PdL that is the basis of the compensation in this Decision.\n\nSee in this respect, *Mobil Investments Canada and Murphy Oil Corporation v. Canada* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/4), Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 473 *et seq* : cf., *Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica* v. *Nicaragua)*, *Judgment,* 13 July 2009, I.C.J Reports 2009, p. 267, \u00b6 150.\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly decides that damages are to be assessed as at the date of this Decision. As noted above, the damages begin when the income stream begins to be affected, on 23 May 2003.\n\n(J) COSTS\n---------\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the submissions of the Parties on the question of costs, and the manner in which the litigation has been pursued.\n\n330.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal has not ordered the payment of reparation under every one of the heads of claim presented by the Claimant, the core of the claim has been upheld and the Tribunal has held that Claimant is entitled to reparation for the losses caused by Respondent's violation of Claimant's rights under the BIT. Those losses include Claimant's reasonable costs in pursuing this claim, payable as at the date of this Decision.\n\n331.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the costs, including legal costs and the costs of expert witnesses, are high, but not excessively high given the length and complexity of these proceedings. It starts from the principle that the successful Party should recover its costs, but considers that a substantial part of the Claimant's case was not accepted and that in the circumstances it would not be fair to impose the entire costs upon the Respondent. Accordingly, it reduces the costs claimed (US **$9,233,758**) by 25% and decides that the Respondent should reimburse the Claimant in the sum of US **$6,925,318.50.**\n\n(K) INTEREST\n------------\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that compound interest is payable on sums due to Claimant from the date on which the payment should have been made to Claimant (e.g., each day on which there was a difference between the actual rate toll revenues and the non-pesified, revised toll revenues).\n\n333.\n\nCompound interest is payable on any and all sums due under this Decision from the date of the Decision until the date when the payment of such sums is made.\n\n334.\n\nInterest is payable at the rates of short-term US Treasury Bills at the relevant times, compounded quarterly.\n\n(L) THE SUM TO BE PAID\n----------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal has not been able, on the basis of the information submitted by the Parties, to calculate the actual sum that results from the application of the principles set out above. This Decision orders the payment of that sum; and if the Parties are unable to agree within three months on the actual sum in US dollars payable as a result of this Decision, the Tribunal will invite each Party to submit, simultaneously and within a further two months, a brief setting out that Party's calculation of each element of the sum due in accordance with paragraph 325, and an explanation of the points on which there is disagreement. The Tribunal will then fix the actual sum payable.\n\n**VI. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL ON LIABILITY**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal DECIDES as follows:\n\na. Having already determined (by a majority) that it has jurisdiction over the claims in this case, the Tribunal concludes, by a majority, that claims made by Claimant in its capacity as a lender to PdL are inadmissible. All the other objections by Respondent to the admissibility of Claimant's claims, are rejected;\n\nb. As explained in paragraphs 209-288, Respondent breached its obligations under Article 2 of the BIT to grant to Claimant fair and equitable treatment, by (1) the failure to restore and redress the commercial balance that had been secured by the Concession Contract, after that balance had been disrupted by the pesification Law, Law 25,561, on 6 January 2002; and (2) the pesification of operation and maintenance expenses in Resolution 14 of 30 June 2003, and reparation is due in respect of those breaches;\n\nc. The Tribunal finds that it does not need to resolve Claimant's claims concerning Full Protection and Security [BIT Articles 2(1) and 4(1)], expropriation [BIT Article 4(2)], arbitrary and discriminatory measures, and 'observance of obligations' or 'umbrella clause', because they are all based on essentially the same arguments as the claims based upon the FET standard. As noted under paragraph 291, it has not been argued that these other standards entail a different approach to causation or to determination of quantum, or to liability, and the Tribunal considers that these additional grounds for the claims are adequately addressed by its decisions in respect to the FET standard;\n\nd. As is explained in paragraphs 292-301, Respondent's submission that the breaches in the present case can be excused or exculpated by reason of the economic crisis and 'necessity' under customary international law, is rejected;\n\ne. Claimant is entitled to 26% of the damages caused to PdL by Respondent, corresponding to its share in the equity of PdL, and the Tribunal decides, by a majority, that such damages are to be assessed as at the date of this Decision;\n\nf. The political risk insurance payment that Claimant had arranged with the German Government should not be deducted from the amount due to Claimant, as explained in paragraph 309;\n\ng. Since the Tribunal has not been able, on the basis of the information provided by the Parties, to calculate the actual compensation to be paid, the Parties are to calculate and submit, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 325, the information required under paragraph 335, in the manner and within the time limits indicated therein;\n\nh. As decided in paragraphs 332-334, interest on all sums due to Claimant from the date on which the payment should have been made to Claimant, and on any and all sums due under this Decision from the date of the Decision until the date when the payment of such sums is made is payable at the rates of short-term US Treasury Bills at the relevant times, compounded quarterly.\n\ni. As to costs, and as explained in paragraphs 329-331, Respondent should reimburse the Claimant in the sum of US$6,925,318.50.\n\nDone in English and in Spanish, both versions being equally authentic."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2016-12-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Frequently Used Abbreviations and Acronyms** | |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| BIT or the Treaty | Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Argentine Republic on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 9 April 1991, that came into force on 8 November 1993. |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n\n**I.

BRIEF PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 29 December 2014, in its Decision on Liability1, the Tribunal decided that the Respondent had breached its obligation under Article 2 of the Germany-Argentine Republic Treaty to grant Claimant fair and equitable treatment, by reason of:\n\n(i) its failure to restore and redress the commercial balance that had been secured by the Concession Contract, after that balance had been disrupted by the pesification law on 6 January 2002; and\n\n(ii) its pesification of operation and maintenance expenses in Resolution 14 of 30 June 2003.\n\nThe 29 December 2014 Decision on Liability [hereafter the \"Decision on Liability\"], the 24 October 2011 Decision on Jurisdiction and the Separate and Dissenting Opinion of Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C., also dated 24 October 2011, in this case are integral parts of this Award. They are annexed to this Award for convenience.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that reparation was due in respect of those breaches.2\n\nDecision, para. 336.\n\n8.\n\nIn respect of the quantum of damages, the Tribunal decided unanimously that Claimant was entitled to 26% of the damages caused to the Puentes del Litoral S.A. (\"PdL\") by the Respondent, corresponding to its share in the equity of PdL.3 It also decided, by a majority, that such damages were to be assessed as at the date of the Decision on Liability.4 The Tribunal also decided unanimously that interest on sums due to Claimant would be payable at the rates of short-term US Treasury Bills at the relevant times, compounded quarterly.5 It did not, however, specify precisely what term would be employed.\n\nDecision, para. 307.\n\nDecision, para. 336(e).\n\nDecision, para. 334.\n\n9.\n\nIn terms of calculating the reparation due to Claimant (from 23 May 2003 to 29 December 2014), the Tribunal decided, in paragraphs 315 and 316 of the Decision on Liability, as follows:\n\n\"315. In broad terms, the measure of the damage is the amount by which the value of Claimant\u2019s 26% shareholding in PdL was reduced by Respondent\u2019s conduct in violation of the BIT. It is to be assumed that this amount is equivalent to 26% of the reduction in value of PdL caused by Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT.\n\n316. The main element in the reduction in the value of PdL is the difference between the sums that PdL actually received from tolls and the sums that it should have received if pesification had not occurred and if the toll rates liad been revised annually in line with the US Consumer Price Index, as the Concession Contract provided.\"\n\n10.\n\nParagraphs 325 - 328 of the Decision on Liability read as follows (footnote omitted):\n\n325. The Tribunal lias accordingly decided that for the purpose of calculating the reparation due to Claimant in this case, the reduction in value is to be Claimant\u2019s 26% share of the difference in US dollars between the actual value of PdL at the date of this Decision, and the value that PdL would have had if all other factors had remained as they stand in the \u2018actual scenario\u2019 except that:\n\na) Peso-dollar parity had been maintained; and\n\nb) The tolls liad been revised in accordance with the US Consumer Price Index, as provided in Article 25 of the Concession Contract;\n\nc) The numbers of each kind of toll payments had been the actual numbers reduced to take into account the impact of the elasticity of demand as estimated in the lower bounds of Mr Bates\u2019 report, as indicated by Claimant\u2019s experts in paragraph 109 of their Second Report (2012) ; and\n\nd) The actual operation and maintenance costs and all other financial liabilities incurred by PdL, including all of its debts, liad not been pesified or reduced in the insolvency proceedings.\n\n*Temporal limitations on recovery*\n\n326. As far as the temporal limitations on damages are concerned, as noted above, since the Respondent lias not effected a proper readjustment of the Concession Contract, the actual losses in the present case begin when the income stream began to be affected, on 23 May 2003, because no earlier loses [sic] have been proven. Respondent\u2019s liability arises from its failure after the end of the economic crisis to restore PdL to the economic position upon which the Parties liad agreed at the beginning of the Project, and to maintain PdL in that position. That is a continuing failure, and the losses resulting from it continue to accrue. The Tribunal accordingly decides by a majority that damages are to be assessed as at the date of this Decision.\n\n327. The calculation is therefore to be effected by reference to the reduced value of PdL as it stands at the date of the Decision. The Tribunal would reject the claims for the recovery of anticipated losses that may arise after the date of the Award, because the Tribunal lias no reason to suppose that Respondent will ignore the implications of this Decision for its continuing obligations towards PdL and Claimant. The approach adopted here does not violate that principle, ft is the *present* value of PdL that lias been reduced, albeit by taking into account present expectations as to the future treatment of the Project, ft is that loss in the present value of PdL that is the basis of the compensation in this Decision.\n\n328. The Tribunal accordingly decides that damages are to be assessed as at the date of this Decision. As noted above, the damages begin when the income stream begins to be affected, on 23 May 2003.\n\n11.\n\nParagraph 335 of the Decision on Liability provided that:\n\n335. The Tribunal lias not been able, on the basis of the information submitted by the Parties, to calculate the actual sum that results from the application of the principles set out above. This Decision orders the payment of that sum; and if the Parties are unable to agree within three months on the actual sum in US dollars payable as a result of this Decision, the Tribunal will invite each Party to submit, simultaneously and within a further two months, a brief setting out that Party\u2019s calculation of each element of the sum due in accordance with paragraph 325, and an explanation of the points on which there is disagreement. The Tribunal will then fix the actual sum payable.\n\n12.\n\nThe Parties were unable to agree within the time prescribed on the actual sum payable as a result of the Decision on Liability, and the Tribunal accordingly set about determining that amount.\n\n13.\n\nBy 19 June 2015, in response to a request from the Tribunal, each Party filed its Submission on Damages.6 On 10 August 2015, in accordance with the timetable set by the Tribunal, each party filed a responsive (Supplemental or Second) Submission on Damages.7\n\nHochtief AG\u2019s Submission on Damages dated 19 June 2015 [\"Claimant\u2019s Submission (19 June 2015)\"]; Submission on Damages pursuant to the Decision on Liability dated 18 June 2015 [\"Respondent\u2019s Submission (18 June 2015)\"].\n\nHochtief AG\u2019s Supplemental Submission on Damages dated 10 August 2015 [\"Claimant\u2019s Submission (10 August 2015)\"; Second Submission on Damages Pursuant to the Decision on Liability dated 10 August 2015 [\"Respondent\u2019s Second Submission (10 August 2015)\"]\n\n14.\n\nAs is explained below at paragraph 75, the Tribunal identified what it regarded as a gap in the information available to it, relating to the indebtedness of PdL. On 1 October 2015, the Tribunal sought from Claimant additional information in the form of spreadsheets. That information was provided on 15 October 2015, and in response to an invitation from the Tribunal, Respondent submitted its comments on the additional information on 30 November 2015.\n\n15.\n\nOn 19 February 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to say that it considered that it had sufficient evidence and submissions on all points except one. That one point was the legal significance and effect upon the calculation of quantum of the termination of the Concession Contract on 26 August 2014, which had not been brought to the attention of the Tribunal until 2015, after the Decision on Liability dated 29 December 2014 had been issued. The Tribunal regarded that late-discovered development as relevant to the assumption set out in paragraph 327 of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability, which has been set out above.8 After a telephone conference with the Parties held on 11 March 2016, the Tribunal clarified its questions and directions to the Parties in a letter dated 21 March 2016.\n\nPara. 10, above.\n\n16.\n\nThe Parties submitted their responses to this request on 2 May 2016.9 On 12 May 2016, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal concerning the interest rate employed by Claimant in its calculations, and by invitation of the Tribunal Claimant responded on 19 May 2016.\n\nHochtief AG\u2019s Second Supplemental Submission on Damages dated 2 May 2016 [\"Claimant\u2019s Submission (2 May 2016)\"; Submission of the Argentine Republic in response to the Tribunal\u2019s Questions of 21 March 2016 [\"Respondent\u2019s Submission (2 May 2016)\"].\n\n17.\n\nOn 10 November 2016, the Tribunal asked each party to submit an updated statement of the costs incurred in the arbitration.\n\n18.\n\nOn 16 November 2016, each party filed an updated statement of costs.\n\n19.\n\nOn 21 November 2016, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed.\n\n**The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability**\n----------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn the operative part of its Decision on Liability of 29 December 2014, paragraph 336, the Tribunal decided as follows:\n\n336. On the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal DECIDES as follows:\n\na. Having already determined (by a majority) that it has jurisdiction over the claims in this case, the Tribunal concludes, by a majority, that claims made by Claimant in its capacity as a lender to PdL are inadmissible. All the other objections by Respondent to the admissibility of Claimant\u2019s claims, are rejected;\n\nb. As explained in paragraphs 209-288, Respondent breached its obligations under Article 2 of the BIT to grant to Claimant fair and equitable treatment, by (1) the failure to restore and redress the commercial balance that liad been secured by the Concession Contract, after that balance liad been disrupted by the pesification Law, Law 25,561, on 6 January 2002; and (2) the pesification of operation and maintenance expenses in Resolution 14 of 30 June 2003, and reparation is due in respect of those breaches;\n\nc. The Tribunal finds that it does not need to resolve Claimant\u2019s claims concerning Full Protection and Security [BIT Articles 2(1) and 4(1)], expropriation [BIT Article 4(2)], arbitrary and discriminatory measures, and \u2018observance of obligations\u2019 or \u2018umbrella clause\u2019, because they are all based on essentially the same arguments as the claims based upon the FET standard. As noted under paragraph 291, it lias not been argued that these other standards entail a different approach to causation or to determination of quantum, or to liability, and the Tribunal considers that these additional grounds for the claims are adequately addressed by its decisions in respect to the FET standard;\n\nd. As is explained in paragraphs 292-301, Respondent\u2019s submission that the breaches in the present case can be excused or exculpated by reason of the economic crisis and \u2018necessity\u2019 under customary international law, is rejected;\n\ne. Claimant is entitled to 26% of the damages caused to PdL by Respondent, corresponding to its sitare in the equity of PdL, and the Tribunal decides, by a majority, that such damages are to be assessed as at the date of this Decision;\n\nf. The political risk insurance payment that Claimant had arranged with the German Government should not be deducted from the amount due to Claimant, as explained in paragraph 309;\n\ng. Since the Tribunal lias not been able, on the basis of the information provided by the Parties, to calculate the actual compensation to be paid, the Parties are to calculate and submit, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 325, the information required under paragraph 335, in the manner and within the time limits indicated therein;\n\nh. As decided in paragraphs 332-334, interest on all sums due to Claimant from the date on which the payment should have been made to Claimant, and on any and all sums due under this Decision from the date of the Decision until the date when the payment of such sums is made is payable at the rates of short-term US Treasury Bills at the relevant times, compounded quarterly.\n\ni. As to costs, and as explained in paragraphs 329-331, Respondent should reimburse the Claimant in the sum of US$6,925,318.50.\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s instructions on the calculation of damages were set out in the Decision on Liability, and have been summarized above. The instructions reflected the Tribunal\u2019s view that the damages calculated must be directly related to the breaches found in the Decision, and ensure that no damages are awarded for losses resulting from other causes, not caused by Treaty breaches attributable to Respondent. This was of particular importance in this case. It is well established that bilateral investment treaties (\"BITs\") are not insurance policies against damages flowing from the assumption of business risk. The highway and bridge construction project was structured in such a way that the Concessionaire was contractually bound to finance those construction costs that were not covered by the State\u2019s subsidy.10 The consortium members and the Concessionaire well understood this financial commitment and there was always a risk that the overall economic climate might affect the project\u2019s financing. This risk unfortunately materialized. PdL\u2019s investors had the misfortune to launch the project at the time when the Argentine Republic began to slip into a recession that developed into a full-blown economic crisis. This, as the Decision on Liability found, adversely affected PdL\u2019s ability to secure the necessary funding from the IDB.11 The lack of third party funding meant that the shareholders had to make loans to finance the company\u2019s operations and ultimately Argentina had to conclude the Financial Aid Agreement with PdL to enable the project\u2019s completion.12\n\nDecision, paras. 78-80.\n\nDecision, paras. 222-227.\n\nDecision, paras. 102-114.\n\n22.\n\nIt is important therefore to seek to isolate the financial effects of Argentina\u2019s breaches of its obligations under the Treaty from those resulting from what the Tribunal described as an \"extraordinary financial crisis... confronting Argentina\" in order to differentiate between damage proximately caused by the breaches and damage resulting from other causes.13\n\nDecision, para. 324.\n\n**III. CLAIMANT\u2019S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n23.\n\nIn summary, Claimant seeks total damages in the sum of US$54 million (employing the 1-year T-Bill Interest Rate)14 or its preferred alternatives:\n\n(a) US$103 million (weighted average cost of capital interest rate);15 or\n\n(b) US$72.8 million (commercial interest rate, as referred to in Article 4(2) of the German-Argentine BIT).16\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (19 June 2015), paras. 8-9 and 47.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (19 June 2015), paras. 12, and 97-98.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (19 June 2015), paras. 13 and 101.\n\n24.\n\nClaimant has argued that the low interest rate specified in the Decision17 does not allow for full reparation of the loss caused to Claimant.18\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraphs 332-334, 336(h). The Decision refers to interest \"payable at the rates of short-term US Treasury Bills\".\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (19 June 2015), para. 81.\n\n25.\n\nOut of the US$54 million, Claimant seeks US$50 million for losses arising out of Respondent\u2019s failure to restore and redress the commercial balance. It seeks US$4 million for the pesification of operation and maintenance expenses in Resolution 14, reflecting the reduction in the value of PdL (from the period of May 2003 to May 2007)19 due to PdL being compelled to redirect its revenues to make payments to the Financial Assistance Agreement (FAA) loan that would have been unnecessary were it not for Resolution 14.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post Liability Decision Report by Manuel A. Abdala (17 June 2015), para. 44.\n\n26.\n\nClaimant also seeks damages for anticipated losses stemming from the fact that on 26 August 2014, after receiving notice of the shareholders\u2019 intention to dissolve PdL (a decision taken on 30 June 2014), Respondent adopted a resolution terminating the Concession Contract.20\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (19 June 2015), paras. 20 and 43; Exhibit CX 170.\n\n27.\n\nThe decision to dissolve the Company was taken approximately 6 months before the Tribunal issued the Decision on Liability, and the Concession\u2019s termination occurred on 26 August 2014, approximately four months before the Tribunal issued the Decision. As was noted above, neither disputing party brought this to the Tribunal\u2019s attention prior to its rendering its Decision on 29 December 2014. For its part, Claimant did not inform the Tribunal of this fact until some two months after the issuance of the Decision, on 25 February 2015.21 It subsequently explained that the termination of the Concession Contract had little impact upon its claim because\n\n\"[t]he only future recovery Hochtief anticipated receiving from its investment was a negligible amount as a creditor under the terms of PdL\u2019s insolvency plan. Argentina\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract on August 26, 2014, therefore liad little impact on Hochtief s damages under Compass Lexecon\u2019s original model.\"22\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (19 June 2015), para. 33.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (2 May 2016), para. 39. The original Compass Lexecon model appears in Manuel Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller, Losses to Hochtief AG\u2019s Investments in Puentes del Littoral S.A., 29 April 2010.\n\n28.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission dated 2 May 2016 summarises the steps leading to the dissolution of PdL by resolution adopted on 30 June 2014, and Argentina\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract by resolution adopted on 26 August 2014. In summary, Claimant maintains that PdL faced the risk of mandatory dissolution from 2006 onwards, after the expiry of the suspension of a law setting out the obligation to dissolve a company in the event of a total loss of its corporate capital. After unsuccessfully attempting to renegotiate the Concession Contract in the course of 2006 and early 2007, PdL initiated insolvency proceedings on 2 May 2007 in an attempt to restructure its debts. Despite agreement with its creditors within the framework of the insolvency proceedings, PdL\u2019s financial position continued to deteriorate, and on 2 July 2012 PdL wrote to Argentina\u2019s President, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, explaining that PdL\u2019s insolvency exposed it to mandatory dissolution under Argentine law, and urging her to sign and implement the Fourth Transitory Agreement. On 27 July 2012, PdL\u2019s shareholders attempted to stave off mandatory dissolution by absorbing its accumulated losses up to AR$ 43,650,000 and increasing its capital by AR$ 1,000,000 conditionally upon approval of the Fourth Transitory Agreement within 90 days (which condition was not fulfilled). PdL sought the necessary approval from the *Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Vialidad* (\"DNV\") for the amendments to its by-laws that the plan required, but that approval was not granted. PdL followed up its application to DNV in October and November 2012, but approval was still not granted. On 11 June 2013, by which time it had a negative net worth of AR$ 28,582,450, PdL filed an administrative claim requesting damages and termination of the Concession Contract.23 PdL\u2019s 2013 financial statements showed its negative net worth as AR$ 121,592,609. On 30 June 2014 PdL\u2019s shareholders voted unanimously for its dissolution, thus triggering the automatic termination of the Concession Contract in accordance with its Section 30.9.24\n\nIt appears that Hochtief opposed this decision, and that the shareholders agreed that Hochtief\u2019s vote would not be counted, so that the decision would be unanimously agreed: Respondent\u2019s Submission (2 May 2016), para. 9, Minutes of Special Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of PdL, 14 March 2013 (Exhibit RA 466).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (2 May 2016), paras. 4-30; Concession Contract, Exhibit CX32.b.\n\n29.\n\nClaimant maintains that\n\n\"the shareholder\u2019s [sic] decision to dissolve PdL was the inevitable consequence of Argentina\u2019s treatment of PdL: for three consecutive years (2011, 2012, and 2013) PdL had showed a negative net worth and at that stage it was clear that Argentina liad no intention whatsoever of restoring the economic balance of the Concession Contract.\"25\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (2 May 2016), para. 31.\n\n30.\n\nClaimant submits that due to the Concession Contract\u2019s termination, this has left PdL with no expected cash flow in the actual scenario through 2023, and there can be no renegotiations. This it considers to be \"a follow on effect\" of the Respondent\u2019s breach of the BIT by failure to rebalance the financial terms timeously.26 Claimant argues further that even if the Concession had not been terminated, the Tribunal\u2019s stated expectation27 that the Respondent would abide by the Decision and meet its obligations to Claimant and PdL was not consistent with the Respondent\u2019s past conduct.28 Claimant maintains that it is therefore entitled to compensation for future losses, covering the period up to the expiry of the Concession Contract as originally stipulated.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (19 June 2015), para. 51.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (19 June 2015), para. 48; Decision, para. 327.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission (19 June 2015), para. 59.\n\n**IV. RESPONDENT\u2019S POSITION**\n-----------------------------\n\n31.\n\nRespondent maintains that\n\n\"the economic-financial equilibrium of the Contract had already been disrupted prior to the emergency measures, a situation which was clear to the IDB [sc. Inter-American Development Bank] itself and which influenced the decision to reject the loan request, together with the low level of income evidenced by the traffic rates presented by PdL. This led to a change in the financing strategy-whereby PdL\u2019s shareholders took on the role of creditors at an extremely high cost to PdL -which resulted in the worsening of the financial deterioration of the Concessionaire.\"29\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission (2 May 2016), para. 20 (footnote omitted).\n\n32.\n\nRespondent notes \"that PdL had no reserves and that the unappropriated accumulated loss exceeded the capital stock as from 2011; a situation experienced in 2012 and 2013 as well In sum, PdL was in a position to be dissolved as early as December 2011.30 It says that PdL\u2019s \"level of indebtedness grew exponentially as from 2001, largely because of the intercompany loans expressed in United States dollars and the update of the value with annual 15% rates, after its failure to obtain the IDB [l]oan.\"31\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission (2 May 2016), para. 47 (footnotes omitted).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission (2 May 2016), para. 48.\n\n33.\n\nRespondent initially submitted that as of the date of the Decision on Liability Claimant sustained total damages of US$3.55 million at most.32 This loss would be due to the failure to restore and redress the commercial balance that had been secured by the Concession Contract. However, assuming that the PdL\u2019s operating costs were expressed in US Dollars, as required by the Decision on Liability, then in its view the damages would be zero.33 There would be no damages arising out of Argentina\u2019s breaches of the Treaty, because once all the adjustments had been made no dividends would be generated, and PdL\u2019s shareholders would therefore have lost nothing as a result of Respondent\u2019s breaches.34\n\nSubmission on Damages pursuant to the Decision on Liability dated 18 June 2015 [\"Respondent\u2019s Submission (18 June 2015)\"], para. 31.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission (18 June 2015), para. 32; Updated Damages Valuation Report following the guidelines in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability dated 18 June 2015 [\"Respondent\u2019s Updated Experts\u2019 Report (18 June 2015)\"], para. 52.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Updated Experts\u2019 Report (18 June 2015), paras. 53.\n\n34.\n\nIn relation to Resolution 14, Respondent\u2019s experts considered that the appropriate valuation period was between 22 May 2003 and 31 December 2006.35 No compensable losses were suffered and the effect of Resolution 14 was simply delay the repayment of the FAA and no dividends would have been paid over that time period even without the effects of Resolution 14.36\n\nRespondent\u2019s Updated Experts\u2019 Report (18 June 2015), para. 43.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Updated Experts\u2019 Report (18 June 2015), paras. 46.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent and its experts, Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky, principally focused on Compass Lexecon\u2019s decision to shift away from the valuation method used consistently in their two expert reports submitted in the merits phase, to what Compass Lexecon called a *\"simplified cash flow analysis\"* in this damages phase.37 Compass Lexecon\u2019s previous reports employed a \"Free Cash Flow to Equity\" approach when estimating the losses suffered by Claimant.

It argued that this was not brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention and was not therefore analysed during the stage in which the potential liability of the Argentine Republic was under consideration.47 It observed further that PdL has already brought an action in this respect before the Argentine courts, and there is thus the risk of double recovery.48\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission (18 June 2015), para. 14.

THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S FINDINGS**\n------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s task has been assisted by the Parties\u2019 submissions on quantum and by the experts\u2019 reports.\n\n45.\n\nEssentially, there are three major issues that must be addressed to arrive at the Award. Two involve questions of principle and proper procedure: (i) whether the Tribunal should revisit its determination of the appropriate interest rate; and (ii) what is the effect of the dissolution of PdL and the consequent termination of the Concession Contract on this arbitration. Having decided those issues, the Tribunal can then determine whether the experts\u2019 approach was faithful to the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, and which is to be preferred and to what extent. It will then determine the amount of damages payable.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal will address each of these questions in turn before turning to the experts\u2019 calculations.\n\n***(i) The Interest Rate***\n---------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal arrived at its decision on the applicable rate of interest53 with the assistance of submissions and the evidence adduced by the Parties. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimant\u2019s interest rate adjustment request amounts to a request for re-consideration of that decision. Leaving aside the issue of whether or not the Tribunal is empowered to reconsider the interest terms set forth in the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal perceives no reason for changing its previous decision on the subject. Hence the interest provisions of the Decision on Liability are carried forward in this Award.\n\nDecision on Liability, para. 334.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly reiterates that interest is payable at the rates of short-term US Treasury Bills at the relevant times. Further, it specifies that \"short-term US Treasury Bills\" is to be understood to mean one-year US Treasury Bills.\n\n***(ii) Whether the Disolution of PdL and the Consequent Termination of the Concession Contract Requires the Tribunal to Adjust the Approach Taken in its Decision***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIt is common ground that on 30 June 2014, the shareholders of PdL resolved to dissolve the company and therefore it was no longer in a position to perform the Concession Contract. This led, in accordance with Section 30.9 of the Concession Contract, to the contract\u2019s termination. Respondent adopted a resolution on termination on 26 August 20 1 4.54 Court proceedings have been commenced against the Respondent in relation to its actions relating to the Concession Contract.\n\nCX-170.\n\n50.\n\nWhen it was notified of the dissolution and related events the Tribunal left open, in its letter to the Parties dated 11 March 2015, the possibility of the Parties making out a case (either in their bilateral negotiations, or in their submissions to the Tribunal) for a variation in the process for determining the quantum of damages as set out in the Decision.55 The letter referred to the possibility of an effect upon the calculations, but not to any effect upon the factual premises of the Decision on Liability, and paragraph 1 expressly reaffirmed the approach hitherto taken to the determination of quantum.\n\n\"(1) Having considered the Parties\u2019 letters of 25 February 2015 and 05 March 2015, the Tribunal reaffirms its Decision on Liability, including its approach to the determination of quantum as set out in paragraphs 311-334 of the Decision, and its fixing of 23 May 2003 and 29 December 2014 as the beginning and end dates for the assessment of losses. (2) The Tribunal is nonetheless aware that recent developments might be said to have affected the calculations envisaged in paragraphs 325-328 and 332-334 of the Decision.\"\n\n51.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 further submissions, the Tribunal\u2019s view is that there is no basis for the Tribunal to supplement or vary its prior determinations insofar as the determination of the quantum of damages up to the date of the Decision is concerned. However, that is not dispositive of the issue that has arisen from PdL\u2019s dissolution.\n\n52.\n\nAt paragraph 327 of its Decision, the Tribunal reasoned that it could not be presumed \"that Respondent will ignore the implications of this Decision for its continuing obligations towards PdL and Claimant.\"56 That finding was based on what the Tribunal then understood the situation to be, namely, that the Concession Contract was in force and that it could be expected that, following the Tribunal\u2019s determination of certain Treaty breaches and any order for compensation for Hochtief s losses suffered up to the date of the Decision, Respondent would finally conclude a revised contract with PdL that would reestablish the economic bargain in the changed circumstances and this new arrangement would then govern the Parties\u2019 relations for the balance of the Concession Contract\u2019s term.\n\nDecision, para. 327.\n\n53.\n\nHad it been made aware of the decision to dissolve PdL and the consequent termination of the Concession Contract, the Tribunal could not and would not have made the statements in paragraph 327 of the Decision. It would have been squarely presented with the fact of the non-existence of the Concession Contract, and indeed PdL itself, and would have had to determine the consequences of those developments. Claimant has asserted that now that the Tribunal is apprised of these developments it must award damages for the remaining period of the Concession Contract\u2019s term because PdL and through it, Hochtief, has no prospect of receiving any revenues from contractual performance. For its part, Respondent asserted that Claimant had raised a new claim which it did not raise earlier in the proceedings, and that it was doing so belatedly.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s description of the failure to notify it of the changed circumstances should not be taken to be a criticism of counsel for either Party. At the time of the Concession Contract\u2019s termination the Tribunal had yet to issue its Decision and therefore both sides were unsure what the outcome of this proceeding would be. On Claimant\u2019s case, it had suffered from multiple breaches with the result that the Concession had been, among other things, effectively expropriated and therefore substantial damages were in order; for Respondent, the claims should have been dismissed in their entirety. As events transpired, the Tribunal accepted that only two of the measures identified by Claimant breached the fair and equitable treatment standard. The Tribunal also made a series of findings that narrowed the amount of damages that would be payable to Hochtief.57\n\nSee para. 61 below.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal initially had a concern that the development has been brought to its attention only through correspondence and without the benefit of detailed evidence and submissions. The present proceeding had not been declared closed after the oral hearing. It was open to either disputing party to bring any new facts to the Tribunal\u2019s attention before it rendered its Decision so that they could be considered by the Tribunal after giving both Parties an appropriate opportunity to address them. As this has not occurred, the Tribunal has not been given a detailed and tested account of the circumstances surrounding the dissolution and termination decisions. It is evident from the very existence of the court proceedings as well as in the Parties\u2019 exchanges in this arbitration that the reasons for the Concession Contract\u2019s termination are a matter of dispute under the applicable law.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds itself in the position of having to arrive at a just and legally supported award in light of a development that had not been anticipated when it declined to award damages for lost future cash flows. After carefully reviewing its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal finds that in dealing with the claim for damages suffered from the date of the Decision on Liability to the date of the Contract\u2019s expiry, it is not dealing with a new claim, as Respondent contended, but rather a further development -unknown to the Tribunal at the relevant time- in the Concession\u2019s life and ultimate demise. It also finds, for reasons explained below, that it is unnecessary to hold a full-blown evidentiary hearing.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it helpful to recall certain key findings of the Decision on Liability in order to explain the basis for these findings. In concluding that Respondent breached the Treaty, the Tribunal took note of the fact that \"renegotiation was mandated by the Emergency Law, Law No. 25,561 in January 2002. Title IV (and in particular Article 9) of the Emergency Law provided for the renegotiation of public works contracts, and Article 8 of Decree 214/02 provided for adjustments of contracts to be made annually (and in some circumstances, more frequently) so as to \u2018preserve the continuity of the contractual relationship in a way equitable for the parties.\u2019\"58\n\nDecision, para. 284.\n\n58.\n\nVarious draft Transitory Agreements were developed and exchanged over the ensuing years including during the course of the arbitration itself, but none resulted in a final implemented agreement that would achieve the re-balancing that the Emergency Law had promised. During this period, PdL sought creditor protection. The Tribunal took note of the fact that the court conducting the insolvency proceeding considered \"that UNIREN\u2019s refusal to continue the renegotiation of the concession agreement was contrary to the aims of Argentine law, and that more than six years after the enactment of Emergency Law 25,561 \u2018the grave imbalance in the terms of the [Concession] agreement persists\u2019\".59\n\nDecision, para. 285. [Emphasis added.]\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal found that \"that it was practicable for the Parties to conclude a negotiated settlement by 2006 or 2007 at the latest. PdL was prepared in 2006 to accept - and, indeed, did accept - a negotiated settlement, and the Claimant was also willing to accept that settlement as a shareholder in PdL. But the 2006 Letter of Understanding (*Carta de Entendimiento* or \u2018CdE\u2019) that set out the terms of a settlement was repudiated by the presentation of the 2007 CdE to PdL by Respondent on 12 February 2007.\"60 Due to this failure timeously to conclude an agreement, the Tribunal fixed the breach as having occurred by 26 February 200761 -the date on which the Claimant sent to Respondent its notice regarding the existence of a dispute under the BIT- but found that for the purposes of calculating damages, the \"breach consists in the failure to redress the commercial balance that had been disrupted by the pesification Law, Law 25,561 on 6 January 2002; and the injury for which reparation is due includes losses suffered on and after 6 January 2002.\"62\n\nDecision, para. 286.\n\nDecision, para. 287.\n\n*Id.*\n\n60.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal then found that no losses could be proved from the period 6 January 2002 to 23 May 2003: \"It was after the opening of the road and bridges to tollpaying traffic on that date, that the impact of the pesification and the Emergency Loan upon PdL\u2019s income stream from tolls began to be felt. The Tribunal accordingly decides by a majority that while the renegotiation and \u2018rebalancing\u2019 should have occurred by 2006 or 2007, the duty to restore the balance extended back to cover all \u2018unbalancing\u2019 losses resulting from the 2002 Emergency Law, and thus covered the losses arising after 23 May 2003.\"63\n\nDecision, para. 298.\n\n61.\n\nThree claims advanced by the Claimant were not accepted: (i) the Tribunal, by a majority, rejected as inadmissible the claims made by Claimant in its capacity as a lender to PdL; (ii) the claim for losses flowing from PdL\u2019s inability to obtain the IDB loan, and from the delay in beginning operations (which included the extra costs incurred as a result of the failure of the IDB loan to materialize, and the allegedly excessive costs of the 2003 Emergency Loan), was rejected on the merits;64 and (iii) the claim for damage to Hochtief s investment as a result of the fall of PdL towards bankruptcy was also rejected on the merits.65\n\nDecision, para. 320.\n\nDecision, para. 323.\n\n62.\n\nThis latter claim was not accepted because the evidence showed that PdL had had the misfortune to initiate its project shortly before the Argentinean economy began its slide into the deep recession that triggered the economic crisis. The Tribunal found in this regard that: \"Given the Project\u2019s difficult financial straits in the deteriorating financial conditions of Argentina in the months leading up to the Emergency Law\u2019s enactment,... there is insufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion that the bankruptcy proceedings against PdL were caused by the pesification process or any other breach of the BIT for which Respondent was responsible; and it declines to order the payment of any reparation in respect of PdL\u2019s fall towards bankruptcy.\"66\n\nDecision, para. 324.\n\n63.\n\nThis finding in turn led the Tribunal to hold that the calculation of the quantum of damages in the *'but-for'''* world of dollarized revenues must at the same time assume that PdL would have paid all of its creditors: \"Indeed, the Tribunal\u2019s assumption must be that if it requires a revenue stream to be calculated in dollars, in order to avoid any unjust enrichment, it must equally assume that all of PdL\u2019s liabilities are similarly to be calculated in dollars. On this basis, and having regard to the normal priority of creditors over shareholders, PdL must be assumed to have been placed in a position to fully repay all of its debts, including to Boskalis-Ballast Nedam, to Argentina (for the Emergency Loan), and to those shareholders such as Hochtief who advanced loans to the company. It follows that the valuation exercise must assume no insolvency and the full repayment of sums owing to creditors without any discount.\"67\n\n*Id.*\n\n64.\n\nThis set the stage for the Tribunal\u2019s instructions to the Parties in paragraph 336 of the Decision, quoted above at paragraph 20, on the approach to be taken in the additional quantum phase.\n\n65.\n\nAs is clear from the recitation of the key findings listed above, the Tribunal considered that the principal breach (the failure to rebalance the concession) adversely affected PdL\u2019s business. This, to the Tribunal\u2019s mind, was beyond doubt on the evidence before it. It was the view of the Argentinean insolvency court; and it is also the Tribunal\u2019s view. Similarly, the Tribunal found, on contemporaneous evidence, including statements of PdL\u2019s own making, that there were other causes of the project\u2019s poor financial health, including threatened bankruptcy and the suspension of construction, that predated the financial crisis.68 What has not been established is the relative ranking of the various causes: but the Tribunal does not need to make that determination in order to be in a position to award damages because its instructions allow financial harm caused by factors not attributable to the breaches to be addressed by the requirement that all debts be assumed to be paid in full and in dollars. Thus, in the *\u2018but-for\u2019* scenario, PdL must pay the debt owed to Boskalis-Ballet Nedam, to Argentina for the FAA, and the debts owed to Hochtief and the other shareholders, before PdL is in a position to declare dividends.\n\n*Id.,* para. 253: \"...The Tribunal notes, however, that there is evidence that PdL was in financial difficulties even before pesification occurred. In particular: (i) PdL was informing the Grantor in August 2001, four months before pesification, that it was going to have to suspend construction of the bridge at the end of the month; (ii) PdL appeared to be unable to pay its creditors (Boskalis/Ballast Nedam); (iii) PdL told the IDB in October 2001 that it could be petitioned in bankruptcy by its creditors; and (iv) PdL\u2019s smaller shareholders\u2019 were apparently unable or unwilling to make further capital contributions in September 2001.\" (Footnotes omitted.)\n\n66.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal takes some comfort from the fact that in 2012, when PdL wrote to the President of Argentina urging Argentina to implement the Fourth Transitory Agreement, the shareholders conditionally committed to increase the company\u2019s capital if that occurred.69 The investors were experienced contractors and had operated the Concession for some nine years by the time of that request and it can be surmised that they believed that they could run the Concession satisfactorily (if not as profitably as originally hoped) if the rebalancing occurred. Accordingly, it warrants noting that even in the actual world in 2012, they were willing to commit more capital to PdL if the rebalancing occurred.\n\nSee para. 28 *supra.*\n\n67.\n\nMoreover, the key point for the Tribunal is that the experts for both Parties agree that in the *\u2018but-for\u2019* world of a rebalanced concession, PdL would have paid off all debt owing to its creditors including its shareholders and the Argentine Republic by either 2013 or 2014.70 This allows the Tribunal to put to one side the other non-attributable causes of PdL\u2019s financial difficulties because in the *\u2018but-for\u2019* dollarized world PdL would have been able to surmount those difficulties. It is clear that it would take some time for PdL to pay off its debts, but the seminal point is that both Parties\u2019 experts agree that the Company would eventually have been in a position to pay dividends to its shareholders.\n\nCompass Lexecon believes that the debt would be paid by the end of 2013 whereas Sandleris and Schargrodsky believe that it would be paid off in 2014.\n\n68.\n\nOnce this is established, the answer to Respondent\u2019s objection is clear. In the *\u2018but-for\u2019* world, PdL\u2019s shareholders would not have voted for dissolution and the Concession Contract would not be terminated on that ground. Rather, by either 2013 or 2014, the company would be \u2018cash flow positive\u2019. Accordingly, the Tribunal is in a position to award damages for lost profits for the balance of the Concession Contract\u2019s term, that is, to 13 September 2023.\n\n69.\n\nHaving decided the first two issues of principle and procedure, the Tribunal now turns to estimate those damages.\n\n***(iii) Estimates of damages: Shareholders\u2019 Cash Flow*** vs. ***\"Simplified Cash Flow\"***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAfter the Decision was issued and further analysis performed, it became clear to the Tribunal that Claimant interpreted the Decision on Liability to mean that it is entitled to 26% of the dollarized cash flows due to PdL directly (evidently without regard to any PdL\u2019s liabilities and debts). In contrast, Respondent quantified the entitlement as 26% of the dollarized dividends that Claimant might have received *qua* shareholder of PdL after all of PdL\u2019s creditors had been satisfied. This is the key difference between the Parties in respect of the estimation of damages.\n\n71.\n\nBy way of introduction to this discussion, it may be helpful to recall the instructions that the Tribunal had given in its Decision on Liability with respect to creditors\u2019 rights when it came to valuing Claimant\u2019s compensable interest in PdL:\n\n(i) *At paragraph 304:* \"As a shareholder in PdL, Claimant has obligations as well as rights; and one of those obligations is to accept that the assets of PdL would be properly applied to satisfy the legitimate demands of all PdL\u2019s creditors and all PdL\u2019s shareholders, according to the priorities laid down by law.\"\n\n(ii) *At paragraph 324:* \"Indeed, the Tribunal\u2019s assumption must be that if it requires a revenue stream to be calculated in dollars, in order to avoid any unjust enrichment, it must equally assume that all of PdL\u2019s liabilities are similarly to be calculated in dollars. On this basis, and having regard to the normal priority of creditors over shareholders, PdL must be assumed to have been placed in a position to fully repay all of its debts, including to Boskalis-Ballast Nedam, to Argentina (for the Emergency Loan), and to those shareholders such as Hochtief who advanced loans to the company. It follows that the valuation exercise must assume no insolvency and the full repayment of sums owing to creditors without any discount.\"\n\n(iii) *And at paragraph 325,* when setting out the precise instructions for calculating damages, the Tribunal stated that the \" the reduction in value is to be Claimant\u2019s 26% share of the difference in US dollars between the actual value of PdL at the date of this Decision, and the value that PdL would have had if all other factors had remained as they stand in the \u2018actual scenario \u2019...,and the last specific instruction stated that: \"d) The actual operation and maintenance costs and all other financial liabilities incurred by PdL, including all of its debts, had not been pesified or reduced in the insolvency proceedings.\" [Emphasis added.]\n\n72.\n\nThe necessity to factor in dollarized costs and debt repayments has been settled by the clear terms of the Tribunal\u2019s directions concerning the calculation of damages, which required that the valuation exercise must assume no insolvency, and assume the full repayment of sums owing to creditors without the pesification or reduction of debts in the insolvency proceedings.71\n\nSee para. 63, above\n\n73.\n\nThis conclusion is dictated by the logic of the relationship between Claimant\u2019s ability to claim under the Treaty and its ability to claim under municipal law, and the fact that Respondent can be liable only for damages that are shown to have flowed from its breach of its duties under the Treaty. Claimant accepted the terms of the Concession Contract, which precluded \u2018creditor\u2019 claims against Argentina, leaving creditors (including shareholder-creditors who had the protection of the Treaty in their capacity as investors) reliant upon municipal law for the pursuit of their claims.72 That left Claimant with its right to claim for damage to the value of its investment; and the measure of that damage is the loss in the value of Claimant\u2019s interest as a shareholder in PdL.\n\nDecision, para. 192.\n\n74.\n\nNotwithstanding the Tribunal\u2019s clear directions, by focusing virtually exclusively on the difference between actual and *\u2018but-for\u2019* cash flows and essentially equating a 26% interest in those cash flows to Hochtief s 26% shareholding interest, Compass Lexecon\u2019s Post Liability Decision Report dated 17 June 2015 appeared to *exclude* what the Tribunal had directed must be *included,* namely, the impact of PdL\u2019s financial obligations on its performance.\n\n75.\n\nHaving asserted that Claimant\u2019s 26% share in PdL was worth US$29.8 million as of August 2014, Compass Lexecon\u2019s 17 June 2015 valuation appeared to overstate the value of Claimant\u2019s shareholding interest after all PdL\u2019s debt had been paid. But the report also asserted in a footnote (without further explication) that by 2013 all debt would have been paid off. It was Respondent\u2019s view, and the Tribunal believed that there might well be substance to it, that the expert\u2019s report overstated PdL\u2019s value as of 2013. It was for this reason that, on 1 October 2015, the Tribunal instructed its Secretary to write to the Parties, referring to footnote 18 of Compass Lexecon\u2019s report, and requesting Compass Lexecon to provide the worksheets that showed the paying down of the various debts incurred by PdL.73\n\nLetter dated 1 October 2015 from the Secretary of the Tribunal to the Parties [\"Tribunal Secretary\u2019s Letter dated 1 October 2015\"].\n\n76.\n\nOn 15 October 2015, Claimant\u2019s counsel submitted a letter accompanied by certain Compass Lexecon spreadsheets in electronic form and describing the analysis contained therein.74 The letter introduced three additional worksheets to Exhibit CLEX-042 (the Valuation Model previously submitted with Compass Lexecon\u2019s Post- Liability Decision Report dated 17 June 2015):\n\n(i) Worksheet VI. 1 \u2018But-for\u2019 Financing : This worksheet calculated the evolution of PdL\u2019s loan debt in the *\u2018but-for\u2019* scenario. Compass Lexecon broke the debt down into \"Senior Debt\" for the loan extended by Argentina and \"Junior Debt\", which included inter-company loans made by PdL\u2019s shareholders. The worksheet showed the breakdown of the principal repayment, the interest due and the interest repayment at the end of each year (for both categories of debt). The worksheet showed that in the *\u2019but-for\u2019* world, by 2013, PdL was debt-free.\n\n(ii) Worksheet VI.2 \u2018But-for\u2019 Cash Flows 03-13 : This worksheet calculated PdL\u2019s *\u2019but-for\u2019* free cash flows available for debt repayment, which was reflected in the calculation of the evolution of the loan debt in Worksheet VI. 1. The calculations further reflected PdL\u2019s and Boskalis-Ballast Nedam\u2019s agreement in 2004 that PdL\u2019s debt would be US$25 million plus interest. Accordingly, the calculations showed that that debt was paid off as at the end of 2004. It also showed that PdL took on new Junior Debt to pay off Boskalis-Ballast Nedam.\n\n(iii) Worksheet IV.3 \u2018But-for\u2019 Financial Aid Agreement : This worksheet showed the evolution of PdL\u2019s debt to Argentina in the *\u2018but-for\u2019* scenario. By the end of December 2005 in the *\u2018but-for\u2019* scenario, PdL would have fully paid Argentina all principal and interest due under the Financial Aid Agreement.\n\nThe letter then concluded that there was no disagreement between the Parties\u2019 experts in relation to the paying off of debts by the end of 2013 in the *\u2018but-for\u2019* scenario.75\n\nLetter dated 15 October 2015, from Kelley Drye & Warren LLP to the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\nCounsel\u2019s letter noted at pp. 3-4: \"There is no disagreement between the parties in relation to PdL\u2019s ability to repay its loan debt and Boskalis by the end of 2013 in the but-for scenario. Indeed, in their 15 June 2015 updated report, Argentina\u2019s experts, Drs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky, conclude that in their \u2018but-for scenario, and according to the normal priority of creditors over shareholders...

In case they should be relevant to the Tribunal's decision, the Tribunal wishes to see the worksheets that lie behind the conclusion noted in footnote 18 of the Compass Lexecon Report dated 17 June 2015. The conclusion reads T checked that in the but-for scenario as of August 26, 2014, PdL would have already paid all of its debts (including the Emergency Loan to Argentina, the debt with suppliers such as Boskalis-Ballast Nedam, and the loans advanced by PdL\u2019s shareholders, considering the debt amounts as not pesified, and not reduced by the insolvency proceedings).\u2019 The worksheets should be sent in electronic form and in hard copy by Thursday, October 15, 2015. If Respondent wishes to request permission to comment upon those worksheets, it should do so by Thursday, October 29, 2015.\"\n\nLetter from Respondent to the Members of Tribunal dated 30 November 2015, NOTE PTN No. 227/AI/15; Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment; Excel worksheet containing sheet titled \"SS Damage Valuation\" containing the CLEX Model with Drs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s calculation [\"Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky Damage Valuation\"].\n\n78.\n\nRespondent\u2019s comments were accompanied by a report by Respondent\u2019s experts, Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky, analysing Compass Lexecon\u2019s approach and how the recently disclosed spreadsheets comported with prior analyses conducted by Compass Lexecon.\n\n79.\n\nMessrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky asserted that Compass Lexecon\u2019s simplified model did not comply with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions and was problematic (in sum, resulting in the overstatement of the amount of damages). Their main arguments were as follows:\n\n(i) Change in valuation method : Claimant\u2019s experts had switched from the \"Free Cash Flow to Equity\" method used in their earlier reports to a \"Free Cash Flow to Firm\" method. The latter was based on the differential between the actual and the *\u2018but-for\u2019* revenues to the company. This was problematic for a number of reasons: (i) it was at odds with fundamental principles of financial theory; (ii) it contradicted the Tribunal\u2019s instructions in the Decision in including as damages claims already found to be inadmissible by the Tribunal; (iii) it drew no difference between debts paid in the actual scenario and in the *\u2018but-for\u2019* scenario (thus assuming in the real scenario all debts were repaid, and operating costs and capital investments were the same as in the *\u2018but-for \u2019* scenario); and by considering the revenues obtained by PdL and the liabilities assumed by the PdL as two independent processes, the valuation model incorporated damages without any prior deduction of interest or repayment of debt to shareholders.78\n\n(ii) Valuation implied PdL\u2019s insolvency in the \u2018but-for\u2019 scenario : In the *\u2018but-for\u2019* scenario, Claimant\u2019s experts assumed that all additional revenues generated in that scenario were allocated to the payment of dividends to shareholders. This necessarily implied that PdL\u2019s liabilities remained unpaid in the period for which damages were estimated, thus implying that PdL remained insolvent in contradiction to the Tribunal\u2019s directions in the Decision to assume no insolvency.79\n\n(iii) Valuation sought to restore compensation for Claimant\u2019s creditor\u2019s claims : The new method included PdL\u2019s debts in full as damages, including PdL\u2019s debt to Claimant already found to be inadmissible by the Tribunal, and debts to third parties and the Argentine State, thus implicitly also compensating Claimant for debts owed by PdL to third parties.80\n\nMessrs.Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, paras. 3-6, 9-10.\n\nMessrs.Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, para. 12.\n\nMessrs.Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, paras. 7 and 13.\n\n80.\n\nRespondent\u2019s experts also commented on certain other issues reflected in the spreadsheets produced by Compass Lexecon:\n\n(i) Worksheet VI. 1 \u2018But-for\u2019 Financing : The Respondent\u2019s experts pointed out that Claimant\u2019s experts had reduced the average interest to 11.44% for the period of 2003 to 2014 and ultimately to 8.57% in 2014. This was, it was argued, without justification, and below the 15% interest rate at which shareholders had granted loans to PdL between 2001 and 2005.81 Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky asserted that if the 15% rate agreed in the inter-company loans had been maintained, \"CLEX\u2019s model would throw [sic. Sc, \u2018show\u2019. The Spanish text says \"... el propio modelo de CLEX estimar\u00eda un nivel de deuda...\"] a remaining debt of USD 12 million for 2014. In other words, there would be no dividends to be distributed to shareholders in the *but-for* scenario in any year, not even in 2014, so that there would be no possibility of claiming damages.\"82\n\n(ii) Worksheet VI.2 \u2018But-for\u2019 Cash Flows 03-13 : Claimant\u2019s experts determined an amount of income tax for the *\u2018but-for\u2019* free cash flow to PdL which was different from that estimated for the damage valuation. This amounted to employing different income tax amounts for the same scenario and Dr. Abdala offered no explanation to justify such difference.83\n\n(iii) Worksheet IV.3 \u2018But-for\u2019 Financial Aid Agreement : Both interest and principal for Financial Aid were paid out of the *\u2018but-for\u2019* revenues obtained by PdL. However, the *\u2018but-for\u2019* revenues set out in sheet \"1.1 Toll Rate Pesification\" for the purposes of damage valuation did not decrease as a result of such payment. The Respondent\u2019s experts asserted that this made it clear that Claimant\u2019s experts did not consider the debts undertaken by PdL in their damage valuation.84\n\nMessrs.Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, paras. 17-21.\n\nMessrs.Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, para. 21.\n\nMessrs.Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, paras. 22.\n\nMessrs.Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, paras. 23-25.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees generally with the main points made by Respondent\u2019s experts. The Decision treated the investment as having been made by a consortium, with Claimant\u2019s rights not being extinguished by PdL\u2019s rights.85 It follows that Claimant\u2019s investment and rights consisted in the revenues that it expected to get out of the consortium, for which PdL was the vehicle. Further, the Decision referred to Claimant\u2019s share of the value of PdL, not (as Claimant says - for example, in its Supplemental Submission dated 10 August 2015) of the value *to* PdL.86\n\nDecision, paras. 158-169\n\nDecision, paras. 315, 325; Claimant\u2019s Supplemental Submission (10 August 2015), para. 23.\n\n82.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the problem with Compass Lexecon\u2019s analysis is that although it calculated the repayment of PdL\u2019s debts over a period of some 10 years, it did not take the next crucial step of integrating that into the *\u2018but-for\u2019* cash flows to the shareholders. Reference to Compass Lexecon\u2019s worksheets shows that the *\u2018but-for\u2019* value estimation of \"Free cash flows to PdL\" as at 2014 was calculated by taking the *\u2018but-for\u2019* toll revenues and subtracting operating expenses to arrive at EBITDA, then subtracting depreciation and amortizations to arrive at EBIT, then subtracting income taxes, CAPEX and changes in working capital. There is no mention of repayment of debt. Similarly, for the so-called \"Toll Pesification Damages\", Compass Lexecon simply took the *\u2018but-for\u2019* revenues in USD, subtracted the actual revenues in USD, applied income tax and a tax loss carry forward, to arrive at a \"Revenue Differential (post-tax)\" 26% of which was then attributed to Hochtief as the \"Revenue Differential to Hochtief (Post-Tax) as of Dec-14\" of some US$ 28,771,753. Again, there is no mention of PdL paying its creditors out of any revenues surplus to operating needs.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal has checked the results of this approach against LECG\u2019s Expert Report of 29 April 2010.87 It is useful to compare LECG\u2019s initial estimate of Hochtief s lost dividends estimated in the first report to that now estimated as the \"Revenue Differential to Hochtief (Post-Tax) as of Dec-14\".\n\nLECG LLP later became pari of Compass Lexecon and all subsequent reports are authored by Messrs. Spiller and Abdala or by Dr. Abdala alone as Compass Lexecon reports.\n\n84.\n\nIt warrants noting in this regard that the 2010 estimate was based on the assumption that the Tribunal would accept Hochtief s case in its entirety *including its claim for losses suffered in connection with its having lent sums to PdL by means of inter-company loans,* a claim that the Tribunal did not accept. Having rejected that claim, the Tribunal held that the debt owed by PdL to all lenders must be assumed to have been repaid to the lenders without any reduction and on the basis that no insolvency proceedings (which reduced the debts owing in the actual scenario) took place. In simple terms, the debt actually owing to Hochtief and others had to be assumed to be paid off before any funds could be freed up for dividends to the shareholders. It is obvious that the repayment of the large intercompany debt incurred by PdL would mean that the anticipated dividend stream to the shareholders would be delayed as compared to the *\u2018but-for\u2019* scenario as originally conceived by Claimant\u2019s experts. This was to be expected given the overall macroeconomic conditions in which the project was executed and PdL\u2019s failure to conclude the IDB loan.\n\n85.\n\nLECG\u2019s report stated at paragraph 77 as follows:\n\n\"As a condition to the disbursements of the IDB loan, Hochtief, as well as other shareholders, would have been required to make additional equity contributions in 2002. For Hochtief, this contribution would have been US$ 4.0 million, making Hochtief\u2019s total equity contribution add up to US$ 15.3 million. We also find that starting in 2007, Hochtief would have been earning dividends and that as of end of 2009 it would have obtained a historical return of US$ 2.3 million on its equity investments as of December 31, 2009 (net of the US$ 4.0 million additional contribution of 2002 required by the IDB loan). Furthermore, we estimate that from 2010 onwards Hochtief would have expected to receive additional dividends, or other forms of equity distributions, worth US$ 18.1 million in US$ of December 31, 2009. The implicit Internal Rate of Return (IRR) on Hochtief\u2019s equity investment would have been 11.7%.\" (footnotes omitted)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table YIL DCF Approach: Losses to Claimant** |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | **But-For** | **Actual** | **Losses** |  |\n|  | In US$ MM **of** Dec 31,2009 **Equity Value to Hochtief** | **20.4** |  | **20.4** |  |\n| **Historical Returns (prior to 20** 10) Expected Dvldends (2010-2023) **Debt Value to Hochtief** | 2.3 18.1 | **(54.2)** | **54.2** |\n| l/C Debt Contributions Expected l/C Debt Recovery | **-** | (62.9) 8.7 |  |\n|  | **Losses to Hochtief** |  |  | **74.6** |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *Source: Own Production.* |\n\n86.\n\nLECG thus estimated that Hochtief would recover US$54.2 million in damages for the loan claim and that PdL would have begun to declare dividends in 2007, with the result that the equity value to Hochtief as of 31 December 2009, for the entire period of the Concession Contract\u2019s life to expiry in 2023, would amount to US$20.4 million.\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal has already referred to footnote 18 of Compass Lexecon\u2019s Post-Liability Decision Report, where Dr. Abdala noted that he had checked the *but-for* scenario as of 26 August 2014, and had found that PdL would have already paid all of its debts, including all of the loans. The Tribunal does not see how the worksheets in CLEX-042 comport with the \"Free cash flows to PdL\" calculated in June 2015. The Tribunal agrees with Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s characterization of the Compass Lexecon 17 June 2015 analysis as being \"at odds with the ruling made by the Tribunal in its Decision\" with the effect that \"damages are artificially overstated due to the failure to deduct from *\u2018but-for'* revenues the *\u2018but-for'* debt payments which should have been included pursuant to the Decision on Liability\".88\n\nMessrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, para. 2.\n\n88.\n\nThat said, the key point for present purposes is that Dr. Abdala recognised that (contrary to the assumed state of affairs in in the initial LECG Report) dividends would not start flowing to PdL\u2019s shareholders in 2007 in the \u2018but-for'' world, but rather that it would take quite a bit longer -on his worksheets later produced to the Tribunal on 15 October 2015- *some six years more,* for the company\u2019s liabilities to third parties, including Hochtief, to be paid off. The Tribunal recalls that by 2 May 2007, in the actual scenario PdL\u2019s debt to Hochtief already amounted to US$ 43.3 million.89 (This was not the only inter-company debt owed; the other major foreign shareholder, Impregilo, made similar loans to PdL.) Thus, it was inevitable that when the loans were held not to be recoverable in these proceedings, they would form part of the company\u2019s liabilities that had to be paid off before dividends could be paid.\n\nLECG Expert Report of 29 April 2010, para. 39.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal further agrees with Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky that had Compass Lexecon correctly linked the \u2018but-for'' debt repayment to the \u2018but-for'' revenues, Compass Lexecon\u2019s own model would show no damages to Hochtief before 2014. It follows that free cash flows to equity would be generated only from 2013 (at the earliest), which of course dramatically reduces the claimable damages in this case. This was illustrated in a table included in Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment:90\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Analysis of CLEX's model (CLEX's model rate)** | **2003** | **2004** | **2005** | **2006** | **2007** | **2008** | **2009** | ***2010*** | **2011** | **2012** | **2013** | **2014** |\n| **Free cash flow to PdL** | ***(15,2)*** | ***(28,7)*** | ***14,4*** | ***14,8*** | ***18,3*** | ***19,0*** | **25,9** | ***16,1*** | ***17,0*** | **27,0** | **25,8** | ***13,3*** |\n| **(\u2026) Debt (year start)** | ***30,6*** | ***52,3*** | ***88,7*** | ***87,3*** | ***81,8*** | ***72,0*** | ***60,1*** | ***49,9*** | ***38,5*** | ***25,1*** | ***10,4*** |  |\n| **(-) Financial Aid Agreement Interest** | ***1,9*** | ***1,7*** | ***0,7*** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **(-) Intercompany Loan Interest** | ***4,6*** | ***6,1*** | ***12,2*** | ***9,4*** | ***8,4*** | ***7,1*** | ***5,7*** | ***4,7*** | ***3,5*** | ***2,2*** | ***0,9*** |  |\n| **Debt (year end)** | ***52,3*** | ***88,7*** | ***87,3*** | ***81,8*** | ***72,0*** | ***60,1*** | ***49,9*** | ***38,5*** | ***25,1*** | ***10,4*** |  |  |\n| **PdL equity valuation** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ***4,5*** | ***13,3*** |\n| **Value to Hochtief AG (26%)** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1,2 | ***1,2*** | *3,5* |\n| **Updating factor** | ***1,2*** | ***1,2*** | ***1,2*** | ***1,1*** | ***1,1*** | ***1,0*** | ***1,0*** | ***1,0*** | ***1,0*** | ***1,0*** | ***1,0*** | ***1,0*** |\n| **Damages to Hochtief: USD 4,7 M** |\n\nOn this analysis, Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky pointed out that the maximum recoverable damages as of the date of the Decision on Liability would be US$4.7 million.91 However, they went further and asserted that in arriving at that figure one would have to overlook the fact that Compass Lexecon adjusted certain interest rates for monies owing in what they had labelled as \"Junior Debt\", noting in this regard that if the 15% interest rate that was set in the Hochtief and Impregilo inter-company loans was employed, the damage valuation would be *zero* because PdL would still have been paying off debt as of the date of the Decision on Liability.92 They also asserted that the income tax rate was adjusted as well in order to achieve the results.93 This was also presented in the form of another table:94\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Analysis of CLEX's model (15% rate)** | **2003** | **2004** | **2005** | **2006** | **2007** | **2008** | **2009** | **2010** | **2011** | **2012** | **2013** | **2014 I** |\n| **Free cash flow to PdL** | **(15,2)** | ***(28,7)*** | ***14,4*** | ***14,8*** | ***18,3*** | **19,6** | ***18,5*** | ***18,5*** | ***18,7*** | ***18,6*** | ***17,3*** | ***13,3*** |\n| **(-) Debt (year start)** | ***30,6*** | ***52,3*** | ***88,7*** | ***87,3*** | ***85,6*** | ***80,1*** | ***72,5*** | ***64,9*** | ***56,1*** | ***45,9*** | ***34,2*** | ***22,0*** |\n| **(-) Financial Aid Agreement Interest** | ***1,9*** | ***1,7*** | ***0,7*** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **(-) Intercompany Loan Interest** | ***4,6*** | ***6,1*** | ***12,2*** | ***13,1*** | ***12,8*** | ***12,0*** | ***10,9*** | ***9,7*** | ***8,4*** | ***6,9*** | ***5,1*** | ***3,3*** |\n| **Debt (year end)** | ***52,3*** | ***88,7*** | ***87,3*** | ***85,6*** | ***80,1*** | ***72,5*** | ***64,9*** | ***56,1*** | ***45,9*** | ***34,2*** | ***22,0*** | ***12,0*** |\n| **PdL equity valuation** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Value to Hochtief AG (26%)** |  | ***-*** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | - |  |  |\n| **Updating factor** | **1,2** | **1,2** | **1,2** | **1,1** | **1,1** | **1,0** | **1,0** | **1,0** | **1,0** | **1,0** | **l,o** | **1,0** |\n|  | **Damages to Hochtief: USD 0** |\n\nMessrs.Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, p.10.\n\nMessrs.Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, para. 26.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the evidence of Mr Roberto Lamdany, Head of the Transportation Technical Team from the Unit of Renegotiation and Analysis of Public Utility Contracts (UNIREN): \"The company\u2019s Financial Statements as of 31 December 2001 show paid-up capital in the amount of ARS 43,650,000 and shareholders\u2019 loans for ARS 15,030,466 at an annual rate of 15%. Irrespective of the exorbitant rate accepted for an inter-company loan in US dollars (Libor rate as of 29 December 2000 ranged from 6,6325% to 5,9646% for a term of 30 and 360 days), it was clear that the shareholders were not willing to pay up capital for ARS 59,039,000, as announced in the Financial Statements for the prior year. Consequently the company recorded financial losses, which then resulted in difficulties for the renegotiation process.\" [Lamdany Witness Statement, 7 March 2012, para. 29],\n\nMessrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, para. 28: it is observed that the calculations performed in the two tables displayed above did not correct an income tax calculation \"inconsistency\" found in Sheet \"IV. 2. But-For Cash Flows 03-13\" and discussed at para. 22 of the same Comment.\n\nMessrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s 30 November 2015 Comment, p. 11.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined LECG\u2019s and Compass Lexecon\u2019s treatment of the interest rate charged in the inter-company loans made by Hochtief. In the reports prepared prior to the Decision on Liability, the experts uniformly used the loan rate stipulated in the loan agreements themselves, *i.e.,* 15%.95\n\nSee the LECG Report of 29 April 2010, at paras. 65 and 136 and footnotes 38, 42, 53, and 105, and the Compass Lexecon Report of 5 June 2012, at paras. 62-66 and 105.\n\n91.\n\nYet, as Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky correctly point out, this changes in CLEX-042. In barely readable grey font Compass Lexecon added:\n\n*Note: After 2005, once senior debt (FAA) is fully repaid, PdL's loan rate on junior debt equals benchmark corporate bonds in local market 2006-2009: CLEX-001 sheet \"WACC\"*  \n*2014: CLEX-042, sheet \"II.3. WACC\"*\n\n92.\n\nPut in larger clearer font, this states: \"Note: after 2005, once senior debt (FAA) is fully paid, PdL\u2019s loan rate on junior debt equals benchmark corporate bonds in local market 2006-2009; CLEX-001, sheet \u2018WACC\u2019, 2014: CLEX-042, sheet \u2018II.3, WACC\u2019\".\n\n93.\n\nIndeed, the interest rates for inter-company debt drop in Compass Lexecon\u2019s 17 June 2015 Report from 15% starting in the year 2006 (10.72%) and continue a downward trend culminating in a rate of 8.76% in 2013:\n\n**10.72% 10.30% 9.83% 9.55% 9.35% 9.16% 8.96% 8.76% 8.57%**\n\n94.\n\nThis is at odds with Compass Lexecon\u2019s prior work. In its report filed with the Reply Compass Lexecon\u2019s Table IV consistently listed the inter-company loan rates through to 2010 (listed under the heading \"Subordinated\") at 15% as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table IV.

The effect can only be to reduce the amount of debt payments outstanding at the end of each year such that the worksheets would show that PdL repaid its debt in the *\u2018but-for'* world in 2013 and would eke out a small dividend distribution to Hochtief of US$1.2 million and US$3.5 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively.96\n\nLECG Report of 29 April 2010, footnote 38: \"The loans granted by Hochtief to PdL were denominated in US Dollars and accrued interest at a nominal interest rate of 15% per year. The I/C loans granted by Hochtief in 2001 had a 1-year renewable term. Hochtief s I/C loans granted since 2002 had an average maturity date of 1.3 years, and were also renewable. Both principal and interests were due at maturity.\"\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal is inclined to accept Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s view that had the proper interest rates been employed by Compass Lexecon, the resulting analysis would show that\u2014leaving aside the discounted value of any losses arising after 26 August 2014, which are considered below\u2014no damages were suffered by Hochtief up to the Concession Contract\u2019s termination.\n\n97.\n\nLECG\u2019s original estimate of the equity value of Hochtief s shareholding as of 31 December 2009 provides another check on the expert analysis done after the Decision on Liability. It will be recalled from paragraph 77 of the LECG Report quoted above at paragraph 85, that LECG estimated Hochtief s total loss in the value of its equity, projected to the end of the Concession, as being US$20.4 million. But that estimate assumed that Hochtief would also receive compensation for losses associated with the loans. Since that has not occurred and it has taken some seven years longer to pay off the loans in the *\u2018but-for\u2019* scenario, with nine years remaining before expiry, it might be expected that the net present value of the dividend stream would be somewhat smaller than LECG\u2019s estimated US$18.1 million for a 13-year period running from 2009 (brought forward with interest). Yet Dr. Abdala has estimated the *but-for* value of Hochtief s interest in PdL to be US$20,2 million for a 9-year period as of August 2014.97\n\nCompass Lexecon\u2019s Report dated 17 June 2015, Table 1.\n\n98.\n\nHowever, this is not the end of the matter, for the reasons previously explained above, because even on Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky\u2019s analysis, by the end of 2014 PdL would have been cash flow positive and able to pay dividends to its shareholders. This was made clear in their report of 2 May 2016 which, among other things, computed PdL\u2019s value from 27 August 2014 to 14 September 2023.\n\n99.\n\nWhile Messrs. Sandleris and Schargrodsky still adhered to their position that using a properly dollarized *\u2018but-for\u2019* analysis there would be no damages for renegotiation delays up to 26 August 2014, and that the claimed US$4 million for Resolution 14 damages was not made out, they agreed that PdL had a positive value for the balance of the Concession Contract\u2019s life.98 In their view, Claimant\u2019s 26% interest in PdL as of 29 December 2014 amounted to US$8.94 million.\n\nSandleris and Schargrodsky Updated Damages Mode, 2 May 2016, paras. 33-36.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal has studied the submissions of the Parties and their experts, and considers that the most reasonable estimate of Claimant\u2019s loss is higher than that accepted by Respondent\u2019s experts but some way short of the US$20.2 million estimated by Claimant. Having regard to the expert evidence, the Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to an award of US$l3.4lmillion for the diminution in the value of its shareholding in PdL caused by Respondent\u2019s breach of the Treaty.\n\n101.\n\nThere is one remaining head of damages claimed, the losses said to be associated with the Resolution 14 breach. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, just as the financial damages caused by non-attributable factors are addressed by the Tribunal\u2019s instructions in its Decision, any alleged damage said to flow from Resolution 14 would be subsumed in the analysis dictated by the Decision\u2019s general requirement that all revenues, costs and liabilities be dollarized. That is, in the *\u2018but-for\u2019* scenario posited by the Tribunal, the operation and maintenance costs would never have been pesified in the first place and since they are assumed to be in dollars, the Concession would, in this respect, operate as per the Concession Contract. Therefore, the claim for US$4 million is rejected.\n\n102.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal decides that Respondent must pay Claimant USD US$13.41 million, plus interest running from 29 December 2014 at the rate for one-year US Treasury Bills.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the question of the allocation of the costs arising from this phase of the proceedings. The costs in this phase arose initially from the inability of the Parties to agree upon the precise amount of compensation due in accordance with the instructions of the Tribunal in its Decision on Liability dated 29 December 2014, and from the investigation of the implications in this context of the termination of the Concession Contract on 26 August 2014, which neither Party had brought to the attention of the Tribunal before it delivered its Decision on Liability. Additional work was also required as a result of the departures by Claimant\u2019s expert, noted above, from the instructions issued by the Tribunal. The Tribunal decides that in these circumstances it is appropriate that Claimant should contribute US$200,000 towards Respondent\u2019s costs arising from this phase of the proceedings. The order for costs arising from earlier phases of these proceedings, set out in paragraph 336.i of the Decision on Liability dated 29 December 2014, stands and is not affected by this decision.\n\n**VII. AWARD**\n--------------\n\n104.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, and the reasons stated in its Decision on Jurisdiction dated 24 October 2011 and the Separate and Dissenting Opinion of Mr. J.
