At all material times CDC has been, and continues to be, a national of the United Kingdom.\n\n2.\n\nRespondent is the Republic of the Seychelles (\"the Republic\").\n\n**II JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe dispute between the parties arises out of two agreements which are the subject of these proceedings.\n\n(i) an agreement dated November 6, 1990 between CDC and the Government of the Republic (the \"1990 Guarantee\"); and\n\n(ii) an agreement dated March 17, 1993 between CDC and the Government of the Republic (the \"1993 Guarantee\").\n\n4.\n\nEach Guarantee contains the following provisions:\n\n\"6.1 The Government [defined as the Government of the Republic of the Seychelles] and CDC hereby consent and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes all disputes between them arising out of this Agreement for settlement by arbitration pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and the Nationals of Other States (hereinafter called 'The Convention') and the parties recognise that CDC is a 'National of another Contracting State' for the purposes of Article 25 of the Convention.\n\n6.2 Arbitration proceedings following a submission under this Section shall, if the appropriate arrangements can be made and agreements secured pursuant to Article 63 of the Convention, be held in London, England.\n\n6.3 The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes shall been entitled to publish the award rendered by, as well as the minutes and other records of, the arbitral tribunal constituted following any submission under this Section.\"\n\n5.\n\nBoth the United Kingdom (of which CDC is a national) and the Republic of the Seychelles are Contracting States to the ICSID Convention. The ICSID Convention entered into force in the United Kingdom on January 18, 1967 and in the Republic of the Seychelles on April 19, 1978.\n\n6.\n\nAs the Republic ultimately withdrew its objection to jurisdiction (see paras 19 and 34 below) and did not contest the Tribunal's jurisdiction at the oral hearing, I find that the conditions in art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention have been fulfilled and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to arbitrate this dispute.\n\n**III THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------\n\n7.\n\nCDC claims that the Republic is in breach of its obligations under the Guarantees.\n\n8.\n\nCDC claims:\n\n(i) Under the 1990 Guarantee, the Republic guaranteed to CDC punctual payment of all principal monies and interest becoming due and payable by Public Utilities Corporation (\"PUC\"), a statutory corporation incorporated in the Republic of the Seychelles, to CDC under a Loan Agreement between PUC and CDC dated September 20, 1990 (as amended by letters dated January, 10 1991 and July 3, 1992) together the \"1990 Loan Agreement\". By that Agreement CDC agreed to lend \u00a3450,000 to PUC.\n\n(ii) Under the 1993 Guarantee, the Republic guaranteed to CDC the due and punctual payment of all principal monies and interest becoming due and payable by PUC to CDC under a Loan Agreement between PUC and CDC dated February 5, 1993 (as amended and re-scheduled by an amending and re-scheduling Agreement dated January 25, 1996) (together the \"1993 Loan Agreement\"). By the 1993 Loan Agreement, CDC agreed to lend \u00a31,800,000 to PUC.\n\n(iii) PUC is in default of its obligations to CDC under the 1990 Loan Agreement and the 1993 Loan Agreement (together the \"Loan Agreements\") in the manner specified in CDC's letter to the Republic dated January 2, 2002 (to which was attached CDC's letter to PUC dated December 17, 2001 on the same subject).\n\n(iv) The Republic has failed to meet CDC's demands for the Republic to honour the Republic's obligations under the Guarantees.\n\n9.\n\nCDC claims that the total amount due and owing to CDC under the Loan Agreements as at December 4, 2001 was \u00a32,103,379.32.\n\n10.\n\nCDC has sought resolution of the dispute and payment of its claims over a long time.\n\n**IV PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n11.\n\nCDC lodged with ICSID its request for arbitration dated August 22, 2002, as supplemented by its letter of October 17, 2002, of its dispute with the Republic.\n\n12.\n\nOn November 7, 2002, pursuant to Art. 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States and Rules 6(1)(a) and 7(a) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration proceedings, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the request in the Arbitration Register. A certificate of registration was issued on the same day and the parties were invited to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nPursuant to Rule 2 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, CDC proposed and the Republic agreed to the Secretary-General of ICSID appointing a Sole Arbitrator.\n\n14.\n\nOn 19 December 2002 I accepted appointment by the Secretary-General as Sole Arbitrator. The Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that day. The Secretary-General informed the parties on the same day that Ms Martina Polasek, Counsel, ICSID would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held, with the parties' agreement, in Sydney, Australia, on February 10, 2003. The parties confirmed that they had no objection to the proper constitution of the Tribunal. It was agreed that, in accordance with the contractual provisions between the parties, the place of proceeding be London, without prejudice to the Sole Arbitrator holding sessions with the parties at any other venue as may be convenient, after consultation with the parties.\n\n16.\n\nIt was agreed that CDC's request for arbitration be treated as its Memorial on the merits. The parties agreed on the following timetable:\n\n(i) the Republic to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits and any objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by Monday, March 24, 2003.\n\n(ii) CDC to file a Reply by Thursday, April 17, 2003; and\n\n(iii) the Republic to file a Rejoinder by Thursday, May 15, 2003.\n\nThe parties agreed with the Sole Arbitrator's proposal that a hearing on the merits and jurisdiction be held in London on July 22-23, 2003.\n\n**V CDC'S INVESTMENTS IN THE SEYCHELLES**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nCDC's activities are commercial in substance and nature. CDC's investments in the Seychelles related to the expansion of the capacity of the Baie Ste Anne Power Station on the Island of Praslin and the upgrading of Victoria A Power Station on the Island of Mah\u00e9. These investments were made on a commercial basis.\n\n18.\n\nCDC claims that each of the Loan Agreements and each of the Guarantees amount to an \"investment\" within the meaning of Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention which provides that\n\n\"[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\".\n\n19.\n\nAlthough the Republic initially contested CDC's claim that the Loan Agreements and Guarantees were \"investments\" within the meaning of Art. 25(1), the Republic subsequently withdrew its objection to jurisdiction at the oral hearing which took place on 22-23 July 2003.\n\n**VI RELIEF SOUGHT BY CDC**\n---------------------------\n\n20.\n\nBy its Request for Arbitration, CDC sought from the Arbitral Tribunal an award including:\n\n(i) an order that the Republic shall pay to CDC the sum of \u00a32,103,379.32 being the total amount due and owing to CDC under the Guarantees as at 4 December 2001;\n\n(ii) an order that the Republic shall pay to CDC the further amounts due and owing to CDC under the Loan Agreements (and, hence, the Guarantees) from 5 December 2001 to the date of the Award (as to which CDC will provide calculations and such further evidence as is necessary, in the course of the proceedings);\n\n(iii) an order that the Republic shall make payment to CDC of all legal and other expenses incurred by CDC in connection with this arbitration, including fees and expenses of its counsel and its solicitors, fees and expenses of ICSID, fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and any other expenses howsoever incurred in connection with this arbitration; and\n\n(iv) an order for such further or other relief as to the Arbitral Tribunal seem just or appropriate.\n\n**VII WRITTEN PROCEDURE AND EVENTS PRECEDING ORAL HEARING**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nBy its Counter-Memorial dated March 17, 2003, the Republic objected under Rule 41 of the Arbitration Rules read with Art. 25 of the Convention that the legal dispute, if any, between the parties was not one \"arising directly out of an investment\" between CDC and the Republic, as the investments were with PUC and not the Republic and the guarantees were not an investment within the meaning of Art. 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n22.\n\nBy its Counter-Memorial, the Republic further pleaded that, by reason of the poor performance and ultimate abandonment of the 4MW gas turbine generator purchased under the 1993 Loan Agreement relating to the Victoria A Power Station in the Island of Mah\u00e9, the capacity of PUC to supply electricity to its customers from 1994 to 1999 was severely affected and resulted in widespread disruption to the economy and loss of revenue to PUC and the Republic. The cost of the gas turbine generator and the cost of its replacement by four mobile generator sets had a drastic effect on the Republic's foreign exchange reserves and affected its ability to meet its commitment under the 1993 Guarantee. The Counter-Memorial did not contest the enforceability of the 1990 Loan Agreement and Guarantee relating to the Baie Ste Anne project.\n\n23.\n\nThe Republic also pleaded that the project set out in Schedule 1 to the 1993 Loan Agreement was \"thoroughly appraised by\" CDC and that the clause in the Guarantee which makes the guarantee unconditional was \"an unfair contract term in view of the circumstances of the case and the emerging jurisprudence in relation to International Trade and Investments between developed and developing countries\".1\n\np. 4 of the Counter-Memorial\n\n24.\n\nThe Republic therefore sought dismissal of the claim on the basis of its objection to jurisdiction and, if not, dismissal of the claim on the ground that CDC should bear its share of the responsibility for the failure of the project and the consequential damage to the Seychelles economy.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated March 26, 2003, to the Tribunal, CDC's solicitors requested that the Tribunal suspend the procedural calendar agreed on at the first session and instead convene an early meeting of the parties to address the Republic's objection to jurisdiction and the Republic's defence on the merits. According to CDC's solicitors, the objection to jurisdiction was unarguable and the defence on the merits was without substance because there was no contractual obligation which imposed any responsibility on CDC for the success of the project. The facts pleaded by the Republic constituted no defence in law, so CDC's solicitors contended.\n\n26.\n\nBy a Decision dated April 17, 2003, the Tribunal ruled that the Republic's Counter-Memorial did not comply with the directions given by the Tribunal at its first session in that it was not accompanied by written statements of witnesses and expert reports on which the Republic intended to rely. The Tribunal ordered the Republic to provide promptly such statements and reports.\n\n27.\n\nBy the Decision, the Tribunal also ruled that the parties should have a further opportunity to address submissions on the question whether there should be a preliminary hearing to determine the questions of law and gave the Republic an opportunity to present further submissions to show that why its defence on the merits was a good defence in law.\n\n28.\n\nBy its Reply dated April 17, 2003, CDC submitted that the Republic's objection to jurisdiction was misconceived and that the Republic's failure to comply with the directions given at its first sessions prevented CDC from presenting a Reply that fully complied with those directions. Nevertheless the CDC's Reply presented arguments why the Republic's defence on the merits was not a good defence in law and contended that CDC should not be required to present an answer on the facts to this defence when the Republic failed to comply with the Tribunal's directions as to witness statements and expert reports.\n\n29.\n\nBy its Rejoinder dated May 13, 2003, the Republic re-stated its objection to jurisdiction and its defence on the merits. As to the defence on the merits, the Rejoinder stated:\n\n\"The Respondent would be relying for its defence on the principles of equity, contractual fairness, inequality of bargaining power, contributory negligence and the emerging jurisprudence in relation to international trade and investments between developed and developing countries.\"2\n\np. 4 of the Rejoinder\n\n30.\n\nAs to CDC's request for a preliminary hearing, the Rejoinder stated:\n\n\"The Respondent has no objection to a preliminary hearing in London on the 22nd and 23rd of July 2003 on the two issues raised by the Claimant in its letter dated 26th March 2003 and depending on the determination to be made at such hearing proceeding to a hearing on the merits on a subsequent date to be agreed by the parties and the sole arbitrator.\"3\n\n*Id.*\n\n31.\n\nHaving considered the pleadings and further correspondence between the parties and the Tribunal, the Tribunal, on June 5, 2003, issued its Second Decision, directing that a preliminary hearing be held in London on July 22-23, 2003 to determine the Republic's objection to jurisdiction and whether the Republic's defence on the merits is capable of constituting a defence in law to CDC's claim or is otherwise capable of providing a basis in law for the Tribunal to order the Republic to pay a reduced sum in satisfaction of CDC's claims. The Tribunal stated that, if the parties wished to have both questions and the hearing on the merits dealt with on July 22-23, 2003, the Tribunal was prepared to deal with the matter on that basis.\n\n32.\n\nBy its Second Decision, the Tribunal directed the Republic to provide full and detailed particulars of \" 'the principles of equity, contractual fairness, inequality of bargaining, contributory negligence and the emerging jurisprudence in relation to international trade and investment between developed and developing countries' on which it proposes to rely at the preliminary hearing both by way of defence and by way of reduction of the amount to be awarded in satisfaction of Claimant's claim.\"\n\n33.\n\nBy its Addendum to the Rejoinder, the Republic sought to provide the particulars required in para. 30. The Addendum alleged that the Republic\n\n\"gave an unconditional guarantee to the Claimant in view of the representation made by the Claimant to the Respondent that they made a thorough appraisal of the project proposals in connection with the loan that was granted to PUC. It implied that the 4 MW gas turbine generator being purchased from the loan would be suitable and viable for PUC\".4\n\nThis was the first specific mention in the pleadings of a case based on misrepresentation. The Addendum went on to allege that the representation was an unambiguous representation of fact which the Republic was intended to act upon and did act upon to its detriment. The Addendum further alleged that CDC owed the Republic and PUC a duty to take reasonable care that the representation was accurate knowing that the Republic would act upon it in view of the fact that the knowledge of PUC and the Republic of this type of generator was extremely limited. The Addendum also alleged that the facts gave rise to a situation of inequality of bargaining power.\n\np. 1 of the Addendum to the Rejoinder\n\n**VIII THE ORAL HEARING**\n-------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe oral hearing took place in London on July 22 and 23, 2003. The oral hearing was confined to the second of the two questions of law, the Republic having indicated that it wished to call witnesses to substantiate its defence on the merits. The Republic had indicated shortly before the oral hearing that it withdrew its objection to jurisdiction. The Republic called three witnesses. CDC called no witnesses as the question for determination was whether the Republic's defence on the merits was capable of constituting a good defence in law. CDC reserved its right to call witnesses at a hearing on the merits, should such a hearing prove necessary.\n\n35.\n\nThe first witness was Mr Morin, an electrical engineer, who is the managing director of PUC and had worked with PUC since 1973. He was a member of the PUC negotiating team that dealt with CDC in relation to the 1993 Loan Agreement and Guarantee. He was the only witness who participated in those negotiations. He gave evidence that PUC requested CDC to fund the Victoria A power project involving the installation of a gas turbine. In connection with that application, PUC prepared and delivered to CDC an analysis of the project. Mr Morin said that a sum of \u00a322,500, being 1.25% of the amount of the loan, was paid to CDC to make an analysis of the project.\n\n36.\n\nAccording to Mr Morin, PUC and its engineers had no experience of gas turbine generators. They did not engage expert consultants. CDC and its engineers had more experience in power turbine technology than PUC. PUC relied on CDC as PUC did not have the resources to engage independent consultants. Mr Morin said that if CDC had not done an appraisal of the project, PUC would not have bought the turbine from EGT. He described CDC variously as a \"partner\", \"assessor\" and \"adviser\" in relation to the project. He also stated that PUC and CDC were unequal in bargaining power, CDC being well resourced while PUC was under-resourced and desperately in need of additional power generation to satisfy the growing demand for power in the Seychelles.\n\n37.\n\nMr Morin then stated that the gas plant never operated properly, that it was plagued with numerous problems, that it was not used after 1999 and was replaced by four small generator sets at substantial extra cost. The breakdown and the incapacity of the plant had a very significant adverse impact on the tourist industry and was detrimental to the Seychelles economy. When asked whether there was anything about the loan which was unfair or unreasonable, leaving aside the problems with the turbine, Mr Morin's answer was \"No\".\n\n38.\n\nMr Morin has never seen an appraisal of the project by CDC. No such appraisal was produced by the Republic at the hearing, nor has anyone seen a copy of a CDC appraisal of the project in PUC files. In fact, Mr Morin did not know whether CDC made an appraisal or not. In cross-examination, Mr Morin was asked\n\n\"\u2026 are you saying one of them\" [officers of CDC] said to one of you that they were appraising the project in terms of its suitability or viability, or did they merely tell [you] that they were conducting their own assessment of the project?\"\n\nHis answer was\n\n\"They were conducting their own assessment of the project.\"\n\nHe was then asked\n\n\"Other than to subsequently grant the loan, was there any indication from CDC as to the outcome of its own assessment of the project?\"\n\nHis answer was \"No\" but he went on to say that the contract stated that they were going to carry out an appraisal of viability (which it did not) and that PUC thought that CDC would have told us if they considered the project was not viable. He referred to the earlier relationship of partner and adviser assumed by CDC.\n\n39.\n\nMr Morin said that he was not aware that PUC had ever made a claim against CDC in connection with the project before CDC made its request for arbitration. He also said that PUC had not taken action against EGT, the supplier of the gas turbine, on account of the expense involved. It seems that PUC had decided on a gas turbine, though not an EGT turbine, before PUC sought finance from CDC. Mr Morin stated in reexamination that CDC had \"not directly\" ever represented to PUC the quality and suitability of the turbine. He was not aware that it had ever been asked to do so.\n\n40.\n\nThe Republic's second witness was Mr Francis Chang-Leng, Governor of the Central Bank of the Seychelles and the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Finance. He has been working for the Ministry since 1991. He gave evidence of other earlier projects in which the Republic and CDC had been involved, including the Reef Hotel in which they were partners. He said that the Republic relied on CDC's appraisal of the Baie St Anne and the Victoria A projects. He regarded the relationship between the Republic and CDC as one of partnership in relation to the two projects and as one to be distinguished from the ordinary relationship between a borrower and a bank. Like Mr Morin, Mr Chang-Leng relied on the fact that CDC had appraised the Victoria A project and would not have proceeded with it but for CDC's appraisal. He gave evidence of the loss suffered by PUC and the Republic in consequence of the flawed performance of the gas turbine.\n\n41.\n\nIn cross-examination, Mr Chang-Leng admitted that he had no involvement in the negotiation of the 1992 Loan Agreement with CDC and that he was relying on the antecedent general relationship between the parties in expecting CDC to carry out due diligence on the project and an appraisal for viability.\n\n42.\n\nThe Republic's third witness was Mr JG Dilliway, an engineer with experience as a specialist power consultant. Mr Dilliway considered that a gas turbine, particularly a liquid fuel gas turbine of the type supplied by EGT, was unsuitable for the Seychelles. It was an unproven type of turbine when supplied and it required clean quality fuel and back up which PUC was not in a provision to provide. He was surprised that CDC had made a favourable appraisal. Had he been in CDC's position, he would not have approved the loan because he would have regarded the project as \"high risk\" because the turbine was \"first off\" and the implementation of the project involved difficulties. Mr Dilliway had discussions with PUC and EGT from 1996 onwards in an endeavour to resolve difficulties when PUC complained that the turbine was poorly designed and deficient and EGT complained that the problems were due to poor fuel and inadequate maintenance. There was substance, he thought, in the complaints made by each party. He was, however, in no doubt that the EGT turbine was not the right equipment for the Seychelles.\n\n**IX THE APPLICABLE LAW**\n-------------------------\n\n43.\n\nClause 7.8 of the Amending and Rescheduling Agreement provides:\n\n\"This Agreement and its performance shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of England \u2026\"\n\nAlthough the Republic made reference in its Rejoinder to\n\n\"the emerging jurisprudence in relation to international trade and investments between developed and developing countries\",\n\nno argument based in such jurisprudence was presented to the Tribunal. The submissions presented by the parties proceeded on the footing that CDC's claim was to be resolved in accordance with English law.\n\n**X THE REPUBLIC'S CASE THAT CDC REPRESENTED THAT THE PROJECT WAS VIABLE AND SUITABLE**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Republic's first submission is that there was an implied representation by CDC to both PUC and the Republic arising from the appraisal which it carried out of the Victoria A project that the project as well as the product (the EGT gas turbine) was suitable and viable for PUC. It is not in dispute that CDC conducted an appraisal. The Republic says that CDC was paid \u00a322,500 for doing so in accordance with cl. 15(1) of the 1993 Loan Agreement.\n\n45.\n\nAccording to counsel for the Republic, the implied representation arises from the following circumstances:\n\n(1) that the making of the loan application by PUC to CDC, accompanied by PUC's analysis of the project;\n\n(2) the making of an appraisal by CDC;\n\n(3) the charging of a fee under cl. 15(1);\n\n(4) the approval by CDC of the loan; and\n\n(5) the inference to be drawn from the communication of that approval that the appraisal was that the project was suitable and viable for PUC.\n\n46.\n\nClause 15(1) appears under the heading \" SECTION 15 - NEGOTIATION FEE \" and is in these terms:\n\n\"15.1 By way of recompense for the time spent and expenses incurred by CDC in considering proposals for the Project and in negotiating the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the Borrower shall within thirty days after the date hereof or, if earlier, upon the making of the first advance by CDC hereunder pay to CDC twenty-two thousand five hundred pounds sterling (\u00a322,500).\"\n\n47.\n\nClause 15(1) makes no mention of CDC making an appraisal of the project. The clause imposes no obligation on CDC to make an appraisal for the benefit of PUC or the Republic or at all. The absence of such an obligation indicates that an appraisal, if it was to be made, was to be for the benefit of CDC so as to enable it to determine whether the loan proposal was a viable transaction from its perspective, not to determine whether the project was suitable and viable for PUC. As appears from cl. 15(1), the sum of \u00a322,500 was payable for time spent and expenses incurred by CDC in considering the proposals and in negotiating the terms and conditions of the 1993 Loan Agreement; in other words, to compensate CDC for the time and expense incurred in deciding whether it would make the loan which the Republic sought. The heading to the clause, in describing the charge as \"Negotiation Fee\", makes this clear. In this respect, the clause is consistent with the common practice of lenders in charging for time spent and expenses incurred in connection with the investigation and processing of applications for loans.\n\n48.\n\nWhether an appraisal was to be made was a matter for CDC to determine in its own interests. There is nothing in cl. 15(1) to suggest that the fee was charged for giving advice to PUC, let alone the Republic, or for giving advice on which either of them could rely. Nor is there anything in the clause or in the 1993 Loan Agreement to suggest that CDC was assuming the role of adviser, assessor or partner in relation to the loan or the Victoria A Power Station Project.\n\n49.\n\nNor is there any evidence that PUC or the Republic ever requested CDC to make an appraisal for their benefit or to enable PUC to decide whether it should proceed with the Victoria A project or to give advice in relation to the project. Likewise there is no evidence that CDC represented to PUC or the Republic that CDC would make an appraisal of the project for their benefit.\n\n50.\n\nIndeed, there is a remarkable absence of evidence on the subject of CDC making an appraisal or feasibility study of the project. There is no evidence that CDC delivered to the Republic a copy of such an appraisal or study or communicated the contents of an appraisal or study to the Republic. Absent evidence of this kind, there is no foundation for the implied representation on which the Republic relies.\n\n51.\n\nThe Republic has assumed, no doubt justifiably, that, in the ordinary course of considering the application for the loan, CDC made its own favourable assessment of the loan. The Republic then relied upon that assumed favourable assessment in proceeding with the project, purchasing the gas turbine and entering into the Loan Agreement and the Guarantee. But reliance without more does not establish that CDC made a representation of the kind alleged by the Republic.\n\n52.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between a lender making an appraisal or study of a project for its own purpose in deciding whether it will make a loan and making an appraisal or study of a project for the benefit of the borrower. Indeed, it would be unusual for a lender to make an appraisal or study for the benefit of the borrower.\n\n53.\n\nThe point was well made by Lord Millett in *National Commercial Bank (Jamaica) Ltd v Hew* [2003] UKPC Appeal No. 65 of 2002, 30 June 2003. His Lordship said (at para. 22):\n\n\"There is a useful illustration of the truism that the viability of a transaction may depend on the vantage point from which it is viewed; what is a viable loan may not be a viable borrowing. This is one reason why a borrower is not entitled to rely on the fact that the lender has chosen to lend him the money as evidence, still less as advice, that the lender thinks that the purpose for which the borrower intends to use it is sound.\"\n\n54.\n\nAlthough it was pleaded that CDC was aware that the Republic was relying upon its appraisal of the project, there was no evidence of CDC's awareness of that reliance or of any communication by PUC to CDC that PUC was relying on such an appraisal. And, accepting that a relationship of partner, associate, adviser existed at an earlier time between CDC and the Republic, the immediately antecedent transaction between the parties was the 1990 Loan Agreement and Guarantee. It was not suggested that it was other than a loan transaction.\n\n55.\n\nFinally, on this point, it is necessary to refer to cl. 17.8 of the 1993 Loan Agreement and cl. 2.4 of the 1993 Guarantee. Clause 17.8 provides:\n\n\"The obligations of the Borrower to pay punctually all moneys from time to time falling due by it in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement are absolute and shall be in no way impaired or affected by reason of any failure or delay on the part of CDC to assert or enforce any of its rights or by reason of failure of the purpose of this Agreement or of impossibility to carry out the Project or any part thereof or for any other reason.\"\n\nClause 2.4 provides:\n\n\"There are no representations, collateral agreements or conditions with respect to this guarantee and affecting the liability of the Government hereunder other than those contained herein.\"\n\nClause 17.8 makes it clear that PUC's obligations under the Loan Agreement to carry out its terms are absolute while cl. 2.4 undermines the basis on which the Republic seeks to establish an implied representation. A provision such as cl. 2.4 may be ineffective to exclude an express representation but its operation in excluding an implied representation, derived in part from provisions in the 1993 Loan Agreement and Guarantee, seems to be fair and reasonable.\n\n**XI THE REPUBLIC'S CASE THAT CDC OWED A DUTY OF CARE TO THE REPUBLIC AND WAS IN BREACH OF THAT DUTY OF CARE**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nOn the same facts, the Republic submits that CDC owed a duty of care to PUC and the Republic to make an accurate appraisal of the project and that CDC was in breach of its duty of care because its appraisal was negligently made. CDC's first answer to this submission is that a lender who makes an appraisal of the viability of a loan for its own purposes as lender owes no duty of care to the borrower to make in relation to that appraisal. Mr Jagusch for CDC points to Lord Griffiths' citation of passages from the judgment of Kerr LJ in *Smith v Bush* as support for this proposition (see *Smith v Bush* [1988] QB 835 at 851-852; affd. [1990] 1 AC 831 at 864). So much may be acknowledged.\n\n57.\n\nThe position may, however, well be different where the lender makes a representation to the borrower that the appraisal shows that the proposed transaction is viable and suitable for the borrower or it appears that the lender is aware that the borrower is relying on the vendor's appraisal for its own purposes. As pointed out earlier in these reasons, the evidence does not establish that such a representation was ever made or that PUC or the Republic was relying on CDC's appraisal for their own purposes. The other matters called in aid by the Republic alleged antecedent relationship between the parties (CDC being a partner, adviser or assessor) and the imbalance between the parties' resources and expertise are insufficient to generate a duty of care on the part of CDC in the light of the relationship established by the 1993 Loan Agreement, in the absence of a case, based on evidence, that CDC made a representation, express or implied, that the project was viable and suitable for the Republic's purposes as distinct from making an appraisal for CDC's own purposes.\n\n**XII THE REPUBLIC'S CASE THAT THERE WAS AN INEQUALITY OF BARGAINING POWER**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Republic seeks to bring the case within the concept of \"inequality of bargaining power\", as formulated by Lord Denning MR in *Lloyds Bank v Lundy* [1975] 1 QB 326 at 339. Lord Denning stated that English law gives relief to a person who,\n\n\"without independent advice enters into a contract upon terms which are very unfair or transfers property for a consideration which is grossly inadequate, when his bargaining power is grievously impaired by reason of his own needs or desires, pressures brought to bear on him by or for the benefit of the other\".\n\n59.\n\nIn *National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan* [1985] AC 686 at 708, Lord Denning's general proposition was disapproved. In any event, neither the Loan Agreement nor the Guarantee fall within this statement of principle. There is nothing unfair in the terms of the Loan Agreement or the Guarantee. The Republic suggests that the provision for an \"unconditional\" guarantee was unfair. In the light of the provisions of the 1993 Loan Agreement, the Guarantee and the evidence, the unconditional guarantee was an appropriate commercial term for the protection of the lender. There is no suggestion of pressure brought to bear by CDC for its own benefit. The initiative for the transaction came from the Republic which wanted funding for the gas turbine which it wished to buy for the project. CDC was accommodating the Republic's wishes or commercial terms. On the evidence, CDC was not seeking to induce the Republic to enter into an improvident transaction for CDC's benefit.\n\n60.\n\nIn any event, neither CDC nor the Republic has sought at any time to rescind the 1993 Loan Agreement and the Guarantee on the ground of inequality of bargaining power or on any other ground. Indeed, PUC and the Republic entered into the 1996 rescheduling Agreement with CDC after PUC and the Republic were well aware of the problems with the gas turbine.\n\n**XIII CONCLUSION**\n-------------------\n\n61.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defences raised by the Republic do not amount to a good defence to CDC's claim based on the Guarantees. There should, accordingly, be orders that the Republic do pay to CDC principal and interest owing under the Guarantees. It is not contested that the amount of principal due and owing under the Guarantees is \u00a31,771,096.75 (being \u00a3157,588.81 under the 1990 Loan Agreement and \u00a31,613,507.94 under the 1993 Loan Agreement) and that interest is payable under the Loan Agreements at the rate of 9% per annum. The Agreements also provide that interest shall accrue from day to day and shall be payable at half-yearly intervals on February 15 and August 25 each year and that interest due for any period of less than a year shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.\n\n**XIV INTEREST CALCULATION**\n----------------------------\n\n62.\n\nCDC asserts, without contradiction by the Republic, that from August 25, 2003 the amounts owing by the Republic are as follows:\n\nOutstanding amounts (\u00a3) Principal (\u00a3) **Interest (\u00a3)** Premium (\u00a3) Total (\u00a3)\n\n1990 Loan/Guarantee 157,588.81 **56,946.30** - 214,535.11\n\n1993 Loan Guarantee 1,613,507.94 **615,969.15** 2,689.18 2,232,166.27\n\nTotal \\_ 1,771,096.75 **672,915.45** 2,869.18 2,446,701.38\n\nFrom August 25, 2003 interest continues to accrue at the daily rates of \u00a353.63 per day and \u00a3557.37 per day on the 1990 Loan Agreement and Guarantee and the 1993 Loan Agreement and Guarantee respectively, making a total of \u00a3611.00 per day.\n\n**XV COSTS**\n------------\n\n63.\n\nCDC seeks indemnity costs in the sum of \u00a3124,295.15. The Republic disputes this amount on the ground that it is excessive. Pursuant to Art. 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, I assess the costs to be paid by the Republic to CDC in the sum of \u00a3100,000.\n\n**AWARD**\n---------\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Tribunal makes the following award:\n\n(1) an order that the Republic shall pay to CDC the sum of \u00a31,771,096.75 being the total amount of principal due and owing to CDC under the Guarantees;\n\n(2) an order that the Republic shall pay to CDC the sum of \u00a3672,915.45 being interest due and owing to CDC under the Guarantees until August 25, 2003;\n\n(3) an order that the Republic shall pay interest to CDC from August 25, 2003 down to the date of this award at the daily rate of \u00a3611;\n\n(4) a declaration that the Republic is and remains liable to pay interest to CDC on the terms stated in Section 5 of each of the 1990 Loan Agreement and the 1993 Loan Agreement until the date of payment of the principal amounts due thereunder;\n\n(5) an order that the Republic shall make payment to CDC of \u00a3100,000 representing legal fees and disbursements incurred by CDC in relation to these proceedings; and\n\n(6) an order that the Republic shall make payment to CDC of US$40,000 in reimbursement of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of the Centre which have been paid by CDC.\n\nDATED the 17th day of December 2003."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2005-06-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Award which this annulment proceeding reviews arose out of two Loan Agreements and two related sovereign Guarantees. The Respondent Republic of Seychelles (\"Republic\") agreed to guarantee timely performance of two loans Claimant CDC Group plc (\"CDC\") made to the Public Utilities Corporation (\"PUC\"), an entity organized in the Republic responsible for, *inter alia,* the generation of electric power. PUC did not timely perform its obligations to CDC, which then sought payment from the Republic under the Guarantees. When the Republic in turn failed to satisfy its assumed obligations under the Guarantees, CDC submitted a Request for Arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"). A Tribunal, consisting of a sole Arbitrator, Sir Anthony Mason AC KBE, heard the case and rendered an Award in favor of CDC.1 The Republic now seeks annulment of that Award under Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\" or \"Convention\"). The present *ad hoc* Committee was constituted pursuant to Article 52(3) of the Convention and has performed a number of functions assigned to it by the Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.2 For the reasons set forth hereinafter, we dismiss Republic of Seychelles\u2019 Application for Annulment of Award submitted 30 March 2004.3\n\nAward in *CDC Group plc v.

Republic of the Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14 (30 March 2004) (\"Application\").\n\n**II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nCDC is a public company incorporated under the Companies Act 1985 in England and Wales. It was founded in 1948 as the United Kingdom (\"UK\") governmental instrumentality for investing in developing countries. At the relevant times, CDC was wholly owned by the UK Government, but acted on a day-to-day basis without Government instruction or operational involvement.4 The Republic of Seychelles comprises an Indian Ocean archipelago, with a population of approximately 80,000 people. Throughout this arbitration, CDC has been represented by Mr. Stephen Jagusch and Mr. Anthony Sinclair of Allen & Overy, while the Republic has been represented by the Attorney-General of the Republic of Seychelles, Mr. A.F.T. Fernando, and his colleague Mr. Ronnie James Govinden.\n\nSince the commencement of this arbitration CDC has been restructured. Actis Capital LLP is the resulting entity owning the loans made by CDC to PUC and the Guarantees provided by the Republic. Actis Capital is 40% owned by the UK Government.\n\n3.\n\nThe record discloses that CDC and the Republic had had some dealings prior to negotiation of the two Loan Agreements and two Guarantees at issue in this case. No specific details of that antecedent relationship were adduced before the Tribunal, however, beyond the simple fact that CDC had been involved in a hotel project and at least one prior power generation project in the Republic.\n\n4.\n\nIn 1990 and 1993, CDC and PUC negotiated the two Loan Agreements, the proceeds of which were to finance improvements to the Republic\u2019s electric power generation infrastructure. Under the first agreement, dated 20 September 1990 and amended by letters of 10 January 1991 and 3 July 1992 (collectively, the \"1990 Loan Agreement\"), PUC borrowed \u00a3450,000. Pursuant to the second agreement, dated 5 February 1993 and amended and rescheduled by an agreement dated 25 January 1996 (collectively, the \"1993 Loan Agreement\"), PUC borrowed an additional \u00a31,800,000. Both Loan Agreements were conditioned on the Republic\u2019s agreement to guarantee PUC\u2019s performance thereof. This resulted in the two Guarantees, executed roughly contemporaneously with the Loan Agreements, the first dated 6 November 1990 (\"1990 Guarantee\") and the second dated 17 March 1993 (\"1993 Guarantee\"). Each Guarantee provided that any dispute arising under it between the Parties be referred to ICSID for arbitration. At no point in the process of this arbitration did the Republic contest its liability under the 1990 Guarantee. At issue therefore was only its liability under the 1993 Guarantee.\n\n5.\n\nThe Republic applied the proceeds of the 1993 Loan Agreement, at least in part, to the purchase of a gas turbine generator for its Victoria A power station from a company known as EGT. The Republic admits that it had approached CDC with the idea of purchasing a gas turbine generator. Both parties also agree, and the record clearly indicates, that that gas turbine generator project was not successful. What has been contested are the reasons for the project s failure, specifically, whether the EGT generator was generally unsuited for PUC\u2019s needs, as the Republic contends, or whether the failure resulted from problems arising from the manner of its use and maintenance, including the use of contaminated fuel, as CDC contends.\n\n6.\n\nUltimately, PUC failed timely to repay the principal and interest due under the Loan Agreements, in part, undoubtedly, because as a practical matter the problems with the project prevented it from generating the cash with which PUC had expected to finance such repayment. CDC thus demanded payment from the Republic under the Guarantees. When the Republic did not comply with such demand CDC filed its Request for Arbitration in this case (which also served as its Memorial before the Tribunal) on 22 August 2002 seeking an Award against the Republic. On 19 December 2002, a Tribunal, consisting of a sole Arbitrator, Sir Anthony Mason AC KBE, was constituted to hear the case. In its Counter-Memorial, submitted on 17 March 2003, the Republic claimed (1) that ICSID lacked jurisdiction over the dispute, and (2) that in any event its non-performance should be excused, or, alternatively that the amount of damages awarded to CDC should be reduced, because of CDC\u2019s wrongful conduct in connection with its decision to grant the 1993 loan, which resulted in substantial, but unspecified, financial losses on the part of the Republic. The specific legal grounds upon which the Republic has relied have taken various forms throughout the proceedings. Ultimately, however, the Republic alleged a misrepresentation, arising from CDC\u2019s approval of the 1993 loan, that the EGT gas turbine project was suitable and viable for PUC\u2019s needs at the Victoria A power station, and inequality of bargaining power between the Republic and CDC at the time the 1993 Loan Agreement and Guarantee were negotiated.5 It is the view of the Republic that CDC therefore should bear at least partial responsibility for the Republic\u2019s losses attributable to the project.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Republic objects to the 1993 Guarantee based on inequality of bargaining power (which includes the element of unfairness) but has made no such objection to the 1990 Guarantee, which, in substance, is virtually identical to the 1993 Guarantee.\n\n7.\n\nFollowing receipt of the Republic\u2019s Counter-Memorial,6 in which it had outlined the defenses on which it relied at that time, CDC proposed, via letter dated 26 March 2003, that the Tribunal hold a special, preliminary hearing to test two legal issues in the case: first, whether jurisdiction existed for ICSID to hear the parties\u2019 dispute, and second, whether or not any of the Republic\u2019s then-claimed defenses, if proven, was capable of constituting a good defense at law. CDC sought such a preliminary hearing in the hopes that if it were successful on both points it would avoid the additional costs of responding more fully to the Republic\u2019s defenses. In a letter dated 31 March 2003, the Republic opposed CDC\u2019s proposal, arguing that such a departure from what it described as normal ICSID arbitration procedure was unnecessary and inappropriate. CDC attempted to clarify its reasoning for the request in a letter of 7 April 2003, citing Article 44 of the Convention, which allows the parties to consent to any modification of the \"typical\" procedure. The Tribunal issued a Decision on 17 April 2003 in which it noted that the Republic had failed to submit all written witness statements with its Counter-Memorial as it had been directed to do in the Minutes of the first session and invited the Parties to provide additional argument on CDC\u2019s proposal. The Tribunal also pointed out that it could not render a decision on CDC\u2019s proposal until CDC filed its Reply Memorial outlining its response to the Republic\u2019s legal contentions. Although it was CDC\u2019s right not to submit its Reply Memorial until such time as the Republic had submitted all witness statements, which the Tribunal by its direction at the first session (and as reflected in the Minutes) had required to be submitted with the Republic\u2019s Counter-Memorial, CDC nevertheless proceeded to prepare its Reply Memorial, which coincidentally was also submitted on 17 April 2003.\n\nThe Counter-Memorial failed to include written statements from any Republic witnesses, except Mr. P.S.G. Morin, and to this extent did not comply with the Tribunal\u2019s directions at the first session of the Arbitral Tribunal, held in Sydney on February 10, 2003. *See* Minutes of the first session of the Arbitral Tribunal in *CDC Group plc* v. *Republic of Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14 (10 March 2003) (\"Minutes\"). The Minutes state that \"insofar as a party intends to rely on witnesses... those witnesses... shall be identified in any relevant pleading by that party and written statements... shall accompany such pleading.\" Upon receipt of the Counter-Memorial, CDC objected that the Republic had not supplied statements of all witnesses identified therein. The Republic responded by way of letter dated 22 April 2003 with a request for \"the indulgence of the Tribunal\" in which it asked to be given until 2 May 2003 to file witness statements of Mr. Graham Dilliway and Mrs. Danielle Polson. The letter stated that the Republic no longer intended to rely on the evidence of Mr. Francis Chang-Leng, who had been referred to in the Republic\u2019s Counter-Memorial. The Republic filed Mr. Dilliway\u2019s witness statement on 29 April 2003. A statement from Mrs. Polson was never filed. On 24 June 2003, the Republic requested permission to file the witness statement of Mr. Chang-Leng. CDC objected to Mr. Chang-Leng\u2019s witness statement because it was filed three months after witness statements were due and two months after CDC was informed that the Republic would not be relying on Mr. Chang-Leng\u2019s testimony, and it did not include any evidence upon which the Tribunal could base a decision. Thus, with respect to witness statements, only one statement, that of Mr. Morin, was filed in compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s direction at the first session, which was recorded in the Minutes. The witness statements of the additional two witnesses who gave oral evidence at the preliminary hearing, Mr. Dilliway and Mr. Chang-Leng, were submitted more than one and three months, respectively, after the deadline for their submission. The Tribunal nevertheless, extending itself to accommodate the Republic, allowed those two witnesses to testify at the preliminary hearing and considered their evidence.\n\n8.\n\nIn an attempt to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of 17 April 2003, the Republic submitted its Rejoinder Memorial on 13 May 2003 in which it developed the legal and equitable bases for its defense and formally consented to the preliminary hearing CDC had proposed: \"The Respondent has no objection to a preliminary hearing... on the two issues raised by the Claimant in its letter dated 26th March 2003 and depending on the determination to be made at such hearing proceeding to a hearing on the merits on a subsequent date to be agreed by the parties and the Tribunal.\" The Republic reiterated its consent to the preliminary hearing in a letter of 26 May 2003.\n\n9.\n\nWith the consent of the Parties in hand, the Tribunal on 5 June 2003 issued a Second Decision related to CDC\u2019s proposal and (in paragraph (1)) ordered that\n\nA preliminary hearing will be held to determine two questions, namely (i) Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction based on Article 25 of the ICSID Convention; and (ii) whether the defence pleaded by Respondent in its counter-memorial pages 6-11 (inclusive) is capable of constituting a defence in law to Claimant\u2019s claim or otherwise is capable of providing a basis in law for the Tribunal to order Respondent to pay Claimant a reduced sum in satisfaction of its claims.\n\nThe Tribunal further discussed the potential consequences of the preliminary hearing, noting that in the event that Claimant succeeds on the two questions set out in para. (1) above, an Award can be made in favour of Claimant.\" The Tribunal also stated that only in the situation where \"Claimant succeeds on question (i) in para. (1) but fails on question (ii), [will it be] necessary to fix a new date for the hearing on the merits.\" The stated rationale behind structuring the case in this way was the hope that the time and expense of a hearing on the merits, which would likely have involved the \"attendance of witnesses and the presentation of documentary evidence,\" might be avoided if legally unwarranted. Finally, the Tribunal directed the Republic to provide the particulars of the legal and equitable principles \"on which it proposes to rely at the preliminary hearing both by way of defence and by way of reduction of the amount to be awarded in satisfaction of Claimant\u2019s claim.\" Clarification was necessary because \"Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial is so generally expressed that it does not enable Claimant to know the legal basis of Respondent\u2019s case on this point.\" Clarification came, finally, in the Republic\u2019s Addendum to its Rejoinder Memorial, submitted 27 June 2003.\n\n10.\n\nThere then followed a discussion as to whether or not the preliminary hearing should actually be a full hearing on the merits as the Republic expressed a desire to present testimony from its witnesses at such a preliminary hearing. By its letter of 10 July 2003 the Republic wrote that the \"questions of law... is [sic] inextricably linked to the facts set out in the Counter Memorial... The Respondent suggests that at the commencement of the Respondent\u2019s case the testimony of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses be taken before legal arguments on the questions of law are heard.\" To this the Tribunal responded by directing, via letter from the Tribunal Secretary of 11 July 2003, that \"If the Respondent contends that the second question cannot be resolved without evidence, the Respondent should have available to give evidence its witnesses who can deal with that aspect of the case... Whether the Respondent\u2019s witnesses should give evidence before legal argument on the questions of law begins is a matter to be decided at the hearing.\"\n\n11.\n\nApproximately five days before the hearing, the Republic withdrew its objections to jurisdiction, leaving only the second legal question for resolution.7 Thus, after receiving written argument (consisting of CDC\u2019s Memorial, the Republic\u2019s Counter-Memorial, CDC\u2019s Reply Memorial, and the Republic\u2019s Rejoinder Memorial and Addendum thereto) and three witness statements the Tribunal was prepared to hear whether or not one or more of the Republic\u2019s claimed defenses amounted to a good defense at law.\n\nThe Republic\u2019s letter of 18 July 2003, which included this withdrawal, also addressed the procedure to be used at the preliminary hearing. The Republic reiterated its claim that \"its Defence on the merits could best be understood only after the evidence of its witnesses is placed before the Tribunal....\" The Republic then concluded its letter by stating that \"The Respondent wishes to place on record that the Respondent had not agreed for limiting the hearing to the two questions of law referred to in the Tribunal\u2019s decision of 5th June 2003,\" despite the fact that its letters of 13 May 2003 and 26 May 2003 had agreed to exactly that. Later on 18 July 2003, however, the Republic submitted another letter in which it stated that the aforementioned sentence was included as \"a result of an oversight\" and should be deleted.\n\n12.\n\nThe preliminary hearing was held in London on 22-23 July 2003. At the outset of the preliminary hearing, the Tribunal described its purpose: \"We now have one question only for decision, the jurisdiction question having disappeared.\" As will be discussed again later in this Decision, the Tribunal then turned to the question of whether or not the Tribunal needed to receive oral testimony at the preliminary hearing: \"The question arises as to how we should go about disposing of [the sole remaining legal question], which relates to the arguability of the respondent\u2019s defence on the merits. The respondent wants to call evidence in relation to that.\" As noted above, the Tribunal Secretary\u2019s letter of 11 July 2003 specifically had reserved this decision for the preliminary hearing. Initially at that hearing, the Tribunal wondered whether such testimony was necessary given the legal question at issue and the fact that the Republic finally had, as of 24 June 2003, completed its submission of comprehensive witness statements. The Republic reacted vigorously, arguing that it would be unfair for the Tribunal not to hear the testimony of its witnesses, who had traveled all the way from the Seychelles. The Tribunal ultimately agreed to receive the Republic\u2019s oral evidence at the preliminary hearing, which was given by Messrs. Morin, Chang-Leng and Dilliway.\n\n13.\n\nAt the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the Tribunal once again confirmed that both Parties understood the purpose and potential consequences of such hearing. The following segment of the transcript makes plain that both Parties did in fact understand that the case potentially could be disposed of based on the evidence and argument presented at that preliminary hearing:\n\nArbitrator: Now Mr. Fernando, you agree that in the event that I find that the evidence does not support the defences that you have raised, then that will lead to an award in favour of the claimant?\n\nMr. Fernando: Yes.\n\n\u2026\n\nArbitrator: So, both of you see that it is now a straightforward case of deciding whether or not the evidence supports defences that are valid defences in law to this claim?\n\nMr. Jagusch: Yes.8\n\nTranscript of Preliminary Hearing in *CDC Group plc* v. *Republic of Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14 at 134-35 (23 July 2003).\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the preliminary hearing and some post-hearing correspondence, the Tribunal issued its Award on 17 December 2003, concluding that the Republic\u2019s defenses did not amount to good defenses at law and ordering that the Republic pay to CDC the amounts owed under the Guarantees, including simple interest, as well as CDC\u2019s and ICSID\u2019s expenses and costs.9\n\nAward, *supra* note 1, at 22-23.\n\n15.\n\nThe Republic filed its Application for Annulment of Award (\"Application\") on 30 March 2004 (within the time limit provided in the Convention) arguing that the Tribunal manifestly had exceeded its powers, that it had seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based. Following registration of the Republic\u2019s Application 30 April 2004 this *ad hoc* Committee was duly constituted on 28 May 2004 with Judge Charles N. Brower as President of the Committee, Mr. Michael Hwang SC and Mr. David A.R. Williams QC as Members of the Committee, and Ms. Martina Polasek as Secretary of the Committee.10 Since constitution of the *ad hoc* Committee, Ms. Polasek has been replaced as Secretary of the Committee by Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu.\n\nLetter from Acting Secretary-General of ICSID in *CDC Group plc* v. *Republic of the Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14 at 1 (28 May 2004).\n\n16.\n\nOn 14 July 2004 this Committee issued a Decision and Order on the question of whether or not to continue the automatic stay of enforcement of the Tribunal\u2019s Award that had been in place pursuant to Article 52(5) of the Convention. Subsequently, after the submission of argument and affidavits, the Committee decided, and accordingly ordered on 14 July 2004, that the stay be terminated because the Republic had not provided the required security or a satisfactory explanation why such security should no longer be required.11\n\n*See generally* Decision, *supra* note 2.\n\n17.\n\nThe Republic submitted its Memorial on 28 July 2004. CDC submitted its Counter-Memorial on 11 October 2004. The Republic submitted its Reply Memorial on 5 November 2004.\n\n18.\n\nThe hearing on the Republic\u2019s Application was held on 17 and 18 January 2005 in London.\n\n**III. THE AWARD**\n------------------\n\n**A. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n19.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Award considered the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the dispute, concluding that jurisdiction existed because both of the Guarantees at issue in the case included an arbitration clause requiring that the Parties submit to ICSID any dispute arising under either Guarantee, both the UK and the Republic were Contracting States to the ICSID Convention, and the conditions in Article 25(1) of the Convention were fulfilled.12 As previously noted, the Republic, which initially had contested jurisdiction, withdrew such objection prior to the preliminary hearing.\n\nAward, *supra* note 1, at 2 para. 4.\n\n**B. The Arguments of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Award then turned to a discussion of the particulars of the dispute and the Parties\u2019 arguments on the merits. The Award noted with respect to CDC\u2019s contentions that:\n\nCDC claims that the Republic, is in breach of its obligations under the Guarantees. CDC claims:\n\n(i) Under the 1990 Guarantee, the Republic guaranteed to CDC punctual payment of all principal monies and interest becoming due and payable by Public Utilities Corporation (\"PUC\"), a statutory corporation incorporated in the Republic of the Seychelles, to CDC under a Loan Agreement between PUC and CDC dated September 20, 1990 (as amended by letters dated January, 10 1991 [sic] and July 3, 1992) together the \"1990 Loan Agreement.\" By that Agreement CDC agreed to lend \u00a3450,000 to PUC.\n\n(ii) Under the 1993 Guarantee, the Republic guaranteed to CDC the due and punctual payment of all principal monies and interest becoming due and payable by PUC to CDC under a Loan Agreement between PUC and CDC dated February 5, 1993 (as amended and re-scheduled by an amending and rescheduling Agreement dated January 25, 1996) (together the \"1993 Loan Agreement\"). By the 1993 Loan agreement, CDC agreed to lend \u00a31,800,000 to PUC.\n\n(iii) PUC is in default of its obligations to CDC under the 1990 Loan Agreement and the 1993 Loan Agreement (together the \"Loan Agreements\") in the manner specified in CDC\u2019s letter to the Republic dated January 2, 2002 (to which was attached CDC\u2019s letter to the Republic dated December 17, 2001 on the same subject).\n\n(iv) The Republic has failed to meet CDC\u2019s demands for the Republic to honour the Republic\u2019s obligations under the Guarantees.13\n\n*Id.* at 3-4 paras. 7-10.\n\n21.\n\nThe Award also described the relief sought by CDC in its Request for Arbitration:\n\n(i) an order that the Republic shall pay to CDC the sum of \u00a32,103,379.32 being the total amount due and owing to CDC under the Guarantees as at 4 December 2001;\n\n(ii) an order that the Republic shall pay to CDC the further amounts due and owing to CDC under the Loan Agreements (and, hence, the Guarantees) from 5 December 2001 to the date of the Award (as to which CDC will provide calculations and such further evidence as is necessary, in the course of the proceedings);\n\n(iii) an order that the Republic shall make payment to CDC of all legal and other expenses incurred by CDC in connection with this arbitration, including fees and expenses of its counsel and its solicitors, fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and any other expenses howsoever incurred in connection with this arbitration; and\n\n(iv) an order for such further or other relief as to the Arbitral Tribunal seem just or appropriate.14\n\n*Id.* at 6-7 para. 20.\n\n22.\n\nThe Award also recited the arguments made by the Republic in its defense. Primarily, the Republic argued, with respect to the 1993 Guarantee, that \"the poor performance and ultimate abandonment of the 4MW gas turbine generator purchased under the 1993 Loan Agreement\" affected the Republic\u2019s ability to perform its obligations under the 1993 Guarantee and had generally negative consequences for the Republic\u2019s economy.15 (As noted previously, the Republic\u2019s Counter-Memorial did not contest liability under the 1990 Guarantee.) The Republic argued that its non-performance under the 1993 Guarantee was excusable because CDC represented that it had \"thoroughly appraised\" the underlying project, and the Republic therefore sought dismissal of \"the claim on the ground that CDC should bear its share of the responsibility for the failure of the project and the consequential damage to the Seychelles economy.\"16 The Republic had stated, in its Rejoinder Memorial, that it \"would be relying for its defence on the principles of equity, contractual fairness, inequality of bargaining power, contributory negligence and the emerging jurisprudence in relation to international trade and investments between developed and developing countries.\" The Republic had not, however, in the opinion of the Tribunal, provided the \"full and detailed particulars\" of the principles \"on which it proposes to rely at the preliminary hearing both by way of defence and by way of reduction of the amount to be awarded in satisfaction of Claimant\u2019s claim.\" Accordingly, the Republic had submitted the Addendum to its Rejoinder on 27 June 2003 (just three and a half weeks before the preliminary hearing), wherein it alleged that its agreement to guarantee the loan was made in reliance on \"the representation made by [CDC] to the [Republic] that [CDC had] made a thorough appraisal of the project proposals in connection with the loan that was granted to PUC. [CDC] implied that the 4 MW gas turbine generator being purchased from the loan would be suitable and viable for PUC.\"17 The Award noted at this point in its rehearsal of the Republic\u2019s arguments that this Addendum was the first time in the pleadings that the Republic had appeared to base its defense on alleged misrepresentations by CDC on which CDC knew the Republic would rely. Additionally, the Republic had alleged in its Rejoinder Memorial that its non-performance should be excused because of inequality of bargaining power between it and CDC.\n\n*Id.* at 7 para. 22.\n\n*Id.* at 8 para. 24.\n\nId at 10 para. 33 (citing the Republic\u2019s Addendum to its Rejoinder at para. 30).\n\n**C. The Preliminary Hearing**\n------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Award next describes the 22-23 July 2003 preliminary hearing held in London. The Republic called three witnesses (CDC called none); The Managing Director of PUC, Mr. P.S.G. Morin, an electrical engineer, was the first witness.18 He testified that PUC paid CDC \u00a322,500, which he believed was for an analysis of the gas turbine project at Victoria A power station, although he admitted under cross-examination that he had never seen an appraisal of the project nor had he had any confirmation of his belief other than the granting of the loan. He noted that neither he nor any of his colleagues at PUC had had any experience dealing with gas turbine technology and that PUC had not hired independent consultants to provide it with advice. He testified that he believed that CDC was PUC\u2019s \"partner,\" \"assessor\" and \"adviser\" in the project, and he stated that he thought that PUC and CDC were unequal in their respective bargaining power.\n\n*Id.* at 11-13 paras. 35-39.\n\n24.\n\nThe next to testify was Mr. Francis Chang-Leng, the Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic.19 He stated that the Republic relied on the expertise of CDC in making its determination with respect to the purchase of the gas turbine generator for Victoria A power station. He also testified that he believed that CDC was the Republic\u2019s \"partner\" in the project, and as such he did not characterize the relationship between the Parties as an ordinary one between a borrower and a lender. But for its belief that CDC considered the project viable, the Republic, Mr. Chang-Leng stated, would not have proceeded with it. He admitted, however, that he had not participated in the negotiations leading to the 1993 Loan Agreement and Guarantee.\n\n*Id.* at 13-14 paras. 40-41.\n\n25.\n\nThe final witness was Mr. J.G. Dilliway, an expert in gas turbine power generation not involved with the case at the time the 1993 Loan Agreement and Guarantee were signed, who testified that the type of turbine employed at the Victoria A power station was not suited to the uses to which it was put.20\n\n*Id.* at 14 para. 42\n\n**D. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n26.\n\nAfter determining that the Parties had agreed that English law governed resolution of the dispute, and noting as well that the Republic had failed to adduce any legal authority or argument with respect to \"the emerging jurisprudence in relation to international trade and investments between developed and developing countries\" despite its reference to such law in its Rejoinder Memorial, the Award proceeded to its analysis of the merits of the case.\n\n27.\n\nThe Award first addressed the Republic\u2019s contention that \"there was an implied representation by CDC to both PUC and the Republic arising from the appraisal which it carried out of the Victoria A project that the project as well as the product (the EGT gas turbine) was suitable and viable for PUC. It is not in dispute that CDC conducted an appraisal.\" As the Award described the Republic\u2019s argument, the defense allegedly arose from PUC\u2019s application for the loan from CDC coupled with CDC\u2019s appraisal and making of the loan as well as the Republic\u2019s payment of the \u00a322,500 fee under clause 15(1) of the 1993 Loan Agreement. After noting that that clause imposes no duty on CDC to make an appraisal for \"the benefit of PUC or the Republic or at all,\" the Award concluded that the sum of \u00a322,500 was, as is the \"common practice of lenders,\" to compensate CDC for the time and expense incurred in deciding whether it would make the loan the Republic sought, and not as payment for CDC to execute a study of the project as a whole to determine for the benefit of PUC or the Republic whether or not it was suitable for PUC\u2019s needs.21\n\n*Id.* at 16 para. 47. Clause 15(1) states that:\n\nBy way of recompense for the time spent and expenses incurred by CDC in considering proposals for the Project and in negotiating the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the Borrower shall within thirty days after the date hereof or, if earlier, upon the making of the first advance by CDC hereunder pay to CDC twenty-two thousand five hundred pounds sterling (\u00a322,500).\n\n28.\n\nGiven the absence of any duty to make an appraisal for the benefit of PUC or the Republic, the absence of any evidence indicating that PUC or the Republic or any of their officers received any such appraisal from CDC, and the absence of any credible evidence indicating that CDC was aware of any reliance by the Republic on CDC\u2019s decision to make the requested loan, the Award determined that the Republic\u2019s defense was not legally sufficient, citing the principle of English law that a borrower cannot rely on the fact of a loan (in the absence of a representation or the lender\u2019s knowledge that the borrower is relying on the loan decision) to recover from the lender on the ground that the use to which the loan proceeds were to be (and were) put was not a good one.22 The Award noted additionally that two clauses of the 1993 Loan Agreement and the 1993 Guarantee, respectively, made the Republic\u2019s contention even more untenable: \"[t]he obligations of the Borrower to pay... shall be in no way impaired or affected by reason of impossibility to carry out the Project or any part thereof or for any other reason\" and \"[t]here are no representations... with respect to this guarantee and affecting the liability of the Government hereunder other than those contained herein.\"23 There were, the Award concluded, no express representations in the Guarantee, and based on the aforementioned disclaimers, there could be no implied representations.\n\n*Id.* at 17-18 paras. 51-54.\n\n*Id.* at 18 para. 55 (quoting clause 17.8 of the 1993 Loan Agreement and clause 2.4 of the 1993 Guarantee).\n\n29.\n\nThe Award also rejected the Republic\u2019s related argument that CDC owed a duty of care to the Republic to make an accurate appraisal of the project,24 because there was no evidence that CDC had made any representation to the Republic that could create such a duty of care and, in fact, all evidence (such as the aforementioned clauses of the 1993 Loan Agreement and the 1993 Guarantee) indicated that CDC specifically disavowed making any representations. As part of this analysis, the Tribunal concluded that the prior relationship between CDC and the Republic and PUC as embodied in the 1990 Loan Agreement and Guarantee was simply that of a lender and a borrower and hence that CDC was not acting as a partner, assessor, or adviser. Therefore, the general principle stated above governed the defense and precluded its use by the Republic.\n\n*Id.* at 19-20 paras. 56-57.\n\n30.\n\nFinally, the Award addressed the Republic\u2019s argument that there was an inequality in bargaining power between CDC and the Republic such that the Republic could be relieved of its responsibility under the 1993 Guarantee.25 After observing that proof of unfairness is a prerequisite to the application of this doctrine, the Award concluded that there was nothing unfair about the 1993 Guarantee.\n\n*Id.* at 20 para. 59.\n\n**E. Conclusion and Order**\n---------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Award therefore concluded that \"the defences raised by the Republic do not amount to a good defence to CDC\u2019s claim based on the Guarantees.\"26 The principal amounts as well as the rate of interest were not contested, so the Tribunal ordered the Republic to pay \u00a31,771,096.75 in principal (in total for both Guarantees), \u00a3672,915.45 in interest as of 25 August 2003, and \u00a3611 in interest daily after 25 August 2003. The Tribunal also Awarded CDC \u00a3100,000 in reimbursement for legal fees and disbursements and $40,000 in reimbursement for fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID paid by CDC.\n\n*Id.* at 21 para. 61.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n32.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention, which the Application of the Republic invokes, allows for annulment of an ICSID Award as follows:\n\n(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\nThe Republic invokes (b), (d) and (e).27\n\nApplication, *supra* note 3, at 2-3.\n\n**A. Article 52(1) Generally**\n------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nAs an initial matter, *ad hoc* Committees have taken the position that the Convention should be \"interpreted in accordance with the law of treaties.\"28 As such, the ordinary meaning of its terms in their context and in light of its object and purpose provide the touchstone for its interpretation29\n\nDavid D. Caron, *Reputation and Reality in the ICSID Annulment Process: Understanding the Distinction between Annulment and Appeal,* 7 ICSID Rev. 21, 33 (1992) (collecting cases). [CDC\u2019s Exhibit E-4]\n\n*See* Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, January 27, 1980, art. 31, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331, *available at* http://www.un.org/law/ilc/texts/treaties.htm.\n\n34.\n\nAs the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 52(1) indicates, the ICSID annulment procedure is concerned with determining whether the underlying proceeding was fundamentally fair: Article 52(1) looks not to the merits of the underlying dispute as such, but rather is concerned with the fundamental integrity of the tribunal, whether basic procedural guarantees were largely observed, whether the Tribunal exceeded the bounds of the parties\u2019 consent30, and whether the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is both coherent and displayed. To borrow Caron\u2019s terminology, annulment is concerned with the \"\u2018legitimacy\u2019 of the process of decision\" rather than with the \"substantive correctness of decision.\"31 Because of its focus on procedural legitimacy, annulment is \"an extraordinary remedy for unusual and important cases.\"32 That annulment is not the same thing as appeal is a principle acknowledged, although applied unevenly, in the various decisions of *ad hoc* Committees.33 Additionally, the Convention specifically recognizes this distinction by rejecting, in Article 53, any right to appeal.\n\nDecision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. The Republic of Guinea,* Case No. ARB/84/4) at para. 5.03 (2 December 1989), *reprinted in* 4 ICSID Rep. 79 *(\"MINE\"* or *\"MINE* Decision\"). [CDC\u2019s Exhibit F-3]\n\nCaron, *supra* note 28, at p. 24. Appeal, on the other hand, is commonly concerned with both the legitimacy of the process and the correctness of the decision.\n\nC.H. Schreuer, *Three Generations of ICSID Annulment Proceedings* in ANNULMENT OF ICSID Awards 17, 42 (Emmanuel Gaillard and Yas Banifatemi eds. 2004) (\"Schreuer, *Three Generations\").* [CDC\u2019s Exhibit E-l7]\n\n*Id.* at 17 (collecting cases).\n\n35.\n\nTwo early decisions of *ad hoc* Committees have been widely criticized for reviewing the propriety of the underlying tribunals\u2019 factual and legal determinations (and thus appearing to exercise more of an appellate function).34 Since those two Decisions, *Kl\u00f4ckner I35* and *Amco Asia I,36 ad hoc* Committees consistently have taken a much more restrictive view of the role of the *ad hoc* Committee and the annulment process. The so-called \"second\" and \"third\" generation annulment decisions (*MINE, Vivendi,37* and *Wena Hotels38* are the published examples) have further crystallized the now apparently generally accepted proposition that \"annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision\" alone.39 Thus there has been an evolution in the ICSID annulment case law and scholarship away from *Kl\u00f4ckner I* and *Amco Asia I* that has culminated, in our view correctly, in *ad hoc* Committees reviewing arbitral proceedings only to the extent of ensuring their fundamental fairness, eschewing any temptation to \"second guess\" their substantive result.40\n\n*See, e.g.,* M.B.

Parties use ICSID arbitration (at least in part) because they wish a more efficient way of resolving disputes than is possible in a national court system with its various levels of trial and appeal, or even in non-ICSID Convention arbitrations (which may be subject to national courts\u2019 review under local laws and whose enforcement may also be subject to defenses available under, for example, the New York Convention42). Procedural protections are, however, all the more necessary in order to ensure that the resulting award is truly an \"award,\" *i.e.,* a result arrived at fairly, under due process and with transparency, and hence in the basic justice of which parties will have faith.\n\nA. Broches, *Observations on the Finality of ICSID Awards,* 6 ICSID Rev. 321,324, 324-34 (1991) (discussing the debates surrounding adoption of the Convention). [CDC\u2019s Exhibit E-3]\n\nConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958, *available at* http://www.kentlaw.edu/perritt/conflicts/nucmain.htm. It is interesting to note that following the decisions in *Amco Asia I* and *Kl\u00f4ckner I* some commentators predicted the obsolescence of the ICSID system precisely because the more searching review in which those particular *ad hoc* Committees engaged indicated that awards might not be as final and binding as was previously thought. *See, e.g.,* Reisman, *supra* note 34, at 749, 785-787, 804-805. *But see* Caron, *supra* note 28, at 22-23; Broches, *supra* note 41, at 376-77 (stating that despite the misconceptions of the *Kl\u00f4ckner I* Committee, the ICSID annulment process is \u2018on track\u2019 and will fulfil the limited purposes for which it was established).\n\n37.\n\nKeeping the object and purpose of the Convention as well as these underlying policy considerations in mind, we note that the *ad hoc* Committees operating during the last two decades have considered that a Committee has discretion to determine not to annul an Award even where a ground for annulment under Article 52(1) is found to exist.43 The *Vivendi* Committee, for example, stated that an award should be annulled in whole or in part only if annulment is \"appropriate in the circumstances.\"44 We thus should \"consider the significance of the [alleged annullable] error relative to the legal rights of the parties.\"45\n\nSchreuer, *Three Generations, supra* note 32, at 19 (\"A good example for the movement towards this more balanced approach is the position taken by *ad hoc* Committees on their obligation or discretion to annul once they have found a ground for annulment. In *Kl\u00f4ckner I,* the *ad hoc* Committee had still held that a finding that there existed a ground for annulment would have to automatically lead to the annulment of the award. Subsequent *ad hoc* Committees have rejected this \u2018hair trigger\u2019 standard in favor of a \u2018material violation\u2019 approach. *Wena* and *Vivendi* contain further confirmation of this cautious attitude.)\n\n*Vivendi, supra* note 37, at 358 para. 66 (citing C.H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary 1018-1023 (2001) (\"Schreuer, The ICSID Convention\"), and emphasizing *MINE, supra* note 30, at paras. 4.09-4.10).\n\n*Id.*\n\n38.\n\nBy our reckoning, the Republic has raised at least 19 separate arguments for annulment and has done so generally without specifically indicating in each case which ground for annulment set forth in Article 52(1) it believes to be applicable. In the following sections of this Decision, however, we set forth each of the Article 52(1) grounds invoked, describing each one generally and then addressing the Republic\u2019s particular contentions that appear to relate to it. Where an argument made by the Republic can be analyzed under more than one of the Article 52(1) grounds we have disposed of the argument primarily in one section and have referred to it only briefly in any other applicable section, adding any such additional analysis as may be necessary to understand its disposition under such other section.\n\n**B. Article 52(1)(b) - Manifest Excess of Powers**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Manifest excess of powers generally**\n------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nArticle 52(1)(b) allows for annulment of an award where the Tribunal \"manifestly exceeded its powers.\" That is, a tribunal (1) must do something in excess of its powers and (2) that excess must be \"manifest.\" It is a dual requirement. The *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* noted that the requirement that the excess be manifest \"necessarily limits an ad hoc Committee\u2019s freedom of appreciation as to whether the tribunal has exceeded its powers.\"46\n\n*MINE, supra* note 30, at 85 para 4.06.\n\n40.\n\nCommon examples of such \"excesses\" are a Tribunal deciding questions not submitted to it or refusing to decide questions properly before it.47 Failure to apply the law specified by the parties is also an excess of powers.48 Essentially, a Tribunal\u2019s legitimate exercise of power is tied to the consent of the parties, and so it exceeds its powers where it acts in contravention of that consent (or without their consent, *i.e.,* absent jurisdiction).\n\nSchreuer, *Three Generations, supra* note 32, at 25-26.\n\n*Id.* at 28-29.\n\n41.\n\nAs interpreted by various *ad hoc* Committees, the term \"manifest\" means clear or \"self-evident.\"49 Thus, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal\u2019s conduct, if susceptible of argument \"one way or the other,\" is not manifest.50 As one commentator has put it, \"If the issue is debatable or requires examination of the materials on which the tribunal\u2019s decision is based, the tribunal\u2019s determination is conclusive.\"51\n\n*Wena Hotels, supra* note 38, at 135 para. 25.\n\n*Id.*\n\nFeldman, *supra* note 34, at 101.\n\n42.\n\nThis interpretation conforms with other interpretations of the, term \"manifest\" (or a variation thereof) where it is employed elsewhere in the Convention. For example, Article 36(3) states, in pertinent part, that \"The Secretary-General shall register the request [for arbitration] unless he finds, on the basis of the information contained in the request, that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre.\" Schreuer has noted that, in Article 36(3), the term \"manifestly\" means \"easily recognizable.\"52 He further observes that \"If the Secretary-General has doubts in the matter he will register the request.\" Similarly, Article 57 provides, in pertinent part, that \"A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.\" With respect to this article, the arbitral tribunal in *Amco Asia I* held that \"manifest\" means \"highly probable\" and not simply \"possible.\"53 These interpretations of the term \"manifest\" confirm that its use in the Convention sets a high bar to the application of any provision so conditioned.\n\nSchreuer, The ICSID Convention, *supra* note 44, at 462.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction in *Amco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development Ltd. and P.T. Amco Indonesia v. The Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1 (25 September 1983), *reprinted in* 1 ICSID Rep. 389.\n\n43.\n\nThe Republic argues, with respect to this ground, that the Tribunal acted in excess of its powers by failing to apply English law.54 CDC contends that the Republic actually takes issue with the Tribunal\u2019s actual application of English law, which, even if truly erroneous, is not an appropriate basis for annulment.55 As the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* noted, \"Disregard of the applicable rules of law must be distinguished from erroneous application of those rules which, even if manifestly unwarranted, furnishes no ground for annulment.\"56\n\nThe Republic also argues that that Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to answer the question put to it. We consider this argument in part IV.C.4., *infra,* ultimately determining that the Tribunal answered the appropriate question.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial in *CDC Group plc v.

Alleged failure to apply English law**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Republic cites a number of English judicial decisions that it contends the Tribunal \"ignores\" in its Award: *Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd. v. Heller & Partners Ltd,* [1964] AC 46557; *Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd* v. *Mardon,* [1976] QB 80158; and *Howard Marine and Dredging Co. Ltd v. A. Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd,* [1978] QB 574.59 The Republic also cites the Tribunal\u2019s failure explicitly to cite the Misrepresentation Act 196760 as an annullable error. It argues as well that the Tribunal improperly relied on an inapplicable English legal authority, *National Commercial Bank (Jamaica) Ltd.* v. *Hew.61* Finally, the Republic maintains that the Tribunal erred in failing to apply the equitable doctrine of inequality of bargaining power, as described by Lord Denning in *Lloyd's Bank* v. *Bundy,* [1975] QB 326.62\n\n*See* Annulment Memorial in *CDC Group plc v. Republic of the Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14 at 10 para. 24 (28 July 2003) (\"Memorial\").\n\n*Id.* at 40-41 para. 33.\n\n*Id.* at 41-43 para. 34.\n\nId. at 50-51 para. 37\n\n*National Commercial Bank (Jamaica) Ltd. v.

Rather, it appears to us that the Tribunal\u2019s citation to authority was consistent with its legal determinations (1) that CDC made no representation to the Republic or PUC as was alleged and (2) that CDC was unaware of any reliance by the Republic or PUC on its approval of the 1993 loan. The Tribunal did not ignore the cases the Republic cited, but simply found them inapplicable considering the facts as established by the Republic\u2019s evidence. The Tribunal then cited the relevant precedent, the case of *Smith v. Bush,* which stands for the proposition that \"a lender who makes an appraisal of the viability of a loan for its own purposes as lender owes no duty of care to the borrower... in relation to that appraisal.\"63 Regardless of our opinion of the correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s legal analysis, however, our inquiry is limited to a determination of whether or not the Tribunal endeavored to apply English law. That it did so is made plain by its explicit statement in the Award that it did as well as by its repeated citation to relevant English legal authorities. This same analysis applies to the Republic\u2019s contention with respect to the Misrepresentation Act 1967; the Act is not applicable to this case given the Tribunal\u2019s unreviewable determination that there was no representation.\n\n*Smith v.

The Republic also contends, in paragraph 36 of its Memorial, *supra* note 57, that the Tribunal\u2019s citation of the *Smith* v. *Bush* case amounts to a failure to state reasons. As we discuss in greater detail below, this case seems perfectly applicable to the facts as found by the Tribunal for the purposes of its legal determination. Thus, the case is not irrelevant, and the Tribunal\u2019s reliance on it does not lead to the Award being contradictory or absurd.\n\n46.\n\nThe Republic also takes issue with the Tribunal\u2019s citation to, and reliance on, the *National Commercial Bank* case,64 which the Republic likewise did not cite in its submissions to the Tribunal.65 That case, however, seems to us to be entirely on point. There, a bank provided an overdraft facility to a customer for use in a land development project. When the customer defaulted on the obligation, he defended his non-performance by stating that he relied on the bank\u2019s granting of the loan in his land development decisionmaking. The Privy Council held, however, that such reliance was not a defense to nonperformance absent the bank\u2019s actual provision of advice or undertaking of an obligation to give such advice. The Republic contends that the instant case is distinguishable because \"CDC granted the loan only after a thorough appraisal of the project proposals submitted to it by PUC. Thus CDC assumed an obligation to advise as to the viability of the project and failed to advise that it was not, as cited in the privy council case.\" Given the Tribunal\u2019s determination based on all the evidence that there was nothing in the 1993 Loan Agreement (particularly considering clause 15(1)) nor in the antecedent relationship between CDC and PUC indicating that CDC had agreed to analyze the suitability of the project for PUC or to become PUC\u2019s partner, assessor, or adviser, this case would seem to be directly on point. Again, however, such a determination is not the responsibility of this Committee. Our review is limited to a determination of whether or not the Tribunal endeavored to apply English law to its factual findings. As noted by the *Wena Hotels* Committee: \"The Tribunal did not consider that there was sufficient evidence to prove such a claim. It is therefore not a question of the applicable law but of evidence, the evaluation of which relates to the merits of the case and is not a matter for the ground of annulment related to a purported excess of power by the Tribunal.\"66\n\n*National Commercial Bank, supra* note 61.\n\nMemorial, *supra* note 57, at 44-48 para 35.\n\n*Wena Hotels, supra* note 38, at 139-140 para. 47.\n\n47.\n\nAs for the Republic\u2019s contention that the Tribunal ignored principles of equity,67 we have no difficulty rejecting this argument, for it is plain on the face of the Award that the Tribunal considered the applicability of equitable principles (and actually cited in paragraph 58 thereof the case upon which the Republic relies) before making the legal determination that the 1993 Loan Agreement and Guarantee were not \"unfair,\" proof of which fact is necessary to the establishment of a claim of inequality of bargaining power. Additionally, the Tribunal determined that the *Lloyd\u2019s Bank* case was not the final word in English law on the subject. It cited a more recent precedent, which observed that the proposition for which the *Lloyd's Bank* case was cited has not been generally accepted. As we noted previously, however, it is not the duty of this Committee to parse the meanings of English legal authorities. Rather, we are supposed to make a procedural review to determine whether or not the Tribunal honored the intent of the parties to have their dispute decided under English law. Clearly it did.\n\nMemorial, *supra* note 57, at 52-54 para. 39.\n\n**C. Article 52(1)(d) - Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure generally**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe next basis for annulment raised by the Republic is Article 52(1)(d), which provides that annulment may be appropriate where there has been a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" in the underlying proceeding. As with the requirement that a Tribunal\u2019s \"excess of power\" be *manifest,* here the departure must be *serious* and it must be from a *fundamental* rule of procedure. It is a dual requirement. Not just any departure from any rule of procedure will support annulment.68 Prior *ad hoc* Committees have held that it is the duty of the party seeking annulment to \"identify the fundamental rule of procedure\" and to show that any departure from it \"has been serious.\"69\n\n*MINE, supra* note 30, at 85 para. 4.06.\n\n*Wena Hotels, supra* note 38, at 142 para. 56.\n\n49.\n\nA departure is serious where it is \"substantial and [is] such as to deprive the party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\"70 In other words, \"the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had the rule been observed.\"71 As for what rules of procedure are fundamental, the drafters of the Convention refrained from attempting to enumerate them, but the consensus seems to be that only rules of natural justice - rules concerned with the essential fairness of the proceeding - are fundamental. Not all ICSID Arbitration Rules are fundamental in this sense.72 As the *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena Hotels* stated, Article 52(1)(d) makes applicable to ICSID arbitrations the \"minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law.\" For example, \"It is fundamental, as a matter of procedure, that each party is given the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal. This includes the right to state its claim or its defence and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it.\"73 Other examples of such fundamental rules are impartiality of the Tribunal and meaningful deliberation by the Tribunal.74\n\n*Id.* at 87 para. 5.05.\n\n*Wena Hotels, supra* note 38, at 142 para. 58. Given this statement of the requirement that a violation of a rule of fundamental procedure be serious it would seem that we might not in fact have discretion to conclude that annulment is not appropriate where that requirement is met. This is because, as we have already noted, our discretion with respect to annulment is constrained by an investigation into the impact of an error on the legal rights of the parties. Where, as is the case with Article 52(1)(d), prejudice is found as a necessary element of the decision on the availability of annulment, an *ad hoc* Committee has, it seems, *ipso facto* made the determination that the error significantly impacted the legal rights of the parties, thus requiring annulment. *See, supra,* para. 37.\n\n*MINE, supra* note 30, at 87 para. 5.06.\n\n*Wena Hotels, supra* note 38, at 142 para. 57.\n\nSchreuer, *Three Generations, supra* note 32, at 29-32.\n\n50.\n\nWith respect to this ground for annulment, the Republic argues that the Tribunal committed numerous errors seriously violating fundamental rules of procedure. It contends that the Tribunal failed, in multiple situations, to apply English law (we have disposed of this argument in the previous section, concluding that the sole Arbitrator did in fact apply English law), that the Tribunal lacked impartiality75; that the Tribunal failed to address questions put to it by the parties as required by Article 48(3)76; that there was an absence of real deliberation because the Tribunal failed to consider relevant matters, instead considered irrelevant matters, and because there was an alleged discrepancy in the Award\u2019s reasoning suggesting such an absence of deliberation77; that the Tribunal failed to follow rules of evidence78, and that the Tribunal failed to issue its Award within the time limit provided for in ICSID Arbitration Rule 46.79 CDC responds generally that the Republic was afforded a full and fair opportunity\" to prove its case and maintains that the Tribunal did not depart at all, much less seriously, from any fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nMemorial, *supra* note 57, at 56-58 para. 41.\n\n*Id.* at 29 para. 24.\n\n*Id.* at 31 para. 25,32 para. 26, 33 para. 27,33 para. 28, 34 para. 29, 34-35 para. 30, and 35-37 para. 31.\n\n*Id.* at 5.\n\n*Id.* at 54-56 para. 40.\n\n**2. Alleged lack of impartiality**\n-----------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nWe first consider the Republic\u2019s very serious allegation that the sole Arbitrator lacked impartiality. The Republic is of the opinion that the Tribunal evidenced a lack of impartiality when it heard argument on whether or not testimonial evidence needed to be heard at the preliminary hearing because \"whether the witnesses should be called to testify on its behalf before the Arbitrator was entirely for the Republic.\"80 It also cites a number of pages of the transcript where, it contends, the Tribunal illustrated its partiality by interjecting \"always in favour of CDC or when the question is framed in a way which indicates that the Arbitrator is expecting an answer favourable to CDC.\"81 At the hearing before the Committee, the Republic also stated that the very Award itself, when coupled with these other factors, demonstrates the Tribunal\u2019s partiality.\n\n*Id.* at 56-58 para. 41.\n\n*Id.*\n\n52.\n\nCDC responds that the Tribunal\u2019s discussion of the necessity of adducing oral \u2022 testimony at the preliminary hearing was reasonable given the terms of the pre-hearing correspondence (see, *supra,* paragraph 10) and the fact that written witness statements had in fact finally been submitted to the Tribunal before the preliminary hearing.82 Additionally, CDC states that the Tribunal\u2019s questioning was completely appropriate and betrays not a lack of impartiality, but only the involvement of a suitably engaged judge. Finally, CDC notes that the sole Arbitrator is a respected former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and that the Republic\u2019s unsupported allegations of professional misconduct should be treated as being \"prima facie implausible.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, *supra* note 55, at 38-40 paras. 158-166. (quoting *Kl\u00f4ckner I, supra* note 35, at 130 para. 94).\n\n53.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Republic\u2019s allegation appears vulnerable to the point that it failed to challenge Sir Anthony\u2019s alleged improper conduct at any time prior to the issuance of the Award, even though all of the conduct to which objection now is made (excluding the fact of the Award itself) occurred not later than during the preliminary hearing. It is arguable that a timely objection or challenge under Article 57 of the Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 would have been the appropriate remedy and that this complaint effectively has been waived and is therefore simply inadmissible. This conclusion is confirmed by Note B. to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (last published in 1975 as part of ICSID/4/Rev.l (\"ICSID Regulations And Rules\"))83:\n\nA proposal to disqualify an arbitrator must be filed promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed (see Rule 38). Promptness must be measured relative to the time when the proposing party first learns of the grounds for possible disqualification. If it receives this information so late that it can no longer make a proposal before the proceeding is declared closed, its remedy is to request an annulment of the award pursuant to Article 52 of the Convention (Rule 50).\n\nIn the absence of having challenged Sir Anthony on the basis now asserted at any time during the 147 days that followed the conclusion of the preliminary hearing on July 23, 2003 and issuance of the Award on December 17, 2003 the Republic must be deemed to have waived any such objection.84 Although the Republic claimed at the hearing before the Committee that its allegation of lack of impartiality is based also on the totality of circumstances including the Award itself, which contention, it necessarily suggests, escapes the potential bar just discussed, the absence of any earlier objection to the alleged bias nevertheless gives rise to questions regarding the bona fides of the objection.\n\nPrefacing the texts of the various Regulations and Rules set forth therein this volume states that\n\nThough these [\"explanatory Notes prepared by the Secretariat of the Centre\"] do not constitute part of the Rules and have no legal force, the Administrative Council considered that they might be useful to the parties to proceedings and should therefore be published together with the texts of the Rules.\n\nThe proceedings in fact were never formally closed prior to the issuance of the Award. *See, infra,* paras. 62-65.\n\n54.\n\nApart from these obstacles, we have closely reviewed the record of this case, from the time Sir Anthony was appointed until the issuance of the Award, including the contents of the Award itself, and state categorically that Sir Anthony\u2019s conduct of the case was entirely appropriate. Rather than evincing a lack of impartiality, the record unequivocally demonstrates that Sir Anthony served as an unbiased, independent sole Arbitrator whose conduct was entirely appropriate and designed to ensure that the case was vigorously argued and rigorously decided.\n\n55.\n\nAs noted briefly above, the Republic points in particular to Sir Anthony\u2019s conduct at the beginning of the preliminary hearing when he discussed whether or not the oral testimony of the Republic\u2019s witnesses needed to be heard. The Republic believes that this discussion demonstrates Sir Anthony\u2019s bias against it. We frankly profess some astonishment at this contention, as the facts clearly support the opposite conclusion. We note that 11 days before the preliminary hearing, on 11 July 2003, Sir Anthony had expressly reserved for decision at the outset of the preliminary hearing itself the question of whether or not the Republic\u2019s witnesses would need to be heard. Then, as noted in paragraph 12 above, when on the first day of the preliminary hearing on 22 July 2003 the Republic first sought leave to call witnesses the Tribunal indeed did voice doubt as to whether such testimony was necessary. The Republic nevertheless succeeded in persuading Sir Anthony to the Republic\u2019s desired position which, if anything, is strong evidence that Sir Anthony approached the issue (and the case as a whole) with a fully open mind. He clearly was at pains to accommodate to the maximum extent humanly possible the desires of a very small developing state, even though the Respondent persistently had failed to comply with his directions, as recorded in the Minutes, and later his Decision of 17 February 2003, regarding the filing of witness statements.\n\n**3. Alleged failure to answer the question put to the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Republic also argues that the Tribunal seriously violated a fundamental rule of procedure by answering the wrong question, *i.e.,* determining whether the 1993 Loan Agreement obligated CDC to conduct an appraisal \"for the benefit of PUC or the Republic....\"85 That is, the Republic contends that the only question the Tribunal should have answered was whether CDC was obligated to conduct an appraisal. That fact alone, the Republic believes, coupled with the loan decision, established CDC\u2019s liability.86\n\nMemorial, *supra* note 57, at 30 para. 24.\n\n*Id.* at 30 para. 29.\n\n57.\n\nThe specific terminology used by the Republic in its Memorial cannot define the question the Tribunal was obliged to answer. Rather, the Tribunal was required to answer a legal question, or to put it another way, come to a conclusion about the Parties\u2019 rights and liabilities. In this case, the legal question for the Tribunal\u2019s determination was whether or not the Republic\u2019s claimed defenses protected it from liability under the 1993 Guarantee. This question necessarily entailed, under English law as the Tribunal understood it, the determination, *inter alia,* of whether the Republic was entitled to rely on CDC\u2019s loan decision as a representation regarding the substance of the project it financed. The Tribunal answered the question in the negative, thereby answering the proper legal question before it.\n\n**4. Alleged lack of deliberation**\n-----------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Republic has made a multifaceted argument that there was a failure to deliberate amounting to a serious violation of a fundamental rule of procedure.87 The Republic premises this argument on the Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to consider relevant matters, alleged actual consideration of irrelevant matters,88 and alleged discrepancies and inconsistencies in the Award assertedly indicating a failure to deliberate.89 These arguments are discussed in the section of this Decision dealing with Article 52(1)(e), inasmuch as such alleged errors are more commonly understood to implicate a Tribunal\u2019s duty to state the reasons for its decision.\n\nIt is a neat philosophical or metaphysical question as to whether a Sole Arbitrator can be subject to an accusation of failure to \"deliberate.\"\n\n*Id.* at 29 para. 24, 31 para. 25.\n\n*Id.* at 33 para. 28.\n\n**5. Alleged failure to follow rules of evidence**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Republic complains that the Tribunal failed to follow rules of evidence, thereby seriously departing from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Republic has provided no authority for its position that any rules of evidence were fundamental or that the Tribunal\u2019s alleged violation thereof was serious. In any event, we are convinced that the Tribunal did not, in fact, violate any rules of evidence to the prejudice of the Republic.\n\n60.\n\nThe Republic\u2019s contention arises from the fact that CDC did not proffer testimony from witnesses contradicting the testimony of the Republic\u2019s witnesses. This failure, argues the Republic, compelled the Tribunal to accept the Republic\u2019s evidence as true. (The Republic overlooks the fact that CDC did cross-examine the Republic\u2019s witnesses and it also presented non-testimonial evidence to the Tribunal.) The Republic again is insensitive to the fact that a trier of fact may in such circumstances nonetheless find a party\u2019s evidence not to be credible.\n\n61.\n\nEssentially, however, CDC was under no obligation to present evidence from its own witnesses to contest the Republic\u2019s evidence at the preliminary hearing held, since the agreed object of that hearing, which was designated from its inception as a \"preliminary\" one, was simply to determine whether the Republic was able to make out a *prima facie* case or whether instead, on the Republic\u2019s evidence and English law, there was \"no case to answer.\" Only had the Republic succeeded in persuading the Tribunal that it had put forward \"a case to answer\" would the Tribunal have proceeded to a full evidentiary hearing as the parties had agreed. Because the Republic did not make out a *prima facie* case, CDC was not required to respond.\n\n**6. Alleged untimely issuance of the Award**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nWe turn finally (with respect to Article 52(1)(d)) to the Republic\u2019s argument that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by its allegedly tardy issuance of the Award. The Republic argued initially that the Award, issued by the Tribunal on 17 December 2003, is a nullity because it was not issued within 60 days after the closure of proceedings in the case (as provided, it contended, by ICSID Arbitration Rule 46), which it maintains occurred at the end of the hearing on 23 July 2003 when the Tribunal stated \"All right, well, we will wrap it up.\" The Republic admits, however, that correspondence of the Parties and the Tribunal on the merits of the case continued well into October 2003. CDC responds that the Tribunal did not violate Rule 46 because the version of those Rules that the Parties agreed would apply in the case allows 120 days plus an additional 60 days (at the election of the Tribunal) for issuance of the Award.90 The Republic later conceded the applicability of the 120-day (plus 60 days) rule.91\n\nCounter-Memorial, *supra* note 55, at 50-52 paras. 209-219.\n\nReply to the Counter-Memorial in *CDC Group plc* v. *Republic of the Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14 at 14-15 para. 57 (5 November 2004) (\"Reply\").\n\n63.\n\nThe record indicates that there was no post-hearing formal closure of proceedings in this case. One reason might have been that to have done so following the preliminary hearing and prior to issuance of the Award, thereby foreclosing further proceedings, would itself have constituted a dispositive conclusion adverse to the Republic telegraphing the eventual Award. In the circumstances the proceedings must be regarded as having been closed only upon issuance of the Award, thereby eliminating this issue from further consideration.\n\n64.\n\nEven accepting (for the purposes, of argument only), however, the Republic\u2019s contention that the proceedings were closed at the end of the hearing, the Award was still timely issued. A total of 147 days passed from the conclusion of the preliminary hearing to the Tribunal issuing its Award. In our view, its conduct thus would fall squarely within the rule, which allows for 180 days in total for the issuance of an Award if the Tribunal is unable to do so in 120 days.92\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 46 provides, in pertinent part, that \"[t]he award (including any individual or dissenting opinion) shall be drawn up and signed within 120 days after closure of the proceeding. The Tribunal may, however, extend this period by a further 60 days if it would otherwise be unable to draw up the award.\" The Committee would not regard a Tribunal\u2019s failure expressly so to extend and to notify the parties of such extension as either a serious departure or one from a rule of procedure of a fundamental character.\n\n65.\n\nEven had the Tribunal erred in issuing the Award when it did, the Committee would see no basis for annulling the Award as a result. Specifically, the Republic was unable to communicate to the *ad hoc* Committee how it had been prejudiced by the allegedly impermissible delay. Therefore, we must conclude that annulment on this ground could not be appropriate.\n\n**D. Article 52(1)(e) - Failure to State Reasons**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Failure to state reasons generally**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nAnnulment under Article 52(1)(e) is permissible where a tribunal fails to state the reasons on which its award is based. This ground for annulment has been a cause of great concern to commentators since, unlike (b) and (d), it does not include any limiting terms such as \"manifest,\" \"serious\" or \"fundamental.\" Early on, *ad hoc* Committees interpreted this clause in such a way that it appeared to allow inquiry into the sufficiency or substance of the reasons offered. In *Kl\u00f4ckner I,* for example, the *ad hoc* Committee stated that it was bound to determine whether the reasons given by the Tribunal were \"reasonably sustainable and capable of providing a basis for the decision.\"93 Similarly, in *Amco Asia I* the *ad hoc* Committee held that its duty was to determine whether there was a \"reasonable connection between the basis invoked by the tribunal and the conclusions reached by it.\"94 As we have already noted, however, both of these decisions have been criticized as too closely resembling the work of appellate bodies and thus going beyond the ambit prescribed for *ad hoc* Committees.95\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner I, supra* note 35, at 139 para. 120.\n\n*Amco Asia I, supra* note 36, at 520 para. 43.\n\nSchreuer observes that \"The formal test of the presence of a statement of reasons blends into a substantive test of adequacy and correctness and the distinction between annulment and appeal (see paras. 8-12 *supra)* becomes blurred.\" Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, *supra* note 44, at 990. While the Decisions referred to have more frequently been criticized for wrongly basing annulment on excess of powers, some commentators have criticized their formulation of the standard of review to be employed under Article 52(1)(e). *See, e.g., id.* at 992.\n\n67.\n\nLater *ad hoc* Committees, beginning with the *MINE* Committee, have interpreted Article 52(1)(e) more restrictively. The *MINE* Committee was of the view that this provision of the Convention requires only that the reader of an award be able \"to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law.\" Investigation into \"the adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review... because it almost inevitably draws an *ad hoc* Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal\u2019s decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention.\"96 Given this concern, the *MINE* Committee determined that \"the requirement is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to the conclusion, even if it made an error, of fact or of law.\"97 The Committee did note, however, that \"the minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\"98\n\n*MINE, supra* note 30, at 88\u2019 para. 5.08.\n\n*Id.* at 88 para. 5.09.\n\n*Id.*\n\n68.\n\nThe *Vivendi* Committee followed the lead of the Committee in *MINE* and interpreted Article 52(1)(e) as allowing for annulment where there is \"a failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.\"99\n\n*Vivendi, supra* note 37, at 358 para. 64.\n\n69.\n\nSimilarly, the *Wena Hotels* Committee stated that \"[t]he ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the *ad hoc* Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not.\"100\n\n*Wena Hotels, supra* note 38, at 146 para. 79.\n\n70.\n\nIt thus appears that the more recent practice among *ad hoc* Committees is to apply Article 52(1)(e) in such a manner that the Committee does not intrude into the legal and factual decision-making of the Tribunal.101 That is to say, Article 52(1)(e) requires that the Tribunal have stated reasons, and that such reasons be coherent, *i.e.,* neither \"contradictory\" nor \"frivolous,\" but does not provide us with the opportunity to opine on whether the Tribunal\u2019s analysis was correct or its reasoning persuasive. This conclusion is reinforced by reference to three other provisions of the Convention: Article 49(2), Article 50, and, as noted in the *MINE* decision, Article 53. As the Committee in *Wena Hotels* observed:\n\nwhen the reasons stated in the award give rise to doubts about its meaning, either party may request interpretation of the award under Article 50. In the case where the Tribunal omitted to decide on a question or where the award contains an error, either party may request the award be rectified, according [to] Article 49(2). These remedies confirm the understanding that any challenge as to the substance of reasons given in the award cannot be retained as a ground for annulment under Article 52(1).102\n\nSimilarly, Article 53 specifically disclaims the existence of a right to appeal in an ICSID case and, therefore, can be read as necessarily limiting the permissible scope of review by an *ad hoc* Committee in an annulment proceeding.\n\nSome scholars have opined that some investigation into the Tribunal\u2019s factual findings may be appropriate where \"the way in which the fact was found [] is at the centre of criticism\" or where \"the fact itself [] needs a fresh determination in order to decide whether a certain criticism is justified.\" P. Mayer, *To What Extent Can an* Ad Hoc *Committee Review the Factual Findings of an Arbitral Tribunal?* in ANNULMENT OF ICSID Awards 243, 244 (Emmanuel Gaillard and Yas Banifatemi eds. 2004). An example of the latter situation is where \"a certain factual finding is so obviously wrong, considering the evidence adduced, that it shows an obvious lack of impartiality, which would constitute a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\" *Id.* (citing Peter D. Trooboff, *To What Extent May an* Ad Hoc *Committee Review the Factual Findings of an Arbitral Tribunal Based on a Procedural Error,* in ANNULMENT OF ICSID AWARDS 251 (Emmanuel Gaillard and Yas Banifatemi eds. 2004)). An example of the former is where \"the applicant claims that there was no arbitration clause and that by declaring that it had jurisdiction, the tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\" Mayer, *supra* at 244. Mayer concludes that a Committee \"should limit its review to the evidence which was already before the tribunal\" and \"should not too easily come to the conclusion that the tribunal erred in its factual finding; it should use self-restraint.\" *Id.* at 249. Trooboff notes that the \"ICSID Convention does not permit a party to argue that its claims have been ignored and that the grounds for annulment exist if the tribunal finds that the evidence submitted does not as a matter of law support that claim or defense.\" Trooboff, *supra* at 265. Here the Republic is attempting to do exactly that, however, and therefore should not be given \"another opportunity to make the case it could have made but that the tribunal found had not been made as a matter of law.\" *Id*.\n\n*Wena Hotels, supra* note 38, at 146 para. 80.\n\n71.\n\nLater *ad hoc* Committees h\u00e2ve also observed that the failure to answer all questions put to the Tribunal, while perhaps a violation of Article 48(3), does not necessitate annulment under Article 52(1)(e) unless \"the. failure to deal with a particular question rendered the award unintelligible.\"103 This makes sense given the twin aims of finality and fairness.\n\nSchreuer, The ICSID Convention, *supra* note 44, at 1001 paras. 308-309 (citing *MINE, supra* note 30, at 89 para. 5.13).\n\n72.\n\nIn the instant case, the Republic argues that the Award merits annulment under Article 52(1)(e) for a number of reasons, including that it ignores relevant matters, considers irrelevant matters, is contradictory, and also arbitrary.104 The Republic also contends that the Tribunal failed adequately to state reasons for its decision on costs. CDC responds to each of these contentions, concluding that the Republic\u2019s application is \"in substance an appeal as to the substantive correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s reasons (as opposed to an investigation into their existence and sufficiency)... However, Article 52(1)(e) does not provide the Republic, which is merely a dissatisfied party, with a free opportunity to launch an appeal into the merits of the Award.\"105\n\n*See, supra,* note 77.\n\nCounter-Memorial, *supra* note 55, at 74 para. 323.\n\n**2. Alleged errors in the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of clause 15(1) of the 1993 Loan Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Republic contends that the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of clause 15(1) of the 1993 Loan Agreement dealing with payment of the \u00a322,500 fee by the Republic to CDC \"has taken into consideration irrelevant matters and failed to take into consideration relevant matters and [its] interpretation is so faulty that it does not come up to the standard of reasons that should be set out in an Award as contemplated by Article 52(2) [sic] and 48(3) of the ICSID Convention.\"106 Clause 15(1) of the 1993 Loan Agreement provides as follows:\n\nBy way of recompense for the time spent and expenses incurred by CDC in considering proposals for the Project and in negotiating the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower shall within thirty days after the date hereof or, if earlier, upon the making of the first advance by CDC hereunder pay to CDC twenty-two thousand five hundred pounds sterling (\u00a322,500).\n\nThe Republic points to the phrase \"considering proposals for the Project\" in the clause, maintaining that it clearly creates the obligation on the part of CDC to conduct an appraisal of the project upon which the Republic was entitled to rely. This position is contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s decision that the Agreement created no such obligation. The Republic additionally objects to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that CDC had no duty to perform an appraisal of the project *\"for the benefit of PUC or the Republic,\"* arguing that the identity of the beneficiary of the alleged obligation is irrelevant because the fact of the appraisal taken together with the granting of the loan created an \"implied representation that the project as well as the product was suitable and viable for PUC.\" Finally with respect to clause 15(1), the Republic takes issue with the Tribunal\u2019s determination that the charging of a fee for expenses related to the loan was in keeping with the ordinary practice of lenders because, the Republic maintains, the fee was paid in consideration for the execution of an appraisal of the project. Nowhere in its discussion of this clause does the Republic cite to any authority indicating that erroneous conduct of the kind alleged against the Tribunal necessitates annulment of the Award.\n\nMemorial, *supra* note 57, at 29 para. 24. This argument has been addresses as well in part IV.B.2., *supra,* of this Decision.\n\n74.\n\nCDC defends the Tribunal\u2019s Award, stating that the Republic is attempting to take issue with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation, based on the evidence, of this clause\u2019s meaning, and does so by reading paragraph 50 of the Award out of context.107 The Tribunal considered all relevant evidence, in CDC\u2019s opinion, before coming to the conclusion that, despite the Republic\u2019s contention otherwise, clause 15(1) deals with payment for expenses related to the loan transaction (and consideration of the project as a part of that loan transaction) and not for an appraisal of the suitability of the project for PUC\u2019s needs made for PUC\u2019s or the Republic\u2019s benefit. This factual determination by the Tribunal is thus, according to CDC\u2019s submission, not subject to review under Article 52(1)(e).\n\nCounter-Memorial, *supra* note 55, at 60-63 paras. 259-271.\n\n75.\n\nAs noted above, Article 52(1)(e) simply requires that the Tribunal have stated its reasons in such a fashion that the parties are able to follow the reasoning to its conclusion, not that it state any particular reasons or that the reasons be convincing to the Committee. Thus, even if this Committee were to disagree with the Tribunal\u2019s legal conclusions, Article 52(1)(e) does not allow annulment on that basis alone.\n\n76.\n\nWe can find nothing in the Award with respect to clause 15(1) of the 1993 Loan Agreement that demonstrates a failure to state reasons such that annulment might be permissible. The Tribunal weighed the evidence (including the self-interested testimony of Mr. Morin and Mr. Chang-Leng) before making its determination. The reasons stated in the Award are not \"contradictory or frivolous.\"\n\n**3. Alleged instances of contradiction, inconsistency, consideration of irrelevant matters and failure to consider relevant matters**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Republic objects to the Award\u2019s statement, in paragraph 50, that \"there is a remarkable absence of evidence on the subject of CDC making an appraisal or feasibility study of the project....\"108 The Republic contends that CDC admitted that it had appraised the project, and that the Tribunal ignored this evidence. With respect to this contention we are of the opinion that the Republic fails to appreciate the distinction, made by the Tribunal, between an appraisal of the loan application (as a part of the loan-making decision process) and an appraisal of the project (to determine whether or not the project was suitable or viable for the needs of PUC and the Republic). In essence, the Tribunal decided that an appraisal of the project (to. determine its viability and suitability for PUC\u2019s needs or those of the Republic) was a condition to the availability of the Republic\u2019s proffered defense that CDC represented that the project was, in fact, appropriate. Once this distinction is acknowledged (as it must be, given the standard of review), it is plain that the Tribunal\u2019s statements are consistent. The Tribunal did not ignore relevant evidence; it simply came to a conclusion, with which the Republic disagrees, about what the evidence means. The Tribunal\u2019s decision in this regard is not reviewable by this Committee under Article 52(1)(e) (or Article 52(1)(d) for that matter).\n\nMemorial, *supra* note 57, at 32, para. 26.\n\n78.\n\nThe Republic also contends that the Award\u2019s statement, in paragraph 48, that \"there is [nothing] in the Clause [15(1)] or in the 1993 Loan Agreement to suggest that CDC was assuming the role of adviser, assessor or partner\" was \"absurd\" because the relationship between the parties could only \"be gathered from the antecedent relationship that existed\" between them.109 Thus the Tribunal considered irrelevant matters (the Loan Agreement) and ignored relevant matters (the antecedent relationship). Again, the Republic cites no authority for the proposition that such an alleged error necessitates annulment. CDC notes, with respect to this contention, that the Tribunal expressly did consider the antecedent relationship between CDC, on the one hand, and PUC and the Republic on the other (to the extent that any evidence of the relationship was in the record) as embodied in the 1990 Loan Agreement and Guarantee before concluding, based on all the evidence (including the testimony of Mr. Morin and Mr. Chang-Leng), that CDC was not an adviser, assessor, or partner in the project.110\n\n*Id.* at 33 para. 27.\n\nCounter-Memorial, *supra* note 55, at 68 paras. 296-300.\n\n79.\n\nWe are unable to comprehend how the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of whether or not the 1993 Loan Agreement created a particular relationship between CDC and PUC (as a part of its inquiry into whether or not CDC was a partner, assessor, or adviser to PUC with respect to the project) can be criticized as being an unreasoned decision. The Republic raised the issue of the relationship between CDC and PUC, so it was reasonable (and necessary given the requirement of Article 48(3)) for the Tribunal to consider whether that alleged relationship was created by contract or by the prior interactions of the parties. Having considered all the evidence, the Tribunal determined that the relationship between CDC and PUC and the Republic was only that incident to a normal loan transaction. This conclusion does not indicate a lack of deliberation and the Tribunal\u2019s statement of reasons in respect to this issue was easily comprehensible and therefore legally sufficient under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n80.\n\nWe turn now to the Republic\u2019s allegation that the Award contradicted itself, in ' paragraph 57, by stating first that \"[t]he Republic then relied upon that assumed favourable assessment in proceeding with the project\" and later that \"the evidence does not establish... that PUC or the Republic was relying on CDC\u2019s appraisal for their own purposes.\"111 CDC responds that any lack of clarity in this portion of the Award results not from a contradictory statement but simply a \"drafting oversight.\"112 As CDC interprets the Award, the allegedly contradictory portion of the Award should read as follows: \"[T]he evidence does not establish that such a representation was ever made or that *CDC was aware that* PUC or the Republic was relying on CDC\u2019s appraisal for their own purposes.\" CDC\u2019s position is that the inclusion of the phrase \"CDC was aware that\" eliminates any potential contradiction and makes the latter part of the paragraph consistent with the first sentence, which discusses the situation where \"the lender makes a representation to the borrower that the appraisal shows that the proposed transaction is viable and suitable for the borrower or *it appears that the lender is aware that the borrower is relying on the vendor\u2019s appraisal for its own purposes.\"113*\n\nMemorial, *supra* note 57, at 33 para. 28.\n\n*Id.* at 70-71 paras. 309-314.\n\nAward, *supra* note 1, at para. 57 (emphasis added).\n\n81.\n\nWe believe that the allegedly contradictory statements are in fact not so when read in context. The first statement, at paragraph 51 of the Award, *i.e.,* that \"The Republic then relied upon that assumed favourable assessment,\" refers to CDC\u2019s own \"favourable assessment *of the loan\"* recorded in the previous sentence, and *not* \"of a *project* for the benefit of the borrower\" (paragraph 52) (emphasis added). Paragraph 57, then, in stating that \"the evidence does not establish... that PUC or the Republic was relying on CDC\u2019s approval for their own purposes,\" seen in this context, is a finding that the evidence before the Tribunal did not, in its assessment thereof, support a conclusion that any such reliance was justified in the sense of giving rise to a liability on the part of CDC. In construing awards, as in construing statutes and legal instruments generally, one necessarily should construe the language in issue, whenever possible, in a way that results in consistency, which seems perfectly possible here.\n\n82.\n\nNext, the Republic takes issue with the Award\u2019s allegedly contradictory statements, in paragraph 38, first that the Republic\u2019s witness, Mr. Morin, \"did not know whether CDC made an appraisal or not,\" and later that Mr. Morin testified that CDC \"were conducting their own assessment of the project\" and that \"if CDC had not done an appraisal of the project, PUC would not have bought the turbine from EGT.\"114 CDC responds that the Tribunal\u2019s comments were not contradictory because Mr. Morin, in fact, testified initially that he thought CDC would appraise the project because the 1993 Loan Agreement said they would (although the Tribunal disagreed with Mr. Morin\u2019s interpretation of the Loan Agreement) but later admitted that he never received confirmation of this supposition nor saw an appraisal prepared by CDC.\n\nMemorial, *supra* note 57, at 34 para. 29.\n\n83.\n\nThroughout the Republic\u2019s Memorial there seems to be some confusion about the difference between evidence offered to the Tribunal and conclusions about that evidence reached by the Tribunal after full consideration. We believe this to be one of those situations. The Republic believes that the Award is inconsistent because it states that there was evidence (Mr. Morin\u2019s testimony) that CDC \"were conducting their own assessment of the project\" but later also states that Mr. Morin did not *know* whether CDC conducted the assessment or not. The Award is consistent; it was Mr. Morin\u2019s testimony that was inconsistent. The Tribunal simply and appropriately concluded based on all of the evidence (Mr. Morin\u2019s testimony that he thought CDC would appraise the project based on the 1993 Agreement, the fact that the loan was granted, and his admission that he in fact never received any appraisal or knew of the conclusions of any such appraisal) that Mr. Morin did not truly know whether or not CDC had conducted an appraisal of the project. This conclusion is consistent with the evidence and is therefore not an example of the Tribunal failing to state reasons (or failing to deliberate or manifestly exceeding its powers).\n\n84.\n\nThe Republic complains next that the Award contradicts itself, in paragraph 54, by noting that \"there was no evidence of CDC\u2019s awareness of [the Republic\u2019s] reliance,\" given Mr. Morin\u2019s testimony that CDC knew of PUC\u2019s reliance because PUC had always relied in the past on CDC\u2019s expertise.115 Also, the Republic contends that the Award erred in stating that \"[i]t was not suggested that it was other than a loan transaction,\" when the Award acknowledged testimony from Mr. Chang-Leng that he \"regarded the relationship between the Republic and CDC as one of partnership in relation to the two projects and as one to be distinguished from the ordinary relationship between a borrower and a bank.\" CDC responds to these arguments by stating that the Tribunal did not ignore any evidence, but rather simply came to a conclusion, based on all of the evidence, that was different from the Republic\u2019s.\n\n*Id.* at 34-35 para. 30.\n\n85.\n\nAs noted above there is a distinction between evidence and findings of fact based on that evidence. It appears that the Tribunal considered the self-interested testimony of Mr. Morin and Mr. Chang-Leng (which latter, with respect to whether CDC knew of PUC\u2019s asserted reliance, was speculative and offered without personal knowledge) before concluding that CDC was unaware of any reliance by PUC on its alleged appraisal of the project and that the antecedent relationship between the Parties as embodied in the 1990 Loan Agreement was consistent with that of an ordinary loan transaction. The Award is thus not contradictory.\n\n86.\n\nFinally, the Republic contends that because the \"uncontroverted\" evidence was that CDC did know of the Republic\u2019s reliance on its expertise, the Tribunal erred in not finding the existence of a duty of care owed by CDC.116 Again, the Republic fails to recognize the distinction between offering evidence and meeting the burden of proof.117 The only evidence that CDC knew of the Republic\u2019s reliance was the self-interested testimony of Mr. Morin. Mr. Morin admittedly had no personal knowledge of the facts to which he testified, however. After considering this fact as well as the relevant documentary evidence, the Tribunal determined that there was a failure of proof on this point and thus found, based on all of the evidence, that CDC did not know of the Republic\u2019s asserted reliance. The Tribunal did not ignore relevant evidence. Rather, the Tribunal considered the evidence, came to a non-contradictory conclusion with respect to that evidence, and logically stated the reasons for its conclusion.\n\n*Id.* at 35-37 para. 31.\n\nThis distinction is discussed in Bin Cheng, General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals 329 (1987):\n\nBurden of proof, however closely related to duty to produce evidence,... implies something more. It means that a party having the burden of proof must not only bring evidence in support of his allegations, but must also convince the Tribunal of their truth, lest they be disregarded for want or insufficiency or proof.\n\n**4. Alleged failure to state reasons with respect to costs**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Republic takes issue with what it regards as the Tribunal\u2019s failure to state reasons for its Award of costs to CDC. Here it must be said that quite commonly reasoned awards do not extend their reasoning to the area of costs. It therefore may be doubted whether Article 52(1)(e) was intended to embrace such an issue. Assuming *arguendo,* that it does, however, we reject the idea that annulment is either permissible or appropriate on this point. It is clear from paragraph 63 of the Award that CDC was awarded about 80 percent of its demand over the unparticularized objections of the Republic. Thus the Award in this respect \"speaks for itself.\" Moreover, it would be impossible to conclude, based on all the circumstances, that the result was affected by any failure to state reasons, in which event annulment, even if permissible, would not be appropriate.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n88.\n\nCDC seeks to recover its costs and expenses, which total \u00a383,345.61 (of which \u00a379,911.35 represents fees). While claiming costs itself, and denying any entitlement of CDC to costs as a general matter, the Republic has not commented specifically on the amount of costs claimed by CDC although it was given an opportunity to do so. This is perhaps not surprising in light of the fact that its own request was for an award of \u00a3140,000 in costs (of which \u00a3125,000 represents the claimed value of the time of the Attorney General and his staff), or a sum 68 percent higher. Both parties claim also all of the costs of ICSID and the Committee.\n\n89.\n\nWith respect to this request we find ourselves in a difficult position. On the one hand, we are not insensitive to the fiscal circumstances of the Republic, which, as the Republic itself has described them in these proceedings, can be summarized as impecunious. On the other hand, however, we must be mindful of our determination, founded upon careful consideration of all arguments advanced by the parties in this proceeding, that the Republic\u2019s case before this Committee was fundamentally lacking in merit. While we refrain from going so far as to say that it was frivolous, we can state unequivocally that, taking into account the presumption of finality in ICSID arbitration and the restrictive grounds of challenge available in the annulment process, the Republic\u2019s case was, to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed.\n\n90.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi* decided that each of the parties should bear its own costs and expenses and its own share of ICSID\u2019s expenses because \"the dispute raised \u2018a set of novel and complex issues not previously addressed in international arbitral precedent.\u2019\"118 The Committee also observed that \"both parties had prevailed to some extent.\" We are not faced with the same or even remotely similar circumstances. We therefore are, in the end, compelled to require that CDC receive the total amount of its claimed costs and expenses (which the Committee does not find unreasonable in the circumstances) and that the Republic bear the entirety of the costs of ICSID and the Committee, as well as its own costs and expenses.\n\n*Vivendi, supra* note 37, at 45 para. 117.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n91.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee DECIDES.\n\n(1) The Tribunal committed no annullable errors in arriving at its Award and the Republic\u2019s Application therefore is dismissed.\n\n(2) The Republic shall pay to CDC, in addition to the amounts due under the Award, EIGHTY-THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE BRITISH POUNDS STERLING AND SIXTY-ONE PENCE (\u00a383,345.61) for CDC\u2019s legal expenses and costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n(3) The Republic shall bear the full costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in connection with this annulment proceeding."}]}
