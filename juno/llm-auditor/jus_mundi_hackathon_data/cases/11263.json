BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nIn accordance with paragraph 24.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 and the procedural schedule for this case, on October 28, 2022, the United States filed a written submission as a non-disputing Party under NAFTA Article 1128.\n\n2.\n\nOn November 11, 2022, the Parties filed responses to the United States' written submission.\n\n3.\n\nOn November 16, 2022, the United States requested access to the Hearing as a non-disputing Party. In accordance with paragraph 25 of the Confidentiality Order dated October 7, 2021 and Articles 1127, 1128 and 1129 of the NAFTA, the Tribunal directed the ICSID Secretriat to make appropriate arrangements for the United States to attend the Hearing. On November 23, 2022, the United States was informed of the Hearing details and received a copy of the Confidentiality Order and Hearing protocol. The Parties confirmed that no additional measures to protect confidential information were necessary.\n\n4.\n\nOn November 23, 2022, the United States stated that it \"may, with the Tribunal's leave, wish to make a short oral submission at the upcoming hearing,\" pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 and in light of Claimants' comments of October 28, 2022. The United States proposed that such oral submission be no longer than 15 minutes and could be made at the start of the hearing. It indicated that it had not made a final determination as to whether it would make the oral submission but that it wished to provide notice to facilitate planning for the Hearing. The United States' request was transmitted to the Tribunal and the Parties on the same day.\n\n5.\n\nOn November 28, 2022, the United States confirmed that it wished to make an oral submission at the Hearing. On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Parties to indicate as soon as possible if they had any objections to a brief oral submission by the United States being scheduled immediately after the Parties' openings and before the rebuttals.\n\n6.\n\nOn November 29, 2022, the Claimants objected to the United States' request to make an oral submission at the Hearing. In their view, the NAFTA does not provide a non-disputing Party with the right to make an oral submission at a NAFTA hearing. According to the Claimants, NAFTA Article 1128 focuses on written submissions, and the Confidentiality Order only foresees that the non-disputing Parties may attend oral hearings. In this case, the United States availed itself of the opportunity to make a written submission, and there is nothing in that submission that requires any oral exposition. The Claimants argue that an oral submission by the United States would put them in an unfair position having to respond to two Respondents, which would prejudice their right to an equal hearing and create time constraints at the Hearing. They also submit that the request is untimely, as the United States did not indicate in its 1128 submission that it wanted to make an oral submission at the Hearing. In these circumstances, the Claimants do not consent to the oral submission, and the Tribunal should therefore deny the United States' request.\n\n7.\n\nGiven the Claimants' objections, on November 30, 2022, the Tribunal requested the United States and the Respondent to file comments by December 1, 2022.\n\n8.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, Canada indicated that it had no objection to a short oral statement by the United States. It stated that oral submissions are permitted by NAFTA Article 1128, which is not limited to \"written submissions.\" The Respondent also stated that there would be no procedural unfairness by such oral submission as any submissions are limited to matters of Treaty interpretation, and the Tribunal previously indicated that the disputing parties would have an opportunity to comment.\n\n9.\n\nAlso on December 1, 2022, the United States filed its observations, arguing that NAFTA Article 1128 does not contain a limitation with regard to oral submissions. The provision imposes two requirements: (i) a \"written notice to the disputing parties;\" and (ii) that the submission must address \"a question of interpretation of this Agreement.\" According to the United States, it has complied with both conditions. The United States also listed three examples of cases in which it requested and received permission to make oral submissions, and argued that such submissions are routine. There would be no prejudice or undue burden on the Claimants as the result of a short, 15-minute oral submission, which would address certain points raised in the Claimants' response to the United States' 1128 submission.\n\n**II. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n10.\n\nArticle 1128 of the NAFTA provides:\n\nOn written notice to the disputing parties, a Party may make submissions to a Tribunal on a question of interpretation of this Agreement.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the provision does not specify the modality of the submissions, and whether a non-disputing Party may make both written and oral submissions. Article 1128 is not expressly limited to written submissions, nor does it expressly provide a right to make both types of submissions. The Tribunal is of the view that it may therefore determine whether to allow an oral submission taking into account all circumstances, such as the timeliness of the notice to make an oral submission, the utility of such submission, and any undue burden on the parties.\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this respect that the United States first indicated that it may wish to make an oral submission on November 23, 2022, and that it confirmed such request on November 28, 2022, one week before the Hearing. Given the short notice, the Tribunal is not convinced that the United States should be given the opportunity to make an oral submission, however, it will allow a short submission of no more than 15 minutes before the Parties' openings. The Parties may comment on the oral submission orally during the Hearing or, after consulting with the Tribunal, in writing after the Hearing."}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2024-03-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**DEFINED TERMS**\n-----------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \u00b6(\u00b6) | Paragraph(s) |\n| \u00a7(\u00a7) | Section(s) |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| C-[#] | Claimants\u2019 Exhibit |\n| Memorial or Mem. | Claimants\u2019 Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits dated October 6, 2021 |\n| Claimants\u2019 PHB | Claimants\u2019 Post Hearing Brief dated 19 January 2023 |\n| Claimants\u2019 Statement of Costs | Claimants\u2019 Statement of Costs dated 14 April 2023. |\n| Reply | Claimants\u2019 Reply on Jurisdiction and the Merits dated 18 July 2022 |\n| CL-[#] | Claimants\u2019 Legal Authority |\n| CER-[#] | Claimants\u2019 Expert Report |\n| CWS-[#] | Claimants\u2019 Witness Statement |\n| FK-[#] | Exhibit of Claimants\u2019 witness Frank King |\n| JdB-[#] | Exhibit of Expert Jeremy de Beer |\n| Hearing | Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits held 5-8 December 2022 |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| MM-[#] | Exhibit of Expert Michael Mehling |\n| MB-[#] | Exhibit of Claimants\u2019 witness Michael Berends |\n| NAFTA | North American Free Trade Agreement |\n| NR-[#] | Exhibit of Respondent\u2019s witness Nadia Ramlal |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| R-[#] | Respondent\u2019s Exhibit |\n| Counter-Memorial or C-Mem. | Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits dated 17 February 2022 |\n| Respondent\u2019s PHB | Respondent\u2019s Post Hearing Brief dated 19 January 2023 |\n| Respondent\u2019s Statement of Costs | Respondent\u2019s Statement of Costs dated 14 April 2023. |\n| Rejoinder | Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the Merits dated 30 September 2022 |\n| RL-[#] | Respondent\u2019s Legal Authority |\n| RER-[#] | Respondent\u2019s Expert Report |\n| RS-[#] | Exhibit of Expert Robert Stavins |\n| RD-[#] | Respondent\u2019s Demonstrative Exhibit |\n| RWS-[#] | Respondent\u2019s Witness Statement |\n| Hearing Tr.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. Overview of the arbitration**\n----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**ICSID** or the **Centre**) on the basis of the North American Free Trade Agreement (the **NAFTA**), the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the **USMCA**), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **ICSID Convention**).\n\n2.\n\nThis dispute relates to the cancellation without compensation by the Province of Ontario of emission allowances which had been acquired in a joint auction (Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, and California) established under the so-called \"Cap and Trade Program\".\n\n**B. Parties**\n--------------\n\n3.\n\nThe claimants are Koch Industries Inc. (**Koch Industries**), a privately held company with its principal registered place of business in Wichita, Kansas, USA, and Koch Supply & Trading, LP (**KS&T**), a company organized under the laws of Delaware, USA, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Koch Industries (together, **Claimants**).\n\n4.\n\nThe respondent is Canada (**Respondent**).\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\". The Parties\u2019 representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (ii).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 7 December 2020, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 7 December 2020 from the Claimants against Canada (**Request**).\n\n7.\n\nOn 17 December 2020, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Secretary-General of ICSID would appoint the presiding arbitrator in accordance with a default appointment procedure that the Parties agreed on within the scope of Article 1123 of NAFTA.\n\n9.\n\nOn 22 December 2020, in accordance with the method agreed by the Parties, the Claimants appointed Mr. Henri C. Alvarez, K.C., a national of Canada. Mr. Alvarez accepted his appointment on 4 January 2021.\n\n10.\n\nOn 6 January 2021, the Respondent appointed Professor Andrea K. Bjorklund, a national of the United States of America. Professor Bjorklund accepted her appointment on 13 January 2021.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 March 2021, the Parties requested that the Secretary-General of ICSID appoint the presiding arbitrator in accordance with a list procedure agreed by the Parties. The Parties specified that the candidates must have experience in the field of public international law and international investment treaty arbitration but did not need to be subject to any nationality restrictions.\n\n12.\n\nOn 2 April 2021, in accordance with the Parties\u2019 agreement concerning the list procedure, ICSID proposed nine candidates to the Parties for ranking. On 19 April 2021, the Parties returned their complete lists which resulted in three candidates being tied as highest ranked candidates. In accordance with the agreed method, the Secretary-General drew lots to determine the presiding arbitrator. Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, a national of Colombia, was thus selected to act as the President of the Tribunal. Mr. Zuleta accepted his appointment on 27 April 2021.\n\n13.\n\nOn 27 April 2021, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (**Arbitration Rules**), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Randi Ayman, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. Ms. Ayman was subsequently succeeded by Ms. Martina Polasek, Deputy Secretary-General.\n\n14.\n\nOn 26 May 2021, with consent of the Parties, the Tribunal appointed Ms. Mar\u00eda Camila Rinc\u00f3n, an associate with the President\u2019s law practice, as an Assistant to the President of the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session on 24 June 2021. In view of the Parties\u2019 agreement on all procedural items except two matters, the Tribunal decided, in consultation with the Parties, to hold the first session without the presence of the Parties.\n\n16.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 29 June 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No.1 provides, *inter alia,* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. Procedural Order No.1 also sets out the agreed Procedural Calendar for the proceedings and restates the transparency regime set out in the NAFTA, subject to a Confidentiality Order to be agreed by the Parties.\n\n17.\n\nOn 5 October 2021, pursuant to paragraph 23.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement on a Confidentiality Order.\n\n18.\n\nIn accordance with the Procedural Calendar, on 6 October 2021, the Claimants filed their Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits (**Memorial**), together with witness statements of Mr. Michael Berends (with Exhibits MB-001 to MB-030), Mr. Graeme Martin, Mr. Paul Brown (with Exhibits PB-001 to PB-009), and Mr. Frank King, the expert report of Dr. Robert Stavins (with Appendices A and B and Exhibits RS-001 to RS-126), Exhibits C-012 through C-175, and Legal Authorities CL-022 through CL-138.\n\n19.\n\nOn 7 October 2021, the Tribunal approved and issued the Confidentiality Order agreed by the Parties.\n\n20.\n\nOn 21 January 2022, the Tribunal approved the Parties\u2019 agreement to revise the Procedural Calendar.\n\n21.\n\nOn 28 January 2022, ICSID informed the Parties that, in accordance with paragraph 25.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, it would invite non-disputing parties to file *amicus curiae* briefs by posting a public notice on the ICSID web site. The notice was posted on 1 February 2022 and invited any such briefs by 17 March 2022. No *amicus curiae* briefs were received.\n\n22.\n\nOn 17 February 2022, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits (**Counter-Memorial**) together with witness statements of Mr. Alexander Wood (with Exhibits AW-001 to AW-014) and Ms. Nadia Ramlal (with Exhibits NR-001 to NR-024), expert reports of Professor Larissa Katz (with Appendix A and Exhibits LK-001 to LK-063) and Mr. Franz Litz (with Appendix A and Exhibits FL-001 to FL-024), Exhibits R-001 through R-087, and Legal Authorities RL-001 through RL-131.\n\n23.\n\nOn 1 April 2022, following exchanges between the Parties, each Party filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents.\n\n24.\n\nOn 12 April 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning production of documents.\n\n25.\n\nOn 18 July 2022, the Claimants filed a Reply on Jurisdiction and the Merits (**Reply**), together with reply witness statements of Mr. Graeme Martin, Mr. Frank King (with Exhibits FK-1 to FK-68), and Mr. Michael Berends (with Exhibits MB-31 to MB-36), witness statement of Mr. Jonathan McGillivray (with Exhibits JMG-1 to JMG-55), second expert report of Dr. Robert Stavins (with Appendices A and B and Exhibits RS-127 to RS-147), expert reports of Professor Jeremy de Beer (with Appendices A and B and Exhibits JdB-001 to JdB-046) and Professor Michael Mehling (with Appendices A and B and Exhibits MM-001 to MM-55), Exhibits C-176 through C-218, and Legal Authorities CL-139 through CL-203.\n\n26.\n\nOn 28 July 2022, with consent of the Parties, Ms. Mar\u00eda Marulanda, an independent attorney, replaced Ms. Rinc\u00f3n as the Assistant to the President of the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nOn 30 September 2022, ICSID notified State representatives of the United States of America (the **U.S.**) and the United Mexican States that, in accordance with NAFTA Article 1128, non-disputing NAFTA Parties were invited to file submissions by 28 October 2022.\n\n28.\n\nAlso on 30 September 2022, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the Merits (**Rejoinder**), together with second witness statements of Mr. Alexander Wood (with Exhibits AW-015 to AW-030) and Ms. Nadia Ramlal (with NR-025 to NR-035), second expert reports of Professor Larissa Katz (with Exhibits LK-064 to LK-089) and Mr. Frank Litz (with Exhibits FL-025 to FL-029), Exhibits R-088 through R-193 and Legal Authorities RL-132 through RL-200.\n\n29.\n\nOn 28 October 2022, the U.S. filed a written submission as a non-disputing State Party pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 (the **U.S. 1128 Submission**).\n\n30.\n\nOn 8 November 2022, following the Parties\u2019 exchange of comments on the draft agenda for the Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting, the Tribunal provided directions to the Parties regarding the issues to be addressed during the Hearing and the experts the Tribunal would be calling.\n\n31.\n\nOn 10 November 2022, the Tribunal held a Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting with the Parties by video conference.

On the same date, ICSID, following the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, notified the Parties of the non-disputing Party\u2019s request and invited their comments on any protocols needed to protect confidential information.\n\n34.\n\nOn 17 November 2022, both Parties submitted their comments on the U.S.\u2019s request to attend the Hearing.

REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------\n\n52.\n\nClaimants\u2019 claims arise out of the measures taken by Respondent which allegedly \"had the effect of wiping out KS&T\u2019s carbon allowances trading business\" in Ontario under the Cap and Trade Act, without compensation, thus breaching Respondent\u2019s obligations under NAFTA. According to Claimants, the Tribunal has jurisdiction under Chapter 11 of NAFTA because they are investors holding protected investments. Claimants argue that the emission allowances of KS&T constitute \"property\" and \"interests\" under NAFTA Article 1139(g)1 and (h).2 Moreover, Koch Industries holds the following investments under NAFTA Article 1139(e): a 100 percent shareholding in KS&T and INVISTA, interests in enterprises entitling Koch Industries to the income or profits of these enterprises, and real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes.3 Claimants argue that the measures taken by Respondent amount to an expropriation under NAFTA Article 1110,4 and to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause in NAFTA Article 1105.5\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 45-78.\n\nReply, \u00b6 313; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 79-86.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 349-350.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 610.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 511.\n\n53.\n\nRespondent contends that the Tribunal lacks *ratione materiae* jurisdiction with respect to KS&T and Koch Industries because (i) emission allowances are neither \"property\" nor \"interests\" that may qualify as an investment under NAFTA Articles 1139(g) and (h),6 (ii) Koch Industries\u2019 shareholding in KS&T and in Canadian entities INVISTA and Georgia Pacific does not qualify as an \"enterprise\" under Article 1139(a),7 and (iii) the emission allowances purchased by an enterprise are not an interest in such an enterprise under Article 1139(e).8 Respondent also contests the Tribunal\u2019 s *ratione personae* jurisdiction over Koch Industries under NAFTA Article 1116, because there is no *prima facie* claim to loss or damages.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 141, 147-150, 167; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 50-51.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 166-168; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 168-170.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 164.\n\n54.\n\nOn the merits, the Respondent says Claimants have not established a breach of NAFTA Articles 1110 and 1105.9\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 67 ff, 88 ff.\n\n**A.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n58.\n\nIn their joint submission of 1 December 2022,13 the Parties agreed on a chronology of relevant facts summarized below. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal has divided the chronology into four sections: Antecedents of the Ontario Cap and Trade Program (A); Ontario\u2019s Cap and Trade Program (B); KS&T\u2019s participation in the Cap and Trade Program (C); and Cancellation of the Cap and Trade Program (D). Where necessary, the Tribunal has supplemented the facts described jointly by the Parties based on evidence from the record and will elaborate on these facts in the relevant sections of the award.\n\nParties\u2019 Joint *Dramatis Personae,* Chronology, and List of Disputed Issues, 1 December 2022.\n\n**A. Antecedents of Ontario\u2019s cap and trade program**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nIn 2008, Ontario joined the Western Climate Initiative (**WCI**). The initiative involved regional governments of the United States of America, the United Mexican States and Canada with the purpose of designing a regional and market-based approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While in 2007 it was only comprised by the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington, by 2008 Montana, Utah, and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec had joined the initiative. On 2 June 2008, the Governments of Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec signed a Memorandum of Understanding, agreeing to collaborate on a provincial greenhouse gas Cap and Trade initiative, seeking to reduce the costs of emission reductions.14\n\n**RS-037**, Ontario Office of the Premier, Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government of Ontario and the Government of Qu\u00e9bec: A Provincial-Territorial Cap and Trade Initiative, 2 June 2008.\n\n60.\n\nThat same year, the WCI partner jurisdictions published the *Design Recommendations for the WCI Regional Cap-and-Trade Program.15* They suggested the design of a broad program that would maximize total benefits throughout the region by reducing air pollutants, diversifying energy sources, and advancing economic, environmental, and public health objectives, while also avoiding localized or disproportionate environmental or economic impacts.\n\n**C-014**, WCI, Design Recommendations for the WCI Regional Cap-and-Trade Program,23 September 2008; **RS-039**, WCI, Design Recommendations for the WCI Regional Cap-and-Trade Program, 23 September 2008; **R-005**, WCI, Design Recommendation for the WCI Regional Cap-and-Trade Program, 23 September 2008.\n\n61.\n\nOn 15 December 2009, the Ontario Government enacted the *Environmental Protection Amendment Act (Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading), 2009,* which authorized the Government of Ontario to make regulations establishing programs and other measures for the purposes of maintaining or improving existing environmental standards, protecting the environment, and achieving environmental quality goals in a cost-effective manner.16\n\n**RS-038**, David V. Wright, Enforcement and withdrawal under the California-Qu\u00e9bec (and not Ontario) Cap-and-Trade Linkage Agreement, 25-26 October 2018.\n\n62.\n\nIn July 2010, the WCI partner jurisdictions issued the *2010 Design for the WCI Regional Program.17* This Design offered a roadmap to implement the program\u2019s regulations. The document stressed its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. This goal would be reached by using market power to trade permits that provide companies and inventors with incentives to create new technologies that increase efficiency, promote the use of renewable or lower-polluting fuels, and foster process improvements that reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Further, the Design mentioned the need to address the effects of climate change on water resources, natural ecosystems, air quality and environment dependent industries. The program was summarized in the following terms:\n\n\"The WCI Cap-and-Trade Program will be composed of the individual jurisdictions\u2019 cap-and-trade programs implemented through state and provincial regulations. Each WCI Partner jurisdiction implementing the cap-and-trade program design will issue \"emission allowances\" to meet its jurisdiction-specific emissions goal. The total number of available allowances serves as the \"cap\" on emissions. The allowances can be bought and sold (\"traded\"). A regional allowance market is created by the Partner jurisdictions recognizing one another\u2019s allowances for compliance. Through this recognition, the emissions allowances issued by each jurisdiction will be usable throughout the jurisdictions for compliance purposes\".18\n\n**C-015**, WCI, Design for the WCI Regional Program,2010; **RS-019**, WCI, Design for the WCI Regional Program, July 2010; **MM-052**, Western Climate Initiative, Design for the WCI Regional Program, July 2010.\n\n**C-015**, WCI, Design for the WCI Regional Program,2010, p. 6.\n\n63.\n\nAt the time, WCI partner jurisdictions were also in discussions with other greenhouse gas reduction initiatives such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (**RGGI**) and the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord. The RGGI program relies almost exclusively on auctions for allowance distribution, whereas for the WCI, auctions are just one component among others.\n\n64.\n\nOn 31 May 2011, the Governor of New Jersey announced that the state planned to withdraw from the RGGI at the end of the first compliance period ending on 31 December 2011.19\n\n**RS-116**, State of New Jersey, Letter to Mr. Jonathan Schrag, 31 May 2011.\n\n65.\n\nIn 2012, California launched its Cap and Trade program. Compliance obligations would be enforced from 2013.20 That same year, KS&T registered to participate in the California Cap and Trade program as a market participant and was assigned a California Compliance Instrument Tracking System Service (**CITSS**) account.21\n\n**RS-022**, ICAP, USA - California Cap-and-Trade Program, ETS Detailed Information, 9 August 2021.\n\n**CWS-002**, Witness Statement of Graeme Martin, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\n66.\n\nA year later, in 2013, Qu\u00e9bec launched its Cap and Trade program.22\n\n**RS-024**, ICAP, Canada - Qu\u00e9bec Cap-and-Trade System, ETS Detailed Information, 9 August 2021.\n\n67.\n\nOn 25 September 2013, the California Air Resources Board and the *Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec* signed the Agreement Concerning the Harmonization and Integration of Cap-and-Trade Programs for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions.23\n\n**R-025**, Ontario Newsroom, Agreement on the Harmonization and Integration of Cap-and-Trade Programs for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions between the Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec, the Government of California and the Government of Ontario, 22 September 2017; **CL-025**, Agreement between the California Air Resources Board and The Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec Concerning the Harmonization and Integration of Cap-and-Trade Programs for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions,25 September 2013.\n\n68.\n\nIn January 2014, Qu\u00e9bec formally linked its system with California\u2019s program.24\n\n**RS-024**, ICAP, Canada - Qu\u00e9bec Cap-and-Trade System, ETS Detailed Information, 9 August 2021.\n\n69.\n\nOn 13 April 2015, Ontario announced its intention to set up a provincial Cap and Trade program and link it to the Qu\u00e9bec and California programs under the WCI model.25\n\n**C-019**, Ontario Government, Cap and Trade System to Limit Greenhouse Gas Pollution in Ontario, 13 April 2015.\n\n**B.

As detailed in subsections C and D below, after the second joint auction, Ontario held elections, which were won by the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party whose election platform had included the cancellation of the Cap and Trade Program. On 15 June 2018, the premier-designate announced that Ontario would withdraw from the program. The same day, California and Qu\u00e9bec issued an auction notice for a third joint auction, specifying that Ontario would not participate. Following the premier\u2019s swearing-in on 29 June 2018, Regulation 386/18 (defined below) was enacted prohibiting transactions involving emission allowances.\n\n**C.

Second, Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* with respect to Koch Industries as it did not hold relevant investments under NAFTA Articles 1101, 1116, and 1139.118\n\n123.3. Third, Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Koch Industries under NAFTA Article 1116.119\n\n123.4. Fourth, Respondent claims that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.120\n\n123.5. Fifth, Respondent contends that the Premier-Designate\u2019s announcement of 15 June 2018 was not a \"measure\" that was \"adopted or maintained\" by Respondent within the scope of NAFTA Article 1101.121\n\nC-Mem, \u00a7 III.D.1; Rejoinder, \u00a7 III.C.1.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7 III.D.2; Rejoinder, \u00a7 III.C.2.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7 III.D.3; Rejoinder, \u00a7 III.D.1.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7 III.E; Rejoinder, \u00a7 III.D.2.\n\nC-Mem, \u00a7 III.C; Rejoinder, \u00a7 III.B.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 III.E.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal will next consider Respondent\u2019s objections. As a preliminary matter, however, the Tribunal will briefly address the Parties\u2019 discussion of the burden of proof applicable to jurisdictional matters.\n\n**A. Burden of proof**\n----------------------\n\n1. Respondent\u2019s Position\n------------------------\n\n125.\n\nRespondent claims that the onus to show that jurisdictional requirements have been satisfied is on the claimant and \"[i]f there is any ambiguity as to whether or not a claimant has met its burden, the tribunal should decline jurisdiction\".122 According to Respondent, Claimants have failed to meet their burden of proof with respect to jurisdiction.123\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 109.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 111.\n\n126.\n\nRespondent further contends that \"[a] *prima facie* standard does not apply to factual issues upon which a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction depends\"124 and \"Claimants must 'positively establish key jurisdictional facts\u2019\".125\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 96.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 96.\n\n2. Claimants\u2019 Position\n----------------------\n\n127.\n\nClaimants claim that the factual burden of proof is shared by the parties, while the legal burden of proof rests with neither.126 According to Claimants, \"[i]t is [...] for a claimant to adduce evidence in order to establish jurisdiction, and [...] for a respondent to adduce evidence in order to challenge the claimant\u2019s substantiated assertion of [sic] that a tribunal has jurisdiction\".127 Likewise, \"a tribunal must determine whether it has jurisdiction, and the scope of its jurisdiction, on the basis of all relevant facts and arguments submitted by the parties\".128\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 239-240.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 241.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 239.\n\n128.\n\nClaimants further contend that there is no rebuttable presumption regarding jurisdictional objections, and that Respondent\u2019s assertion that \"[i]f there is any ambiguity as to whether or not a claimant has met its burden, the tribunal should decline jurisdiction\" lacks any legal foundation.129 Claimants maintain that they have \"demonstrated that - legally and factually -the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction\",130 while Respondent has failed to substantiate its objections to jurisdiction.131\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 242.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 241.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 241-242.\n\n3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n129.\n\nIt is an accepted principle of international law that a claimant in an arbitration bears the burden of proving that the tribunal has jurisdiction to hear its claims.132 Furthermore, consistent with international practice, a party bears the burden of proving the facts it asserts.133 Accordingly, if jurisdiction is based on specific facts, the claimant must prove them at the jurisdictional stage.134 Conversely, if the respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections are based on specific facts, the respondent must provide proof. Ultimately, the tribunal will decide whether it has jurisdiction and the extent of that jurisdiction based on the proven facts.135\n\n**RL-001**, *Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v.

Jurisdiction under NAFTA Article 1139(g)**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1. Respondent\u2019s Position\n------------------------\n\n130.\n\nRespondent claims that the emission allowances held by KS&T do not qualify as an \"investment\" because they are not property under Ontario law, as required by NAFTA Article 1139(g).\n\n131.\n\nRespondent submits that the existence of property rights for purposes of Article 1139(g) must be determined by reference to the relevant domestic law, in this case the law of Ontario.136 In Ontario, however, neither the legislature nor the courts have declared emission allowances to be property.137 In Respondent\u2019s view, \"[w]here there is a new interest created by statute, it ought to be clear either that the legislature intended to imbue it with proprietary status or that the interest shares the core features of common law property\".138 In the absence of a conclusive answer with respect to property under Ontario law, the Tribunal cannot find that property exists for purposes of the NAFTA.139\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6 136.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 1, 202:12-15.\n\n*Id.*, 201:21 - 202:3.\n\n*Id.*, 199:5-7.\n\n132.\n\nRespondent relies on Professor Katz\u2019s expert report to explain the stages of analysis that an Ontario court would typically go through when assessing a new claim that an interest is property in any context.140 Following this approach, Professor Katz concludes that emission allowances lack the core common law characteristics of property rights and are therefore not considered property rights in Ontario.141\n\n*Id.*, 203:4-8.\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6 139.\n\n133.\n\nRespondent further takes issue with the evidence on the status of emission allowances under Ontario law put forward by Claimants. According to Respondent, that evidence was not only late in arriving (Claimants only submitted it with their Reply), but it also suffers from significant flaws.142 Respondent claims that the Claimants\u2019 expert on Ontario law, Professor de Beer, \"presents an oversimplified 'legal test\u2019 that he draws from only two Canadian cases in which the interests in question were found to constitute property\",143 while Professor Mehling\u2019s evidence on international practice is of limited relevance to an Ontario court and, thus, to this Tribunal, considering the jurisdiction-specific nature of the inquiry.144\n\nHearing Tr.

Day 1, 200:5-17.\n\n134.\n\nIn any event, Respondent asserts that \"the vast majority of the evidence before this Tribunal pertains to the speculative task of ascertaining whether an Ontario court *might* find emission allowances to be property\",145 and \"[t]his Tribunal cannot base its jurisdiction on speculation\".146\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 16.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 16.\n\n135.\n\nAs to Professor Katz\u2019s methodology, Respondent submits that an Ontario court approaching a novel claim to property would proceed through three stages of analysis: at the first stage, an Ontario court would consider \"whether there is a legislative declaration or a judicial decision that adds the interest to the category of property rights\".147 Here, the Parties agree that (i) neither the Cap and Trade Act nor its regulations declare emission allowances to be property,148 and (ii) there is no court decision addressing this issue in Ontario.149\n\nHearing, Tr. Day 1, 203:13-17.\n\n*Id.*, 205: 2-4.\n\n*Id.*, 207:1-2.\n\n136.\n\nWith respect to (i), Respondent submits that courts view the absence of property language in a statute creating a new interest as significant, as evidenced in the *Anglehart v. Canada* case *(**Anglehart**).150* The fact that the Cap and Trade Act does not use the nomenclature \"property\" with respect to emission allowances is particularly important when paired with Section 70 of the Act, which specifies that these interests are non-compensable.151 In Respondent\u2019s view, this indicates that the legislature did not intend to create a proprietary interest.152 By contrast, such a conclusion cannot be drawn from the absence of an express disclaimer as to the non-proprietary nature of emission allowances because the creation of a new property right cannot be presumed.153\n\n*Id.*, 205:18 - 206:8.\n\n*Id.*, 206: 9-21.\n\n*Id.*, 206: 9-21.\n\n*Id.*, 205: 2-17.\n\n137.\n\nWith respect to (ii), Respondent contends that Claimants\u2019 position that it is the statute that creates the property right, and that a court merely confirms or rejects its legal status as property, \"denies the judicial role in a common law system in deciding whether an interest has the legal status of property rights in a particular statutory or common law context\".154\n\n*Id.*, 207: 7-11.\n\n138.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s case that \"the absence of any legislative declaration or judicial decision that confers property status on emission allowances is sufficient to conclude that the emission allowances are not at present property rights in Ontario\"155 and \"[t]he Tribunal need not proceed to the further stages of analysis\",156 as considering whether an Ontario court might in the future admit emission allowances to the category of property rights \"is not a matter of fact but of speculation\".157 For the sake of completeness, however, Respondent explains stages two and three of an Ontario court\u2019s inquiry.\n\n*Id.*, 207:16 - 208:5.\n\n*Id.*, 207:16 - 208:5.\n\n*Id.*, 208:9-12.\n\n139.\n\nAt stage two, an Ontario court would examine the nature and character of a statutory interest, considering the provisions of the statute in their entire context within the statute\u2019s object and purpose.158 Based on Professor Katz\u2019s analysis, Respondent contends that \"as it is created in the Climate Change Act and regulations, the nature and character of an emission allowance is that of a compliance instrument: a non-compensable, regulatory interest conferring an immunity from penalties for an amount of GHG emissions\".159\n\n*See*, Rejoinder, \u00b6 124; Hearing Tr.

Day 1, 209:1 - 212:18.\n\n140.\n\nAt stage three, an Ontario court would consider whether the interest at issue bears the characteristics of common law property.160 Respondent submits that the legal context in which the question arises is highly relevant to a court\u2019s analysis, and indicates that, unlike the statutes at issue in *Saulnier v. Royal Bank of Canada,* the Cap and Trade Act is not a commercial statute, but a regulatory statute that created a market mechanism to achieve its regulatory purpose.161\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 124; Hearing Tr. Day 1, 204:2-15.\n\n*See*, Hearing Tr. Day 1, 215:7 - 217:12.\n\n141.\n\nRespondent further contends that the emission allowances created by the Cap and Trade Act lack the core common law characteristics of property, most notably exclusivity, which both legal experts agree is a necessary attribute of property in Ontario.162 According to Respondent, \"[a]t common law, exclusivity entails both the ability to exclude interference from all others, including the government, and the ability to include others as and on the terms that the holder wishes\".163 Based on Professor Katz\u2019s expert testimony, Respondent argues that emission allowances lack exclusivity for three main reasons:\n\n141.1. The government reserved discretion to act with respect to emission allowances (e.g., Sections 27, 14(7), 14(8), 33, 25(3), 32, 21, 22(3) of the Act) and make additional regulations to achieve its policy goals (as evidenced in the use of the phrase \"as may be prescribed\" throughout the Act and in Section 78.1, items 6 to 8);164\n\n141.2. The holder of emission allowances lacks exclusive control vis-\u00e0-vis the government as it does not have a presumptive right against expropriation without compensation under Section 70 of the Act;165 and\n\n141.3. Holders of emission allowances cannot include anyone else in their interest under Section 28.2 of the Act.166\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 37.\n\nHearing Tr.

Day 1, 220:14 - 222:17.\n\n*Id.*, 222:18 - 223:18.\n\n142.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that the Tribunal should adopt Professor Katz\u2019s approach and conclude that emission allowances do not constitute property under Ontario law. However, Respondent further contends that, \"to the extent that the Tribunal finds both experts\u2019 explanations of the provisions and their import in an Ontario property analysis equally plausible, that, too, means that the Claimants have failed to meet their burden. If the answer is inconclusive under Ontario law, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction under NAFTA Article 1139(g)\".167\n\n*Id.*, 224:11-18.\n\n2. Claimants\u2019 Position\n----------------------\n\n143.\n\nClaimants maintain that the emission allowances that KS&T acquired are intangible property acquired for economic benefit or other business purposes under NAFTA Article 1139(g).168\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 323(c); Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 246-296.\n\n144.\n\nClaimants argue that international law has considered that the term \"property\" should be given expansive content, and that the same applies to the definition of \"property\" under the NAFTA.169 Claimants further agree with Respondent that (i) it is appropriate to look at Ontario law for a determination of what constitutes property, and (ii) the question of whether emission allowances are property under Ontario law has not yet been considered by Ontario courts.170 Thus, according to Claimants, the question for the Tribunal is whether, \"[o]n a balance of probabilities, applying the interpretative rules followed by judges in Ontario, [...] emission allowances created and held under the Cap and Trade Program [are] property under NAFTA Article 1139(g)?\".171\n\nReply, \u00b6 248.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 248.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 1, 82:1-5.\n\n145.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s contention, Claimants are not asking the Tribunal to \"base its jurisdiction on speculation\", but instead asking it to make a finding of fact based on expert evidence, and note that Canada itself agreed that asking how an Ontario court would answer the question of whether emission allowances are property under Ontario law is an appropriate analytical tool for this purpose.172 Also, Respondent\u2019s contention that the fact that the experts have reached opposite conclusions implies that their opinion cancel each other out is incorrect.173\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 46.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 48.\n\n146.\n\nFirst, Claimants maintain that \"the Ontario courts provide the appropriate analytical framework, the application of which confirms that emission allowances are indeed property\".174 Claimants rely on Professor de Beer\u2019s expert testimony for their contention that emission allowances qualify as property under Ontario law. Claimants explain that Professor de Beer derives the legal test to determine the existence of property from \"the most recent authoritative Canadian cases: \" \"first, *Saulnier v. Royal Bank of Canada*, which found that a fishing license was property, and second, *Tucows.com v. Lojas Renner, SA,* where the Ontario Court of Appeal found a domain name to be property\".175 The test from *Saulnier* is whether the exclusive rights that an emission allowances holder had were \"a good deal more than merely permission to do what would otherwise be illegal\" in the relevant statutory context.176 For its part, *Tucows* elaborates on what constitutes a bundle of rights at common law for the purpose of defining what constitutes property and confirms that, in Ontario, exclusivity is necessary for property to exist.177\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 47.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 1, 82:20 - 83:5.\n\n*Id.*, 83:6-10.\n\n*Id.*, 83:11-14.\n\n147.\n\nAccording to Claimants, exclusive control and use \u2014a necessary attribute of property rights under Ontario and common law\u2014 is \"clearly demonstrated here by the many different things that a participant could exclusively do to control and use emission allowances\", including \"holding, purchasing, selling, trading, and otherwise dealing with emission allowances\".178 Indeed, Professor de Beer found ample evidence of \"exclusive control and use\" in Sections 22(1) and 28(2) of the Cap and Trade Act and Section 15 of Regulation 144/16,179 and accordingly concluded that \"the exclusive rights that an emission allowance holder had were 'a good deal more\u2019 than merely permission to do what would otherwise be illegal\".180\n\n*Id.*, 84:6-13. *See also,* Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 54.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 55.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 55.\n\n148.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent\u2019s and Professor Katz\u2019s contention that emission allowances are not property because \"they have not yet been added to the category of property\"181 is incorrect because \"the status of emission allowances as property does not require an Ontario judicial decision affirming this fact, but instead is inherent in the Cap and Trade Act\".182 Moreover, a legislative declaration expressly stating the proprietary status of allowances was unnecessary.183 As explained by Professor de Beer, (i) governments typically take a minimalist approach in that regard, and (ii) Ontario courts have recognized multiple statutory creations as property, even though legislative declarations on the property status of statutory rights is rare.184 This is consistent with Professor Mehling\u2019s evidence explaining that \"there is consistent administrative or judicial practice in many jurisdictions recognizing property rights in allowances *without* explicit recognition in law\".185\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 126; **RER-003**, Second Expert Report of Professor Katz, \u00b6 6.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 1, 84:19 - 85:1; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 54.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 53.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 53.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 53, *referencing* Hearing Tr. Day 3, 769:4 - 773:17.\n\n149.\n\nSecond, Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s position is not supported by principles of statutory interpretation or the application of the Ontario court framework,186 for the following reasons:\n\n149.1. Professor Katz did not analyze objectively the statutory features of allowances, maintaining a results-driven approach that focused only on the use of allowances for compliance purposes.187 Moreover, framing emission allowances as immunities based on Hohfeld\u2019s terminology is not based on the text of the Cap and Trade Act, or on any principle of statutory interpretation that an Ontario court would likely apply.188\n\n149.2. Respondent and Professor Katz sought to deny the significance of Ontario\u2019s express choice of a \"market mechanism\" as part of the Cap and Trade Program and the commercial context inherent in the Cap and Trade Act and Regulation.189 As confirmed by Professor de Beer, an Ontario court would likely consider the importance of secondary markets as part of the commercial realities that provide an appropriate context for interpreting the status of emission allowances under the Cap and Trade Act.190\n\n149.3. Respondent and Professor Katz did not engage in any meaningful analysis of the relevant context in which the question of allowances as property arise, namely, a jurisdictional dispute under the NAFTA.191 Instead, Respondent and its expert sought to analogize the present dispute to *Anglehart \u2014* which is entirely distinguishable from this case \u2014 and refused to accept its similarities with *Tucows*.192\n\n149.4. Professor Katz\u2019s contention that emission allowances lack exclusivity is based on arguments that contradict principles of statutory interpretation and common sense.193 First, \"merely ensuring the ability of *the Minister* to take various circumscribed actions under the Act to further its objectives is insufficient to show a lack of exclusive control/use by *allowance holders\".194* The government did not have \"absolute discretion\" under the statute, and none of the examples indicated by Respondent show \"extensive discretion\" with respect to the treatment of allowances.195 Second, Professor Katz\u2019s interpretation of Section 70 of the Act is inconsistent and flawed.196 Contrary to her analysis, Section 70 as drafted supports the inference that allowances are property; if they were not, an express declaration of \"no compensation\" would be unnecessary to protect against domestic law expropriation claims.197 Third, Professor Katz\u2019s contention that the ability to fragment is part of the concept of exclusivity under Ontario law is unsupported; Section 28(2) of the Act only prevents one type of fragmentation (the creation of a trust), and, in any event, other types of fragmentation of intangible rights, such as security interests, could have been possible in the case of emission allowances under the Act.198\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 47.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 57.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 58.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 59.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 60.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 61.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 61.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 62.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 63.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 65.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 66.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 67.\n\n150.\n\nThird, Claimants contend that, in contrast with those of Professor Katz\u2019s, Professor de Beer\u2019s conclusions are supported by international cases and practice on the legal treatment of allowances \u2014as demonstrated by Professor Mehling\u2019s report\u2014, which are likely to be considered by an Ontario court faced with the question of whether allowances are property in Ontario.199 Claimants emphasize the relevance of the English High Court decision in the *Armstrong DLW GmbH v. Winnington Networks Ltd* case *(**Armstrong**),200* where a leading common law jurisdiction, applying the same criteria that would be applied by an Ontario court (the *Ainsworth* criteria), found that emission allowances under the EU Emission Trading System (**EuA**) \u2014an instrument for all purposes the same as an Ontario emission allowance\u2014 were property under common law.201 Respondent and Professor Katz have failed to satisfactorily rebut Claimants\u2019 contentions on the weight of international case law and practice, in general, and of the *Armstrong* case, in particular, in the analysis of an Ontario court and of this Tribunal.202\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 47.\n\n**LK-040,** *Armstrong DLW GMBH v.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n*(a) The legal issue before the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nArticle 1139(g) defines investment for purposes of NAFTA as \"real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes\".\n\n152.\n\nThe Parties extensively debated the burden of proof for purposes of jurisdiction. However, the Tribunal has already established that it is for each Party to prove the facts on which it bases its claim or its jurisdictional objection.203 The facts that Claimants must prove to succeed on jurisdiction on the basis of Article 1139(g) are (i) that they had property in Ontario, tangible or intangible; and (ii) that such property was acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes.204\n\n*See Supra.* \u00a7V(A)(3)\n\n**CL-002**, North American Free Trade Agreement (1994), Chapter Eleven, Article 1139(g) \"real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes\".\n\n153.\n\nIn their Memorial, Claimants identified the following investments held by Koch Industries and KS&T, respectively, as qualifying under NAFTA Article 1139(g):\n\n\"[R]eal estate or other property, tangible or intangible, that was acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes. For example, Koch held a range of other bricks-and-mortar investments in Ontario, as well as intangible investments\".205\n\n\"[I]ntangible property rights 'acquired with the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes\u2019 through carbon allowances issued by Ontario. The carbon allowances that KS&T held were tradeable property rights, both as commodities and under futures contracts, and were capital assets\".206\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 322 (c).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 323 (c).\n\n154.\n\nNo evidence was filed to support the ownership of real estate by Claimants and no substantial allegation was made as to how real estate owned by Claimants was affected by measures taken by Respondent. In their Reply, during the Hearing, and in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants focused on the emission allowances as the property affected by the measures taken by Respondent.207 The expert evidence submitted by Claimants focuses exclusively on emission allowances and does not refer to the real estate mentioned in the Memorial. Claimants seem to have abandoned their position that they had real estate that was affected by measures of the State. But even if that allegation is not considered abandoned, Claimants have failed to provide convincing evidence that they held real estate in Ontario that is relevant for the purposes of the claims submitted in this arbitration.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 17, and \u00a7III(B)-III(C); Hearing Tr. Day 1, 18:15-22, 19:1-22, 26:21 - 27:22; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore must focus on whether the emission allowances held by KS&T constituted property in Ontario for purposes of Article 1139(g) of NAFTA.\n\n156.\n\nThe analysis of the Tribunal, however, is limited in its scope, fact specific, and framed by the evidence submitted in this arbitration for the purpose of determining jurisdiction under NAFTA. Therefore:\n\n156.1. The Tribunal needs to determine only whether allowances constitute property exclusively to determine its jurisdiction under Article 1139(g) of NAFTA. A determination of this Tribunal as to the nature of the allowances is not intended to create a general rule of interpretation or a general definition of whether or not allowances are property under Ontario, Canadian or common law \u2014or for that matter, under any other law\u2014 and cannot be deemed as establishing principles or rules as regards the legal nature of allowances for purposes other than establishing its jurisdiction under the aforementioned article of NAFTA in the specific circumstances of this case.\n\n156.2. Any such determination is based on the allegations and evidence submitted in this arbitration for the exclusive purposes of determining jurisdiction, and therefore, does not analyze other arguments or evidence not submitted by the Parties or that may be relevant for other purposes or in other circumstances as regards emission allowances.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the environment require cooperation between public and private actors, the creation of novel instruments and legal tools, and predictability and depoliticization in the technical and economic management of such instruments, as well as tools to avoid the possibility that internal political conflicts undermine the efforts made to cooperate in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The ambiguities in the Cap and Trade Act as to its main purposes, the role of market participants, the nature of the allowances and the powers of Ontario\u2019 s authorities, coupled with the manner in which the regime was terminated, the decision not to indemnify market participants and to restrict their access to Canadian courts, do not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, contribute to the creation of a predictable scheme to control emissions. Rather, they may appear to discourage the participation of private actors in positive actions towards climate change.\n\n158.\n\nThe first analysis the Tribunal must undertake is limited to determining whether it has jurisdiction for the exclusive purposes of Article 1139(g) of NAFTA, which involves a novel issue under Ontario law in the particular circumstances that arise from the actions and omissions of Ontario in drafting, implementing, and revoking the Cap and Trade Act.\n\n*(b) Applicable legal framework*\n--------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nFirst, the Parties agree that there is no express definition of \"property\" in NAFTA and therefore, that emission allowances as property \"should be examined principally on the basis of Ontario law\".208\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response to the U.S. 1128 NAFTA Submission, \u00b6 39. *See also* Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 45; Reply, \u00b6 248; C-Mem, \u00b6\u00b6 134-135.\n\n160.\n\nIn their Response to the U.S. 1128 NAFTA Submission, Claimants argued that domestic laws are \"not dispositive of the question whether a particular right or interest qualifies as 'property\u2019 for the purposes of Article 1139(g)\" because NAFTA does not expressly provide that the term \"property\" is governed by domestic laws.209 Therefore, the term \"property\" in Article 1139 must also be interpreted under international law. In Claimants\u2019 view, international law has assigned an expansive content to the term \"property\".210 Also, the term \"investment\" in Article 1139 was meant to have a \"broad meaning\" in light of the object and purpose of NAFTA reflected in the Preamble and Article 102.211\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response to the U.S. 1128 NAFTA Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n\nReply, \u00b6 248.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response to the U.S. 1128 NAFTA Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 35-36.\n\n161.\n\nRespondent does not appear to dispute that Article 1139 should also be analyzed under international law but contends that Claimants have provided no grounds to conclude that property should be given expansive content under international law, because the cases cited as legal authorities differ from this case, since they involved a locally established enterprise with a physical presence in the host state.212\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 122, ft. 299.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal does not disagree that Article 1139(g) must be interpreted pursuant to international law, which includes considering the object and purpose of NAFTA.\n\n163.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal\u2019s first task is to determine the definition of the term \"property\" in Article 1139(g). No express definition is found in NAFTA, and the Parties have not provided a definition of property in international law. Therefore, before assessing whether \"property\" should be given an expansive or restricted content in light of the object and purpose of NAFTA, the Tribunal must first find the definition of that term in the law of the host State and determine whether the object in question satisfies that definition.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, as a rule, a claimant who claims the existence of a property right under the legal system of a state must prove that the asset over which the claimant alleges property rights is considered as property in that legal system, and that, according to the corresponding laws or rules of that legal system, the property right is vested in the claimant. This approach, far from novel, was adopted in other NAFTA cases, including *Lion v. Mexico:*\n\n\"(i) NAFTA does not offer a definition of the term 'intangible real estate' used in its Art. 1139(g). Absent such definition, to determine whether an investor holds 'intangible real estate\u2019, it is necessary to refer to the law of the host state. As the tribunal stated in Emmis:\n\n'Public international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain protections to property rights created according to municipal law\u2019\".213\n\n**CL-217**, *Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 July 2018, \u00b6 231.\n\n165.\n\nSecond, the Parties also agree that there is no statutory provision under Ontario law that considers emission allowances as \"property\" and that the courts of Ontario have not considered whether emission allowances amount to \"property\" under Ontario law.214\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6 135; Reply, \u00b6 248.\n\n166.\n\nRespondent and its expert submit that, in the absence of a statutory provision or a court decision, the Tribunal must conclude, without further analysis, that emission allowances are not property, and therefore, that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants had no property in Ontario.215 According to Respondent, any further analysis, and particularly a determination of how an Ontario court may decide the matter, when and if seized with the question, would be mere speculation.216\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 30-31. For Respondent\u2019s expert, Professor Katz, the position of Claimants\u2019 expert that the absence of a court decision does not bear on the analysis of whether emission allowances are property *\"denies the judicial role in a common law system in deciding whether an interest, given its nature and character, has the legal status of property rights in a particular statutory or common law context. There is a clear \"before \" and \"after\" quality to a court\u2019s ruling that affects the legal status of the interest in a given context. In this case, the absence of any legislative declaration or judicial decision that confers property status on emission allowances is sufficient to conclude that emission allowances are not at present property rights in Ontario* **RER-003**, Second Expert Report of Professor Katz, \u00b6 35.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 131.\n\n167.\n\nClaimants submit that the absence of a court decision is not an indication that emission allowances are not property.217 Claimants further submit that it was Canada who suggested that an analysis of how an Ontario court would approach the issue is a proper test to determine whether emission allowances are property.218 Claimants also contend that they are not requesting this Tribunal to speculate on what an Ontario court would do, but rather they are \"asking the Tribunal to make a finding of fact based on the expert evidence\".219\n\nAccording to Claimants\u2019 expert, Professor de Beer, *\"that an Ontario court has not yet confirmed emission allowances 'status as property does not mean they lack such status. A court deciding the issue would not confer proprietary status upon emission allowances; a court would confirm such status which already did or did not exist. The statute, not the court, conferred this status by establishing rights to allowances that are property rights even if they were not expressly labelled as such. The court interprets the statute.* **CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 32.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 46.\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 46.\n\n168.\n\nIn this case it is undisputed that there is no rule \u2014statutory or judicial\u2014 in Ontario which expressly provides for emission allowances as property rights. This Tribunal cannot and will not substitute itself for the courts to create an Ontario rule, binding in Ontario, declaring that emission allowances are property under the laws of Ontario. What this Tribunal must analyze in this arbitration is whether the allowances created by the Cap and Trade Act and Regulations constitute property under existing Ontario common law, for the purposes of finding jurisdiction under NAFTA.\n\n169.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is no need for a previous Ontario court judgment in this regard. Moreover, it was Respondent who first suggested in its Counter Memorial, based on the First Expert Report of Professor Katz, that the Tribunal should consider the interpretative approach taken by Ontario courts to address novel property claims. Respondent cannot now claim that such an approach is speculative.\n\n170.\n\nIn sum, absent a definition of property both in NAFTA and in a statutory provision of Ontario or Canadian law, and absent a court decision in Ontario or Canada that determines whether emission allowances are property, the Tribunal must determine \u2014based on the evidence submitted by the Parties in this arbitration\u2014 whether the courts of Ontario or the courts of Canada have developed general interpretative principles that, applied to allowances, may allow this Tribunal to conclude that allowances are property in this context and for the purposes of the dispute at hand to find jurisdiction under the treaty.\n\n(i) Whether the Ontario or Canadian Courts have established a general \"legal test\" or general interpretative principles for property\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Parties debate whether there is a general \"legal test\" for property under Ontario common law that the Tribunal should follow for purposes of its decision on jurisdiction.\n\n172.\n\nProfessor de Beer -Claimants\u2019 expert- proposes a three-step analysis that Ontario courts would follow to determine whether allowances are property: first, a description of the applicable statute (in this case the Cap and Trade Act and the Regulation); second, a description of the allowances as the object in question; and third, a description of \"the law of property\"220 and the \"legal test\".221\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 35 (a), (b) and (c).\n\n173.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 expert argues that a \"legal test for property\" under \"Canadian and Ontario legal precedents\"222 is found in what he considers to be the most recent authoritative cases from the Supreme Court of Canada and the Ontario Court of Appeal: *Saulnier v. Royal Bank223 (**Saulnier**),* where the Supreme Court decided whether a fishing license was property, and *Tucows.com Co v. Lojas Renner SA224 (**Tucows**),* where the Ontario Court of Appeal decided whether a domain name was property225. In the words of Professor de Beer, \"[t]he governing legal principles in Ontario, however, are **clearly and authoritatively** established in *Saulnier* and *Tucows*\".226\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 85-86, 204\n\n**LK-019**, *Saulnier v.

Professor Katz argues that *Saulnier* and *Tucows* do not set any test to determine the existence of property in Ontario and that \"there is no single authoritative 'list\u2019 of attributes or indicia of property at common law\".227 Professor Katz further argues that Ontario courts would not limit their analysis to those two cases,228 but would instead consider additional decisions that clarify the evolution of the Canadian approach to property, which is what the *Tucows* court did in its judgment.229\n\n**RER-003**, Second Expert Report of Professor Katz, \u00b6 21.

The *Saulnier* decision\n--------------------------\n\n177.\n\nMr. Saulnier was a fisherman who held fishing licenses granted to him under the Fisheries Act. The Royal Bank granted a loan to Bingo Queen, Mr. Saulnier\u2019s company, and Mr. Saulnier entered into a general security agreement in which four fishing licenses were granted as collateral for the loan. Bingo Queen also signed a general security agreement over all personal property, including \"intangibles\" as defined in the Personal Property Security Act.231\n\n**LK-019**, *Saulnier v. Royal Bank of Canada,* [2008] 3 SCR 166, \u00b6 5.\n\n178.\n\nMr. Saulnier later applied for bankruptcy under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, where the fishing licenses were deemed part of the bankruptcy estate and valued in an amount that would discharge all debts.232 Therefore, the receiver and trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings sold the fishing licenses to a third party. Mr. Saulnier refused to sign the documents required to transfer the licenses. The trustee and the Royal Bank sued Mr. Saulnier before the Nova Scotia courts to obtain relief.233 Mr. Saulnier opposed by arguing that the fishing licenses were not property but a permission to do something that would otherwise be illegal and, therefore, they could not be transferred to the trustee to cover the liabilities, nor to the bank to enforce the general security agreement.234\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 6.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 7.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 2.\n\n179.\n\nThe question in *Saulnier* was whether fishing licenses created by the Fisheries Act could be deemed property for purposes of their sale to a third party by the trustee in bankruptcy proceedings, to cover the liabilities under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, or for purposes of their transfer to a bank as a creditor with a registered a general security agreement under the Nova Scotia Personal Property Security Act.\n\n180.\n\nAt first instance, the court found that the fishing licenses were property for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings on the basis of the commercial realities approach. The decision was challenged and the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the finding of property, but on the different basis of the existence of a \"bundle of rights\" under the fishing license, which included the holder\u2019s right to renewal of the license as opposed to the Minister of Fisheries and Ocean\u2019s discretion to grant or reject that renewal under the Fisheries Act.235 On appeal, the Supreme Court delivered a judgment in which Justice Binnie upheld the finding of property through the bundle of rights approach, but \"for different reasons and on a more limited basis\".236\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 3.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 4.\n\n181.\n\nFirst, the Supreme Court disagreed with the \"variant\" of the regulatory approach adopted by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal. The regulatory approach was established in the *Re National Trust Co. and Bouckhuyt* case *(**Bouckhuyt**),* where \"licenses and quotas were held to be intangible property (or not) according to the degree of renewal discretion vested in the issuing authority\".237 Under the variant proposed by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, the holder\u2019s right to renewal of a license, as opposed to the government\u2019s discretion to renew, was \"part of the 'bundle of rights\u2019 which collectively constitute a type of property in which a security interest can be taken\".238 The Supreme Court rejected this variant considering that \"[u]ncertainties of renewal do not detract from the interest presently possessed by the holder, but nor does an expectation of renewal based on a Minister\u2019s policy which could change tomorrow, transform a licence into a property interest\".239\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 36.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 36.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 37.\n\n182.\n\nThe Fisheries Act, as the statute that created fishing licenses, provided that the Minister had \"absolute discretion\" to issue, suspend or cancel them.240 However, the Supreme Court found that the \"broad scope and discretion of the Minister\" over the fishing licenses241 was not \"determinative\" to establish whether the licenses constituted property.242 Rather, fishing licenses had to satisfy \"the statutory definition of the BIA and PPSA\", and it was unclear what degree of discretion was required \"to transform a mere license into some sort of interest sufficient to satisfy\" the definitions of property found in those statutes.243 The Supreme Court added that anyone could apply for a fishing license and have a right to a fair ministerial decision over such application; therefore, those elements could not be \"capable, as such, of constituting a licence 'property\u2019 in the hands of a holder\".244\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 8.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 33.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 38.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 38.\n\n183.\n\nSecond, the Supreme Court clarified that the question was whether fishing licenses granted the holder a \"bundle of rights\" that qualified as property \"for the purposes of the statutes\", that is to say, bankruptcy and insolvency laws, even if they did not \"wholly correspond with the full range of rights necessary to characterize something as 'property\u2019 at common law\".245 The \"preferred approach\" of the Supreme Court to answer the question was to satisfy the elements of property within the scope of bankruptcy and insolvency legislation,246 not within the scope of general common law.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 43.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 1, \u00b6 43, and \u00a7 (iv)(A).\n\n184.\n\nSection 2 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act defined \"property\" as:\n\n\"any type of property, whether situated in Canada or elsewhere, and includes money, goods, things in action, land and every description of property, whether real or personal, legal or equitable, as well as obligations, easements and every description of estate, interest and **profit, present or future, vested or contingent**, in, arising out of or incident to property\"247\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 18 (emphasis added).\n\n185.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court this \"very wide\" definition \"unambiguously signalled an intention to sweep up a variety of assets of the bankrupt not normally considered 'property\u2019 at common law\".248 The Supreme Court analyzed the bundle of rights associated with fishing licenses and found that they satisfied the statutory definition of property for the purposes of bankruptcy and insolvency laws because the \"subject matter of the license (i.e. the right to participate in a fishery that is exclusive to license holders) coupled with a proprietary interest in the fish caught\" bore a \"reasonable analogy to a common law *profit \u00e1 prendre* which is undeniably property right\" and therefore could be framed within the element of \"profit\" found in the definition of property of section 2 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.249 Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that \"the property in question is the fish harvest\".250\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 44.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 34.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 34.\n\n186.\n\nThe Supreme Court further analyzed the other applicable definition of \"property\", found in section 2 of the Personal Property Security Act, as follows:\n\n\"(w) \"intangible\" means personal property that is not goods, a document of title, chattel paper, a security, an instrument or money; (ad) \"personal property\" means goods, a document of title, chattel paper, a security, an instrument, money or an intangible\".251\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 51.\n\n187.\n\nThe Supreme Court found that fishing licenses were also property under this definition, since \"intangible\" personal property encompassed statutory creations capable of being \"coupled with an interest at common law as in the case of a *profit \u00e0 prendre*\". The Supreme Court clarified that a fishing license did not \"constitute a *profit \u00e0 prendre* at common law\" but went on to find that \"exclusively with the extended definitions of 'personal property\u2019 in the context of a statute that seeks to facilitate financing by borrowers and the protection of creditors\", the grant of a fishing license coupled with a proprietary interest in the fish caught was sufficient to meet the definition under the BIA and the PPSA.252\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 51.\n\n188.\n\nThird, the Supreme Court explicitly clarified that the concept of property was not being analyzed \"in the abstract\", but rather in the specific and restricted context of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act in order to \"fulfill certain objectives in the event of a bankruptcy which require, in general, that non-exempt assets be made available to creditors\".253 The Supreme Court stated that \"a fishing license may not qualify as 'property\u2019 for the general purposes of the common law\", which did not mean that they were \"excluded from the reach of the statutes\".254\n\n*Id.*, \u00b646.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 16.\n\n*The Tribunal's conclusions on Saulnier*\n----------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that *Saulnier* \"legally settled\" the approach to find property under Ontario law, so as to make of \"the bundle of rights with exclusivity at the core\" the \"test\", as proposed by Claimants\u2019 expert.255 The decision of the Supreme Court in *Saulnier* is clear in that it does not intend to settle a general test to find property under Ontario common law, but rather answers the more limited question of property for the specific purposes of insolvency proceedings and personal property security. Claimants\u2019 expert seems to recognize this limited scope of the *Saulnier* decision when he acknowledges that \"[t]he Court left the question of whether a fishing licence is property in other statutory contexts\".256 Justice Binnie clearly and expressly limited his findings to the definitions found in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Personal Property Act, for the purposes of bankruptcy proceedings and the protection of creditors.257\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 134.\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 69.\n\n**LK-019**, *Saulnier v. Royal Bank of Canada,* [2008] 3 SCR 166, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 51.\n\n190.\n\n*Saulnier* does not establish a binding property test or a binding approach to assert a definition of property under Ontario law in the circumstances of this case. However, there are some general principles in *Saulnier* that can provide guidance to solve the question of property in this case.\n\n191.\n\nFirst, *Saulnier* confirms that there is not a fixed list of criteria to find property in general common law and that the finding of property in a specific statutory context and under a statutory definition does not imply a finding of property under general common law.\n\n192.\n\nSecond, the \"bundle of rights\" in *Saulnier* was an interpretative approach to determine if an intangible object not defined as property in the statute that created it (the Fisheries Act) satisfied a given definition of property under another specific statute (Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and Personal Property Security Act). This approach involves jointly analyzing the rights associated with the asset in question under the applicable statutory definition, while giving full effect to the purposes of the statute. In other words, the question of property is to be answered in consideration of any applicable statutory definition, and the corresponding statutory context, while giving full effect to the purposes of such statute. However, in the case before this Tribunal there is no statutory definition of property, either in NAFTA or in Ontario law. NAFTA protects \"investments\", and contains a broad list of the types of assets that can constitute investments, one of which is \"property\" under Article 1139(g), but contains no definition of property as such. Answering that question, as both Parties have acknowledged, is referred to national law.\n\n193.\n\nThird, the Supreme Court did not establish the characteristics required of the rights in \"the bundle\" to find property, but it did compare them with a traditional type of property such as a *profit \u00e0 prendre,* finding that there was \"some analogy\" with the bundle of rights of fishing licenses. In *Saulnier,* only a resemblance, and not an analogy, was justified because the element of \"profit\" was part of the definition of property under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Personal Property Security Act. The Supreme Court even recognized that fishing licenses were clearly not a *profit \u00e0 prendre* as such.258\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 33 34.\n\n194.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal can consider a comparative analysis between the bundle of rights of emission allowances and other traditional forms of property, including the *profit \u00e0 prendre.* However, absent a statutory definition of property providing specific characteristics, such as that of profit, the Tribunal cannot make a finding of property solely on the basis of \"some\" resemblance or analogy.\n\n195.\n\nFourth, the Supreme Court excluded from the bundle of rights analysis the right of renewal as opposed to the government\u2019s discretionary powers. This approach was justified by the Supreme Court in light of the specific statutory definition of property that existed in *Saulnier,* and to fulfill the purposes of the applicable statutes, *i.e.* the protection of creditors*.* The Supreme Court even clarified that their approach and the finding of similarities with the *profit \u00e0 prendre* type of property did not alter or \"encumber\" the Minister\u2019s discretion under the Fisheries Act. In this case, there are no specific statutory contexts or definitions such as those found in *Saulnier,* and the question of property is to be answered under Ontario general common law, where exclusive control is an essential characteristic of property. The Tribunal sees no grounds to exclude the analysis of the government\u2019s discretion as part of the analysis of exclusive control in this case.\n\n196.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal is not persuaded that *Saulnier* established a general test, much less that the conclusions in *Saulnier* can be replicated in this arbitration. This Tribunal is not called to answer the question of property for the purposes of insolvency proceedings or for protecting creditors and neither NAFTA Article 1139(g) nor Ontario law provides for a statutory definition of property such as those in section 2 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Nova Scotia Personal Property Security Act, which were key in the findings of the Court.\n\nb. The *Anglehart* decision\n---------------------------\n\n197.\n\nRoland Anglehart Jr. et al. (**Anglehart Appellants**) were a community of traditional crab fishers at the Gulf of St. Lawerence. To preserve crab stocks since 1984 the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (**DFO**) established an annual total allowable catch (**TAC**), and beginning in 1990, the TAC was distributed among crabbers in individual quotas (**IQ**).259\n\n**LK-012**, *Anglehart v. Canada,* [2018] CAF 115, \u00b6 4.\n\n198.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2006, pursuant to a Supreme Court judgment, the DFO had to integrate aboriginal peoples into commercial fisheries by reacquiring IQs from crabbers (**Marshall Initiative**).260 In 2003, the Minister of Fisheries and Ocean implemented a 3-year fishing plan to remove certain fishers from Fishing Area No. 18 and transition them to different activities. This \"rationalization\" process involved the participation of fishers from Fishing Area No. 18 in 15% of the TAC for the fishers of Fishing Area No. 12, but the latter refused to sign a joint project with the DFO.261 Absent such agreement, between 2004 and 2006, the DFO used parts of the TAC for the rationalization process and its own operations.262\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 5.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 6.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 7.\n\n199.\n\nIn 2007, the Anglehart Appellants brought a claim against the Crown for certain omissions of the Minister and the DFO, and argued, *inter alia,* that the Marshall Initiative, the fishing plan, and the use of the TAC by the DFO amounted to expropriation.263 In their view, the fishing licenses with the IQs were intangible property because they were a permanent and commercial asset \"assignable and transferrable\" that granted them the right to fish in a portion of the annual TAC.264 Moreover, while fishing licenses and IQs were not normally covered by the 1985 Expropriation Act, and the Fisheries Act granted broad discretionary powers to the government, it did not explicitly exclude expropriation claims.265 Also, the *Saulnier* decision had already recognized fishing licenses as property.266 Therefore, the removal of 35% of the TAC for other uses by the DFO, and the resulting reductions in their IQs, amounted to an expropriation giving rise to compensation.267\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 14.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 14.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b631\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 16.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16.\n\n200.\n\nAt first instance, the Federal Court judge dismissed the expropriation claim because the fishing licenses did not give a right of ownership in the fishery resource or a vested right to an IQ as a share of the TAC, and there was no legitimate expectation that the TAC would not vary.268 In 2018 the Federal Court of Appeal decided the appeal against this judgment*,* addressing the question of whether fishing licenses and IQs were \"property\" capable of being expropriated.269\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 9.\n\n*Id.*, \u00a7 VI (A).\n\n201.\n\nThe Court first clarified that the \"bundle of rights\" analysis in *Saulnier* was a \"statutory interpretation\" of the Supreme Court made in the very \"specific and narrow legislative context\" of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Personal Property Security Act as \"primarily commercial instruments\", and \"[t]herefore, the concepts of *profit \u00e0 prendre* and of the market value of licences addressed by the Supreme Court in *Saulnier* depend on the definition of 'property\u2019 set out in the legislation at issue\".270 In this sense, the finding of fishing licenses as property in *Saulnier* was intended to \"give effect to the Parliament\u2019s intention in a specific legislative context\",271 which is why it could not be extrapolated to a different case and under a different statute, such as the Fisheries Act.272\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 18.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 19, 23.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 19*,* 23-24.\n\n202.\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal then analyzed the ministerial discretion over fishing licenses and IQs under the Fisheries Act and the 1993 Regulations, finding that the government\u2019s \"broad\" or \"wide\" discretion did not allow the conclusion that the licenses or the IQs could constitute property capable of being expropriated.273 Such discretionary powers included those related to the annual expiration of the licenses, the uncertainties of the right of renewal, the fact that licenses were deemed property of the Crown, the limitations to their transfer, and the conditions related to the species and quantities of fish.274 In particular, the Federal Court of Appeal noted that the predictability of the annual renewal of licenses \"cannot be interpreted as conferring a right similar to a property right that may be expropriated\",275 and that social, economic and commercial factors were relevant in managing the fisheries but did not limit the FO Minister\u2019s discretion.276\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27, 32, 42.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 40.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 47.\n\n203.\n\nIts analysis of the ministerial discretion led the Court to uphold the Federal Court judge\u2019s finding that that the IQs granted \"no legal right to any particular amount of quota. This flows from the nature of fishing licenses, in respect of whose issuance the Minister has the broadest discretion. [...] if there is no vested right to a given quota, there can be no right to compensation arising purely from the fact of loss of quota. [...] The exercise of the minister\u2019s discretion to issue fishing licenses with reduced quota under section 7 of the Act did not result in a public legal duty to pay compensation for the lost quota\".277\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 44.\n\n204.\n\nEven though the IQs and fishing licenses were included together in the claim for expropriation, the Court apparently recognized a difference between them: licenses can be coupled with proprietary interests, while this does not seem to be the case for IQs. The Anglehart Appellants invoked the Manitoba Fisheries decision to argue that IQs were commercial assets similar to the boats and equipment of a fisher. However, the Court agreed with the Federal Court judge\u2019s statement that \"a parallel cannot be drawn between the rights of the appellants claim to have in their IQs and the goodwill of a business as an asset because the appellants do not 'own\u2019 their IQs\".278 Further, the Court referred to other cases involving mining licenses, and distinguished them from IQs because the former \"confer on the owners of mineral claims **personal or property rights over land** owned by another\";279 therefore \"there can be no question of expropriation with regard to IQs because they do not grant any **property rights or real interest** akin to the rights of mineral claims holders\".280\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 35.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 37 (emphasis added).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 38 (emphasis added).\n\n*The Tribunal's conclusions on Anglehart*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nNothing in the language of *Anglehart* suggests that the Federal Court of Appeal established a general test to define or find property under Ontario common law. Nonetheless, given that the Court addressed the question of whether or not intangible statutory creations constituted property \"in the common law sense\",281 this decision may provide some guidance to the Tribunal in this arbitration.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 13.\n\n206.\n\nThe *Anglehart* decision is clear in that: (i) *Saulnier* did not establish a general test for the finding of property but rather found property for the limited purposes of a specific statute, and (ii) that such findings cannot be extrapolated to different statutes or to establish a general concept of property.\n\n207.\n\nThe *Anglehart* decision does not determine which are the elements that an intangible object must necessarily fulfill to be deemed property in Ontario. This supports the conclusion that there is no definitive list of requirements of property under common law determined by the courts of Ontario.\n\n208.\n\nThe analysis of the Court focuses on the attributes of a statutory creation for the purposes of ruling out expropriation claims under a specific statute, the Fisheries Act. In this regard, there is at least one attribute of property that clearly emerges: the ability to exclude others, particularly the State, from appropriation or taking over the right in question, which includes the ability to bring expropriation claims.\n\n209.\n\nFrom the analysis of this attribute in *Anglehart,* it appears that in the case of a statutory creation of an asset or a right, the mere absence of a provision in the statute excluding expropriation claims is not sufficient to conclude that such creation is property and that it can provide a basis for expropriation claims. In the absence of an explicit exclusion, the analysis of the State\u2019s discretionary powers becomes relevant to assess the degree of exclusivity held by the holder of the right in question and to determine whether the State\u2019s powers are broad enough to exclude proprietary rights and expropriation claims. In this case, the Cap and Trade Act explicitly excludes expropriation claims in connection with emission allowances, the implications of which will be further developed in the following sections.\n\n210.\n\nFinally, the Court identified the \"bundle of rights\" as an interpretation of the Supreme Court in *Saulnier,* and while it did not follow *Saulnier's* findings, it did rule that \"there can be no question of expropriation with regard to IQs because they do not grant any property rights or real interest\" similar to the \"personal or property rights over land owned by another\" granted by mining licenses.282 This appears to suggest the possibility that coupling certain rights with those of a statutory creation which would not otherwise constitute property may give rise to expropriation claims and a finding of the existence of property.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n\nc. The *Tucows* decision\n------------------------\n\n211.\n\nTucows.com Co. (**Tucows**) brought a claim against Lojas Renner S.A. (**Renner**) to keep the domain name . Renner was the registered owner of the trademark \"Renner\".283\n\n**LK-007**, *Tucows.com Co. v. Lojas Renner S.A.,* [2011] ONCA 548, \u00b6 1.\n\n212.\n\nThe issue before the Ontario Court of Appeal in *Tucows* was related to the validity of the service of process of the statement of claim on Renner outside Ontario and the stay of the claim in the face of ongoing administrative proceedings before the World Intellectual Property Organization.284\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 8-11.\n\n213.\n\nThe question of property arose in connection with the first claim: the validity of service of process. Rule 17.02 of the Rules of Civil Procedure required prior leave from a court to serve the statement of claim outside Ontario, unless it pertained to \"personal property in Ontario\".285 Renner brought a motion to set aside the service of process on the grounds that Tucows had failed to obtain prior leave to serve outside Ontario, which was required in that case.286 The motions judge set aside the service of the statement of claim because a domain name was not \"personal property\" and, being intangible, it was not \"located in Ontario\".287\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 17-18.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 16.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 20.\n\n214.\n\nThe question before the Ontario Court of Appeal was whether a domain name was (i) \"personal property\" within the meaning of Rule 17.02 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure, and (ii) whether the domain name was located in Ontario for the purposes of the same Rules.288\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 23.\n\n215.\n\nThe Court first provided a definition and a description of a domain name as an \"intangible or ideational thing consisting of two parts, one being numerical and the other being a distinctive readable address\".289 The first part is the Internet Protocol (**IP**) number, and the second is the distinctive readable address in Uniform Resource Locators (**URL**), both being functionally necessary.290 The Court further noted that a domain name must be unique, and when used to identify and distinguish a business \"the value of maintaining an exclusive identity has become critical [...] Because of this, domain names have value on the secondary market\".291\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 65.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 42.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 44.\n\n216.\n\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal then held that as a \"relatively new innovation\" the legal status of domain names was undetermined in Canada, and they were thus compared with \"other types of intellectual property\".292 In this regard, a 2001 decision of the Ontario Superior Court had explicitly acknowledged that domain names could be intangible property similar to a copyright or a trademark, despite not being considered \"personal property\" for the purposes of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure.293 The Court then recognized that the dominant view in the \"international jurisprudence\" and the \"emerging consensus\" was that domain names were a new form of intangible property.294\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 48.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 50-52, 55.\n\n217.\n\nAfter this overview, the Ontario Court of Appeal delved into the \"attributes of property\" for the purposes of Rule 17.02, finding that (i) there was no definition of personal property in the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure; thus, the common law attributes of property applied, and (ii) \"there is no agreed list of required attributes of 'property\u2019 at common law\".295 Therefore, the Court analyzed multiple sources of doctrine and \"judicial decisions\" to conclude that domain names satisfied all the possible attributes of property as identified in such cases*.*296\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 58-66.\n\n218.\n\nThe Court referred to *Saulnier* and its analysis on the bundle of rights and the *profit \u00e0 prendre,* recognizing that the exclusive right to fish \"was coupled\" with property rights over the fish and revenues from their sale, as well as the license\u2019s ability to unlock the value of other assets. The Court found that the bundle of rights associated with a domain name satisfied the attributes of property \"in that at present **Tucows can enforce those rights against all others**\".297 That bundle of rights included the owner\u2019s ability to derive income from holding the rights in the domain name, with subscribed clients, and the domain name\u2019s ability to unlock the value of a business or of other assets.298\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 62 (emphasis added).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 60, 63.\n\n219.\n\nThe judgment also recognized that *Saulnier* was limited to the specific statutory context of bankruptcy laws, and that to give a \"purposive\" interpretation to the statute, it had \"rejected the traditional common law approach\" followed in *Bouckhuyt*, under which \"[t]he notion of 'property\u2019 imports the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of, interference with or appropriation of a specific legal right. This is distinct from a revocable license, which simply enables a person to do lawfully what he could not otherwise do\".299\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\n220.\n\nThe Court adopted no position on the differences between *Saulnier* and *Bouckhuyt,* and simply analyzed domain names under the attributes of property set out in the latter, finding that they fulfilled the element of exclusive control because domain names granted the right to exclusively direct traffic to a website and \"to exclude anyone else\" from using it.300 The court added that \"unlike the situation of the tobacco quota in Bouckhuyt\" the renewal of domain names was subject to the UDRP and its rules, and not to unfettered discretion.301\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 63-66; **CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 152.\n\n**LK-007**, *Tucows.com Co. v. Lojas Renner S.A.,* [2011] ONCA 548, \u00b6 63.\n\n221.\n\nFinally, the *Tucows* decision also referred to *National Provincial Bank Ltd. v. Ainsworth,* [1965] A.C. 1175 (H.L.) *(**Ainsworth**).* In that case, the English House of Lords held that \"other requirements must be met\",302 to constitute property. The Court found that \"a domain name also satisfies\" *Ainsworth's* definition of property because it is definable, identifiable, capable of assumption by third parties, and has some degree of permanence.303\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 64.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 64.\n\n*The Tribunal's conclusions on Tucows*\n--------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nProfessor de Beer, Claimants\u2019 expert, holds that *Tucows* settles a general legal test for property that \"requires a bundle of rights, with exclusivity at the core\".304 However, nothing in the wording or the structure of the decision suggests that the Ontario Court of Appeal intended to, or in fact did, establish a definitive test or rule.\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 134.\n\n223.\n\nIf the intention had been to settle or identify an existing \"test\" to find property, the Ontario Court of Appeal would have likely done so explicitly, as it did when analyzing the applicable tests \"developed by the Supreme Court\" to identify the relevant connecting factors required to determine if the domain names were located in Ontario;305 but it did not. Instead, the Court simply approached a novel property claim by referring to multiple definitions of property found in the doctrine and the \"definitions from Canadian and other common law jurisprudence\" and concluded that the \"bundle of rights in the domain name\" met the criteria set forth in those definitions, without making any statement, and even less any assessment, as to whether such definitions \u2014as a whole or in part\u2014 constitute a general rule or test that must be satisfied to find property under Canadian common law.306\n\n**LK-007,** *Tucows.com Co. v. Lojas Renner S.A.,* [2011] ONCA 548, \u00b6 69-70.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 66.\n\n224.\n\nEven though the Court in *Tucows* did not recognize a general \"test\" in the decisions it referred to, it did recognize in the *Bouckhuyt* decision the \"traditional common law approach\" to finding property, which requires \"the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of, interference with or appropriation of a specific legal right\".307 The Court also used the \"bundle of rights\" approach proposed in *Saulnier,* and, while it did not rule which rights must necessarily be included in the bundle to find property, it did recognize a common element among them: that the holder \"can enforce those rights against all others\".308\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 62.\n\n225.\n\nIn sum, even though there is no evidence of an \"agreed list of required attributes of 'property\u2019 at common law\", the foregoing appears to confirm the agreement of the experts of both Parties that exclusivity is an essential core attribute of common law property.309 Moreover, the \"bundle of rights\" approach and the decisions applying it may provide valuable guidance to answer the question of whether emission allowances satisfy the element of \"exclusivity\" to be deemed property in Ontario for the purposes of this arbitration.\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6\u00b6 133-134; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 37.\n\n226.\n\nAs for the *Ainsworth* decision, which Claimants\u2019 expert refers as a \"test\",310 the same considerations apply. At no point does the Ontario Court of Appeal refer to or adopt the *Ainsworth* decision as establishing a general test or a rule. *Ainsworth* adopts another definition of property,311 providing for elements in addition to those considered by the Canadian court decisions. However, those other elements do not include the element of \"exclusivity\" and there is no indication that the House of Lords considered it as an element of property. Therefore, while *Ainsworth* could provide some further \"indicia\" of property,312 the element of exclusivity remains an essential element for the finding of property in the Canadian decisions.\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6\u00b6 171-172.\n\n**RER-003**, Second Expert Report of Professor Katz, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 20, ft. 14.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 21.\n\nd. The *Bouckhuyt* decision\n---------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Bouckhuyts owned a farm that was linked to a tobacco basic production quota (**Tobacco Quota**). Tobacco Quotas were allocated by the Ontario Flue-cured Tobacco Growers\u2019 Marketing Board (**Tobacco Board**) to specified lands and could not be sold independently until a change in the Farm Product Marketing Act regulations in 1974, when they were no longer allocated to lands but to persons.313\n\n**LK-023,** *National Trust Co. v. Bouckhuyt,* [1987] CarswellOnt 141, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.\n\n228.\n\nThe Bouckhuyts sold their farm in 1977 and transferred their quota at the same time. As part of the consideration, the buyers gave back a mortgage over the farm in favor of the Bouckhuyts. The mortgage included the Tobacco Quota as part of the land, and subjected its transfer to the Bouckhuyts\u2019 consent. The Bouckhuyts\u2019 Notice of Transfer to the Tobacco Board included the mortgage. The Board approved the transfer and recorded that the Bouckhuyts had an interest in and against the Tobacco Quota.314 The Bouckhuyts\u2019 mortgage was registered under the land registry system, but not under the Personal Property and Securities Act.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.\n\n229.\n\nThree years later, without the consent of the Bouckhuyts, the buyers executed a chattel mortgage over the Tobacco Quota in favor of a trust company and registered it under the Personal Property Security Act.315 The trust company was a second mortgagee of the farm property. With the chattel mortgage, it intended to be a first mortgagee over the Tobacco Quota in the absence of registration by the Bouckhuyts of their mortgage under the Personal Property Security Act, despite knowing that the Bouckhuyts\u2019 mortgage required their consent to transfer the Tobacco Quota.316\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 6.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 11.\n\n230.\n\nThe trial judge found that Tobacco Quotas were intangible personal property within the Personal Property Security Act, and under that regulation, actual notice of the Bouckhuyts\u2019 prior unregistered interest was irrelevant to determine the priorities of security interests.317 According to the trial judge, Tobacco Quotas were property because in practice they were successfully traded in the market if they fulfilled the regulatory requirements, despite the broad discretionary powers of the Tobacco Board.318\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 13, \u00b6 15.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\n231.\n\nOn appeal, the Ontario Supreme Court found that Tobacco Quotas were not intangible property; thus registration by the trust company under the Personal Property Security Act was irrelevant.319 To determine if a Tobacco Quota satisfied \"the notion of property\" understood as \"the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of, interference with or appropriation of a specific legal right\" distinct from a \"revocable license, which simply enables a person to do lawfully what he could not otherwise do\", the Court analyzed the scope of the discretionary powers of the Tobacco Board.320\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 31.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 24.\n\n232.\n\nThe Court concluded that Tobacco Quotas could not satisfy the notion of property because they were transitory and ephemeral and subject to the absolute and complete control of the Tobacco Board.321 Section 2 of the Farms Products Marketing Act provided \"for the control and regulation in any or all respects of the producing and marketing within Ontario of tobacco, including the prohibition of such producing and marketing, in whole or in part\".322 Accordingly, under such regulations no one could produce or market tobacco without a license, or in excess of an allocated Tobacco Quota. Moreover, the Tobacco Board had discretion to allot, cancel or reduce Tobacco Quotas, and it could seize, remove or destroy tobacco produced in violation of the regulations.323 Finally, although transactions over Tobacco Quotas were possible and even a market among licensed producers existed, all transactions pertaining to the Tobacco Quota were still subject to the approval and unfettered discretion of the Tobacco Board.324\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22, 23, 27.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 20.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 21.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\n233.\n\nConsidering these statutory features, the Court in *Bouckhuyt* classified a Tobacco Quota as \"a license to produce which can, in turn, be granted only to a licensed producer\" which \"does no more than permit the licensed producer to grow tobacco, something which would otherwise be prohibited\",325 and \"the mere fact that it could be exchanged, sold, pledged or leased does not in itself make it property\".326 The Court held that \"[t]he notion of 'property\u2019 imports the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of, interference with or appropriation of a specific legal right which is distinct from a revocable licence\".327 It went on to find that the Tobacco Board regulations not only created the basis for legislative control over every aspect of the sale, production and marketing of tobacco in Ontario, but also vested complete authority in the Board \"to prohibit, restrain, or reduce the production and marketing of tobacco and the absolute discretion as to how that control is to be exercised\". In the Court\u2019s view, the *Farm Products Marketing Act* and the applicable regulations made it clear that a tobacco quota was a privilege \"granted at the discretion of the board to do that which [was] otherwise prohibited\".328\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 28.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 22, \u00b6 26.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 24.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 29.\n\n*The Tribunal's conclusions on Bouckhuyt*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe Supreme Court in *Saulnier* described the approach adopted in *Bouckhuyt* as the \"traditional common law\" approach,329 where the Ontario Court of Appeal found that the Tobacco Quota at issue \"is by its nature subject to such discretionary control and is so transitory and ephemeral in its nature\" that it could not \"constitute intangible personal property as that term is utilized in the P P S A\"330\n\n**LK-019,** *Saulnier v Royal Bank of Canada,* [2008] 3 SCR 166, \u00b6 27.\n\n**LK-023,** *National Trust Co. v. Bouckhuyt,* [1987] CarswellOnt 141, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22, 23, 29.\n\n235.\n\nThe Supreme Court further noted that, although the *Bouckhuyt* approach had been adopted in some Ontario cases involving the PPSA, and had given rise to a line of cases in which the degree of renewal discretion was the determining basis for deciding whether licenses and quotas constituted property, it had also been criticized as being \"insufficiently sensitive to the particular context of personal property security legislation, which (so the critics say) commands a broader concept of intangible property if the purposes of that legislation are to be achieved\".331 In this sense, the Supreme Court held that \"[u]ncertainties of renewal\" and the authorities\u2019 degree of renewal discretion were of \"limited value\" to find property.332 The Supreme Court also noted that the application of *Bouckhuyt's* \"regulatory approach\" entailed a difficulty due to the absence of \"clear criteria to determine how much 'fetter\u2019 on the issuing authority\u2019s discretion is enough to transform a 'mere licence\u2019 into some sort of interest to satisfy the statutory definitions in the BIA and the PPSA\".333\n\n**LK-019,** *Saulnier v. Royal Bank of Canada,* [2008] 3 SCR 166, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 37.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 38.\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the degree of discretion held by an issuing authority to renew a license or quota is of limited value, and that, overall, there is no clear criterion to determine the degree of discretion that becomes \"inconsistent with the degree of exclusive control and use needed to have a property right\".334 While *Saulnier* and *Bouckhuyt* addressed whether property existed in the context of definitions contained in specific legislation, the concern relating to the difficulty in determining the relevant degree of restriction or \"fetter\" on a regulatory authority\u2019s jurisdiction also appears valid in the broader context of property under general common law.\n\n**CER-03**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 169.\n\n237.\n\nDue to the different facts and the specific nature of tobacco quotas under the scheme established by the Farm Products Marketing Act and regulations, the Tribunal finds that *Bouckhuyt* is distinguishable from this case and of limited assistance. However, the Tribunal does note that \"exclusivity\" or the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of, interference with or appropriation of a specific legal right, is a key element of property at common law. On the basis of this factor, the Court in *Bouckhuyt* found that the absolute discretion of the Tobacco Board was an obstacle to finding property. However, as noted in *Saulnier*, the Court did not identify a criterion or limit to determine how much discretion, or how much fetter or restriction on the exercise of that restriction, is relevant.\n\ne. Conclusions on whether the Ontario or Canadian Courts have established a general \"legal test\" or \"interpretative principles\" for property\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, none of these cases has settled the approach for finding property under Ontario law, nor have they identified a test, general rule, or interpretative principle to determine the existence of property. Rather, they address a much more limited question in regard to particular assets under different statutory schemes or instruments. Although reference is made to property at common law, none of the decisions sets out a definitive list of attributes of property under common law or examines the nature and scope of such attributes in any detail. As a result, on the basis of the case law and authorities submitted, the Parties have not identified any general test for the finding of property under Ontario law.\n\na) In *Saulnier,* the Supreme Court adopted a purposive approach to the broad definitions of property and personal property in the federal BIA and the Nova Scotia PPSA to find that a fishing license granted under the federal Fisheries Act constitutes property for the purposes of those statutes. It reached this conclusion despite the very broad scope of the powers and discretion of the Minister under the Fisheries Act and its view that a simple license in and of itself may not constitute property at common law.\n\nb) In *Anglehart*, the Federal Court of Appeal distinguished *Saulnier* on the basis that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision depended on the definition of property in two commercial statutes made in a context different from that of a fishing license under and for the purpose of the Fisheries Act itself. The Federal Court of Appeal examined the Fisheries Act and accompanying regulations and their intended purpose and found that on the basis of the scope of the powers and \"absolute discretion\", including the power not to renew a license, a fishing license or an individual fishing quota did not constitute property \"in the common law sense\" under the Fisheries Act for the purpose of a claim of expropriation under the federal Expropriation Act.\n\nc) In *Tucows,* the Ontario Court of Appeal decided that a domain name constituted personal property under the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure for the purpose of service of legal process outside of Ontario. In the absence of a definition of \"personal property\" in the Rules, the Court examined the common law attributes of property. It found that the bundle of rights associated with the domain name in question satisfied the attributes of property, enforceable against all others, which had been referred to as \"exclusivity\" by academic commentators and in other decided cases. In addition, the Court found that the rights associated with a domain name also satisfied the definition of property in other cases, including the House of Lords decision in *Ainsworth,* which held that \"[b]efore a right or an interest can be admitted into the category of property, or a right affecting property, it must be definable, identifiable by third parties, capable in its nature of assumption by third parties, and have some degree of permanence or stability\".335\n\nd) In *Bouckhuyt,* the Ontario Court of Appeal found that a tobacco quota under the Farm Products Marketing Act and regulations did not constitute personal property for the purpose of the PPSA on the basis of the broad powers and control of the Tobacco Board in its \"absolute\" and \"unfettered\" discretion in their exercise and the transitory and ephemeral nature of production quotas.\n\n**LK-007**, *Tucows.com Co. v. Lojas Renner S.A.*, [2011] ONCA 548, \u00b6 64; **LK-034,** *National Provincial Bank, Ltd. v. Ainsworth,* [1965] 2 All E.R.472, p.494.\n\n239.\n\nIn sum, there is no general test derived from the aforementioned decisions; yet the Parties agree,336 and the cited Canadian decisions seem to confirm, that the element of \"exclusive control\" is an essential attribute to find property under general common law in Ontario. The court decisions that the Tribunal has reviewed in the preceding paragraphs of this Award do not establish a general rule in Ontario that clearly determines the scope and extent of the rights that must be associated to a statutory creation to satisfy the \"exclusive control\" attribute of property under general common law. However, a common element that the Canadian decisions have considered is the discretionary power of the government over the rights of the holder of the corresponding asset.\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 133; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 37.\n\n240.\n\nIn *Anglehart* the question of property and the right to bring expropriation claims was answered on the basis of \"the discretion that [the Fisheries Act] grant[ed] Minister\" as opposed to the existence of \"the exclusive right of fishing\".337 In *Bouckhuyt* the notion of property involved \"the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of, interference with, or appropriation of a specific legal right\"338, and such exclusion was analyzed in connection with the discretionary powers of the Tobacco Board over the Tobacco Quota. In *Tucows,* the notion of property also involved \"some exclusive right to make a claim against someone else\" and it was found that a domain name \"satisfies the attributes of property as described by Harris and Ziff in that at present Tucows can enforce those rights against all others\".339\n\n**LK-012,** *Anglehart v. Canada,* [2018] CAF 115, \u00b6 31.\n\n**LK-023,** *National Trust Co. v. Bouckhuyt,* [1987] CarswellOnt 141, p. 4.\n\n**LK-007**, *Tucows.com Co. v. Lojas Renner S.A.,* [2011] ONCA 548, \u00b6\u00b6 58, 62.\n\n241.\n\nThese decisions do not determine the extent of governmental discretion required to preclude a finding of property, but they do provide some general parameters: (i) the express statutory recognition of \"absolute\" or \"unfettered\" governmental discretion has been deemed inconsistent with a finding of property under general common law; (ii) even if a statute does not expressly grant \"absolute\" or \"unfettered\" discretion to the government, such discretion may still be broad enough to amount to an \"interference with or appropriation of a specific legal right\" or to be \"inconsistent with the degree of exclusive control and use needed to have a property right;\"340 (iii) the right to renewal or the predictability of allocation of a statutory creation does not fetter the government\u2019s statutory discretion, and it cannot confer property rights in itself; and (iv) the government\u2019s discretionary powers over statutory creations permitting the taking, removal or modification of rights without compensation, or the exclusion of expropriation claims, may be indicative of the absence of \"exclusive control\", and thus the absence of property.\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 169.\n\n242.\n\nThe similarities between an intangible statutory creation and traditionally recognized forms of property may provide indicia of the existence of property, but such similarities cannot in themselves support a finding of property under general common law. This standard may be different in the presence of a statutory definition of property, where only \"some analogy\" may suffice as found in *Saulnier* where the Court considered the bundle of rights associated with fishing licenses coupled with a proprietary interest falling within the scope the relevant statutory definitions.\n\n243.\n\nIn sum, there is no settled legal test for the finding of property, as proposed by Claimants, but the decisions of the Canadian courts provide some guidance on the question of whether the emission allowances created by the Cap and Trade Act are property under the laws of Ontario, in the absence of an established list of attributes of property.341 Specifically, the courts seem to agree that if the statute grants discretionary powers to the government that allow it to interfere with or appropriate the assets \u2014in this case emission allowances\u2014 it is an indication that the given asset does not qualify as property.\n\n**RER-001,** First Expert Report of Professor Katz, \u00b6 40; **CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 29.\n\n(ii) The non-Canadian decisions\n-------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nIn the absence of Canadian decisions dealing specifically with emission allowances, the Parties have submitted other non-Canadian decisions that do refer to similar instruments.\n\n245.\n\nThe experts appear to agree that, while not binding, such non-Canadian cases may have some persuasive value.342 Claimants\u2019 expert analyzed five non-Canadian cases referring to emission allowances in connection with the issue of property in this arbitration: two cases of the United States (**US**), two cases of the Court of Justice of the European Union (**CJEU**), and one English case.\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6\u00b6 85, 99.\n\n246.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the experts that some guidance can be found in these decisions given that, unlike the Canadian cases, they do refer to emission allowances and cap and trade systems in other common law jurisdictions. For completeness, the Tribunal will analyze these non-Canadian decisions to identify whether there are relevant interpretative principles additional to those found in the Canadian decisions, and only insofar as they are \"consistent with the Canadian approach\",343 since the question of property is to be answered under Ontario law.\n\n**RER-003**, Second Expert Report of Professor Katz, \u00b6 21.\n\na. The CJEU cases\n-----------------\n\n247.\n\nThe CJEU cases that involved allowances are *Holcim (Romania) SA v. European Commission344* and *ArcelorMittal Rodange et Schifflange SA v. Luxembourg.345* Professor de Beer holds that they are \"tangentially relevant cases\",346 and the Tribunal agrees with that assessment. In *Holcim* there was no analysis of the notion of property in general, or specifically in connection with allowances.347 In *ArcelorMittal,* the question at stake concerned the legality of the decision of an authority to require a company to surrender, without compensation, unused greenhouse gas emission allowances. While the question tangentially referred to the issue of property, the CJEU issued its decision without referring to the debate, and no position was taken on the legal nature of allowances.348\n\n**JdB-014,** *Holcim (Romania) SA v.

The US cases\n---------------\n\n248.\n\nThe US cases involving allowances that were submitted by the Parties are *Ormet Corp v. Ohio Power Co*349 and *California Chamber of Commerce v. State Air Resources Board.350* Professor de Beer holds that those cases may provide guidance but may also be distinguishable from the case before this Tribunal because they were based on \"statutory language disclaiming allowances as 'not\u2019 property, due to the distinct complex American constitutional context of the Fifth Amendment\".351 The Tribunal agrees with this distinction and adds that those cases did not answer the question of whether allowances are property under general common law.\n\n**JdB-016,** *Ormet Corp v.

The *Armstrong* case\n-----------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe English case referring to emission allowances was the *Armstrong* decision, identified by Claimants\u2019 expert as \"the most relevant to an Ontario court\" and the one case \"an Ontario court could not possibly ignore\".365 In *Armstrong,* the High Court of England and Wales determined the proprietary status of European Union allowances under the European Union (**EU**) cap and trade scheme, which, similar to the Cap and Trade Act, does not define whether an emission allowance constitutes property.366\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6\u00b6 100, 125-126.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 100, 125-126.\n\n253.\n\nThe claimant, Armstrong DLW GmbH, requested relief over certain EU carbon emission allowances (**EU Allowances**) that were transferred to the defendant, Winnington Networks Limited, as a result of an email fraud perpetrated by an unrelated third party.367 The defendant, who had already sold the EU allowances, argued it was a *bona fide* purchaser and that claimant had been negligent for giving the password to its account in response to a phishing email, allowing the fraudulent third party to make the transfer.368 The claimant argued that the defendant failed to follow through a sufficient due diligence procedure, overseeing the risk of the fraud.369 Therefore, the core issue in dispute was who should bear the loss for the fraud of the third party.370\n\n**LK-040,** *Armstrong DLW GMBH v. Winnington Networks Ltd,* [2012] EWHC 10(Ch), \u00b6 22.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 25.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 26.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 1.\n\n254.\n\nThe claim was brought on three alternative bases: restitution of proprietary rights, restitution for unjust enrichment, and a personal claim in equity for the \"unconscionable\" receipt of the EU allowances.371 For the first bases, the defendant contended that EU allowances were a form of intangible property, but they were not a chose in possession or a chose in action, and therefore, there were no grounds for a proprietary restitution claim.372 In *Armstrong,* the parties did not dispute \"that EUAs are capable of constituting, and do constitute, property as a matter of law\",373 but rather which kind of property they constituted and the kind of claim that could be made over them.374\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 2.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 40.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 38(1), 40.\n\n255.\n\nTo answer these questions, the Court in *Armstrong* first conducted an assessment of the \"characteristics of property\" at common law defined in the *Ainsworth* case as \"definable, identifiable by third parties, capable in its nature of assumption by third parties and having some degree of permanence or stability\".375 Then, the court defined the features of a chose in action, as a category of property, and of documentary intangibles, as a sub-category of property.376 In this context, the Court analyzed the nature of an EU emission allowance, finding that it satisfies the characteristics of \"property\" in general, under the so-called *Ainsworth* test, because \"[i]t is definable, as being the sum total of rights and entitlements conferred on the holder pursuant to the ETS. It is identifiable by third parties; it has a unique reference number. It is capable of assumption by third parties, as under the ETS, an EUA is transferable. It has permanence and stability since it continues to exist in a registry account until it is transferred out either for submission or sale and is capable of subsisting from year to year\".377\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 42.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 43-47.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 50.\n\n256.\n\nAfter finding EU allowances were \"property\", the English court characterized them in the sub-category of \"intangible property\" on the basis of one case related to trust property*,* and three cases of \"particular relevance\" for the issue of intangible property *\"A-G for Hong Kong v Nai-Keung* [1987] I WLR 1339, *In Re Rae* [1995] BCC 102, and most significantly *In re Celtic Extraction* [2001] Ch 487\" (the \"*Nai Keung, Tn Re Rae'\"* and *\"Celtic\"* cases, respectively)*.*378\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 52.\n\n257.\n\nThe English court applied the three-fold test of *Celtic* to find property, which required (i) \"a statutory framework conferring an entitlement on one who satisfies certain conditions\", (ii) that \"the exemption must be transferable\", and (iii) that \"the exemption or licence have value\".379 According to the British court, EU allowances satisfied *Celtic's* test because\n\n\"First, there is, here, a statutory framework which confers an entitlement on the holder of an EUA to exemption from a fine. Secondly, the EUA is an exemption which is transferable, and expressly so, under the statutory framework. Thirdly the EUA is an exemption which has value [...]\".380\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 56.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 58.\n\n258.\n\nWhen framing the *Celtic* test, the British court in *Armstrong* recognized that *Celtic* had involved a specific statutory definition of property subject to \"the purposes of the s.436 Insolvency Act 1986\".381 In fact, it quoted sections of *Celtic* that referred to definitions of property in *Nai Keung* and *In Re Rae*, which were also subject to specific statutes and contexts:\n\n\"[In *Nai Keung,]* the Privy Council considered that textile export quotas were **property within the definition in the Theft Ordinance of Hong Kong** and therefore capable of being stolen. The definition was: 'property includes money and all other property, real and personal, including things in action and other intangible property. \u2019 [...] 'In summary, to be registered as the holder of an appropriate quota is a prerequisite to obtaining an export licence; it confers an expectation that, in the ordinary course, a corresponding licence will be granted, though not an enforceable legal right ... It would be strange indeed if something which is freely bought and sold ...were not capable of being stolen.\u2019\n\nA similar conclusion was reached by Warner J in *In re Rae* [1995] BCC 102. In that case a bankrupt had been licensed under the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967 in respect of four fishing vessels. The licences terminated on his bankruptcy. But the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the department which issued such licences, recognised an 'entitlement\u2019 in the holder or the person to whom he 'waived\u2019 his entitlement to be considered for the grant of new licences. Such an entitlement had value. The question was whether the benefit of the entitlement remained with the bankrupt or passed to his trustee for the benefit of his creditors. Warner J decided that the 'entitlement\u2019 was **within the definition of 'property\u2019 as a present interest in property,** namely the vessels. **He considered it to be immaterial that the entitlement was also incidental to other things, such as the exercise of the minister\u2019s discretion**\".382\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 53.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 54 (emphasis added).\n\n259.\n\nThe Court then quoted *Celtic's* conclusions on the foregoing cases in connection with the waste management licenses, which reflected the \"property test\":\n\n\"It appears to me that these cases indicate the salient features which are likely to be found if there is to be conferred on an exemption from some wider statutory prohibition the status of property. First, there must be a statutory framework conferring an entitlement on one who satisfies certain conditions even though there is some element of discretion exercisable within that framework [...] Second, the exemption must be transferable [...] Third, the exemption or license will have value. [...]\n\nIn my view a waste management licence comes within the definition of 'property\u2019 contained in section 436 of the Insolvency Act 1986. It is in my view 'property\u2019 properly so called. In the alternative, I consider that it is an 'interest ... incidental to, property\u2019 namely the land to which it relates\".383\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 56.\n\n*The Tribunal's conclusions on Armstrong*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, though not identical, the EU allowances created by Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and Council and the emission allowances under the Cap and Trade Act have several similarities. Like in the Cap and Trade Act, the EU allowances were a permission that had to be acquired by companies operating within the EU, in order to emit carbon dioxide above a certain minimum level. Without EU allowances \"the holder would either be prohibited from emitting CO2 beyond a certain level or at least would be required to pay a fine if he did so. In this way, the holding of the EUA exempts the holder from the payment of that fine\".384 EU allowances were allocated for a specified period and had to be submitted to meet compliance obligations of capped companies. They were tradable and any surplus could be retained by the company to meet future compliance obligations.385 Moreover, EU allowances were not only traded by capped companies, but also by non-capped companies known as \"traders\".386 Each trader and company had an account with a unique number, and each EU allowance has an individual number and is easily identifiable.387\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 48.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 6-11.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 12\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 15,17.\n\n261.\n\nThe fact that *Armstrong* considered the same issue as is before this Tribunal, whether emission allowances constitute property, provides guidance for the decision before this Tribunal, but is not in itself sufficient for this Tribunal to apply the test followed by the English court and conclude that allowances are property under Ontario law.\n\n262.\n\n*Armstrong* found that EU allowances were \"property\" at common law by applying the *Ainsworth* test, and that they were intangible property by applying the *Celtic* test. The Tribunal has already concluded that the Canadian cases submitted in this arbitration are not sufficient to support the conclusion that *Ainsworth* is a \"test\" adopted as such by Ontario courts, despite that such decision was taken into consideration in *Tucows*. There is also no evidence or allegation that the *Celtic* test has been adopted or applied as a \"test\" by Ontario courts.\n\n263.\n\nMost importantly, neither *Ainsworth* nor *Celtic* includes what the Parties and their experts have recognized to be an essential element to find property under Ontario common law: exclusive control. The decisions do not refer to that element. This element is also missing in *Armstrong'*s analysis and conclusion that EU allowances satisfy both the *Ainsworth* and *Celtic* property tests.388 In fact, the first element in *Celtic's* test indicates that \"some element of discretion\" does not affect the proprietary status of a statutory exemption. Further the decision barely deals with the State\u2019s discretion and its consequent interference with the holder\u2019s \"exclusive control\", which the Parties agree is a core issue under Ontario law.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 50.\n\n264.\n\nFurthermore, there is an important difference between *Armstrong's* interpretative approach and that of the Canadian decisions. The English courts have specifically recognized that the characteristics of property found in various statutory definitions reflect common law concepts, and vice versa. The *Armstrong* court explained that\n\n\"[w]hilst the cited case law concerned the meaning of 'property\u2019 as specifically defined in various statutes, in my judgment, the reasoning of Morritt LJ applies equally to the characteristics of property at common law. Indeed, Morritt LJ himself relied upon *National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth*. Moreover, the terms used in statutory definitions are themselves derived from common law concepts\".389\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 59.\n\n265.\n\nCanadian courts, on the contrary, have thus far declined to follow this approach. They have maintained a distinction between specific statutory definitions of property and the general common law conception of property. The *Anglehart* court, for example, distinguished *Saulnier* on the grounds that its reasoning could not be extrapolated to find that licenses granted under the Fisheries Act were property at general common law390 because *Saulnier*\u2019s analysis of property was performed in a different and specific statutory context, *i.e.* that of insolvency law.391 *Anglehart's* conclusion is consistent with the *Saulnier* decision itself, in which Justice Binnie restricted the Court\u2019s finding to the specific legislative context.\n\n**LK-012,** *Anglehart v. Canada,* [2018] CAF 115, \u00b6 19.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 21.\n\n266.\n\nThus, even though Canadian courts would likely consider decisions from other common law jurisdictions in determining whether allowances are property, and particularly decisions that deal with the same type of asset, the Canadian court in *Anglehart* did not interpret *Saulnier* in the same way that the English court in *Armstrong* interpreted *Celtic*. It adopted a different approach and rejected the extrapolation of the conclusions of *Saulnier* to establish a common law definition of what constitutes property.392\n\n**LK-019,** *Saulnier v. Royal Bank of Canada,* [2008] 3 SCR 166, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n\n267.\n\nTo conclude, *Armstrong* shares with the case before this Tribunal the fact that both refer to the determination of whether emission allowances under similar cap and trade regimes may be considered property. But the similarities end there. The issue put before this Tribunal is twofold: first, whether a Canadian court would consider decisions of common law jurisdictions in determining the novel issue of whether allowances are property, and second, assuming *Armstrong* is one of those decisions, whether a Canadian court would conclude that allowances are property.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that Canadian courts have considered and would consider decisions of other common law jurisdictions to determine whether allowances are property. However, they are not bound by such decisions, and it is not clear whether a Canadian court would adopt the same approach as the English court in *Armstrong*. Rather, the decisions of the Canadian courts submitted in this arbitration suggest that they are reluctant to create general rules or tests based on cases that are fact and statute specific or to extrapolate from decisions based on specific statutory definitions of property to other cases in different contexts and where there is no definition, or a different definition, of property.\n\n*(c) Analysis of the Cap and Trade Act*\n---------------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nQuoting the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov,* Claimants\u2019 expert submits that the interpretation of a statute under Ontario common law requires looking at its \"text, context and purpose\".393 According to Claimants these \"general interpretative principles\" allow the conclusion that Claimants had property rights over the emission allowances.394\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 54, 205.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal has already concluded that the Canadian court decisions referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Award have a common element in which the experts of both Parties agree: a fundamental attribute of property is \"exclusive control\" and in the case of a statutory creation the \"exclusive control\" would depend on the extent of the discretionary power of the government over the rights of the holder of the corresponding asset. However, the said decisions do not establish a conclusive general rule in Ontario that determines the scope and extent of the rights that must be associated with a statutory creation to satisfy the \"exclusive control\" attribute.\n\n271.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal needs to determine whether under the Cap and Trade Act the holders of emission allowances, and particularly the market participants, had exclusive control over emission allowances - as opposed to third parties, including the Ontario government, - and thus, whether the Tribunal is persuaded that the emission allowances created by the Cap and Trade Act constitute property in Ontario for the purposes of establishing that an investment existed under NAFTA.395 For purposes thereof, the Tribunal will analyze (i) the purpose, (ii) the context, and (iii) the text of the Cap and Trade Act, as the statute creating the emission allowances.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 35.\n\n(i) The Purpose of the Cap and Trade Act\n----------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nClaimants and their experts submit that the statutory purpose of the Cap and Trade Act and the Regulation was to create a \"market mechanism to achieve environmental policy goals\"396 and \"to establish a broad carbon price through a cap and trade program that will change the behavior of everyone across the Province\" and \"link to other regional cap and trade markets as part of international, national and interprovincial responses to reduce greenhouse gas\".397 In their view, the establishment of a broad market through a cap and trade program is a \"[a] key purpose\" of the Act, that subsection (2) of the Purpose of the Act leaves no doubt on the point and is in equal footing with subsection (1), both being part of the purpose of the Cap and Trade Act.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 62.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 21.\n\n273.\n\nThe interpretation of the aforementioned provisions by Claimants is plausible and results from the structure of the Cap and Trade Act which in places both subsections (1) and (2) under \"Purpose\".\n\n274.\n\nThe Cap and Trade Act defines its \"Purpose\" in section (2) as follows:\n\n\"**Purpose**:\n\n(1) Recognizing the critical environmental and economic challenge of climate change that is facing the global community, the purpose of this Act is to create a regulatory scheme,\n\n(a) to reduce greenhouse gas in order to respond to climate change, to protect the environment and to assist Ontarians to transition to a low-carbon economy; and\n\n(b) to enable Ontario to collaborate and coordinate its actions with similar actions in other jurisdictions in order to ensure the efficacy of its regulatory scheme in the context of a broader international effort to respond to climate change.\n\n**Same**\n\n(2) The cap and trade program is a market mechanism established under this Act that is intended to encourage Ontarians to change their behaviour by influencing their economic decisions that directly or indirectly contribute to the emission of greenhouse gas\".398\n\n**CL-005**, Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016, Cap and Trade Act, Section (2).\n\n275.\n\nSubsection (1) of the Purpose of the Cap and Trade Act leaves no doubt about the purpose to create a \"regulatory scheme\" to reduce gas emissions, protect the environment, transit to a carbon low economy and allow Ontario to coordinate its actions with other jurisdictions in order to ensure the efficacy of its regulatory scheme in the international context.\n\n276.\n\nAs regards subsection (2), there are two possible readings of the reference to the market mechanism. One way is to view the market mechanism as one of the purposes (though not necessarily \"the key\" response as proposed by Claimants) of the Cap and Trade Act. In this regard, subsection (1) is preceded by the word \"Purpose\" and then Section (2) is preceded by the word \"Same\" which is an indication that subsection (2) is also a purpose of the Cap and Trade Act. In addition, the Preamble of the Cap and Trade Act refers to the establishment of a \"broad carbon price\" that is \"a key purpose\" of the statute:\n\n\"The Government of Ontario cannot address this challenge alone. Collective action is required. As a leading sub-national jurisdiction, Ontario will participate in the international response to reduce greenhouse gas by establishing a carbon price. A **key purpose** of this Act is to establish a broad carbon price through a cap and trade program that will change the behaviour of everyone across the Province, including spurring low-carbon innovation. A cap and trade program in Ontario will allow Ontario to link to other regional cap and trade markets as part of the international, national and interprovincial responses to reduce greenhouse gas.\n\nIn addition to the carbon price signal and to further support the reduction of greenhouse gas, the Government of Ontario will pursue complementary actions to support and promote the transition to a low-carbon economy\".399\n\n*Id.*, Preamble (emphasis added).\n\n277.\n\nThe other way to see the market mechanism is as a means to achieve the Purpose of creating a regulatory scheme to \"reduce greenhouse gas in order to respond to climate change, to protect the environment and to assist Ontarians to transition to a low-carbon economy\". The wording in Subsection (2) refers to the \"intention\" or purpose of the market mechanism, but not of the Cap and Trade Act or of the regulatory scheme. By contrast, Subsection (1) expressly refers to the regulatory scheme as \"the\" purpose of the Act. The Preamble refers to the carbon price as \"a\" key purpose, not \"the\" purpose, and only to the extent that it \"will change the behaviour of everyone across the Province, including spurring low-carbon innovation\". The ultimate Purpose remains the reduction of greenhouse gases under a regulatory scheme as indicated in subsection (1).\n\n278.\n\nThe Tribunal is not inclined to either reading of subsection (2). Both readings are admissible, and they cannot be isolated one from the other for purposes of the interpretation of the Cap and Trade Act. On balance, emission allowances, as the object that embodies, materializes or \"facilitates\"400 the market mechanism, played the central role in the Act\u2019s purpose of achieving the reduction of greenhouse gases in collaboration with other jurisdictions to respond to climate change, and were an integral part of the Cap and Trade Act\u2019s purpose. But the Tribunal must also consider the language in subsection (1) of the \"Purpose\" section of the Cap and Trade Act, which unambiguously recognizes that \"the purpose of this Act is to create a regulatory scheme\". The Tribunal recognizes the importance of both the regulatory scheme and the market mechanism, and will consider them both for the purposes of its analysis on property.\n\n**CER-003,** Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 206.\n\n(ii) The context and the text of the Cap and Trade Act\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nProfessor Robert Stavins - Claimants\u2019 expert - explains that carbon-pricing policies emerged as instruments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that there are two types: carbon taxes and emission trading systems, \"[c]arbon taxes fix the price of carbon and allow the resulting emissions to vary, while emission trading systems fix total emissions and allow the resulting emission price to vary\".401 The Tribunal finds Professor Stavins\u2019 description of cap and trade systems illustrative:\n\n\"a cap-and trade system [...] creates total allowances equal to the targeted (constrained) quantity of total emissions. After initial distribution of the allowances, which may occur through free allocation or sale, participants can trade allowances on the secondary market to achieve compliance, given their emission-generating activities. Emission sources (capped participants) can also take actions that lower emissions, and thus reduce their compliance burden. For example, electric utilities that generate power using non- or lower-emitting sources rather than high-emission sources (for example, renewables or natural gas rather than coal) would incur lower costs because the quantity of allowances required to comply with the emission trading system would be less. From the perspective of entities holding allowances, those allowances are valuable not only because they can be used to fulfill any compliance obligations the entities have, but also because they can be sold to other entities with compliance obligations or that otherwise place a greater value on the allowances\".402\n\n\"Participation in emission trading markets is not limited to capped entities, but typically includes other entities (\"market participants\") that play different roles that are important to emission market performance and include services to capped entities that help them achieve compliance and manage compliance risks. [...] Market participants, in turn, benefit financially from participating in emission markets through positive expected returns earned in the course of trading or providing services for participants in the market\".403\n\n**CER-001,** Expert Report of Professor Robert Stavins, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 25.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 43.\n\n280.\n\nAccording to Professor Stavins, since the goal of these systems is to achieve emission reductions, the emissions cap, and therefore the number of allowances available, tend to decline from year to year until the target is met. With fewer allowances in the market, capped participants are forced to either change their behavior and business to reduce emissions or purchase the increasingly scarce and expensive allowances.404\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 40.\n\n281.\n\nWith the issuance of the Cap and Trade Act, the Ontario province created a regulatory scheme to reduce greenhouse gases emissions through a carbon-pricing policy in the form of a cap and trade system instead of a carbon tax.\n\n282.\n\nThe Cap and Trade Act defines emission allowances as \"an Ontario emission allowance or an instrument created by a jurisdiction other than Ontario that, under section 38, is to be treated as an emission allowance for the purposes of this Act; ('quota d\u2019\u00e9mission\u2019)\".405 An Ontario emission allowance is \"an emission allowance created under section 30; ('quota d\u2019\u00e9mission de l\u2019Ontario\u2019)\".406 Section 30, in turn, provides that \"(1) The Minister shall create Ontario emission allowances in accordance with the regulations, and may create classes of allowances\" and that \"(2) The regulations shall prescribe the maximum number or amount of Ontario emission allowances that may be created for a period, and the maximum shall be determined with reference to the targets established under section 6 for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions\".407\n\n**CL-005**, Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016, Section 1(1).\n\n*Id.*, Section 1(1).\n\n*Id.*, Section 30.\n\n283.\n\nThe emission allowances created by the Cap and Trade Act represent the right to emit a certain amount of greenhouse gas for a prescribed activity,408 and must be submitted to the Government by the capped participants in an amount equal to the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by them during a compliance period.409\n\n*Id.*, Sections 1(2) and 13(1).\n\n*Id.*, Section 14(1).\n\n284.\n\nThe Cap and Trade Act and the Regulation refer to three types of participants in the carbon price market: mandatory participants, voluntary participants, and market participants.410 Only mandatory and voluntary participants were \"capped\", *i.e.* subject to caps on emissions. If they exceeded the cap, mandatory or voluntary participants were exposed to penalty. The market participants had no underlying activity associated with the cap and trade program that generates emissions. Therefore, they did not submit allowances, had no cap obligations and were not subject to penalties or other sanctions for exceeding cap emissions.411\n\n*Id.*, Sections 15, 16 and 17.\n\n**CL-006**, Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, Ontario Regulation 144/16, Section 1: \"'capped participant\u2019 means a mandatory participant or a voluntary participant\"; **CER-1**, Expert Report of Dr. Robert Stavins, \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.\n\n285.\n\nMandatory or voluntary participants could comply with the cap by adjusting their production or investing in green technologies, or by acquiring emission allowances. Voluntary and mandatory participants could acquire emission allowances by (i) receiving them free of charge by distribution from the Government of Ontario in accordance with the regulations; (ii) purchasing them in auctions conducted by the Government of Ontario; or (iii) purchasing them from other mandatory, voluntary or market participants.412 Market participants were permitted to purchase allowances at auctions conducted by Ontario (and the other participating jurisdictions) and participate as traders to purchase or sell allowances.413\n\n**CL-005**, Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016, Section 31 and 32; **CL-006**, Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, Ontario Regulation 144/16, Sections 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, and 85.\n\n**CER-002**, Second Expert Report of Dr. Robert Stavins, \u00b6 25; **CER-1**, Expert Report of Dr. Robert Stavins, \u00b6 71**; CER-3**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.\n\n286.\n\nTherefore, the cap and trade system was composed of a primary market of free allowances granted by the Government of Ontario, and the emissions sold in auctions, also by the Government of Ontario.414 In the secondary market, the overall allowances issued by the government were traded between participants, including not only market, but also mandatory and voluntary participants.415\n\n**CL-005**, Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016, Section 30(5); **CER-1**, Expert Report of Dr. Robert Stavins, \u00b6 73.\n\n**CER-001**, Expert Report of Dr. Robert Stavins, \u00b6 70.\n\n287.\n\nThe cap and trade program established an aggregate cap on emissions of greenhouse gas and created allowances that represented the right to emit individual units of greenhouse gas. An entity subject to the cap had to obtain emission allowances corresponding to its emissions. Given that the aggregate cap was fixed by the regulator and represented the total number of allowances, an entity that needed more allowances had to acquire them through transactions with other allowance holders. It could also bid on and purchase allowances at auction, hold them, and sell or trade excess allowances that other participants needed or wished to acquire.\n\n288.\n\nEmission allowances under the cap and trade program were created for mandatory and voluntary participants as a tool to meet their compliance obligations under the regulatory scheme that sought to influence their decisions that may contribute to the reduction of emission of greenhouse gases. The regulatory scheme\u2019s goal of changing the behavior to reduce greenhouse gas emissions required, on the one hand, establishing an aggregate cap to control the emissions of the mandatory and voluntary participants, and on the other, creating a market for such emissions that permitted their trade.\n\n289.\n\nTradable emission allowances were, therefore, a creation of the regulator pursuant to a regulatory scheme designed to curb the emissions of greenhouse gases over time and to respond to changing conditions. This regulatory scheme imposed significant limitations on the participants\u2019 right to use and control the allowances and, in turn, attributed considerable powers to the government regarding their allocation, creation, and cancellation.\n\n290.\n\nThe government was the issuer or creator of emission allowances for each period, could classify them, and determine the amount of allowances that would be in circulation, in accordance with the applicable regulations.416 The Minister had the power to regulate auctions or sales, establish who participated in them and limit the number of emission allowances per person in the auctions.417 The Director was able to take the allowances and submit them whenever there was a shortfall, and to impose adverse consequences when a capped participant\u2019s emissions surpassed its allowances.418 In certain circumstances, the government could suspend the trade of the emission allowances,419 \"remove\" emission allowances and credits, even without notice,420 and without compensation.421 Section 28(2) also forbade the possibility of holding allowances for a third party or to establish a trust without the government\u2019s authorization.\n\n**CL-005**, Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016, Section 30(2).\n\n*Id.*, Section 32.\n\n*Id.*, Sections 10, 14(7) and (8).\n\n*Id.*, Section 25(3).\n\n*Id.*, Section 27.\n\n*Id.*, Section 70.\n\n291.\n\nOverall, the purpose and context of the Cap and Trade Act indicate that emission allowances were subject to a strict regulatory scheme controlled by the government, which does not seem to weigh in favor of finding that there was \"exclusive control\" over the emission allowances. The following sections will review, in detail, the rights and limitations envisaged in the text of the Cap and Trade Act and the Regulations to determine whether the emission allowances created under this statute possess the attributes of property required under the laws of Ontario and particularly whether they satisfy the \"exclusive control\" element.\n\n(iii) Whether emission allowances satisfy the \"exclusive control\" element\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Parties and their experts do not dispute that exclusive control is a salient and determinative element of property under Ontario law422 and that exclusive control is related to the degree of government interference, including, of course, the discretionary powers of the government. The Tribunal will first review the provisions of the Cap and Trade Act invoked by Professor de Beer to assert exclusive control by the holders of emission allowances, and then will consider other relevant provisions of the Cap and Trade Act to determine whether there is exclusive control.\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 133; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 37.\n\na. Provisions identified by Claimants\u2019 expert\n---------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nProfessor de Beer considers the following provisions of the Cap and Trade Act and the Regulation to be evidence that participants had exclusive control and use over the emission allowances:\n\n293.1. Exclusive use: Under Subsection 22(1) of the Cap and Trade Act emission allowances were held in cap and trade accounts \"under the control of participants\",423 and only registered participants could purchase, sell and trade, and deal with emission allowances, \"generally\" on their own terms.424 According to Professor de Beer, apart from a few prescribed circumstances, only the holder of the allowances could determine whether and how to use them, whether by holding them, submitting them to the Minister, selling or trading them.425 Also, Subsection 15(3) of the Regulation provided that capped participants could submit only the emission allowances held in their own account to the Minister.426\n\n293.2. Exclusive control: Subsection 28(2) of the Cap and Trade Act provides that control of the allowances in participants\u2019 accounts was exclusive to the extent that participants may not hold in their accounts allowances \"owned\" by another person.427 Therefore, Professor de Beer concludes that only the registered participant could control allowances in their account.428\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 83, p. 23.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 83, p. 24, \u00b6 146.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 83, p. 24, \u00b6 170.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 83, p. 24, \u00b6 148.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 83, p. 23, \u00b6\u00b6 139 - 144.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 83, p. 23, \u00b6 140.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that that the aforementioned provisions invoked by Claimants\u2019 expert, when individually considered, may indicate that there is some degree of exclusivity or control over the emission allowances created by the Cap and Trade Act. However, those provisions cannot be analyzed in isolation, but rather must be considered in context and together with the other provisions of the Cap and Trade Act, including those that were not reviewed by Professor de Beer in his expert report.\n\n295.\n\nThe rule in Subsection 22(1) of the Cap and Trade Act has \"the purpose of allowing\" registered participants to trade, deal and submit the allowances to the Minister. However, the authorization or permit to negotiate a right with third parties, by itself, does not alter the nature of that right, and does not necessarily confer exclusive use or control over a thing, especially when it is subject to statutory limitations or conditions. Subsection 15(3) of the Regulation excludes the possibility of submitting the emission allowances to the Ministry in order to meet a participant\u2019s compliance obligations, if they are not held in that participant\u2019s account. Therefore, it appears that the purpose of Subsection 22(1), jointly considered with Subsection 15(3), rather than to vest an exclusive right to use and control the allowances account to the exclusion of others, is to require the participants to have their own account in order to limit the possibility to participate through another entity.\n\n296.\n\nConsistent with the foregoing provisions, the rule in Subsection 28(2) of the Cap and Trade Act also forbids the indirect holding of allowances or beneficial interests of third parties. The prohibition for a registered participant to hold in its account allowances that are owned by another person does not resemble or embody a right to exclude the interference of third parties from using its allowances. On the contrary, this provision establishes a limitation of use of the allowance by a holder, who cannot choose to hold the allowances in another participant\u2019s account, or vice versa. Professor de Beer does not explain how the fact that each participant has an exclusive account in this sense is equivalent to the ability to exclude others from interfering with a defined domain of activity.\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal is also not convinced that the use of the word \"owned\" in Subsection 28(2) of the Cap and Trade Act, by itself, implies the existence of property, especially when the effect of the provision is to impose a limitation to the holder\u2019s rights. Recalling the analysis of Professor Katz in this regard, the word \"owned\" by itself does not constitute \"a property right and has to be understood in context: in the context of s. 28(2), it refers to the relation of belonging between a holder of a right and the beneficial interest, which cannot be 'owned\u2019 by anyone other than the account holder, i.e. no trust can be created. In the common law tradition, it is recognized that owning does not in itself refer to holding a property right\".429\n\n**RER-003**, Second Expert Report of Professor Larissa Katz, \u00b6 32, footnote 50, *citing to* **LK-077**, J.W. Harris, \"Property and Justice\" (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 68: (\"'Ownership\u2019 is not a term of art in English law\").\n\n298.\n\nMoreover, the presence or absence of the term \"owned\" has not been determinative to find property in any of the Canadian cases submitted by the parties. In fact, in *Bouckhuyt* the trial court referred to the holder of Tobacco Quotas as an owner who \"does not possess full rights of ownership\",430 a conclusion that was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal. Thus, the use of the words \"own\" and \"owner\" in a statute is not determinative to prove the existence of ownership rights or property over an intangible object.\n\n**LK-0023**, *National Trust Co. v. Bouckhuyt,* [1987] CarswellOnt 141, \u00b6 14.\n\n299.\n\nIn sum, as Professor de Beer acknowledged, the limitations identified in the aforementioned provisions serve the purpose of controlling the regulatory scheme created under the Cap and Trade Act: \"**You have an ability to prescribe regulations and limits**, and it\u2019s much differently worded, and it\u2019s anchored or rooted in the purpose of protecting the integrity of the markets. You can\u2019t have people hoarding allowances beyond the limit, **or you can\u2019t have people hiding their allowances in other people\u2019s accounts held in trust**, and so on and so forth\".431\n\nHearing Tr. Day 3, 759: 15-22 - 760: 1-3 (emphasis added).\n\n300.\n\nThis control is ultimately exerted by, or in favor of, the Government, and it reduces the scope of the participant\u2019s control over the emission allowances. Therefore, the Tribunal is not persuaded that these provisions referred to by Professor de Beer are sufficient to support a finding of \"exclusive control\".\n\nb. Other statutory provisions are indicative of the absence of the \"exclusive control\" element of property\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there are provisions in the Cap and Trade Act which relate to the government powers that were not convincingly addressed by Claimants\u2019 expert. These provisions are:\n\n301.1. Section 33(2), which provides that \"[t]he Minister may cancel Ontario emission allowances in accordance with the regulations in such circumstances as may be prescribed\".432\n\n301.2. Subsection (3) of Section 22, which provides that \"[t]he Director may impose requirements and restrictions with respect to a registered participant\u2019s accounts\".433\n\n301.3. Section 17(4), which provides that \"[d]espite subsection (3), the Director may refuse to register the applicant if the Director is of the opinion that the applicant should not be registered, having regard to such circumstances as may be prescribed and such other matters as the Director considers appropriate\".434\n\n301.4. Subsection (3) of Section 28, which provides that \"[s]ubsection (2) does not apply to such registered participants, or in such circumstances, as may be prescribed\".435\n\n301.5. Section 78(1) subsection (8), which provides that \"(1) The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations in respect of the following matters: [...] (8) Governing the creation, distribution, retirement from circulation, and cancellation of Ontario emission allowances and the retirement of other emission allowances from circulation\".436\n\n**CL-005**, Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016, Cap and Trade Act, Section 33(2), p. 16.\n\n*Id.*, Section 22(3), p. 11.\n\n*Id.*, Section 17(4), p. 9.\n\n*Id.*, Section 28(3), p. 13.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 3, 673-675.\n\n302.\n\nClaimants\u2019 expert\u2019s opinion was that these provisions constituted insufficient discretion to negate the possession of property by Claimants.437 However, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the foregoing provisions, in the aggregate, represent significant limitations to the holders\u2019 control and use of emission allowances by allowing the Government to, *inter alia,* retire them from circulation and cancelling them,438 refuse the registration of an application,439 impose \"requirements and restrictions with respect to registered participant\u2019s accounts\",440 and prescribe exceptions to the prohibition on dividing interest, for participants to create a trust.441\n\nHowever, Claimants\u2019 expert admitted he did not review these provisions in detail in his report. *See* Hearing Tr. Day 3, 677, 681, 685-686, 707-709.\n\n*Id.*, 673-675.\n\n*Id.*, 684-685.\n\n*Id.*, 682.\n\n*Id.*, 708-709.\n\n303.\n\nThese powers were granted either with no restriction - where the Government \"considered appropriate\"442 - or according to regulations issued by the regulator itself443 - as a subset of the Government\u2019s discretion.444 Therefore, the Government had broad powers that imposed significant limitations raising doubts as to the \"exclusivity\" that both Parties claim to be at the core of property rights.445\n\n*Id.*, 684-685.\n\n*Id.*, 678-679.\n\nClaimants\u2019 expert conceded that such provisions envisaged powers for the Government related to emission allowances, which could be exercised without specific restrictions or as the Government considered appropriate. *See* Hearing Tr. Day 3, 674-676, 678-679, 682-683, 685-686, 707-709.\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 210; Hearing Tr. Day 3, 672:17-22; 688: 1-4.\n\n304.\n\nIn addition to these provisions, the Parties and their experts debated whether Section 70 evidences exclusive control over and suggests the intent of the regulator to create property rights in the emission allowances.446\n\n**RER-003**, Second Expert Report of Professor Katz, \u00b6\u00b6 61-64; **CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 192, Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 45.\n\n305.\n\nSection 70 of the Cap and Trade Act provides as follows:\n\n\"**No right to compensation**\n\n**70** (1) Despite any other Act or law, no person is entitled to be compensated for any loss or damages, including loss of revenues, loss of profit or loss of expected earnings that would otherwise have been payable to any person in respect of any action taken by the Minister or the Director under this Act, or by any person acting on their behalf, including any action relating to the removal of emission allowances and credits from a participant\u2019s cap and trade accounts.\n\n**No expropriation, etc.**\n\n(2) Nothing done or not done in accordance with this Act or the regulations constitutes an expropriation or injurious affection for the purposes of the *Expropriations Act* or otherwise at law.\n\n**No payment**\n\n(3) No amount is payable by the Crown with respect to any action taken by the Minister or the Director under this Act, or by any person acting on their behalf, including any action relating to the removal of emission allowances and credits from a participant\u2019s cap and trade accounts\".\n\n306.\n\nProfessor de Beer is of the view that Section 70 leads to the conclusion that emission allowances were property.447 According to him, Section 70 did not limit the holder\u2019s rights to control and use an allowance, but only provided for a limitation of one of the remedies available to the holder by denying \"one path of legal recourse (Ontario expropriation law)\".448 However, as he acknowledged in his cross-examination, expropriation claims are not merely one of many paths to enforcement of property against the State; rather, they are a typical remedy.449\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 192.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 194.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 3, 731.\n\n307.\n\nProfessor de Beer also concludes that if emission allowances were not property, then Section 70 would not have been necessary, \"there would be no need to deny compensation, expropriation, or payment if emission allowances were not property\".450 Respondent\u2019s expert disagrees and submits that the fact that the very statute creating the interest excluded compensation for interferences with such interest confirms \"an intention not to confer a right that is exclusive vis-\u00e0-vis government [...] free from interference by government and others\", and therefore, that the government did not create a property right.451\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6198.\n\n**RER-003**, Second Expert Report of Professor Katz, \u00b6\u00b6 62-64.\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Section 70 addresses two separate concepts. Subsection (1) refers to compensation for any action by the Minister or the Director \"under the Act\", including compensation for the \"removal\" of allowances and credits from a participant\u2019s cap and trade accounts. Subsection (2) specifically refers to expropriation claims for anything \"done or not done in accordance with this Act\" \"for the purposes of the Expropriation Acts or otherwise at law\".\n\n309.\n\nThis evident distinction supports the conclusion that emission allowances are not property under the Cap and Trade Act. That subsection (2) addresses the possibility that any conduct done or not done in accordance with the Act could qualify as an expropriation does not mean that it recognizes allowances as property susceptible of being expropriated. Subsection (1) exists on a separate basis precisely to address the situation in which an allowance could be \"removed\", rather than expropriated.\n\n310.\n\nClaimants\u2019 expert emphasized this distinction, arguing that subsection (2) was limited to the expropriation of land-based facilities and was not to address government actions regarding emission allowances or trading accounts and transactions (which are not interests in land and therefore whose taking or injurious affection would not be covered by the Expropriation Act in any event).452 There is also a textual distinction between subsection (1), which uses the term \"removal\" when referring to allowances instead of the term \"taking\", and subsection (2), which refers to \"taking\" and expropriations.453 \"Taking\" is the term that is used by the Expropriations Act: \"'expropriate\u2019 means the **taking** of land without the consent of the owner by an expropriating authority in the exercise of its statutory powers; ('exproprier\u2019)\".454 This difference in language, while not determinative, may assist in the interpretation of the Cap and Trade Act.\n\n**CER-003**, Expert Report of Professor Jeremy de Beer, \u00b6 195.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 195, the Claimants\u2019 expert referring to \"taking or injurious affection\" in the context of the Expropriations Act; \u00b6 123, \"the context of 'takings\u2019 clause under the Fifth Amendment\".\n\n**JDB-008**, *Expropriations Act,* 1990, Article I, Definitions (emphasis added).\n\n311.\n\nOverall, the Tribunal observes that the treatment assigned to emission allowances under Section 70 is relevant in light of the general parameters derived from the analysis of the Canadian decisions debated by the Parties in this arbitration*.* In the Tribunal\u2019s view, discretionary powers over statutory creations permitting the taking, removal or modification of rights by the Government without compensation may be indicative of the absence of the exclusive control element required to find property in Ontario.455 The Cap and Trade act not only excludes claims for the \"removal\" of emission allowances but also does not recognize the possibility of expropriations of emission allowances, supporting the conclusion that these intangible objects were not conceived as property in Ontario.\n\nIn *Anglehart,* the absence of a right to bring expropriation claims for the reduction of fishing quotas was linked to the absence of property. In *Bouckhuyt,* when defining the element of \"exclusivity\", the Court referred to a previous U.S. case that \"reflected [its] same approach\" by holding that property \"does not arise from value, although exchangeable - a matter of fact. Many exchangeable values may be destroyed intentionally without compensation. Property depends upon exclusion by law from interference\". *See* **LK-23,** *National Trust Co. v. Bouckhuyt,* [1987] CarswellOnt 141, \u00b6 25. From the foregoing, it appears that the ability to \"destroy\" an exchangeable value without giving rise to a right to compensation, would indicate that the element of exclusivity may not be satisfied.\n\n312.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal is of the view that Section 70 is indicative of a degree of discretion, control and interference by the Government inconsistent with the concept of \"exclusive control\".\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on Article 1139(g)*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that there is a significant number of provisions of the Cap and Trade Act that, in the aggregate, grant the regulator a broad degree of control over the rights conferred over the emission allowances. These broad powers affect the possibility of legally enforcing the holder\u2019s rights against the State. Contrary to the suggestion of Claimants\u2019 expert, the Cap and Trade Act does not provide for exclusive control by participants, but only control over certain rights in limited circumstances.\n\n314.\n\nThe powers granted to the regulator are certainly not unfettered or unlimited. However, as previously discussed, there is no standard identifying the scope of the powers or extent of the discretion of the Minister sufficient to limit the control of an emission holder such as to create an obstacle to a finding of property. The issue is not whether the powers of the government are unlimited, but rather whether such powers are broad enough to sufficiently limit exclusive control, which the Tribunal finds to be the case.\n\n315.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that the Minister had broad discretion but subject to the law and therefore the discretion is a limited one. Discretion does not mean arbitrariness, and whatever the degree of discretion granted to a regulator, it does not authorize a government to act outside the framework of the law in the exercise of that discretion. What matters for purposes of this arbitration, however, is whether the Cap and Trade Act granted discretion to the regulator which was broad enough to exclude or seriously limit exclusive control by the holder of the allowance. How such discretion is exercised, is a different matter.\n\n316.\n\nBased on its analysis of the context, purpose and text of the Cap and Trade Act, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Claimants have demonstrated the existence of \"exclusive control\" over emission allowances under the Cap and Trade Act sufficient to constitute the core element required of property in Ontario. That said, this is a very close case. Claimants are correct in that emission allowances do have a number of attributes of property under common law. However, the decisions of the Ontario and Canadian courts that the Parties have submitted in this arbitration indicate that exclusivity is the key element to determine property, and that, to the extent that the holder does not have sufficient control over the asset, there can be no finding of property. Therefore, on the balance of probabilities, and considering the approach developed by Ontario and Canadian courts, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence presented by Claimants in this arbitration does not demonstrate that, as a holder of emission allowances under the Cap and Trade Act, KS&T had sufficient control over those allowances to satisfy the necessary attribute of exclusive control to find property under Ontario law.\n\n317.\n\nIn the absence of evidence that Claimants had property in Canada, the Tribunal must conclude that Claimants did not have an investment in Canada as required by Article 1139(g) of NAFTA.\n\n**C. Jurisdiction under NAFTA Article 1139(h)**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1. Respondent\u2019s Position\n------------------------\n\n318.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants have failed to articulate a cohesive theory of their investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h).456 According to the Respondent, the Claimants initially claimed that their investment comprised KS&T\u2019s \"broader carbon trading business\", as well as the purchase price of emission allowances in Ontario,457 but then seemed to abandon the first part of their claim to \"focus exclusively on the 'emission allowances\u2019, not their purchase price, as the relevant 'interest\u2019\".458 In any event, it is Respondent\u2019s case that neither of these alleged investments is an interest protected by Article 1139(h).459\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 145; Hearing Tr.

Day 1, 226:15-18.\n\n319.\n\nRespondent submits that principles of proper treaty interpretation require that the *chapeau* of Article 1139(h) be read in conjunction with subparagraphs (h)(i) and (h)(ii).460 Accordingly, to qualify as an investment under Article 1139(h), an \"interest\" must exhibit similar features to those of the illustrative examples in the subparagraphs.461\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 146-148.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 149.\n\n320.\n\nAccording to Respondent:\n\n\"The common features of the illustrative examples include references to contracts; the presence of an investor\u2019s property or an enterprise in the territory of the host Party; and economic activities in the territory of the host Party *(e.g.* turnkey or construction contracts or concessions; or production, revenue or profits of an enterprise). The types of contractual interests illustrated in subparagraphs (h)(i) and (h)(ii) thus confirm that, for an interest to meet the requirements of Article 1139(h), it must be longer-term and include an important commitment of capital contributing to the economic development of the host State\".462\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 150. (footnotes omitted).\n\n321.\n\nRespondent claims that KT&S\u2019s \"interests\" do not meet the specific requirements of Article 1139(h) as they bear no similarity to the illustrative examples of subparagraphs (h)(i) and (h)(ii).463\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 152.\n\n322.\n\nFirst, KS&T had no physical or corporate presence in Ontario consistent with Articles 1139(h)(i) or (ii), which is indicative of the kind of economic activity necessary to give rise to a qualifying interest.464\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 153; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 53.\n\n323.\n\nSecond, the economic activities that KS&T undertook in Ontario were not in support of any \"business in Ontario\", but in the U.S.465 The evidence shows that (i)KS&T\u2019s purchases of emission allowances through its Ontario CITSS account were orchestrated and executed in the U.S.;466 (ii) it was the company\u2019s standard practice to move all emission allowances it purchased through its Ontario account to its California account immediately;467 and (iii) very few of KS&T\u2019s secondary market transactions had any meaningful connection with Ontario.468 Indeed, almost none of KS&T\u2019s bilateral trades in compliance instruments used its Ontario CITSS account, involved another Ontario CITSS account, or were governed by Ontario law.469 Similarly, KS&T\u2019s trading in future contracts involved \"[b]uying and selling anonymous promises to deliver in the future on a U.S. exchange\", which \"is not a business activity in Ontario, even if the derivative product could involve the future delivery of an Ontario emission allowance\".470\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 154; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 52.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 154; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 54.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 154.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 55.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 155; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 55.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 56.\n\n324.\n\nThird, \"the mere expenditure of funds, even in connection with an 'interest\u2019, does not suffice to qualify as an investment under Article 1139(h)\".471 This is confirmed by Articles 1139(i) and (j), which exclude from protection \"claims to money\" arising from (i) cross-border sales agreements for goods or services, (ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, or (iii) any other claims to money that do not otherwise fall within the specifically enumerated categories of investment in Article 1139.472 As confirmed by the tribunals in *Apotex* and *Canadian Cattlemen*, cross-border trade interests are not protected under NAFTA Article 1139(h), as this provision requires \"something more permanent\".473\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 156; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 58.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 151.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6155-156, *citing* **RL-030**, *Apotex Inc. v.

Claimants\u2019 assertion that they held rights in a \"broader carbon trading business\" cannot serve as the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction because Article 1139(h) requires, among other things, a cognizable interest and Claimants have failed to identify what those rights are.476\n\n326.2. The emission allowances KS&T purchased in the May 2018 auction do not qualify as an investment under Article 1139(h) for the reasons set forth in paragraphs 322 and 323 above. KS&T had no physical or corporate presence in Ontario and its activities in the primary and secondary markets were conducted from the U.S. or to support its U.S. business.477\n\n326.3. The monies used to purchase the emission allowances do not qualify as an investment under Article 1139(h) either. According to Canada, \"the mere expenditure of funds is not sufficient on its own to qualify as an investment in Ontario\",478 especially given that \"KS&T expressly purchased the emission allowances in the May 2018 auction to sell in California for use against compliance obligations in the United Stated, and to settle anonymous futures contracts on a US exchange\".479 But even if the mere expenditure of funds were sufficient to qualify an interest as an investment, (i) \"Claimants have not established the requisite connection between the emission allowances that are the subject of this claim, and monies used to purchase allowances that are not\",480 and (ii) \"the maximum that KS&T can be said to have spent in Ontario in the May 2018 auction\" is [REDACTED] which corresponds to the purchase price for the Ontario- created allowances.481\n\nHearing Tr.

Claimants\u2019 Position\n----------------------\n\n328.\n\nClaimants maintain that \"the emission allowances that KS&T acquired, together with its carbon trading business in Ontario, are also 'interests arising from the commitment of capital and other resources\u2019 to economic activity in Ontario and independently qualify as protected 'interests\u2019 under NAFTA Article 1139(h)\".482\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 79.\n\n329.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 1139(h) is incorrect. First, they claim that \"[t]he term 'interest\u2019 carries a broad ordinary meaning that extends far beyond the realm of contracts\".483 According to Claimants, NAFTA tribunals have held that Article 1139(h) covers \"anything amounting to 'an actual and demonstrable entitlement of the investor to a certain benefit under an existing contract or other legal instrument\u2019\".484 Emission allowances, in and of themselves, fall within that definition and Respondent does not seem to deny it.485\n\nReply, \u00b6 313.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 313, citing to **CL-019**, *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v.

Rather, in the present dispute KS&T: (i) sought and obtained registered status as an Ontario market participant in accordance with Ontario law; (ii) possessed an Ontario CITSS account; (iii) retained the services of an Ontario-resident Koch company employee as its Ontario-based representative; (iv) bid for Ontario-created emissions allowances at six auctions held and regulated by Ontario; (v) paid monies destined for the public coffers of Ontario in exchange for emission allowances; (vi) held emission allowances in its Ontario CITSS account for varying amounts of time over a period of more than 18 months following their purchases; and (vii) entered into contracts for the supply of offsets and/or emission allowances from its Ontario CITSS account to Canadian purchasers\".493\n\nReply, \u00b6 318.\n\n335.\n\nSecond, Claimants\u2019 interests arose from the commitment of capital \"in the territory of [Ontario] \" \"to economic activity in [Ontario\u2019s] territory\".494 Respondent\u2019s position that \"KS&T\u2019s business strategy merely involved purchasing emission allowances from auctions 'almost exclusively for transfer to its California CITSS account.for resale in that jurisdiction\u2019\"495 is unsupported considering KS&T\u2019s active presence as an Ontario registered market participant.496\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 84, citing to **CD-1**, Claimants\u2019 Opening Statement, Slide 113.\n\nReply, \u00b6 319.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 320.\n\n336.\n\nIn this regard, Claimants argue that:\n\n336.1. KS&T \"built its emission allowance inventory in its Ontario CITSS account by committing capital that was intended to fund Ontario green projects\".497 KS&T\u2019s participation in secondary market OTC and futures transactions with counterparties in Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec and California was \"intrinsically linked to its ownership of an Ontario-based CITSS account into which it deposited and held and through which it traded in [Ontario Carbon Allowances (**OCAs**)] as an Ontario-registered market participant\".498 What matters is that the economic effect of the investment is felt in the host State\u2019s territory as was the case here.499\n\n336.2. In trading as an Ontario-registered market participant, KS&T complied in good faith with the legal framework established by Ontario, including the holding limits of allowances in Ontario CITSS accounts.500 KS&T \"stored\" it allowances in California to maximize its investment while ensuring compliance with these holding limits.501 Also, storing these allowances in KS&T\u2019s California CITSS account did not affect their utility to satisfy compliance obligations in Ontario.502\n\n336.3. Respondent\u2019s argument that KS&T acquired emission allowances in the May 2018 auction to sell them to a U.S. company with compliance obligations in California is a red herring, since this was just \"the latest activity by a registered market participant which regularly traded and transacted in the Ontario Cap and Trade Program over the course of 2017 and 2018\".503\n\n336.4. Regardless, \"there is no debate that throughout 2017 and 2018 Ontario received the proceeds of its emissions allowances purchased by KS&T, which constituted continuing and regular commitments of capital made directly to the Ontario Government and to economic activity in the territory of Ontario\".504 Tribunals considering financial investments have been satisfied that a sufficient territorial nexus exists as long as funds were made available to host States and served to finance their economy or needs.505\n\n**CD-1**, Claimants\u2019 Opening Statement, Slide 113.\n\nReply, \u00b6 323.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 323.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 324.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 324.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 325.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 326, *citing to* **CWS-006**, Reply Witness Statement of Frank King, \u00b6\u00b6 16-31.\n\nReply, \u00b6 327.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 327.\n\n337.\n\nIn any event, according to Claimants, Respondent is estopped from challenging jurisdiction based on an alleged insufficient territorial link \"given its own prior legislative and regulatory provisions and public statements encouraging investors in the Ontario Program to treat all three jurisdictions as a single borderless market\".506\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 86. *See also,* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 330-341.\n\n3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether Claimants had a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h). According to Claimants, the emission allowances that KS&T acquired, along with its carbon trading business in Ontario, qualify as \"'interests arising from the commitment of capital and other resources\u2019 to economic activity in Ontario\", and thus meet the requirements for protection under Article 1139(h).507 In contrast, Respondent maintains that Claimants have failed to establish that \"KS&T held interests contemplated by Article 1139(h), properly understood\".508\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 79.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 49.\n\n339.\n\nArticle 1139(h) of the NAFTA reads as follows :\n\n\"[I]nvestment means:\n\n[...]\n\n(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under\n\n(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor\u2019s property in the territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or\n\n(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise\".509\n\n**CL-002**, North American Free Trade Agreement, 1994, Chapter Eleven.\n\n340.\n\nArticle 1139(h) comprises a general description of interests which give rise to an investment, a *chapeau* and two sub-paragraphs which refer to certain examples. The Parties disagree as to the role of these sub-paragraphs in the interpretation of this provision and its scope. Respondent claims that (i) the two sub-paragraphs constitute highly relevant context that clarifies the type of interests covered by Article 1139(h);510 (ii) to qualify for protection, an alleged interest must have features similar to the illustrative examples in the sub-paragraphs;511 (iii) the common features of these examples include the reference to contracts, the presence of an investor\u2019s property or enterprise in the host State, and economic activities conducted within the host State\u2019s territory;512 and (iv) KS&T\u2019s alleged interests do not bear any similarity to these examples.513\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 148.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 149.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 150.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 152.\n\n341.\n\nClaimants, on the other hand, maintain that (i) the term \"interests\" carries a broad ordinary meaning, which should guide the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation;514 (ii) Article 1139(h) is not limited to contracts;515 (iii) the two sub-paragraphs merely serve as examples of the \"interests\" that fall within the scope of this provision and do not restrict the meaning and extent of qualifying interests;516 and (iv) emission allowances do not need to correspond to these examples to qualify for protection.517\n\nReply, \u00b6 313; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 83.\n\nReply, \u00b6 345.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 345 and 348.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 346 and 348.\n\n342.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1139(h) and then examine whether Claimants have a protected investment based on the facts.\n\n*(a) Interpretation of NAFTA Article 1139(h)*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal must interpret the NAFTA in accordance with the general rule of treaty interpretation contained in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (**VCLT**). Indeed, NAFTA Article 1131(1) mandates that the Tribunal decide the issues in dispute in accordance with the NAFTA and \"applicable rules of international law\".518 Similarly, NAFTA Article 102(2) requires that the treaty provisions be interpreted and applied in light of the objectives stated in Article 102(1), and in accordance with \"applicable rules of international law\".519\n\n**CL-002**, North American Free Trade Agreement, 1994, Chapter Eleven, Article 1131(1).\n\n*Id.*, Chapter One.\n\n344.\n\nThe term \"applicable rules of international law\" is widely understood to encompass the customary rules of treaty interpretation, which are reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.520 Furthermore, despite the United States not being a party to the VCLT, it recognizes that Article 31 of the Convention reflects customary international law regarding treaty interpretation.521 In addition, both Canada and Mexico are parties to the VCLT. Therefore, the Tribunal will apply the VCLT\u2019s \"general rule of interpretation\" when interpreting Article 1139(h).\n\n**RL-031**, *Canadian Cattlemen for Fair Trade v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, 28 January 2008, \u00b6 46.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 1, 10:4-7.\n\n345.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the VCLT requires that a treaty be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\".522 In turn, Article 31(2) specifies that the relevant context includes the treaty\u2019s text, its preamble and annexes, and certain related agreements or instruments.523 The elements of VCLT Article 31(1) \"form a single rule of interpretation and may not be taken separately or in isolation\".524\n\n**RL-029,** Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969 (entered into force 27 January 1980) 1155 U.N.T.S. 331, Art. 31(1).\n\n*Id.*, Art. 31(2) (\"The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: (a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty; (b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty\").\n\n**RL-014**, *Postov\u00e1 banka, a.s. and ISTROKAPITAL SE v. Hellenic Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/8, Award, 9 April 2015, \u00b6 282.\n\n346.\n\nAs noted earlier, NAFTA Article 1139(h) comprises a *chapeau* and two sub-paragraphs. Claimants challenge Respondent\u2019s use of the sub-paragraphs525 and instead focus their argument on the *chapeau*. They contend that \"[t]he emission allowances that KS&T acquired, together with its carbon trading business in Ontario, are [...] interests arising from the commitment of capital and other resources as set out under NAFTA Article 1139(h)\".526 According to Claimants, it is sufficient to prove that (i) they hold an \"interest\" (understood in a broad sense), (ii) which arose from the commitment of capital, (iii) in the territory of Ontario.527\n\n*See*, Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 1, 90:9-13.\n\nReply, \u00b6 310. *See also,* Hearing Tr. Day 1, 90:6-93:2.\n\n347.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees. First, the term \"interests\" cannot be construed in isolation from the other elements outlined in Article 1139(h). This provision only extends protection to \"interests arising *from* the commitment of capital or other resources *in* the territory of a Party *to* economic activity in such territory\".528 Thus, there must be a cognizable interest that results from committing those resources within the territory of a Party towards economic activity within that territory. In this case, the territory in question is Ontario.\n\n**CL-002**, North American Free Trade Agreement, 1994, Chapter Eleven, Article 1139(h) (emphasis added).\n\n348.\n\nSecond, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, proper treaty interpretation requires that meaning be given to the examples in the sub-paragraphs and their content as part of the context of the treaty.529 Not considering them would suggest that the examples are redundant and lack purpose, despite the fact that states carefully negotiate and draft their treaties to clarify their scope.530 The Tribunal notes that, unlike other treaties containing lists of broad examples, the sub-paragraphs contain limited and specific examples that clarify the scope of Article 1139(h). As the tribunal in *Grand River* found, \"NAFTA\u2019s Article 1139 is neither broad nor open-textured. It prescribes an exclusive list of elements or activities that constitute an investment for purposes of NAFTA\".531 This does not mean that an alleged investment must fall squarely within one of the examples to be protected. The term \"such as\" indicates that they are illustrative, rather than exhaustive. However, it is more focused than the frequently used term \"including\" and implies similarity with the examples or their features. Therefore, the alleged investment must exhibit features similar to those in the examples in the sub-paragraphs 1139(h)(i) and/or (ii).532\n\n**RL-014,** *Postov\u00e1 banka, a.s. and ISTROKAPITAL SE v.

Mexico,* the tribunal reached a similar conclusion, which Respondent cited in its pleadings and which Claimants did not dispute as relevant to this case. In considering whether promissory notes *(pagar\u00e9s no negociables)* issued in connection with short-term loans extended by a Canadian company to two Mexican enterprises qualified as protected investments under NAFTA Article 1139(h),533 the tribunal in *Lion v. Mexico* stated that:\n\n\"The *chapeau* cannot be read by itself. The NAFTA does not extend protection to any 'commitments of capital\u2019, but only to those which exhibit certain features so as to give rise to \"interests\". These features are defined through two illustrative examples in subparagraphs (h.i) and (h.ii)\".534\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 101 and 163.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 205.\n\n350.\n\nThe tribunal in *Lion v. Mexico* concluded that the promissory notes were not contracts and the contracts underlying those notes did not share any of the characteristics described in sub-paragraphs (h)(i) and (h)(ii).535 The tribunal then provided the following reasoning to support the latter conclusion:\n\n\"The contracts that underlie the *pagar\u00e9s no negociables* - short-term, fixed-interest loans - do not share any traits with the contracts described in sub-paragraphs (h.i) and (h.ii), which serve as illustrative examples of protected 'commitments of capital\u2019. Sub-paragraph (h.i) covers construction contracts and concessions, and sub-paragraph (h.ii) contracts with variable remuneration. The ordinary meaning of a term in a treaty must be read in its context, as Art. 31.1 VCLT mandates. And in this case the context provided by sub-paragraphs (h.i) and (h.ii) shows that 'commitments of capital\u2019 to be protected under paragraph (h) must show some additional, defining feature, which simple short-term fixed-interest loans lack. Loans are specifically governed by Art. 1139(d) NAFTA - and only protected provided that the requirements set forth in that provision are met\".536\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 205-207.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 207.\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with the *Lion v. Mexico* tribunal that the examples in Article 1139(h) of NAFTA serve to illustrate the type of arrangements that might give rise to protected interests under Article 1139(h). Therefore, the arrangements in question must share some resemblance to those provided as examples.\n\n352.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the tribunal in *Lion v. Mexico* found that mortgages, as opposed to short term fixed loans, did constitute property under Article 1139(g), because under Mexican laws, mortgages were explicitly defined as *in rem* rights that encumber real estate.537 As noted in section V(B)(3)(b), paragraph 165 above, the case of emission allowances is different in that there is no statutory provision or judicial decision recognizing them as property.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 217-225.\n\n*(b) Whether KS&T held a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nClaimants have identified their protected interests under Article 1139(h) as the \"emission allowances that KS&T acquired, together with its carbon trading business in Ontario\".538 Claimants contend that the ordinary meaning of the term \"interest\" should guide the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation and assert that emission allowances clearly fall within the broad ordinary meaning of the term, which includes a legal share in something and any right, privilege, power, or immunity, as per its dictionary definition.539\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 79.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 313-314; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 83. Claimants further contend that \"NAFTA tribunals have [...] construed the provision broadly, such that it is understood to cover anything amounting to 'an actual and demonstrable entitlement of the investor to a certain benefit under an existing contract or other legal instrument\u2019\" (Reply, \u00b6 313; emphasis in original) and cite paragraph 142 of the *Merrill & Ring Forestry v. Canada* award in support of this proposition. However, the Tribunal notes that, read in context, the quote to the *Merrill & Ring* award seems to refer to rights capable of being expropriated, rather than to qualifying investments under NAFTA Article 1139(h). (*See*, **CL-019,** *Merrill & Ring Forestry L. P. v. Government of Canada,* ICSID Administered Case No. UNCT/07/1, Award, 31 March 2010, \u00b6 142).\n\n354.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the notion that emission allowances are covered under the term \"interests\" as outlined in Article 1139(h). First, as mentioned earlier, the term \"interests\" cannot be interpreted in isolation from the other elements specified in the article. Second, even if the focus were exclusively on this term, the Tribunal is still not convinced that emission allowances are included in the ordinary sense of \"interests\" as used in Article 1139(h).\n\n355.\n\nClaimants cite the definition of \"interest\" from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, which reads as follows:\n\n\"**interest** n. (15c) **1.** [...] **2.** A legal share in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property . \u2022 Collectively, the word includes any aggregation of rights, privileges, powers, and immunities; distributively, it refers to any one right, privilege, power, or immunity\".540\n\n**CL-171**, \"Interest\", in Bryan A. Garner (Editor in Chief), Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 11th ed (2019).\n\n356.\n\nHowever, only the first part of this definition (\"[a] legal share in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property\") corresponds to the sense in which the term is used in Article 1139(h). This is further confirmed by examining the Spanish and French versions of the *chapeau* of Article 1139(h), which are equally authoritative:541\n\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement, 1994, Art. 2206 (\"The English, French and Spanish texts of this Agreement are equally authentic\"); **RL-029,** *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,* 23 May 1969 (entered into force 27 January 1980) 1155 U.N.T.S. 331, Art. 33.\n\n357.\n\nIn Spanish, the *chapeau* of NAFTA Article 1139(h) reads as follows:\n\n\"la **participaci\u00f3n** que resulte del capital u otros recursos destinados para el desarrollo de una actividad econ\u00f3mica en territorio de otra Parte, entre otros, conforme a: [...]\" (emphasis added)\n\n358.\n\nThe French version provides:\n\n\"les int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019engagement de capitaux ou d\u2019autres ressources sur le territoire d\u2019une Partie pour une activit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique exerc\u00e9e sur ce territoire, par exemple en raison: [...]\"\n\n359.\n\nAs explained earlier, under the Cap and Trade Act and the Regulation, an emission allowance is a permit or right granted to mandatory or voluntary participants, allowing them to emit greenhouse gases up to a specified limit.542 As a market participant, KS&T had no cap obligations and was not subject to penalties for exceeding any such cap.543 Since emission allowances did not grant KS&T a legal share in any asset or resource, they cannot be considered as \"interests\" under Article 1139(h).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 283-284 above.\n\nAward, \u00b6 285 above.\n\n360.\n\nIn relation to the claim that KS&T\u2019s trading business in Ontario is a protected investment under Article 1139(h), the Tribunal acknowledges the inherent complexities of the trading business.\n\n361.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal notes that the essence of KS&T\u2019s activities involved purchasing emission allowances in the primary market and reselling them in the secondary market. These purchase and sale transactions bear no resemblance to those described in the illustrative examples of sub-paragraphs (h)(i) and (h)(ii).\n\n362.\n\nArticle 1139(h) specifies that interests must arise from a commitment of capital in the host state\u2019s territory for the development of an economic activity in that territory. Sub-paragraph (h)(i) pertains to contracts that involve the presence of an investor\u2019s property in the territory of the host State, while subparagraph (h)(ii) relates to contracts \"where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise\". The illustrative examples therefore suggest that the types of arrangements that can give rise to protected interests are related to economic activities in the host state\u2019s territory that involve the presence of an investor\u2019s property or of an enterprise in that territory. This is consistent with the types of investments covered under Article 1139, which basically comprise (i) interests related to situations where the investor owns or finances \"enterprises\" located in the host State, and (ii) real estate or other property in the host State.544\n\n*See*, **RL-024,** *Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2), Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 July 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 182-186.\n\n363.\n\nFor instance, in *Mondev v. USA,* the tribunal determined that the Canadian claimant\u2019s interests, which were based on its U.S. subsidiary\u2019s contractual rights to develop large property parcels in Boston, met the definition of an \"investment\" as outlined in NAFTA Article 1139(h).545\n\n**CL-056**, *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, \u00b6\u00b6 80-83.\n\n364.\n\nHowever, in the present case, KS&T did not have any physical or corporate presence, or economic activity, in Ontario, except for a Koch-company employee based in Ontario who was appointed as their local representative to fulfill a regulatory obligation. Additionally, the activities related to the trading business, including the planning and execution of purchases in primary and secondary markets, were carried out from the U.S. As further detailed below, there is no evidence that KS&T\u2019s trading business was linked to a specific underlying economic project, operation, or activity taking place in Ontario.546\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 377-400 below.\n\n365.\n\nClaimants have strongly emphasized that the proceeds from KS&T\u2019s purchase of emission allowances were received by Ontario to fund green projects in the province.547 Their argument that the territorial nexus requirement is met based on the availability of funds for Ontario\u2019s economy or needs relies on decisions made by non-NAFTA tribunals considering treaty provisions different from the ones at stake in this arbitration, in the context of financial investments like sovereign bonds and hedging agreements.548 However, this reasoning cannot be applied to NAFTA Article 1139(h), which sets specific requirements for an expenditure of funds to qualify for protection.\n\n*See*, Reply, \u00b6 327; **CD-001**,Claimants\u2019 Opening Statement, Slide 113.\n\nReply, \u00b6 327, citing **CL-155,** *Abaclat and Others (Case formerly known as Giovanna a Beccara and Others) v.

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/02, Award, 31 October 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 288, 292.\n\n366.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the emission allowances acquired by KS&T and its carbon trading business, considered in the context of NAFTA Article 1139(h) as a whole, do not constitute protected investments. Even if the illustrative examples are disregarded, it is not in dispute that the *chapeau* of Article 1139(h) requires economic activity in the territory of the host State. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, KS&T\u2019s activity was based on cross-border trade, which several NAFTA tribunals have found not to be protected by Article 1139(h).\n\n367.\n\nIn *Apotex v. USA,* the tribunal found that the claimant\u2019s interests in submitting, maintaining, and using its applications for regulatory approval of two generic drug products, as well as gaining an economic benefit from selling the products in the U.S., did not qualify for protection under NAFTA Article 1139(h).549 The tribunal noted that Article 1139(h) does not cover \"simple cross-border trade interests\"550 and that the interests identified by the claimant \"amount to no more than the ordinary conduct of a business for the export and sale of goods\".551\n\n**RL-030**, *Apotex Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/10/2, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 14 June 2013, \u00b6 235.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 233.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 235, \u00b6\u00b6 226-241.\n\n368.\n\nThe *Apotex* tribunal further noted that Article 1139(h) must be read together with Articles 1139(i) and (j), which clarify what does not qualify as an investment, and concluded that \"NAFTA Article 1139(h)\u2019s focus on interests arising from the commitment of capital in the host State to economic activity in such territory excludes simple cross-border trade interests. Something more permanent is necessary\".552\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 232-233.\n\n369.\n\nIn *Merrill & Ring Forestry v. Canada,* the tribunal considered whether the claimant\u2019s allegedly expropriated right, defined as the \"interest in realizing fair market value for its logs on the international market\", was protected under NAFTA Article 1139(h).553 The tribunal noted that Article 1139(h) covers \"contractual interests and contractual rights\", while Articles 1139(i) and (j) exclude \"claims to money under commercial contracts and other commercial arrangements\".554 The tribunal determined that the claimant\u2019s right did \"not appear to arise from a contract that might be considered directly related to the investment made\".555 Indeed, according to the tribunal, the purported interest was only a potential interest and not an actual right; however, even if it were an actual right, it would still fall within the exclusions of Articles 1139(i) and (j).556\n\n**CL-019**, *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.

USA,* the tribunal considered whether domestic investors were eligible for protection under NAFTA Chapter Eleven.557 It concluded that they were not, based, among others, on its reading of Articles 1139(i) and (j) in conjunction with Article 1139(h). The tribunal noted that these provisions require something more permanent, such as a commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, for a contractual claim for money based on cross-border trade to be considered an investment under Chapter Eleven.558\n\n*See*, **RL-031**, *Canadian Cattlemen for Fair Trade v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, 28 January 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 31 and 111.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 140-144.\n\n371.\n\nClaimants claim that their interests arose from the commitment of capital in the territory of Ontario.559 Specifically, Claimants assert that (i) \"KS&T actively participated in Ontario in both the primary and secondary markets\"560 and (ii) \"[i]n any event, the Respondent is estopped from denying jurisdiction on the basis of territorial objections\".561\n\nReply, \u00a7 III.B.2(a)(3).\n\n*Id.*, \u00a7 III.B.2, p. 109.\n\n*Id.*, \u00a7 III.B.2, p. 112.\n\n372.\n\nAfter carefully examining the evidence on the record, the Tribunal has concluded that KS&T did not conduct sufficient economic activity in the territory of Ontario to establish jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under NAFTA Article 1139(h).\n\n373.\n\nKS&T\u2019s economic activities primarily involved purchasing allowances in Ontario and then transferring them to California for resale in the secondary market. Claimants do not dispute this, but rather affirm that they had traded for many years in Qu\u00e9bec and California. The evidence suggests that KS&T registered as a market participant in the Ontario program with the expectation that it would be linked to California and Qu\u00e9bec.562 KS&T had been registered as market participant in California since 2013 and had a CITSS account there.563 Additionally, the company was active in the Qu\u00e9bec and Alberta markets.564 By registering as a participant in the Ontario program, KS&T could purchase allowances in the primary market through the auctions hosted by Ontario, which would become fungible with those of other participating jurisdictions after the programs were linked.565 KS&T had decided not to participate in auctions in California due to the stringent disclosure obligations in that jurisdiction.566 KS&T identified the potential to effectively sell allowances and offsets to new counterparties once linkage occurred,567 and to promote efficient compliance for two Koch Ontario-based subsidiaries.568 Finally, KS&T\u2019s entry into the Ontario program prior to the linkage presented an arbitrage opportunity, as it could obtain the allowances at a lower price in Ontario and profit from the increase in their value once the linkage occurred.569\n\nHearing Tr.

As outlined in section V(B)(3)(b)(i) above, Canadian decisions have consistently recognized that the fact that an object has value, while an indication of property, is not sufficient in itself to support a finding of property in Ontario, as required by Article 1139(g).574\n\n*See,* **LK-012,** *Anglehart v. Canada,* [2018] CAF 115, \u00b6 18, referring to *Saulnier* \"Therefore, the concepts of *profit \u00e0 prendre* and of the market value of licences addressed by the Supreme Court in *Saulnier* depend on the definition of 'property\u2019 set out in the legislation at issue. Justice Binnie, writing the reasons for the Court in *Saulnier,* is careful to specify that '[i]t is extremely doubtful that a simple [fishing] licence could itself be considered property at common law\u2019 even though 'a fishing licence is unquestionably a major commercial asset\u2019 *(Saulnier,* at paragraph 23)\". *See* also, **LK-23,** *National Trust Co. v. Bouckhuyt,* 1987 CarswellOnt 141, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26:  \n\"The United States Supreme Court reflected this same approach when it considered what constituted 'property\u2019 in *International News Service v. Associated Press,* supra. In the reasons of Justice Holmes, the following passage appears at p. 246:  \n... Property, a creation of law, does not arise from value, although exchangeable \u2014 a matter of fact. Many exchangeable values may be destroyed intentionally without compensation. Property depends upon exclusion by law from interference, and a person is not excluded from using any combination of words merely because someone has used it before, even if it took labor and genius to make it. ... The principle enunciated there is, I think, applicable to the facts of this case. Although the BPQ might be sold in a limited market, the mere fact that it could be exchanged, sold, pledged or leased does not in itself make it property\".\n\n378.\n\nAfter the programs were linked, the joint auctions included allowances from all three jurisdictions, and payments were divided up based on the number of allowances from each jurisdiction.575 KS&T decided to bid in these auctions as an Ontario-registered market participant but effectively purchased allowances from all three jurisdictions, with the purchase price being distributed to each jurisdiction accordingly.576\n\n**C-036**, Detailed Auction Requirements and Instructions, updated 26 January 2018, p. 7; pp. 51-52.\n\n*See*, *Id.*, pp. 51-52; **R-162**, [REDACTED] **RWS-002,** Witness Statement of Nadia Ramlal, Attachment 1. In the first joint auction, held in February 2018, KS&T purchased a total of [REDACTED] allowances. Out of the total allowances purchased, [REDACTED] allowances [REDACTED] were allocated from California; [REDACTED] allowances [REDACTED] from Ontario, and [REDACTED] allowances [REDACTED] from Qu\u00e9bec. In the second joint auction, held in May 2018, KS&T purchased a total of [REDACTED] allowances. Out of the total allowances purchased, [REDACTED] allowances [REDACTED] were allocated from California; [REDACTED] allowances [REDACTED] from Ontario, and [REDACTED] allowances [REDACTED]from Qu\u00e9bec. *See also,* **R-089**, [REDACTED]\n\n379.\n\nMost importantly, the evidence shows that after the auctions KS&T consistently transferred allowances deposited into its Ontario CITSS account to its California CITSS account and thereafter traded from California, not Ontario. Indeed, KS&T moved the allowances purchased in Ontario-only auctions to California [REDACTED]577 Similarly, it began transferring allowances purchased at the first joint-auction [REDACTED]578 and further planned to transfer the allowances purchased in the second and last joint-auction [REDACTED] into its Ontario CITSS account.579\n\n**RWS-002,** Witness Statement of Nadia Ramlal, Attachment 1.\n\n*Id.*, Attachment 1.

The allowances did not remain in Ontario [REDACTED]. Additionally, Mr. King\u2019s clarification during the Hearing that [REDACTED] undermines Claimants\u2019 argument.\n\n382.\n\nSimilarly, Claimants\u2019 argument that KS&T not using the allowances purchased in the Ontario-only auctions to satisfy regulatory requirements in Ontario cannot be held against them due to the program\u2019s early cancellation583 does not change the Tribunal\u2019s assessment. The Tribunal must consider the activities that KS&T actually carried out rather than what it could have potentially done if the program had continued until 2030.

Finally, the Tribunal concurs with Respondent\u2019s argument that engaging in [REDACTED] on a U.S. exchange does not constitute a business activity in Ontario, even if it entails the possibility of [REDACTED] being delivered.607\n\n*See*, Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6 56.\n\n396.\n\nFinally, Claimants\u2019 assert that Respondent is estopped from challenging jurisdiction based on an alleged insufficient territorial link \"given its own prior legislative and regulatory provisions and public statements encouraging investors in the Ontario Program to treat all three jurisdictions as a single borderless market\".608\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6 86. *See also,* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 330-341.\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this argument unpersuasive. First and foremost, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is a matter of law. The Tribunal must be satisfied that the jurisdictional requirements of the NAFTA are met, and if not, must decline its jurisdiction. The Tribunal therefore concurs with the tribunal in *Oded Besserglik v. Mozambique* that \"the jurisdiction of the Tribunal cannot be created by invoking the doctrine of estoppel\".609\n\n**CL-166**, *Oded Besserglik v. Republic of Mozambique,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/2, Award, 28 October 2019, \u00b6 422.\n\n398.\n\nBut even if it were appropriate to consider the doctrine of estoppel in the manner proposed by Claimants, the Tribunal is not convinced that the statements made by Ontario about the linked carbon market being a single market could be reasonably understood as statements or representations regarding the existence of an investment under NAFTA Chapter 11. It is also worth recalling that KS&T held CITSS accounts in both California an Ontario but decided to participate in the auctions through its Ontario CITSS account due to California\u2019s stricter disclosure requirements.610 KS&T\u2019s decision to purchase allowances in the joint auctions through its Ontario CITSS account appears to have been motivated to satisfy California-based obligations rather than to base a business in Ontario and access protection under the NAFTA.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 2, 367:6 - 368:21.\n\n399.\n\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants\u2019 argument that the doctrine of estoppel can be used to establish jurisdiction in this case.\n\n400.\n\nIn conclusion, KS&T did not hold a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h), and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* with respect to KS&T.\n\n**D. Jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae*** **with respect to Koch Industries**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Respondent\u2019s Position\n------------------------\n\n401.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants have failed to articulate a cohesive theory of Koch Industries\u2019 alleged investments611 and that, in any event, none of the alleged investments is sufficient to establish subject-matter jurisdiction in this dispute.612\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 160-162.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 165.\n\n402.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that Koch Industries\u2019 shareholding in KS&T does not qualify as an investment under NAFTA Article 1139(a), because the \"enterprise\" referred to in such provision must necessarily be an enterprise of the host State (in this case, Canada) and KS&T is a partnership organized under the laws of Delaware.613\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 166-167.\n\n403.\n\nSecond, in response to the Claimants\u2019 argument that Koch Industries indirectly owned the emission allowances purchased by KS&T and thus held investments under NAFTA Articles 1139(e), 1139(g), and 1139(h), the Respondent argues that: (i) emission allowances purchased by an enterprise do not constitute interests in that enterprise and therefore are not protected under Article 1139(e);614 (ii) as a matter of fact, emission allowances cannot be indirectly \"owned\" under the Cap and Trade Act;615 and (iii) even if it were possible for Koch Industries to have an indirect interest in the emission allowances themselves, the allowances do not qualify as investments under Article 1139(g) or Article 1139(h).616\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 164.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 165-166.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 167.\n\n404.\n\nThird, Respondent asserts that Koch Industries\u2019 shareholding in Canadian entities INVISTA and Georgia Pacific does not qualify as an investment under NAFTA Article 1139(a). According to Respondent, in order to ground subject-matter jurisdiction under Article 1101(1)(b) and Article 1139(a), the \"enterprise\" must also be the alleged \"investment\" in dispute, and Claimants have not made any claims of breach or damage with respect to INVISTA or Georgia Pacific under NAFTA Article 1116.617\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 168; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 168-170.\n\n405.\n\nSimilarly, with respect to Claimants\u2019 argument that Koch Industries hold \"a range of other bricks-and-mortar investments in Ontario, as well as intangible investments\", which \"include, but are not limited to, Koch subsidiaries INVISTA and Georgia Pacific\", Respondent contends that \"unidentified investments cannot found the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\"618 Additionally, whether or not Koch Industries owns real estate in Canada indirectly through its ownership of Canadian companies is not relevant unless the real estate itself is the subject of the investment dispute.619\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 170, *citing to* Memorial, footnote 412.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 170.\n\n2. Claimants\u2019 Position\n----------------------\n\n406.\n\nIn their Memorial, Claimants assert that Koch Industries holds the following investments in Canada: (i) \"its 100 percent shareholding in KS&T and INVISTA\", which qualify as an investment in under NAFTA Article 1139(a);620 (ii) \"interests in enterprises entitling Koch to income or profits of these enterprises\", which qualify as an investment under NAFTA Article 1139(e);621 and (iii) \"real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, that was acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes\", which qualify as an investment under Article 1139(g).622 In relation to the latter, Claimants note that \"Koch held a range of other bricks-and-mortar investments in Ontario, [which include, but are not limited to, Koch subsidiaries INVISTA and Georgia Pacific,] as well as intangible investments\".623\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 322(a) and footnote 409.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 322(b) and footnote 410.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 322(c) and footnote 411.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 322(c) and footnote 412.\n\n407.\n\nIn their Reply, Claimants clarified that \"[t]hrough its 100 percent shareholding in KS&T, Koch indirectly acquired the emission allowances that KS&T held\", which qualify as investment under NAFTA Articles 1139(g) and/or 1139(h).624 Additionally, they submitted that Koch Industries\u2019 indirect ownership of the emission allowances from the May 2018 auction qualify as investments under NAFTA Article 1139(e).625\n\nReply, \u00b6 352.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 353.\n\n408.\n\nFinally, Claimants maintained that \"Koch\u2019s 100 percent shareholdings in INVISTA and Georgia Pacific are interests in enterprises that entitled Koch to the income or profits of those enterprises\".626 According to Claimants, \"Ontario\u2019s measures related in particular to INVISTA, as INVISTA was a mandatory participant under Ontario\u2019s Cap and Trade Program, and the cancellation and termination thereof impacted its compliance obligations\".627 Moreover, they claim that\n\n\"KS&T became an investor in Ontario as part of a strategy to efficiently address the Cap and Trade compliance needs of all members of the Koch Group, including those based in Ontario, and in the process turn a profit. In this regard, too, the measures at issue were 'in relation to\u2019 these other Koch investments in Ontario, since these investments formed part of the rationale for KS&T\u2019s presence in Ontario and investment in the Ontario Cap and Trade system, leaving KS&T exposed to the measures at issue in this claim\".628\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 354.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 354.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 356.\n\n3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n----------------------\n\n409.\n\nClaimants argue that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Koch Industries on the basis of (i) Koch Industries\u2019 indirect ownership of the emission allowances purchased by KS&T by virtue of its 100% shareholding in KS&T; and (ii) Koch Industries\u2019 ownership of two Canadian companies \"entitling KI to income or profits of these enterprises\".\n\n410.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Tribunal has concluded that neither of these bases supports the Tribunal\u2019 s jurisdiction over Koch Industries. The Tribunal will first examine the arguments related to KS&T and then turn to those related to Koch Industries\u2019 Canadian subsidiaries.\n\n411.\n\nFirst, Claimants appear to have abandoned their argument that their 100% ownership of KS&T constitutes an investment under NAFTA Article 1139(a), as it was not raised in their Reply or subsequent submissions. In any event, the Tribunal considers that such ownership could not constitute an investment protected under Article 1139(a) because the \"enterprises\" referred to in that article are enterprises of the host State, and KS&T is a U.S. company.\n\n412.\n\nSecond, Claimants\u2019 main argument seems to be that, through its ownership of KS&T, Koch Industries \"indirectly holds intangible property and/or an interest (the emission allowances) that was acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes and which arose from the commitment of capital and other resources to economic activity in the territory of Ontario\".629\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 352.\n\n413.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that the emission allowances do not meet the definition of property under NAFTA Article 1139(g) and that KS&T did not have a qualifying investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h). Therefore, the Tribunal does not need to further consider whether Koch Industries\u2019 claimed indirect ownership of the emission allowances gives it standing to bring claims regarding those alleged investments. As the emission allowances do not qualify as protected investments, Koch Industries cannot establish jurisdiction based on them.\n\n414.\n\nFinally, Koch Industries\u2019 ownership of other Canadian entities, namely INVISTA and Georgia Pacific, does not establish jurisdiction over this dispute.\n\n415.\n\nTo properly define the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, NAFTA Article 1139 must be read in conjunction with NAFTA Articles 1101(1) and 1116(1). Article 1101(1) provides in relevant part that NAFTA Chapter 11 \"applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to: [...] (b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party [...]\".630 Accordingly, the \"measure\" at issue must relate to the \"investments\". In turn, Article 1116(1) provides in relevant part that \"[a]n investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under: (a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises)[...]\".631 The Parties agree that NAFTA Article 1116 requires that an investor demonstrate that it has suffered loss or damage as a result of an alleged violation of NAFTA.632\n\n**CL-002**, North American Free Trade Agreement, 1994, Chapter Eleven.\n\n*Id.*\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 295 (\"The requirement to establish causation is reflected in the text of the NAFTA itself. Article 1116(1) accords standing only to a claimant alleging that it 'has incurred loss or damage, by reason of, or arising out of an alleged breach of the NAFTA.)\"; Reply, \u00b6 646 (\"The NAFTA requires an investor to demonstrate it 'has incurred loss or damage, by reason of, or arising out of a breach of the NAFTA\").\n\n416.\n\nThe claims made by Claimants do not pertain to INVISTA or Georgia Pacific. While Claimants maintain that the cancellation of the Cap and Trade Program was in violation of the NAFTA, they have not identified how the cancellation violated treaty rights of the aforesaid companies - not claimants in these proceedings - or how Claimants\u2019 rights in those companies were affected by the contested measures. Moreover, the fact that KS&T registered as a market participant in Ontario\u2019s Cap and Trade Program to help the Koch Group\u2019s Ontario subsidiaries with compliance is insufficient grounds for jurisdiction, particularly since the Tribunal has already established that it has no jurisdiction over KS&T.\n\n417.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Koch Industries.\n\n418.\n\nSince the Tribunal has already determined that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over KS&T and Koch Industries, there is no need to consider the other jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent. Based on the conclusions stated in the previous sections, the Tribunal does not have the authority to hear the dispute submitted by Claimants.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n419.\n\nArticle 28(2) of the ICSID Rules provides that \"[p]romptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding\". Pursuant to this provision, the Tribunal received the Parties\u2019 statements on costs on 14 April 2023.\n\n420.\n\nIn their Memorial and Reply, Claimants requested the Tribunal to award compensation \"for all of their costs of the arbitration and costs of legal representation, plus compound interest thereon at the same rate and interval as on the damages\".633 In their statement of costs, Claimants estimated their \"arbitration costs\" in the amount of USD 350,000.00, their \"legal fees\" in the amount of USD 3,474,662.97, and their \"disbursements\" in the amount of USD 1,171,009.63, for a total amount of USD 4,995,672.60.634\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 538; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 683-684.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Statement of Costs, \u00b6 5.\n\n421.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder, Respondent requested the Tribunal to \"require the Claimants to bear all costs of the arbitration, including Canada\u2019s costs of legal assistance and representation\".635 In its statement of costs, Respondent estimated its \"costs of legal representation\" in the amount of CAD 5,601,465.21, and its \"disbursements\" in the amount of CAD 1,085,196.75 (including ICSID advances in the amount of USD 325,000), for a total amount of CAD 6,686,661.96.636\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 327; Rejoinder, \u00b6 332.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Statement of Costs, p. 1. Each Party subsequently made a further advance of USD 25,000 to ICSID to cover the costs of the proceeding.\n\n422.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that the \"Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award\".637\n\nICSID Convention, Article 61(2).\n\n423.\n\nPursuant to the aforementioned provision, absent a specific agreement between the Parties in this arbitration regarding the allocation of costs, the Tribunal has the authority to decide - with \"considerable discretion\" - which party shall bear the costs and how they shall be paid.638\n\n**CL-115**, *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00b6 955.\n\n424.\n\nUnder the aegis of such authority and broad discretion, ICSID tribunals have now a wide and varied history of applying both the \"costs lie where they fall\" approach, ordering each party to cover their own costs, and the \"costs follow the event\" approach, ordering the unsuccessful party to cover all costs.639 When applying either approach, rather than allocating costs strictly on the basis of the outcome, ICSID tribunals also tend to consider all the circumstances of each case, giving particular attention to the complexity of the legal issues, and the conduct of the parties during the arbitration.\n\n**CL-130**, *Tenaris S.A. and Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/26, Award, 29 January 2016, \u00b6 621.\n\n425.\n\nIn *Po\u0161iov\u00e1 banka v. Hellenic Republic,* the tribunal ordered both parties to \"bear the costs of arbitration equally\" despite having concluded that it lacked jurisdiction, and having ruled in favor of respondent, given that \"the jurisdictional issue was not clear-cut and involved a complex factual and legal background. Each side presented valid arguments in support of its respective case and acted fairly and professionally\".640 Similarly, in *Bayview,* the tribunal ordered each party to bear their own costs considering that \"[t]he claims were not frivolous, and they were pursued in good faith and with all due expedition. The claims were, equally, defended in good faith and with due expedition. Both sides agreed to the separation of the jurisdictional issue, and this proved a sensible and economical step\".641 The tribunal in *Global Trading v. Ukraine* also followed this approach on the basis of the \"reasonable nature of the arguments\",642 which had been \"concisely presented\" by the parties.\n\n**RL-014**, *Postov\u00e1 banka, a.s. and ISTROKAPITAL SE v. Hellenic Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/8, Award, 9 April 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 377, 378.\n\n**CL-161**, *Bayview Irrigation District v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/1, Award on Jurisdiction, 19 June 2007, \u00b6 125.\n\n**RL-021**, *Global Trading Resource Corp. and Globex International, Inc. v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/11, Award, 1 December 2010, \u00b6 59.\n\n426.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the particular circumstances of this case weigh in favor of following the \"costs fall where they lie\" approach. Despite not finding jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims in this arbitration, the Tribunal does not consider that Claimants\u2019 claims were frivolous or pursued in bad faith. Quite to the contrary, Claimants brought a well-structured case that posed intricate legal questions. As explained throughout the Award, this was a very close case, with a profoundly complex and novel legal issue at the core of the debate on jurisdiction, *i.e.*, the definition of \"property\" and its application to emission allowances created under a novel statute such as the Cap and Trade Act.\n\n427.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the conduct of both Parties throughout the arbitration was commensurate with the high level of complexity of the issues in dispute. The Parties dealt with multiple legal and procedural challenges in a professional and efficient manner, showcasing a sophisticated level of advocacy. Their submissions were concise, reasonable, and well-substantiated, which provided valuable support for the Tribunal\u2019s decision-making task, as reflected in this Award.\n\n428.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal orders each Party in this arbitration to bear its own costs, and to share in equal parts the costs of the Tribunal and the ICSID Secretariat, as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| a) Fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal\u2019s Assistant |\n| Arbitrator\u2019s Fees and Expenses \u2022 Mr. Eduardo Zuleta | 232,916.48 |\n| \u2022 Professor Andrea K. Bjorklund | 95,749.13 |\n| \u2022 Mr. Henri C. Alvarez, K.C. | 128,154.20 |\n| Fees and Expenses of the Assistant to the President of the Tribunal \u2022 Ms. Mar\u00eda Marulanda | 3,104.05 |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| b) ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses |\n| ICSID\u2019s Administrative Fees | 178,000.00 |\n| Direct Expenses | 53,041.68 |\n| c) Total costs of the proceeding |\n| **Total** | **690,965.54** |\n\n429.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts. As a result, each Party\u2019s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 345,482.77.\n\n430.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n431.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claims filed by Claimants, Koch Industries, Inc. and Koch Supply & Trading, LP, against Respondent, Canada.\n\n(2) Each Party shall bear its own costs, fees, and expenses.\n\n(3) The costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of the ICSID Secretariat as outlined in paragraph 428 of this Award, shall be shared in equal parts by the Parties.\n\n(4) All other requests for relief are rejected.\n\nDate: March 5, 2024"}]}
