Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n***A. Request for Arbitration and Constitution of the Tribunal***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn February 16, 2010, Tidewater Inc, Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater Caribe, C.A., Twenty Grand Offshore, L.L.C., Point Marine, L.L.C., Twenty Grand Marine Service, L.L.C., Jackson Marine, L.L.C. and Zapata Gulf Marine Operators, L.L.C. (together **'Tidewater'**) filed a Request for Arbitration under the ICSID Convention against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (**'Venezuela'**).\n\n2.\n\nOn March 5, 2010, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nOn March 9, 2010, Tidewater proposed a method for appointment of the Tribunal by agreement with Venezuela pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 2(1). On June 25, 2010, in the absence of agreement and pursuant to Rule 2(3), Tidewater invoked the appointment procedure provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. It appointed Dr Andres Rigo Sureda, a national of Spain, as arbitrator. On July 13, 2010, the Secretariat informed the parties that Dr Rigo Sureda had accepted his appointment and circulated a copy of his signed declaration. On July 14, 2010, Venezuela appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, a national of France, as arbitrator. On August 4, 2010, the Secretariat informed the parties that Professor Stern had accepted her appointment and circulated a copy of her signed declaration.\n\n4.\n\nIn the same letter of August 4, 2010, the Secretary-General invited the parties to agree on a President of the Tribunal. As no agreement was reached, on August 12, 2010, the Secretary-General informed the parties that she intended to propose to the Chairman of the Administrative Council that he appoint Professor Campbell McLachlan QC, a national of New Zealand, as President of the Tribunal, pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4 as invoked by Claimants. On August 19 and 20, 2010 respectively, each of Tidewater and Venezuela informed the Secretary-General that they had no objection to the appointment of Professor McLachlan. Accordingly, on August 23, 2010, the Secretariat informed the parties that the Chairman had proceeded with his appointment.\n\n5.\n\nThe parties were informed on 31 August 2010 that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that therefore, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6, the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted, and the proceeding to have begun, as of that date.\n\n***B. Professor Stern's Declaration***\n--------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nIn her declaration signed on July 30, 2010, (and forwarded to the parties first on August 4, 2010 and again on August 31, 2010) Professor Stern had crossed out by hand the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the form prescribed by ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2), so that the text read:\n\n*To the best of my knowledge there is no reason why I should not serve on the Arbitral Tribunal constituted with respect to a dispute between* Tidewater Inc. and others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela *(ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5)*\n\n*I shall keep confidential all information coming to my knowledge as a result of my participation in this proceeding, as well as the contents of any award made by the Tribunal.*\n\n*I shall judge fairly as between the parties, according to the applicable law, and shall not accept any instruction or compensation with regard to the proceeding from any source except as provided in the Administrative and Financial Regulations of the Centre.*\n\n*~~Attached is a statement of (a) my past and present professional business and other relationships (if any) with the parties and (b) any other circumstances that might cause my reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party~~**. I acknowledge that by signing this declaration, I assume a continuing obligation promptly to notify the Secretary-General of the Centre of any such relationship or circumstance that subsequently arises during this proceeding.*\n\n7.\n\nOn September 10, 2010, Tidewater made a request to the Secretary of the Tribunal that Professor Stern be asked to provide a complete declaration in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2), since, in Tidewater's submission, that Rule does not contemplate deletions or alternative texts.\n\n8.\n\nOn September 13, 2010 (the next business day), Professor Stern filed a revised declaration in the prescribed form, without deletion or amendment. In an accompanying document, she gave the following explanation for her original deletion of these two sentences:\n\n*First, I consider that there is no circumstance that could cause my reliability for independent judgment, which explains that I deleted the (b) in order to indicate that I will not attach a document containing such information, as there was none.*\n\n*Moreover, I deleted also (a), as I always thought that there was a necessity to disclose only unknown facts, not facts in the public domain, that can be seen by anyone on the ICSID webpage.*\n\n*However, as the Claimant so requests, I confirm what is on the ICSID webpage. I have been nominated by Venezuela in two other cases, in the last 6 years, for which the Tribunal is constituted:*\n\n*Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6), in the year 2004.*1\n\n*Brandes Investment Partners LP v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/3, in the year 2008.2*\n\n*Also, I have accepted a nomination in a new case, this year, for which the tribunal is not yet constituted, as the president has not been designated:*\n\n*Universal Compression International Holdings, S.L.U. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/9).*\n\n*I hope this clarifies the matter. I enclose a declaration with the two sentences not deleted, although the second one should probably be.*\n\n*'Vannessa'*.\n\n*'Brandes'.*\n\n***C. Tidewater's Proposal to Disqualify Professor Stern***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn September 28, 2010, Tidewater proposed the disqualification of Professor Stern upon the ground that her multiple appointments by the same party and the same counsel, not disclosed in her original declaration, give rise to objective and justifiable doubts regarding her independence and impartiality.\n\n10.\n\nOn October 4, 2010, the President of the Tribunal, after consulting with the other arbitrator, fixed the following time limits: October 15, 2010, for Venezuela to file a reply; October 27, 2010, for Professor Stern to file her explanations; and November 3, 2010, for the parties to file further observations including comments arising from Professor Stern's explanations.\n\n11.\n\nEach of the parties and Professor Stern filed their comments within the time limits fixed by the President.\n\n12.\n\nArticle 58 of the ICSID Convention provides that the decision on any proposal to disqualify an arbitrator shall be taken by the other members of the Tribunal (save where they are equally divided, in which event the decision is to be taken by the Chairman of the Administrative Council). The two other members of this Tribunal, Professor Campbell McLachlan QC (President) and Dr Andres Rigo Sureda (Arbitrator), (together **'the Two Members'**) have deliberated by various means of communication, and have reached an agreed Decision on the Proposal. The submissions of the parties, the reasons of the Two Members, and their Decision are set out herein.\n\n**II. The Parties' Submissions**\n--------------------------------\n\n***A. Tidewater***\n------------------\n\n13.\n\nTidewater argues that ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) and the *IBA Guidelines on Conflicts in International Arbitration* (**'IBA Guidelines'**) require an objective standard to be applied in determining whether disclosure is required. It submits that Professor Stern had been appointed by the same party double the number of times that would give justifiable doubts according to Section 3.1.3 of the Orange List of the IBA Guidelines.3 Tidewater further argues that multiple appointments by the same party create a potential for undue influence or at least the appearance of undue influence and for an unfair advantage for the appointing party. As explained by Tidewater, the arbitrator may hear the appointing party's position multiple times while the opposing party has only one opportunity and it may be too late by then for the opposing party to persuade the arbitrator in question.\n\nIBA Guidelines (May 22, 2004), Section 3.1.3: 'The arbitrator has within the past three years been appointed as arbitrator on two or more occasions by one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties'.\n\n14.\n\nAdditionally Tidewater observes that Professor Stern has been appointed three times by the same law firm, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP (**'Curtis'**), and four by Venezuela's Attorney General, Dra. Gladys Maria Gutierrez Alvarado. This, Tidewater submits, also gives rise to justifiable doubts as to Professor Stern's impartiality, being the scenario contemplated in Section 3.3.7 of the Orange List.4 Tidewater submits that, in the *ICS Inspection* case, the Appointing Authority ruled that, when the relevant facts are reflected in more than one scenario on the Orange List of the IBA Guidelines, *'the conflict in question is sufficiently serious to give rise to objectively justifiable doubts as to [an arbitrator's] impartiality and independence'*.5\n\nSection 3.3.7: 'The arbitrator has within the past three years received more than three appointments by the same counsel or the same law firm.'\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services Ltd v Argentina* (Decision on Challenge to Arbitrator, UNCITRAL, December 17, 2009) IIC 406 (2009), [2].\n\n15.\n\nTidewater further submits that an arbitrator may be disqualified even if that arbitrator has the personal intention to act impartially and independently. For this purpose, the level of experience and standing of an arbitrator are not relevant to the determination of 'justifiable doubts.'\n\n16.\n\nTidewater argues that the objective doubts about Professor Stern's independence and impartiality have been compounded by her failure to disclose the multiple appointments in her first statement and the fact that not all the circumstances related to these appointments are publicly known. Tidewater notes that the ICSID website does not disclose which party appointed each co-arbitrator and Professor Stern's appointment in *Universal Compression* did not show on that website at the time that the declaration was made because the tribunal was not then yet constituted. In any case, Tidewater observes that, where there is an objective cause for doubt, arbitrators are obliged to err on the side of disclosure.\n\n17.\n\nTidewater observes that, although the IBA Guidelines were originally developed for international commercial arbitration, their Introduction states that they should *'equally**apply to other types of arbitration, such as investment arbitrations (insofar as these may not be considered as commercial arbitrations).'*6 Tidewater further observes that investment arbitration tribunals have turned routinely to the IBA Guidelines as persuasive authority in resolving challenges to arbitrators. As to the duty of disclosure, Tidewater notes that ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 does not have any exception in respect of the duty to disclose publicly available information. This is necessarily so, since otherwise, submits Tidewater, the parties would need to conduct intrusive investigations and rely on indirect and not always reliable sources. Arbitrators will always be in *'the best position to gather, evaluate, and disclose accurate information relevant to their potential conflicts'.*7\n\n*Supra* n 3, Introduction, [5].\n\nTidewater's Further Observations, November 3, 2010, 5.\n\n18.\n\nTidewater draws attention to a new fact pattern resulting from the information filed with Venezuela's Reply which it submits falls under Section 3.1.58 of the IBA Guidelines on cases involving related issues. According to Tidewater, the *Brandes* case9 raises a dispositive issue identical to an issue raised in this proceeding, namely the question whether the Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments expresses a basis for Venezuela's consent to ICSID arbitration.10 Tidewater contends that, unless Venezuela gives an assurance that it will not contest jurisdiction on that basis in the present case, Professor Stern will need to rule on this issue in *Brandes* before the issue is reached in *Tidewater*. It submits that this will amount to prejudging the identical issue presented in the present case without Tidewater having an opportunity to argue the issue before Professor Stern has made up her mind.\n\nSection 3.1.5: 'The arbitrator currently serves, or has served within the past three years, as arbitrator in another arbitration on a related issue involving one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties.'\n\n*Supra* n 2.\n\nTidewater relies for this purpose on a news report from *Latin Lawyer* dated September 11, 2009 at Ex R-6, 2, which states, inter alia: *'As no BIT exists between Venezuela and the US, Brandes is relying on Venezuela's foreign investment law, which refers to ICSID arbitration.'*\n\n19.\n\nOn the question of multiple appointments by Venezuela, Tidewater disputes whether *Vanessa* should be excluded because the appointment of Professor Stern to this Tribunal was made three years and three weeks after the appointment to the *Vanessa* tribunal. Tidewater submits that, if Professor Stern's explanation in respect of her appointment to the *Universal Compression* tribunal to the effect that an offer to appoint is only perfected when accepted and the tribunal constituted is applied to *Vanessa*, the appointment in the latter case falls within the three years stipulated in the IBA Guidelines.\n\n20.\n\nIn any case, argues Tidewater, a strict three-year time line would give the parties an incentive to adopt dilatory tactics to avoid Section 3.1.3, and the IBA Guidelines explicitly warn against a formalistic approach to their application. Tidewater also argues against excluding the *Universal Compression* appointment since later appointments create the risk that an arbitrator's judgment be skewed in favour of the appointing party as much as earlier appointments.\n\n21.\n\nTidewater observes that the freedom of States to choose their arbitrator is not absolute but limited by Articles 14(1) and 57 of the Convention, Arbitration Rule 6(2) and the persuasive force of the IBA Guidelines. It submits that States should not have greater leeway than claimants in making serial appointments which would be contrary to the principle of equality of arms between a claimant and a State.\n\n***B. Venezuela***\n------------------\n\n22.\n\nVenezuela contests the disqualification proposal on the grounds that it is based on the wrong facts and the wrong law. Venezuela argues that the information not revealed by Professor Stern is publicly known:\n\n(a) At the time she signed her first declaration on July 30, 2010, her appointments in *Vanessa* and *Brandes* were available on the ICSID website, and the decision on jurisdiction in the case of *Vanessa* was also in the public domain;\n\n(b) Her appointment in the case of *Universal Compression* took place in August 2010;\n\n(c) She confirmed in her second declaration on September 13, 2010 the available public information in the cases of *Vanessa* and *Brandes,* and added her recent appointment in *Universal Compression* ;\n\n(d) It was equally public that Curtis represented Venezuela in the cases of *Brandes* and *Universal Compression* ; and,\n\n(e) Curtis has confirmed that Professor Stern has not been appointed as arbitrator in any other proceeding by a client of that firm.\n\n23.\n\nVenezuela argues that the facts and legal arguments of Tidewater in respect of the IBA Guidelines are also incorrect:\n\n(a) Professor Stern fulfilled the requirement of ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 by making her declaration before the first session of the Tribunal;\n\n(b) The IBA Guidelines are applicable to commercial arbitration where the need to reveal appointments by the parties is greater because such information is not publicly available;\n\n(c) At the time of Professor Stern's appointment to the *Tidewater* tribunal, she had been appointed by Venezuela only in one case, *Brandes,* within the three preceding years of Section 3.1.3 of the IBA Guidelines. She was appointed in *Vanessa* in June 2007;\n\n(d) Section 3.3.7 of the IBA Guidelines is not applicable because Curtis does not act as counsel in more than three cases, and the attempt to include within the scope of this section appointments made by the Attorney General should fail since the Attorney General by law represents Venezuela in all of its cases. In any case, the appointment in *Vanessa* is older than the three years specified in Section 3.1.3; and\n\n(e) The *ICS* precedent is irrelevant because in the instant case the factual circumstances for two Orange List cases do not exist.\n\n24.\n\nVenezuela notes that the argument that multiple appointments may give an arbitrator a potential advantage in respect of co-arbitrators has been rejected in three instances.11 Venezuela concludes by pleading that the other members of the Tribunal reject the disqualification proposal and award the related costs to Venezuela.\n\n*Participaciones Inversiones Portuarias Sarl v Gabonese Republic* (Decision on Proposal for Disqualification of an Arbitrator) ICSID Case No ARB/08/17 (November 12, 2009); *Saba Fakes v Turkey* (Decision on Disqualification of Arbitrator) ICSID Case No ARB/07/20 (April 28, 2008); *Electrabel SA v Hungary* (Decision on Disqualification of Arbitrator) ICSID Case No ARB/07/19 (February 25, 2008).\n\n**III. Professor Stern's Explanation**\n--------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nIn her Explanation of October 25, 2010,12 Professor Stern states that she believes that she has always complied with the duty of an arbitrator to be independent and impartial in the numerous arbitrations in which she has been a member of the tribunal and will continue to act independently and impartially in all the arbitral tribunals in which she may be called to serve.\n\nAs supplemented by Professor Stern's Clarification of November 7, 2010.\n\n26.\n\nIn respect of the argument that, by being appointed multiple times by the same party she may be unduly influenced by hearing the same argument repeatedly, Professor Stern explains that she is not convinced by the number of times she hears an argument but by the intrinsic value of the argument. She points out that she knows nothing about the *Tidewater* or *Universal Compression* cases and whether there will be positions pleaded several times. In the other two cases with the same respondent *-Vanessa* and *Brandes* - where she has participated in preliminary decisions, the issues raised were quite different.\n\n27.\n\nShe adds that the number of States and of most experienced arbitrators is limited. If a State cannot nominate the same arbitrator in several cases, it *'would undermine the freedom of States to choose their arbitrator'.*13\n\nProfessor Stern's Explanation, October 25, 2010, 2.\n\n28.\n\nAs to multiple appointments by the same counsel, Professor Stern points out that she has been appointed three or more times by several law firms and does not consider this fact a professional business relationship which could endanger her independence. Professor Stern explains that she has been an academic with *'a tradition of full independence and no business relations with any specific law firm'*14 during the length of her career. She clarifies that in the case of *Vanessa* she was actually nominated by another law firm, Foley Hoag LLP, and not by Curtis.15\n\n*Ibid,* 3.\n\nProfessor Stern had originally stated in her Explanation of October 25, 2010 that Curtis had been instructed in *Vannessa* at a later stage. But she subsequently corrected this statement in her Clarification of November 7, 2010 in which she stated that, on checking her file in that matter, counsel signing the most recent pleading for Venezuela were Foley Hoag and Arnold & Porter with no involvement by Curtis.\n\n29.\n\nProfessor Stern explains that, in her view, her duty to disclose is limited to facts that are undisclosed or unknown. She explains that this has been her practice in other ICSID cases where she has been appointed multiple times by the same party and the practice of other tribunal members. Professor Stern affirms that the parties' lawyers in those cases did not consider that this disclosure practice could raise reasonable doubts regarding her independence or impartiality. She adds that, since she signed her declaration in July, she has been appointed in the case of *Universal Compression* as she informed the Secretary-General in September 2010.\n\n**IV. Analysis of the Two Members**\n-----------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nTidewater's Proposal raises three interrelated issues as to potential grounds for the disqualification of Professor Stern:\n\n(a) What is the effect of Professor Stern's alleged failure initially to disclose her appointments by Venezuela as arbitrator in three other ICSID cases?\n\n(b) Does the holding of those three other arbitral appointments itself indicate a manifest lack of the qualities required to serve as an arbitrator in this case?\n\n(c) Is the answer to (b) affected by the fact that Professor Stern may be required, as a member of an arbitral tribunal in another case also involving Venezuela, to decide certain issues of law which may overlap with issues of law she may be called upon to decide in the present case?\n\n31.\n\nThe Two Members propose to deal with each of these questions in turn. But first it is necessary to set forth the legal standards applicable generally to the disqualification of an arbitrator under the ICSID Convention.\n\n***A. Applicable law***\n-----------------------\n\n32.\n\nThis part of the Decision deals with:\n\n(a) The applicable legal standards;\n\n(b) The relationship between the duty of disclosure and the requirement of independence; and\n\n(c) The relevance of the IBA Guidelines.\n\n*1. Applicable legal standards*\n-------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe applicable legal standards are set out in Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2).\n\n34.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the Convention provides:\n\n*Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence In the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.*\n\n35.\n\nArticle 57 adds, in relevant part:\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.*\n\n36.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) sets out the form of the declaration currently required of arbitrators who accept to serve on a tribunal.16 Sub-paragraph (b) and the last sentence of Arbitration Rule 6(2) were added as part of the amendment of the Arbitration Rules in 2006. The ICSID Working Paper which proposed this amendment states that its purpose is to *'expand the scope of disclosures of arbitrators to include any circumstance likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's reliability for independent judgment'.*17\n\nThis form of words is that set out at [6] *supra,* including the words struck through by Professor Stern.\n\nICSID Working Paper \"Suggested Changes to the ICSID Rules and Regulations\" (May 12, 2005), 12.\n\n37.\n\nThe Two Members find themselves in general agreement with the approach to the construction of Articles 14(1) and 57 of the Convention taken in *Suez v Argentina* :18\n\n*[T]he Spanish language version of the Convention Article 14(1) appears to be slightly different from that of the English language version. The Spanish version of Article**14(1) refers to a person who \"...inspira[r] plena confianza en su imparcialidad de**juicio. (i.e. who inspires full confidence in his impartiality of judgement.) Since the**treaty by its terms makes both language versions equally authentic, we will apply the two standards of independence and impartiality in making our decisions. Such an**approach accords with that found in many arbitration rules which require arbitrators to be both independent and impartial.*\n\n*The concepts of independence and impartiality, though related, are often seen as distinct, although the precise nature of the distinction is not always easy to grasp. Generally speaking independence relates to the lack of relations with a party that might influence an arbitrator's decision. Impartiality, on the other hand, concerns the absence of a bias or predisposition toward one of the parties. Thus Webster's Unabridged Dictionary defines 'impartiality' as \"freedom from favoritism, not biased in favor of one party more than another.\" Thus it is possible in certain situations for a judge or arbitrator to be independent of the parties but not impartial.*\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v Argentina* (Decision on Proposal for Disqualification) ICSID Case No ARB/03/17 (October 22, 2007), [28] - [30], citations omitted.\n\n*2. Relationship between disclosure and independence*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe standard of disclosure under Arbitration Rule 6(2) and the standard under Article 57 of the Convention to determine whether there is a *'manifest lack of the qualities required'* under Article 14(1) are different.\n\n39.\n\nThe standard of *'likely to give rise to justifiable doubts'*, referred to in the ICSID Secretariat Note on the new text of Arbitration Rule 6(2)(b),19 is taken from the standard of disclosure required by the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which is also the standard applicable in those Rules to arbitration challenges.20 This standard is stricter than the *'manifest lack of qualities'* of Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. Article 57 *'imposes a relatively heavy burden of proof on the party making the proposal'21* Thus, as it was put in the Second Disqualification Proposal in the *Suez* case:22\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the language of Article 57 places a heavy burden of proof... to establish facts that make it obvious and highly probable, *not just possible*, that [the arbitrator] is a person who may not be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment.\n\n*Supra* [32] & n 17.\n\nArts11(1) &12(1) UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (2010 version).\n\nSchreuer et al *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edn, 2009), 1202, [57.19].\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v Argentina* (Decision on Second Proposal for Disqualification) ICSID Cases Nos ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19 (May 12, 2008), [29], emphasis in original.\n\n40.\n\nThere is a clear distinction between the disclosure standards of Arbitration Rule 6(2) and the disqualification dictates of Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention. Reconciliation between these two standards is not to be achieved by simply imputing the justifiable doubts standard into Articles 14(1) and 57 of the Convention.23 Thus, in the view of the Two Members, non-disclosure would itself indicate manifest lack of impartiality only if the facts or circumstances surrounding such non-disclosure are of such gravity (whether alone or in combination with other factors) as to call into question the ability of the arbitrator to exercise independent and impartial judgment.24\n\n*Alpha Projektholding Gmbh v Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Decision on Challenge to Arbitrator (March 19, 2010), [64].\n\nThe same view was taken in *Alpha Projektholding ibid.*\n\n*3. Relevance of the IBA Guidelines*\n------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe IBA Guidelines have been referred to extensively by the parties. Venezuela has questioned their relevance in ICSID arbitrations, while Tidewater has pointed out that in the introduction it is clearly stated that they are also intended for other arbitrations, including investment arbitrations. As their title indicates, they are guidelines and not a binding instrument. Nevertheless, it has been held by the ICSID Secretary-General that, though these guidelines have an indicative value only, they may furnish a useful indication.25 Arbitrators dealing with disqualification proposals have frequently been guided by them.26\n\n*Participaciones Inversiones Portuarias supra* n 11 [24].\n\nSee, e.g., *ICS supra* n 5, [2]; *Alpha Projektholding supra* n 23, [56].\n\n42.\n\nThe Two Members do consider it useful to refer to the Guidelines for their indicative value. But they must ultimately apply the legal standard laid down in the Convention itself, and, in so doing, consider the Proposal for Disqualification in the context of the facts of this particular case. They note in any event that the Explanatory Note to the Guidelines states:27\n\n*These Guidelines are not legal provisions and do not override any applicable national law or arbitral rules chosen by the parties.The Working Group trusts that the Guidelines will be applied with robust common sense and without pedantic and unduly formalistic interpretation.*\n\n*Supra* n 3, 5, [6]\n\n43.\n\nThese qualifications are important. The ICSID Convention mandates a general standard for disqualification which differs from the *'justifiable doubts'* test formulated in the IBA Guidelines.28 Further, and in any event, the circumstances relied upon in the Proposal for Disqualification all fall within the 'Orange List' in the IBA Guidelines, to the extent that they fall within the Guidelines at all. By contrast with the Red List, these are not situations in which, depending upon the facts of a given case, an objective conflict of interest exists. Rather, they are situations which the Working Group considered ought to be disclosed, because they *may* give rise to an objective doubt as to the arbitrator's independence or impartiality. It added '*non-disclosure cannot make an arbitrator partial or lacking independence; only the facts or circumstances that he or she did not disclose can do so.'*29 By the same token, *'no presumption regarding disqualification should arise from a disclosure.'*30 The Working Group characterised the time limits set out in the Orange List as *'an appropriate general criterion, subject to the special circumstances of any case.'*31\n\n*Ibid* 7-8.\n\n*Ibid*, 18.\n\n*Idem.*\n\n*Ibid* 19.\n\n44.\n\nWith these observations in mind, it is now possible to consider in turn each of the grounds on which Tidewater relies in its Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Stern, dealing first with the effect of Professor Stern's initial non-disclosure.\n\n***B. Non-disclosure of other ICSID arbitral appointments by the same party***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn the first place, Tidewater contends that Professor Stern ought to have disclosed at the outset the other cases in which Venezuela, its Attorney General or Curtis, had appointed her as arbitrator. It submits that: *'[i]f there is any doubt regarding the inferences to be drawn from the common issues or the repeat appointments in question, the initial nondisclosure would be, in the words of one decision \"sufficient in conjunction with the non-disclosed facts or circumstances to tip the balance in the direction\" of disqualification.* '32\n\nTidewater's Further Observations, 11, citing *Alpha Projektholding supra* n 23, 11.\n\n46.\n\nThe parties are not in agreement as to whether information in the public domain as to an arbitrator's appointments to other ICSID tribunals by the same party needs to be disclosed. Arbitration Rule 6(2) does not limit disclosure to circumstances which would not be known in the public domain. The wording of this rule is all encompassing without distinguishing among categories of circumstances to be disclosed.\n\n47.\n\nThe question for the Two Members is whether the non-disclosed circumstances, whether alone or in combination with other elements, would justify reaching the conclusion that Professor Stern manifestly lacked independence or impartiality. The answer to this question will depend on a number of factors. The two arbitrators in the Second Disqualification Proposal in the *Suez* cases listed the following factors to structure their considerations:33\n\n*[W]hether the failure to disclose was inadvertent or intentional, whether it was the result of an honest exercise of discretion, whether the facts that were not disclosed raised obvious questions about impartiality and independence, and whether the nondisclosure is an aberration on the part of the conscientious arbitrator or part of a pattern of circumstances raising doubts as to impartiality. This balancing is for the deciding authority.in each particular case.*\n\nBefore considering these factors, several issues of fact and law on which the parties disagree need to be addressed.\n\n*Supra* n 22, [44], citing Baker & Davis *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in Practice: the Experience of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal.* (1992) 50.\n\n48.\n\nFirst, should or should not the appointment of Professor Stern as arbitrator in the case of *Vannessa* be included as one of the appointments in considering the number of multiple appointments by a single party? The fact that the IBA Guidelines are just guidelines would favour a flexible interpretation of the time limits - as argued by Tidewater and foreseen in the Guidelines themselves. Therefore, an appointment accepted shortly after the cut-off period of three years, leading to the constitution of the tribunal within the three year period in a case which is still pending should be included in considering the number of multiple subsequent appointments.\n\n49.\n\nSecond, should the Attorney General of Venezuela be considered as counsel or as party for the purposes of applying the IBA Guidelines? The Attorney General is by law the sole and exclusive representative of Venezuela in legal proceedings.34 The office of the Attorney-General should therefore be considered an officer of the State of Venezuela. Adopting a *'robust common sense'* interpretation of the IBA Guidelines, the Two Members are in no doubt that, in considering multiple appointments by the same counsel for the purpose of Section 3.3.7, it would not be right to require a separate disclosure of multiple appointments by the Attorney General. The purpose of Section 3.3.7 is to require an arbitrator to disclose cases of excessive patronage by the same counsel or law firm, which may give rise to a concern that a relationship of dependence has arisen which may affect the arbitrator's independence or impartiality. In the case of a State, which is required by law to act through its Attorney General, no additional dependence could be said to arise simply because the arbitrator's appointment was made formally through the Attorney General's office.\n\nArt.247 Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; Art. 2 *Decreto con Rango, Valor y Fuerza de Ley de Reforma Parcial del Decreto con Fuerza de Ley Organica de la Procuradur**i**a General de la Republica,* cited in Venezuela's Reply Observations, 4.\n\n50.\n\nAs a result of the clarification made by Professor Stern, this case was, at the time of her appointment, only the second time she had been appointed as arbitrator by the outside counsel appointed by Venezuela in this matter, Curtis - the other being *Brandes.*35 Thus, no further consideration need be given to disclosure of multiple appointments by the same counsel on the facts of this case.\n\nProfessor Stern's Explanation, 2.\n\n51.\n\nThis leaves only the non-disclosure of the circumstance that, at the time of Professor Stern's first declaration, the appointment as arbitrator in this case was the third appointment by Venezuela. The Two Members consider that, as a general rule, arbitrators appointed to ICSID tribunals ought to disclose appointments to other arbitral tribunals by one of the parties or an affiliate within the previous three years. Even in the case of investment arbitration, not all of these appointments will necessarily be in the public domain, and they may require consideration in assessing the arbitrator's independence and impartiality. The Two Members agree with Tidewater that in general, in considering the scope of her duty of disclosure, the arbitrator may not count on the due diligence of the parties' counsel. As pointed out by Tidewater, arbitrators will always be in *'the best position to gather, evaluate, and disclose accurate information relevant to their potential conflicts'.*\n\n52.\n\nHowever, one of the distinctive aspects of ICSID arbitration (as compared with the procedures commonly applied in other types of commercial and investment arbitration) is the transparency of the arbitral process. Regulation 22(1) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations provides:\n\n*The Secretary-General shall appropriately publish information about the operation of the Centre, including the registration of all requests for conciliation or arbitration and in due course an indication of the date and method of the termination of each proceeding.*\n\n53.\n\nFurther, Regulation 23 provides for the maintenance of Registers, inter alia, for requests for arbitration:\n\n*(1) The Secretary-General shall maintain, in accordance with rules to be promulgated by him, separate Registers for requests for conciliation and requests for arbitration. In these he shall enter all significant data concerning the institution, conduct and disposition of each proceeding, including in particular the method of constitution and the membership of each Commission, Tribunal and Committee. On the Arbitration Register he shall also enter, with respect to each award, all significant data concerning any request for the supplementation, rectification, interpretation, revision or annulment of the award, and any stay of enforcement.*\n\n*(2) The Registers shall be open for inspection by any person. The Secretary-General shall promulgate rules concerning access to the Registers, and a schedule of charges for the provision of certified and uncertified extracts therefrom.*\n\n54.\n\nAs a matter of practice, details of all appointments to arbitral tribunals are published on the ICSID website, icsid.worldbank.org, once the relevant tribunal has been constituted, along with the dates and development of other procedural details of each case. Thus, in the present case, the fact of Professor Stern's appointment in each of *Vannessa* and *Brandes* was readily accessible on the ICSID website. It is correct that, as pointed out by Tidewater, the website does not explicitly show who appointed each arbitrator. But the name of the appointing party in each case is available for inspection on the ICSID Register of Requests for Arbitration. While the Two Members consider that an arbitrator's disclosure statement ought to include even publicly available arbitral appointments, in the case of ICSID appointments, this must be out of an abundance of caution, given the ready accessibility of this information in the records of the very Centre with which the parties are dealing. In any event, the Two Members consider that the fact that this information is publicly available can and should be taken into account by them in determining the separate question of whether that non-disclosure may itself amount to a manifest lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n55.\n\nReturning to the list of factors identified in *Suez*,36 the Two Members consider that Professor Stern's failure to disclose was an honest exercise of judgment on her part in the belief that publicly available information did not require specific disclosure. How could it be said that she was intent on hiding the circumstances surrounding her appointments if those are publicly available on the Register of ICSID itself? It has been Professor Stern's practice in other similar situations without her independence or impartiality being questioned by counsel.37\n\n*Supra* [47].\n\nProfessor Stern's Explanation, 3.\n\n56.\n\nThus, in the view of the Two Members, no adverse inference can be drawn from her deletion of the two paragraphs from her Declaration. When this deletion was queried by Tidewater, Professor Stern immediately filed a supplementary explanation with her revised Declaration dated September 13, 2010. In that statement, she disclosed all three of her other arbitral appointments by Venezuela.\n\n57.\n\nThe Two Members therefore conclude that the non-disclosure at the time of the first declaration of two previous appointments by Venezuela which are in the public domain is not sufficient to sustain a finding that Professor Stern manifestly lacks the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***C. Multiple arbitral appointments***\n---------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nBeyond the issue of non-disclosure, the next question is whether the existence of multiple appointments by the same party would itself lead an objective observer to conclude that the Article 57 standard has been breached. In addition to *Vannessa* and *Brandes,* Professor Stern has again been appointed by the same party and the same counsel to another arbitral tribunal, in the case *Universal Compression,* as disclosed in her Second Declaration.\n\n59.\n\nThe Two Members begin their analysis of this question by observing that the question whether multiple appointments to arbitral tribunals may impugn the independence or impartiality of an arbitrator is a matter of substance, not of mere mathematical calculation. Whilst it is useful to have the guidance provided by Section 3.1.3 of the IBA Guidelines, this can be no more than a rule of thumb. Depending on the particular circumstances of the case, either fewer or more appointments might, in combination with other factors, be needed to call into question an arbitrator's impartiality. There is perforce an arbitrary character about the limitation to two appointments within three years. Moreover, it is inherent in such a guideline that more than one appointment by the same party is not necessarily suggestive of a conflict.\n\n60.\n\nConsidering the matter as one of principle, the conflict which may potentially arise from multiple arbitral appointments by the same party is of a different character from other connections to one of the parties, including service as counsel or other professional capacity.38 The starting-point is that multiple appointments as arbitrator by the same party in unrelated cases are neutral, since in each case the arbitrator exercises the same independent arbitral function. As Craig, Park and Paulsson observe:39\n\n*A challenge will not ordinarily succeed simply because an arbitrator has served in the same capacity in prior proceedings involving one of the parties. Such a claim for recusal would not lie against a judge, and it is hard to see why the rule should be different in arbitral proceedings.*\n\nConnections as counsel to one of the parties (or to a third party with a right of intervention) were a material factor in a number of the recent reported investment cases where a proposal for disqualification was upheld, e.g., *ICS supra* n 5 ; *Gallo v. Canad* a, PCA, Decision on Challenge to Arbitrator (October 14, 2009) ; *Ghana v Telecom Malaysia Bhd* (Dist Ct The Hague, October 18, 2004).\n\nCraig, Park & Paulsson *International Chamber of Commerce Arbitration* (3rd edn, 2001), 231, [13.05].\n\n61.\n\nRepeat appointments may be as much the *result* of the arbitrator's independence and impartiality as an indication of justifiable doubts about it.40 This is reflected in the fact that national courts called upon to consider proposals for disqualification on such a ground normally reject them in the absence of aggravating circumstances.41\n\nBorn *International Commercial Arbitration* (2009) 1524.\n\nThe American authorities are cited in Born *ibid* 1525, nn 856 & 857; and on the French practice to like effect see Poudret & Besson *Comparative Law of International Arbitration* (2nd edn, trans Berti & Ponti, 2007), [421].\n\n62.\n\nIn the view of the Two Members, there would be a rationale for the potential conflict of interest which may arise from multiple arbitral appointments by the same party if either (a) the prospect of continued and regular appointment, with the attendant financial benefits, might create a relationship of dependence or otherwise influence the arbitrator's judgment; or (b) there is a material risk that the arbitrator may be influenced by factors outside the record in the case as a result of his or her knowledge derived from other cases.42 The Two Members deal with factor (b) in Section D *infra.* In the remainder of this Section, they deal with whether, on the facts of this case, it can be said that the three appointments of Professor Stern by Venezuela *ipso facto* call into question her independence or impartiality.\n\nSee Craig, Park & Paulsson *supra* n 39, *idem.*\n\n63.\n\nSuch practice within ICSID as is publicly available supports a cautious approach to a finding of disqualification on this ground. There have been a number of recent unsuccessful challenges to arbitrators in investment arbitration cases on this ground, both within and outside the ICSID system in which the results are known, but the decision is not fully reported.43 In one case, where the reasoning only is excerpted, the two arbitrators concluded that the mere fact that an arbitrator sat in two different cases brought against the same respondent State did not warrant disqualification *'absent any other objective circumstances demonstrating that these two cases are related in such a manner that the arbitrator's determination in one case would manifestly affect the challenged arbitrator's reliability to exercise independent judgment in the other case.'44* So, too, in the course of a Decision on Jurisdiction in an UNCITRAL case, the Tribunal, observing that the Respondent State had chosen the same arbitrator in two cases, held that *'the fact of holding a joint appointment would not, in and of itself, be grounds for a challenge.'45*\n\nSee the references in Sheppard \"Arbitrator independence in ICSID arbitration\" in Binder (ed) *International Investment Law for the 21st Century. Essays in honour of Christopher Schreuer* (2009) 131, 154-5; and Ziade \"Recent developments at ICSID\" (2008) 25 No 2 *News from ICSID* 3, 4-5. One such Proposal concerned Professor Stern: *Electrabel SA v Hungary supra* n 11.\n\nZiade *idem.*\n\n*Encana Corp v Ecuador* (Partial Award on Jurisdiction) UNCITRAL (February 27, 2004), [43].\n\n64.\n\nIn the view of the Two Members, the mere fact of holding three other arbitral appointments by the same party does not, without more, indicate a manifest lack of independence or impartiality on the part of Professor Stern. Indeed, the Two Members find no basis to infer that Professor Stern would be influenced in her decision in any way by the fact of such multiple appointments by one party. On the contrary, her conduct has been demonstrably independent of such influence. The Two Members take notice from the Register of Cases publicly maintained by ICSID on its website that Professor Stern has held or currently holds arbitral appointments in many ICSID cases and so cannot be said to be dependent on any one party for her extensive practice as an arbitrator in investment cases. Moreover, in each of the two cases in which she was appointed by Venezuela, and where she has to date rendered decisions, *Vannessa* and *Brandes,* Professor Stern has joined unanimous preliminary decisions rejecting applications made by Venezuela.46 This fact tends to indicate that Professor Stern has been appointed on subsequent occasions because of her independence, rather than the reverse. Thus, the Two Members conclude that the appointment of Professor Stern on two prior occasions by Venezuela does not demonstrate a manifest lack on her part of the quality of independent and impartial judgment required of an arbitrator under the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Vannessa* (Decision on Jurisdiction) (August 22, 2008); *Brandes* (Decision on Preliminary Objection) (February 2, 2009), both available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/alphabetical\\_list.htm, and referred to in Venezuela's Observations, 2.\n\n***D. Possibility of decision on related legal issues***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nIt remains finally to consider whether this conclusion is affected by the additional factor, raised in Tidewater's Further Observations, that one of the prior cases, *Brandes,* may raise a related issue of law, namely the question whether the Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments expresses a basis for Venezuela's consent to ICSID arbitration.47 This, claims Tidewater, invokes Section 3.1.5 of the IBA Guidelines as Professor Stern is currently serving as *'arbitrator in another arbitration on a related issue involving one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties.'*\n\n*Supra* [18].\n\n66.\n\nTidewater does not allege that there is an overlap in the underlying facts between *Brandes* and the present case, so that Professor Stern would benefit from knowledge of facts on the record in *Brandes* which may not be available in the present case.48 Rather, it alleges a lack of impartiality based upon an overlap between the issues of law raised in the two cases. Specifically, it states, based upon a news report filed with Venezuela's observations,49 that, in *Brandes,* the sole basis for invoking ICSID jurisdiction is the Venezuelan law. It states that some of Tidewater's claims in the present arbitration also rely upon that law as the basis for ICSID jurisdiction, and that '*[i]t is public knowledge that the Republic of Venezuela takes the position that the Investment Law does not express consent to ICSID jurisdiction.'*50 Since the *Brandes* Tribunal will have to rule on its jurisdiction first, Tidewater claims that ruling *'will amount to prejudging the identical issue presented in this case, without the Claimants having an opportunity to argue the issue before Professor Stern has made up her mind.'*51 Venezuela observes that a similar argument has been rejected in other recent ICSID cases.52\n\nAn issue which could give rise to a problem of procedural equality discussed in *Encana supra* n 45, [44] - [45].\n\n*Supra* n 10\n\nTidewater's Further Observations, 5.\n\n*Ibid* 6.\n\nVenezuela's Observations, 5.\n\n67.\n\nIn the opinion of the Two Members, the rationale behind the potential for the conflict of interest identified in Section 3.1.5 relates to cases where, by reason of the close interrelationship between the facts and the parties in the two cases, the arbitrator has in effect prejudged the liability of one of the parties in the context of the specific factual matrix. They agree with the formulation of the French court, cited with approval in Poudret and Besson, that there is *'neither bias not partiality where the arbitrator is called upon to decide circumstances of fact close to those examined previously, but between different parties, and even less so when he is called upon to determine a question of law upon which he has previously made a decision.'*53\n\nParis, *Ben Nasser,* Rev arb 1994, 380 note Bellet, cited in Poudret & Besson *supra* n 41 *idem.*\n\n68.\n\nThe Two Members note that this view has also been adopted in decisions on recent proposals for disqualification within ICSID, in which the outcome and some of the reasons are available on the public record, but the full text of which is available neither publicly nor to the Two Members.54 The Two Members agree with the observation made in one such case, and reported in an official ICSID publication, that: *'[i]nvestment and even commercial arbitration would become unworkable if an arbitrator were automatically disqualified on the ground only that he or she was exposed to similar legal or factual issues in concurrent or consecutive arbitrations.*55\n\nTwo of the decisions, noted in the sources at *supra* n 43, are *Electrabel SA v Hungary* and *Saba**Fakes v Turkey supra* n 11.\n\nZiade *supra* n 43, 5; and, to like effect, *Suez* n 18, [36]; *Urbaser SA and other v Argentina* (Decision on Disqualification of Arbitrator) ICSID Case No ARB/07/26 (August 12, 2010), [47] - [48]. In *Republic of Argentina v BG Group plc* Civ Action No 08-485 (US DC, June 7, 2010), the Court heard a motion to vacate an investment arbitration award rendered under UNCITRAL Rules, inter alia on the ground that one of the arbitrators lacked impartiality because he had sat on four cases under the same Bilateral Investment Treaty each raising the \"state of necessity\" doctrine and reached different decisions in each. The Respondent State claimed that the *inconsistent* decisions were evidence of bias. The Court dismissed this argument, and the motion as a whole. It noted (at 21) that *'there could be a number of innocuous reasons to explain why [the arbitrator] reached a different conclusion.'*\n\n69.\n\nNeither Professor Stern, still less the present Tribunal as a whole, will be bound in the present case by any finding which the *Brandes* Tribunal may arrive at as to the issue of Venezuelan law referred to. Indeed, at this stage in the present proceeding, it would be premature to make any judgment as to what issues of law may be pleaded by the parties (and thus as to the similarities or differences between the context for the issues of law to be determined in the two cases), since no pleadings other than the Request for Arbitration have yet been filed.\n\n70.\n\nThe Two Members do not consider in this regard that there is a material difference between prior consideration of issues of international law and issues of host state law which may arise in for determination in the course of the proceedings. Thus, the Two Members do not accept the distinction drawn by Tidewater in its Further Observations between issues of international law as being *'generically similar and recurrent in**investment arbitration'* and issues of host state law.56 In the case of each, the Tribunal is legally bound to arrive at its decision according to the applicable law as it finds it to be. In determining its jurisdiction, the Tribunal is bound by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention to determine whether *'the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.'* In determining the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal is bound by Article 42 of the ICSID Convention to *'decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed between the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.'*\n\n*Supra* n 8.\n\n71.\n\nSo far as concerns Professor Stern's position, the Two Members have no reason to doubt Professor Stern's statement that *'the fact of whether I am convinced or not convinced by a pleading depends upon the intrinsic value of the legal arguments and not on the number of times I hear the pleading.'*57\n\nProfessor Stern's Explanation, 2.\n\n72.\n\nAccordingly, the Two Members find that this third ground upon which Tidewater's Proposal for Disqualification is premised is not well founded and must be rejected.\n\n**V. Decision**\n---------------\n\n73.\n\n**For the reasons given above, the Two Members decide that:**\n\n**(1) Tidewater's Proposal to disqualify Professor Brigitte Stern as Arbitrator and member of this Tribunal is dismissed.**\n\n**(2) The determination and attribution of costs in connection with this Decision is reserved to a later stage of this proceeding.**\n\n**(3) As from the date hereof, the suspension of the proceeding according to Arbitration Rule 9(6) is terminated.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2013-02-08T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GLOSSARY OF DEFINED TERMS** | |\n| **Barbados BIT** | Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (signed 15 July 1994, entered into force 31 October 1995) 1984 UNTS 181. |\n| **Claimants or** ****Tidewater**** | Tidewater Inc., Tidewater Barbados, Tidewater Caribe, Twenty Grand Offshore, L.L.C., Point Marine, L.L.C., Twenty Grand Marine Service, L.L.C., Jackson Marine, L.L.C., and Zapata Gulf Marine, L.L.C. |\n| **ILC Unilateral** **Declaration** **Principles** | International Law Commission's Guiding Principles Applicable to Unilateral Declarations of States Capable of Creating Legal Relations 2006 (UN Doc A/61/10) [177], |\n| **Investment Law** | *Decreto con Rango y Fuerza de Ley de Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de Inversiones* [Decree with Status and Force of Law for the Promotion and Protection of Investments] (adopted by means of Decree-Law No 356 of 3 October 1999). |\n| **PDVSA** | Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. |\n| **PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo** | PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo, S.A. |\n| **PetroSucre** | PetroSucre, S.A. |\n| **Reserve Law** | *Ley Org\u00e1nica que Reserva al Estado Bienes y Servicios Conexos a las Actividades Primarias de Hidrocarburos* [Organic Law that Reserves to the State the Assets and Services Related to Primary Activities of Hydrocarbons] (7 May 2009). |\n| **Respondent** or **Venezuela** | The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. |\n| **SEMARCA** | Tidewater Marine Service, C.A. |\n| ****Tidewater**** **Barbados** | Tidewater Investment SRL. |\n| **Tidewater Marine** | Tidewater Marine International, Inc. |\n| **Tidewater Caribe** | Tidewater Caribe, C.A. |\n| **Treaty Claimants** | Tidewater Barbados and Tidewater Caribe. |\n| **VCLT** | Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (opened for signature 23 May 1969, entered into force 27 January 1980) 1155 UNTS 331. |\n| ***TABLE OF CASES CITED*** | |\n| ***Aguas del Tunari v Bolivia*** | *Aguas del Tunari S.A. v.

Request for Arbitration***\n--------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 16 February 2010, Tidewater Inc., Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater Caribe, C.A., Twenty Grand Offshore, LLC., Point Marine, L.L.C., Twenty Grand Marine Service, L.L.C., Jackson Marine, LLC. and Zapata Gulf Marine Operators, L.L.C. (together **'Tidewater'** or **'Claimants')** filed a Request for Arbitration under the ICSID Arbitration Rules against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela **('Venezuela'** or **'Respondent').**\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute concerns the Claimants' investment in marine support services to the oil industry in Venezuela. Venezuela's national oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. **('PDVSA')** engaged private companies to provide support to the oil industry in the country. One of these private companies was Tidewater Marine Service, C.A. **('SEMARCA'),** a company constituted under the laws of Venezuela. SEMARCA contracted with PDVSA and two other national or semi-national companies, PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo, S.A. **('PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo')** and PetroSucre, S.A. **('PetroSucre')** to provide support both at Lake Maracaibo and offshore in the Gulf of Paria.\n\n3.\n\nPrior to February 2009, SEMARCA was owned by Tidewater Caribe, C.A. **('Tidewater Caribe'),** a company incorporated in Venezuela, which in turn was owned by Tidewater Marine International, Inc. **('Tidewater Marine'),** a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. That company was in turn owned by **Tidewater Inc.** (a company incorporated in the United States of America). In addition, a number of other United States \u2014 and Cayman Islands \u2014 incorporated subsidiaries of Tidewater Inc. performed contracted services for SEMARCA, and owned a number of vessels and other assets in Venezuela. Tidewater had owned SEMARCA and provided marine support services in the country since 1958.\n\n4.\n\nIn February 2009, Tidewater Marine incorporated Tidewater Investment SRL **('Tidewater Barbados')** in Barbados. On 9 March 2009, Tidewater Marine transferred to Tidewater Barbados all of the shares in Tidewater Caribe. Accordingly, Tidewater Barbados was inserted into the chain of ownership and became the owner, through Tidewater Caribe, of SEMARCA. The current corporate ownership structure is depicted in the diagram annexed to this Decision as **Appendix A.1**\n\nThis diagram was annexed to the Request for Arbitration as an unnumbered appendix, and accepted by the Respondent as accurate: see Memorial [25],\n\n5.\n\nIn 2008-2009, world oil prices fell significantly. PDVSA struggled to meet its payment obligations to SEMARCA, leading to contractual negotiations between the two companies, the significance of which for present purposes will have to be considered in more detail later in this decision.\n\n6.\n\nOn 7 May 2009, the Government of Venezuela enacted the Organic Law that Reserves to the State the Assets and Services Related to Primary Activities of Hydrocarbons **('Reserve Law').2** The following day, the Ministry of Popular Power for Energy and Petroleum issued a resolution that identified the Claimants, along with 38 other service providers, as subject to the Reserve Law.3 Venezuela thereupon seized the Claimants' operations and assets in Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Paria, together with 15 vessels owned by the Fourth to Eighth Claimants.\n\n*Ley Org\u00e1nica que Reserva al Estado Bienes y Servicios Conexos a las Actividades Primarias de Hidrocarburos.* Memorial [2], Ex.

The Claimants invoke two grounds for the Tribunal's jurisdiction:\n\n(a) Article 22 of the Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments **('Investment Law'),** which the Claimants submit constitutes a standing consent to ICSID arbitration;4 and\n\n(b) The bilateral investment treaty between Venezuela and Barbados (under the law of which country Tidewater Barbados is constituted) **('Barbados BIT').5**\n\nThe Claimants submit that they consented to ICSID jurisdiction in a letter to Venezuela on 11 December 2009.6\n\n*Decreto con Rango y Fuerza de Ley de Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de Inversiones* (adopted by the Republic of Venezuela by means of Decree-Law No 356 of 3 October 1999).

Accordingly, it submits that Tidewater's invocation of the Barbados BIT is an abuse of that Treaty.\n\n***B. Procedural Background***\n------------------------------\n\n*1. Constitution of the Tribunal and First Session*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 31 August 2010, the ICSID Secretariat informed the parties that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 6, the Tribunal consisting of Professor Campbell McLachlan QC (President), Dr Andres Rigo Sureda and Professor Brigitte Stern was deemed to have been constituted on that date.\n\n10.\n\nOn 28 September 2010, Tidewater proposed the disqualification of Professor Stern. After each of the parties and Professor Stern had offered comments on the Proposal, the other two members of the Tribunal rendered a decision on 23 December 2010 dismissing the Proposal. Accordingly, the suspension of the proceedings that had been in effect was lifted pursuant to Arbitration Rule 9(6) on that date.\n\n11.\n\nFollowing the distribution of a Provisional Agenda and the preparation of a Joint Statement by the parties, the Tribunal's First Session was held on 24 January 2011, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. In the Minutes of that session, the Tribunal ordered that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41 and pursuant to the parties' agreement, Venezuela's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction would be addressed by the Tribunal prior to the pleadings on the merits.\n\n12.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal set a calendar for the written and oral phases of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration.7\n\nMinutes, Part I, [14.2],\n\n2. *Procedural matters*\n-----------------------\n\n13.\n\nOn 24 January 2011, the Claimants and the Respondent respectively filed Requests for Production of Documents with the Tribunal.8 The Claimants sought documents concerning the drafting and enactment of the Investment Law, and particularly Article 22.9 The Respondent sought documents relating to the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados and the transfer of shares to it,10 and documents identifying the services underlying the accounts receivable for which the Claimants sought compensation.11\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, [8],\n\nIbid [15],\n\nIbid [24],\n\nIbid [36],\n\n14.\n\nOn 29 March 2011, the President made Procedural Order No. 1 for and on behalf of the Tribunal, addressing the outstanding requests and ordering the parties to search for, and if possible, produce various documents or explain their reason(s) for objecting to production.12\n\nIbid [43],\n\n15.\n\nIn response, the Respondent confirmed that it had no documents responsive to the Claimants' request relating to the preparation of the Reserve Law. The Claimants produced an itemised schedule of documents responsive to the Respondent's request specifying in it their claim to privilege.13 The Respondent objected to the adequacy of the Claimants' disclosure, but by Procedural Order No. 2 on 20 April 2011, the Tribunal declined to make the further orders sought by the Respondent, finding the claim to privilege to be adequately made out.14\n\nEx. C-19.\n\nThis Order was conveyed by letter from the Secretary of the Tribunal to the parties.\n\n16.\n\nConcurrently with the filing of their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, on 29 July 2011, the Claimants made a Request that the Tribunal invite two individuals alleged to have been involved with the drafting of the Investment Law, Ambassador Werner Corrales Leal and Mr Gonzalo Capriles, to appear and testify at the oral phase of the proceedings.15 Following an exchange of submissions, on 22 September 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3. It declined the Claimants' request on the ground that, within the framework of the ICSID Convention, the preparation and presentation of evidence is the responsibility of the parties and not that of the Tribunal.16\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, [1],\n\nIbid [14],\n\n*3. Written phase*\n------------------\n\n17.\n\nPursuant to the timetable set at the First Session, the following pleadings were exchanged:\n\n(a) Venezuela filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 6 May 2011, together with Legal Expert Opinion of Professor Enrique Urdaneta Fontiveros;\n\n(b) The Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on 29 July 2011, together with Legal Expert Opinion of Professor Carlos Ayala Corao and Direct Testimony of Kevin Carr, Vice President, Taxation, Tidewater Inc.;\n\n(c) Venezuela filed its Reply on 14 October 2011, together with Expert Report of Professor John P. Steines, Jr. and Supplementary Legal Expert Opinion of Professor Urdaneta; and\n\n(d) The Claimants filed their Rejoinder on 21 December 2011, together with Supplemental Opinion of Professor Ayala and Supplemental Testimony of Mr Carr.\n\n*4. Oral phase*\n---------------\n\n18.\n\nBy agreement between the parties and the Tribunal, an oral hearing for the jurisdiction phase was scheduled at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. for Wednesday 29 February and Thursday 1 March 2012. Neither party wished to avail itself of the opportunity to call any witness or expert for oral testimony, nor did the Tribunal. Accordingly, the oral hearing consisted of the submissions of counsel for both parties according to an agreed timetable, together with the responses of counsel to questions from the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, both parties confirmed that they had no continuing objection to any aspect of the conduct of these proceedings since the constitution of the Tribunal.17 The President then closed the evidentiary record and the oral procedure in the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration.\n\nT2/371/12-20.

THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n***A. First ground of jurisdiction: Article 22 of the Investment Law***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Introduction*\n-----------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Article 22 constitutes a standing consent to international arbitration of investment disputes. Venezuela disagrees. The text of Article 22 reads:\n\nLas controversias que surjan entre un inversionista internacional, cuyo pa\u00eds de origen tenga vigente con Venezuela un tratado o acuerdo sobre promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n de inversiones, o las controversias respecto de las cuales sean aplicables las disposiciones del Convenio Constitutivo del Organismo Multilateral de Garant\u00eda de Inversiones (OMGI - MIGA) o del Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados (CIADI), ser\u00e1n sometidas al arbitraje internacional en los t\u00e9rminos del respectivo tratado o acuerdo, si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece, sin perjuicio de la posibilidad de hacer uso, cuando proceda, de las v\u00edas contenciosas contempladas en la legislaci\u00f3n venezolana vigente.18\n\nEx. EU-O1.\n\n22.\n\nVenezuela translates Article 22 as follows:\n\nDisputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and protection of investments, or disputes to which are applicable the provisions of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides, without prejudice to the possibility of making use, when appropriate, of the dispute resolution means provided for under the Venezuelan legislation in effect.19\n\nMemorial [37] (emphasis removed).\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants' translation is:\n\nControversies that may arise between an international investor, whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and protection of investments, or controversies in respect of which the provisions of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID) are applicable, shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so establishes, without prejudice to the possibility of using, as appropriate, the contentious means contemplated by the Venezuelan legislation in effect.20\n\nCounter-Memorial [59] (emphasis removed).\n\n24.\n\nThe parties exchanged extensive submissions on the interpretation of Article 22, which were further elaborated in oral pleading. The points in dispute between the parties can be divided into four issues:\n\n(a) The standard to be applied to the interpretation of Article 22, including the relevance of Venezuelan and international law to its interpretation;\n\n(b) The correct interpretation of Article 22 produced by the application of that standard;\n\n(c) The historical context of the enactment of the Investment Law as a guide to interpretation; and\n\n(d) The relevance of comparison with other instruments containing consent to international arbitration, including other countries' investment laws and BITs signed by Venezuela.\n\nThe parties' submissions on each of these issues are summarised in turn.\n\n2. *Standard of interpretation to be applied to Article 22*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Venezuela's submissions*\n-----------------------------\n\n25.\n\nVenezuela submits that domestic Venezuelan principles of interpretation 'play a useful role'21 in the interpretation of a Venezuelan statute alleged to constitute a standing consent to arbitration,22 as an 'appropriate starting point'23 in the interpretative process as evidence of the state's intention.24 It submits that domestic principles require consent to be 'clear', 'unequivocal' and 'express'.25 It cites a decision of the Supreme Tribunal of Venezuela which applied this standard and which ruled that Article 22 was not a standing consent to arbitration.26\n\nReply [21] quoting *Mobil* [96],\n\nMemorial [41] citing *Zhinvali v Georgia* [297], *SPP v Egypt* [61] and I. Suarez Anzorena 'Consent to Arbitration in Foreign Investment Laws' in Laird & Weiler *Investment Treaty Arbitration and International Law* Vol 2 (JurisNet, 2009) 63 & 79.\n\nT2/266/17.\n\nReply [9], citing *Mobil* [120]-[140], *Cemex* [127]-[138] and *Brandes* [113]-[118]; T1/15, citing *Zhinvali v Georgia.*\n\nMemorial [42]-[43] citing various decisions of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela; T1/16/14-17.\n\nMemorial [45]-[46], quoting *Decision on Interpretation Request,* Case No 2008-0763, 17 October 2008.18, 47-48 (in the English translation) (Ex. EU-29).\n\n26.\n\nNevertheless, the Respondent recognises that, 'since the issue is whether Article 22 can serve as a consent for purposes of the ICSID Convention, the principles of international law also come into play.'27 In this context, it refers to the principles of interpretation in Articles 31-32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties **('VCLT').** But the Respondent places particular reliance on the International Law Commission's Guiding Principles applicable to unilateral declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations 2006 **('ILC Unilateral Declaration Principles'),28** Principle 7 of which requires unilateral declarations within the scope of the Principles to be 'stated in clear and specific terms' and 'interpreted in a restrictive manner', concluding that 'weight shall be given first and foremost to the text of the declaration, together with the context and the circumstances in which it was formulated.'29\n\nT2/267/13-16.\n\nUN Doc A/61/10, [177],\n\nIdem.\n\n27.\n\nVenezuela accordingly endorses authorities that suggest that consent must be 'clear, express and unequivocal',30 should not be presumed,31 should be construed 'strictly'32 and should be 'expressed in a manner that leaves no doubts.'33 It accordingly rejects the formulation adopted by the *SPP v Egypt* tribunal to this extent.34 It contends that the principle of *effet utile* cannot cure the absence of language of consent,35 and only requires that the Tribunal reject a meaningless interpretation in favour of a meaningful interpretation, where the latter is available.36\n\nMemorial [31] citing *Plama v Bulgaria* [198]; Reply [14]; T1/19-21.\n\nMemorial [32] citing *Wintershall v. Argentina* [160(3)], [161], [167]; Reply [15],\n\nMemorial [33]; Reply [16], See also Memorial [56] & T1/18 citing ICISD Model Clauses (1968) 7 ILM 1159, 1162.\n\nReply [26] quoting *Brandes* [113],\n\nT2/266/7-11.\n\nReply [38],\n\nReply [44] quoting *Cemex* [114]-[115]; T1/13-14.\n\n28.\n\nIn conclusion nevertheless, the Respondent submits that there is a 'fairly consistent list of factors' that cuts across the various types of instruments of consent, namely, the text, the context, the purposes and the circumstances of the instrument, which may properly be applied to construe Article 22.37 Despite objecting to the application of the *effet utile* principle, the Respondent accepts that the provision must be interpreted in good faith.38\n\nT2/273/15-20.\n\nT2/275/1-6.\n\n*(b) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, in determining the question of whether Article 22 expresses Venezuela's consent to ICSID jurisdiction, one must start with the ICSID Convention, in order to determine whether the statement is capable of validly stating the party's consent to ICSID jurisdiction, and then to general international law in order to ascertain whether the content of the statement expresses such consent.39 Within international law, one should look specifically to those principles governing the unilateral declarations of states 'formulated within the framework and on the basis of a treaty.'40 The Claimants contend that such declarations are in a different category to those dealt with in the ILC Unilateral Declaration Principles.41 Relying upon the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice in relation to the interpretation of states' unilateral declarations of acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction, the Claimants contend that the declaration 'must be interpreted as it stands having regard to the words actually used' and 'in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the state concerned.'42 'That intention can be deduced from the text, the context, the circumstances of its preparation, and the purposes intended to be served.'43\n\nCounter-Memorial [45], [60]; T2/305-6.\n\nCounter-Memorial [61],\n\nT2/308/17-312/21; T2/320/17-321/21; citing UN Doc A/CN.4/L.703 [3] and UN Doc A/52/10, [204],\n\nT2/314/8-20, citing *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co Case* 105 and *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v Canada)* [49], See also T1/143/4-19.\n\nT2/314/17-20.\n\n30.\n\nIn consequence, the Claimants fully endorse the formulation adopted in *SPP v Egypt,* namely that:\n\n[J]urisdictional instruments are to be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, and jurisdiction will be found to exist if - but only if - the force of the arguments militating in favor of it is preponderant.44\n\nThey accordingly reject Venezuela's contention that a restrictive approach to interpretation ought to be adopted. They reject the statement to that effect in *Brandes45* and distinguish the cases involving Most-Favoured Nation clauses.46\n\nCounter-Memorial [46], [62] and T2/312/10-19, citing *SPP v Egypt* [63],\n\nT1/146/4-147/20; T1/153/7-13.\n\nT1/153/14-154/15.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants reject Venezuela's reliance on municipal law principles. They are only relevant to matters such as the legal existence of the statute,47 and to the extent that Venezuelan law requires a restrictive interpretation of consent - which the Claimants submit it does not48 -Venezuelan law must cede to international law.49 The Claimants argue that *Decision No 1541* of the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal of Justice was wrong and politically tainted and accordingly ought to be given no weight.50\n\nCounter-Memorial [125]; Rejoinder [23] citing *Mobil* [96(i)] and *Cemex* [89(a)],\n\nCounter-Memorial [130]; Rejoinder [24], [25]; T1/156/6-157/21.\n\nCounter-Memorial [124], [126]-[128], criticizing Venezuela's reliance on *Zhinvali v Georgia, SPP v Egypt* and *Cemex;* Rejoinder [26]; T1/155/1-11.\n\nCounter-Memorial [164]-[174]; T1/157/22-158/16.\n\n32.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this requires the application of the principle of *effet utile,* which they allege the *Mobil* and *Cemex* tribunals failed to apply.51 The ICJ's consideration of the intention of the drafting state in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v Canada)* did not exclude the principle.52 Likewise the Court in the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co* case recognised the *effet utile* principle but decided that the words in question had been included ex *abundanti cautela,*53 and the principle was also recognised in the *Case Concerning Right of Passage Over Indian Territory.54*\n\nCounter-Memorial [64],\n\nCounter-Memorial [66]-[69] quoting *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v Canada)* [52]; T1/150/9-151/13.\n\nCounter-Memorial [71]; T1/151/14-152/6.\n\nCounter-Memorial [72] quoting *Case Concerning Right of Passage over Indian Territory* [142],\n\n*3. The correct textual interpretation of Article 22*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Venezuela's submissions*\n-----------------------------\n\n33.\n\nVenezuela submits that Article 22 is a 'compound provision which covers three types of disputes: those arising under bilateral investment treaties, those arising under the MIGA Convention and those arising under the ICSID Convention. '55 It submits that the requirement of consent 'in writing' in Article 25(1) of the Convention is not met. Irrespective of the use of the imperative 'shall' in Article 22, this is subject to the condition 'if it so provides'. Thus, Article 22 'only recognizes international arbitration where the treaty or agreement itself contains an obligatory submission to arbitration' (as some BITs and the MIGA Convention do).56 In other words, the proviso is only satisfied if all the requirements of the treaty in question are satisfied, 'including, in the case of the ICSID Convention, a separate written consent.'57\n\nMemorial [38],\n\nMemorial [39]; Reply [30]-[32]; T1/26/19-21 & T1/27/12-14.\n\nT1/24/7-12.\n\n34.\n\nBecause the condition is not met, there is no basis to go beyond the text of the statute in determining Venezuela's intention in enacting Article 22,58 and the Claimants seek to construct consent to arbitration by reference to another document (the ICSID Convention) which provides nothing more than a set of rules to be applied where consent otherwise exists.59 Venezuela rejects the Claimants' argument that the word 'so' in 'if it so provides' refers to an 'infrastructure or framework of international arbitration' and rejects the 'logical leap' between interpreting 'so' to refer to submission to international arbitration and concluding that 'submission to international arbitration means to provide for the settlement of disputes through international arbitration.'60\n\nReply [20],\n\nReply [34],\n\nReply [35-36] quoting Counter-Memorial [84],\n\n35.\n\nTo the extent that the principle of *effet utile* requires the Tribunal to adopt an interpretation that gives meaning to the clause, Venezuela submits that the purpose of Article 22 is to acknowledge existing international commitments and thus avoid any misrepresentation61, a purpose which other articles in the same statute serve,62 as well as to make it clear that investors retain the right to resort to domestic Venezuelan jurisdiction (by the last sentence).63 In this respect, Venezuela accepts that the first two limbs (referring to BITs and the MIGA Convention) and the third limb (referring to the ICSID Convention) have different purposes: the first two acknowledge existing standing consents, while the third acknowledges Venezuela's commitment to arbitration under the ICSID Convention only where an independent instrument of consent (such as a concession contract) exists.64 Venezuela nevertheless submits that Article 22 treats the three limbs alike, in the sense that in each case the Article acknowledges the obligations contained in the treaty in question.65 Finally, Venezuela submits that its interpretation is consistent with the surrounding Articles 18, 21 and 23.66\n\nReply [44], citing *Cemex* [114]-[115]; T1/14/6-16, citing *Cemex;* T1/32/11-33/4, citing *Biwater Gauff* v *Tanzania.*\n\nT1/30/20-32/3.\n\nReply [45],\n\nT1/121/7-20.\n\nT1/123/5-8.\n\nT1/43/2-46/16.\n\n*(b) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimants focus on the 'ICSID clause' part of Article 22.67 It is accepted that the first part of the clause ('Controversies in respect of which the provisions of the [ICSID Convention] are applicable') refers to jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *materiae* which are met.68 The term 'shall' denotes a mandate (notwithstanding Venezuela's 'fallacious' comparison with Article 23).69 The word 'it'/'este' refers to the noun 'treaty or agreement' - in this context the Convention - so *'asi.Jo'* refers to 'the action of the preceding verb', *i.e.* submission to arbitration.70 Accordingly, the qualifier 'if it so establishes' means 'if [the respective treaty or agreement] establishes [submission to international arbitration].'71 The crux of the Claimants' interpretation is their argument that to 'establish' submission means to provide for the settlement of disputes through international arbitration.72 Venezuela's interpretation, according to the Claimants, requires reading the clause to mean 'if the ICSID Convention establishes consent'.73 That is untenable because (a) the term 'consent' appears nowhere in the preceding clause74 and (b) if 'submission to international arbitration' (the phrase to which 'if it so provides' refers back) encompassed the notion of consent then none of the listed treaties would qualify:75 the ICSID Convention cannot contain a state's consent76 and neither the ICSID Convention nor any of the other treaties can contain both the state's and the investor's consent, both of which are necessary.77\n\nT1/160/1-6.\n\nT1/161/3-8.\n\nT1/161/14, T1/162/3-163/13.\n\nT1/163/18-22.\n\nT1/164/1-7.\n\nCounter-Memorial [84];

The historical context of the enactment of the Investment Law*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Venezuela's submissions*\n-----------------------------\n\n39.\n\nVenezuela submits that the Claimants' interpretation is 'irreconcilable with the historical background of the statute and prevailing attitudes in Venezuela towards international arbitration in general and arbitration by the State in particular.'86 It cites the fact that President Chavez, who also promulgated the Investment Law, proposed that there be no provision in the Constitution for arbitration in the case of public interest contracts,87 and cites an Instruction and a Decree issued by President Chavez limiting arbitration of disputes involving public interest contracts.88 It rejects the Claimants' argument that, because Venezuela took 'pro-arbitration' steps around the time the Investment Law was promulgated, Article 22 must express consent.89 It also rejects the Claimants' reliance on Article 258 of the Constitution which, it says, merely promotes a range of dispute resolution mechanisms and does not mandate arbitration, let alone international arbitration.90 Venezuela maintains that Article 151 of the Constitution, despite the fact that President Chavez's initiative was not taken up, along with other factors, demonstrates a continuing hostile attitude to international arbitration.91\n\nMemorial [47];

Venezuela submits that while there is no 'magical language for expressing consent',111 these comparators do show that, if Venezuela had intended Article 22 to have that effect, it would have chosen one of the common formulations with which Venezuela was already familiar,112 not the 'confusing and ambiguous wording of Article 22.'113 Moreover, if Article 22 was intended to constitute consent, then the drafters would have defined the scope of that consent.114\n\nMemorial [57]-[60]; T1/39/2-6, citing US Model BIT & T1/40/16-41/7, citing OECD Working Group Model Investment Law.\n\nMemorial [61]-[64]; T1/39/7-20, citing the Albanian Investment Law In *Tradex v Albania;* T1/41/8-18, citing the Investment Code of the Central African Republic.\n\nMemorial [66]-[68]; T1/34/22-36/5.\n\nReply [13],\n\nMemorial [72]; Reply [22] relying on *Mobil* [139]-[140]; T1/48/10-13.\n\nReply [24] quoting *Brandes* [92],\n\nT1/42/8-22, citing Barbados-Venezuela BIT.\n\n*(b) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants reject Venezuela's reliance on the 1968 Model Clauses because the relevant words have been deleted from the latest version and because a model clause provides no guide to the interpretation of Article 22.115 They also reject Venezuela's other comparisons because the 'comparators have completely different structures from that of Article 22' and do not tell us anything about the meaning of Article 22.116 The argument that Venezuela knew how to draft a consent clause by 1999 is misplaced because it ignores the fact that consent may be drafted in any number of ways, and presupposes correspondence between domestic statutes and BITs.117\n\nCounter-Memorial [121]; Rejoinder [19],\n\nCounter-Memorial [150]; Rejoinder [68]-[69],\n\nCounter-Memorial [153],\n\n***B. Second ground of jurisdiction: the Barbados BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Introduction*\n-----------------\n\n46.\n\nThe second ground of jurisdiction invoked by the Claimants is based on the Barbados BIT. If the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 22 of the Investment Law, then it will have jurisdiction over the entire dispute submitted by the Claimants in their Request for Arbitration irrespective of the effect of the Barbados BIT. However, if the Tribunal concludes that jurisdiction is only available under the Barbados BIT, that would exclude from the Tribunal's remit the losses suffered by the Tidewater subsidiaries, Point Marine, L.L.C, Twenty Grand Marine Service L.L.C., Jackson Marine L.L.C. and Zapata Gulf Marine Operators, L.L.C., including the vessels and assets seized from those companies (except to the extent that these losses caused damage properly the subject of a claim by the Treaty Claimants).118 Nevertheless, the identification of the losses in respect of which the Tribunal has jurisdiction is a matter that will fall to be considered at the merits phase of this proceeding. The Tribunal does not express a view on this question at this stage but simply notes it in order to put Venezuela's jurisdictional objections in context.\n\nRequest for Arbitration [61],\n\n47.\n\nVenezuela accepts that Article 25 is *prima facie* satisfied by the Claimants' invocation of the Barbados BIT, but alleges that in doing so the Claimants are committing 'treaty abuse' and should thus not be permitted to invoke the BIT. Venezuela says that the Tidewater group was restructured to insert Tidewater Barbados into the chain of ownership for the sole purpose of establishing ICSID jurisdiction in respect of a dispute that already existed at the time of the restructuring, or in preparation for anticipated litigation. The parties' submissions are now summarised.\n\n2. *The concept of treaty abuse*\n--------------------------------\n\n*(a) Venezuela's submissions*\n-----------------------------\n\n48.\n\nVenezuela relies on the concept of 'abuse of right' in international law.119 It relies on six ICSID awards to extract a number of factors that may be taken into account to determine whether jurisdiction will be denied on this ground. Venezuela summarises the relevance of these decisions as follows:\n\n(i) *Banro American Resources v Democratic Republic of the Congo:* Canada is not a party to the Convention but the United States is. After the Congo repealed decrees approving the concession held by a subsidiary of Banro (a Canadian company), Banro transferred its shares in the subsidiary to a United States affiliate. The tribunal refused jurisdiction despite the fact that the requirements of Article 25 were technically met.120\n\n(ii) *Autopista v Venezuela:* The tribunal relied on the following key factors in upholding jurisdiction: (i) the transferee entity had been incorporated 8 years earlier; (ii) the transferee was not just a shell corporation but had actual business operations; (iii) the claimant had requested and obtained the state's approval; and (iv) the claimant had a reasonable business justification for the transfer.121\n\n(iii) *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine:* ICSID jurisdiction can be denied in circumstances where an investor creates a shell company for the sole purpose of gaining access to arbitration under a BIT.122\n\n(iv) *Aguas del Tunari v Bolivia:* Although acknowledging that the corporate form could be abused, the majority found that such was not the case because (i) the entity was not simply a corporate shell set up to obtain jurisdiction; (ii) the joint venture was structured so that neither party had exclusive control; (iii) the entity had a portfolio of 8 contracts and real operations; and (iv) the restructuring was planned and executed before the events giving rise to the dispute.123\n\n(v) *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic:* The restructuring in question was a 'mere redistribution of assets' within the same family for the purpose of gaining access to jurisdiction to which the original investor was not entitled.124 The Tribunal drew a distinction between structuring an investment at the outset for the purpose of benefiting from the protection of a treaty, and restructuring after the fact in order to gain protection.125 Venezuela cites along the same lines Zachary Douglas' argument that if 'the objective purpose of the restructuring was to facilitate access to an investment treaty tribunal with respect to a claim that was within the reasonable contemplation of the investor' then the claim would be inadmissible.126\n\n(vi) *Mobil v Venezuela:* Whether a restructuring constituted 'legitimate corporate planning' or an 'abuse of right' depended on the circumstances,127 and restructuring for the purpose of gaining jurisdiction in respect of 'pre-existing disputes' is abusive.128\n\nMemorial [80]; see also [113] quoting Hersch Lauterpacht *The Development of International Law by the International Court* (Frederick A.

(ii) the fact that Tidewater Investment is a shell company with little or no economic operations; (iii) the lack of a reasonable business explanation for the restructuring, which means that it did not create a 'good faith investment'; and (iv) the fact that the host state's consent was not obtained.135\n\nT1/74/8-10, 15-20.\n\n*(b) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants submit that there is nothing objectionable in an investor considering the protection provided by investment treaties in structuring its investments,136 and there is no basis on which to impose additional nationality requirements 'extraneous to the Treaty.'137 The Claimants do not accept the principle on which Venezuela relies that restructuring to obtain protection in respect of an anticipated dispute constitutes treaty abuse.138\n\nCounter-Memorial [191], relying on *Aguas del Tunari* [332], *Phoenix Action* [94]-[95] and *Mobil* [204];

Application to the facts of this case*\n------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Venezuela's submissions*\n-----------------------------\n\n56.\n\nVenezuela submits that an application of the factors it has identified leads to the conclusion that the Claimants' conduct is an abuse of the Barbados BIT. Venezuela defines the 'dispute' in question as 'a dispute over the need to ensure the continuity of service provided by SEMARCA despite the... accounts receivable.'150 A subsidiary aspect of the dispute concerned the position of employees of SEMARCA, whom SEMARCA stopped paying in late 2008 and whom PDVSA began to pay directly.151\n\nT1/75/6-11.\n\nT1/92/8-11.\n\n57.\n\nVenezuela relies on the following facts to establish that a dispute was already in existence or at least reasonably anticipated when the restructuring occurred:\n\n(i) The continuity of SEMARCA's operations was required by the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law;152\n\n(ii) In late 2008 and early 2009 PDVSA had fallen behind on its accounts payable;153\n\n(iii) PDVSA requested all suppliers and contractors, including SEMARCA, to renegotiate their service contracts;154\n\n(iv) SEMARCA and the other suppliers refused to reduce their tariffs;155\n\n(v) The Ensco 69 rig was seized by workers under PetroSucre's control in January 2009 in response to Ensco International's decision to shut down the rig until arrears were paid, and service companies were warned on several occasions that Venezuela would not permit the industry to be paralysed;156\n\n(vi) SEMARCA and the other suppliers stopped paying accrued wages157 and Mr Mikael Jacob, General Manager of SEMARCA, refused to extend contracts with PDVSA unless SEMARCA's demands were met, and on 30 April 2009 described the situation as being at 'breaking point';158\n\n(vii) According to the Minister of Energy and Petroleum the suppliers were threatening to abandon Venezuela with their equipment;159 and the Reserve Law was enacted to guarantee continuity of service.160\n\nT1/75/12-19.\n\nMemorial [11]-[13],\n\nMemorial [13]\u2014[15].\n\nReply [73],\n\nMemorial [16], T1/77/2-5, T1/103/10-16.\n\nMemorial [15],\n\nReply [76],\n\nMemorial [18],\n\nT1/83/2-7, citing Ex.

Cf Factor (i) above.\n\nT2/282/15-17.\n\n60.\n\nVenezuela relies on the chain of privileged communications relating to the restructuring which the Claimants have refused to disclose on grounds of privilege, and infers from the fact that the chain was begun by Mr Jacob,167 and that advice was (first) sought from Venezuelan lawyers with experience in arbitration and compensation for expropriation rather than tax lawyers,168 that the restructuring must have been done to prepare for a dispute with Venezuela.169 It also relies on the fact that no document was produced that demonstrated a business reason for the restructuring.170\n\nT1/103/5-9.\n\nReply [93], T1/104/3-6.\n\nReply [79], Cf Factors (i) and (iii) above.\n\nT1/102/22-T1/103/2.\n\n61.\n\nVenezuela thus submits that no legitimate business reason for the restructuring other than to obtain protection against a foreseeable risk of nationalisation or 'government action' was identified.171 Venezuela submits that the tax reason for the creation of Tidewater Barbados is not credible because the timing was coincidental (coming five years after the enactment of the United States statute that is said to have prompted the desire for a tax restructuring) and decades after the original corporate structure was established;172 and because the alleged tax advantage only required one foreign company to be interposed between Tidewater Inc. and SEMARCA - and Tidewater Marine (a Cayman Islands company) already served that purpose.173\n\nT1/105/1-3, T1/105/16-106/1.\n\nReply [91],\n\nReply [95]-[98], relying on opinion of Professor Steines [15], Cf Factor (iii) above.\n\n62.\n\nVenezuela accordingly disputes the Claimants' argument that their continued investment in Venezuela was inconsistent with the expectation of expropriation and litigation, and suggests that the cash advances relied on by the Claimants were nothing more than 'transfers that were strictly necessary to maintain minimal operations' and not true investments,174 and that the other alleged investments were either plans175 or concerned unrelated projects.176\n\nReply [81], T2/295/10-20.\n\nReply [82], T2/295/21-22.\n\nReply [85], T2/296/3-4, 10-16.\n\n63.\n\nVenezuela argues that Tidewater Barbados is a corporation of convenience with minimal alleged investments and operations and 'does not perform any real economic activity in Barbados [,..].'177 It thus does not fulfil the object and purpose of the BIT, which is to promote the economic development of the contracting parties.178\n\nReply [102], Cf Factor (ii) above.\n\nT1/112/9-19, T2/293/12-21.\n\n64.\n\nAlthough Venezuela accepts that (unlike in *Aguas del Tunari* and *Autopista)* the state's consent was not required for the restructuring in this case, it was relevant that the Claimants did not request authorisation and hid the restructuring from the state.179\n\nT1/110/14-21, T1/111/1-3.\n\n65.\n\nVenezuela thus submits that Tidewater's restructuring was not done in good faith, pointing to the fact that Tidewater Barbados was incorporated shortly before the claim was initiated, that the restructuring was done for reasons clearly related to an eventual arbitration proceeding, and that the Claimants created a legal fiction to gain access to international arbitration to which they had no right of access.180\n\nT1/113/4-20.\n\n*(b) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimants submit that no dispute arose before Venezuela adopted the Reserve Law because the Claimants were not on notice that expropriation would follow if the Claimants refused to enter into a new contract with PDVSA181 and because a dispute cannot arise 'until all of its constituent elements have come into existence.'182 Accordingly, they submit that the 'alleged \"dispute\"' with PDVSA concerning new contracts (referred to in the 30 April 2009 communication from Mr Jacob) was not the same dispute as that which arose out of the enactment of the Reserve Law.183\n\nRejoinder [90],\n\nRejoinder [91]; T1/238/13-18 quoting *Right of Passage over Indian Territories* 34.\n\nRejoinder [95],\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimants rely on the following facts in particular:\n\n(i) Contrary to Venezuela's submission, the Claimants' activities were not governed by the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law.184 Accordingly, SEMARCA was not required by law to provide continuous service; it was only required to provide to PDVSA those services which were contractually negotiated.185\n\n(ii) Between December 2008 and June 2009, PDVSA and PetroSucre paid over US$llm to SEMARCA.186\n\n(iii) The Claimants' restructuring was commenced in 2008, before the events which Venezuela suggests made nationalisation foreseeable.187\n\n(iv) The correspondence between SEMARCA and PDVSA in February 2009 showed that SEMARCA sought payment for services rendered, and was reluctant to enter into a *new* contract and keep sending money to Venezuela until payments were received, and PDVSA promised that payments would be forthcoming.188\n\n(v) SEMARCA did not threaten to suspend its services in February 2009 but in *April* 2009 (after the restructuring) refused to extend them unless agreement was reached on certain issues.189\n\n(vi) PDVSA paid a portion of the salaries of SEMARCA workers of its own accord and not because it had to.190\n\n(vii) PDVSA never requested that SEMARCA adjust its tariffs and SEMARCA had not substantially increased them since 2006.191\n\n(viii) The Claimants were never warned that the Government would expropriate any supplier that suspended its services and none of the articles cited by Venezuela substantiate this assertion,192 and in any case SEMARCA never interrupted its operations until the day it was seized.193\n\n(ix) If there was a dispute, it was not between the Claimants and Venezuela but with PDVSA, which cannot be equated with the state.194\n\n(x) Accordingly, they say that the enactment of the Reserve Law came as a complete surprise and without any prior announcement.195 Moreover, there is no reference in the Reserve Law itself to continuity of services, which undermines Venezuela's argument that it was enacted as part of a single ongoing dispute about continuity of service.196\n\nT2/355/9-16.\n\nT2/358/6-18.\n\nCounter-Memorial [11]\u2014[12].\n\nT2/360/8-9, T2/361/6-10.\n\nT1/220/5-14 citing Ex.

THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n***A. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal will now analyse in turn each of the objections to jurisdiction advanced by the Respondent in the order in which they were argued by the parties:\n\n(a) Whether Article *22* of Venezuela's Investment Law is effective to confer jurisdiction in relation to the claims of all of the Claimants; and,\n\n(b) Whether the Barbados BIT is effective to confer jurisdiction in relation to the claims of the Second Claimant, Tidewater Barbados, and the Third Claimant, Tidewater Caribe (together 'the Treaty Claimants').210\n\nRequest for Arbitration, [30]; T1/188/12-14.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal is empowered to determine these questions by virtue of Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that '[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.'\n\n***B. First ground of jurisdiction: Article 22 of the Investment Law***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Consent in writing under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe starting-point for any analysis of the question whether a tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention has jurisdiction to determine a dispute is the master provision in the Convention itself, namely Article 25(1), which provides, in relevant part:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State, *which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre211*\n\nThus, as the framers of the Convention emphasised, '[c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre.'212\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention [23],\n\n76.\n\nThe proper construction of Article 22 of the Investment Law has given rise to arguments of considerable legal sophistication. It was indeed presciently observed in the leading Commentary on the ICSID Convention that this Article 'is drafted in ambiguous terms and is likely to give rise to difficulties of interpretation, notably as to whether it contains an expression of Venezuela's consent to ICSID arbitration or not.'213 Nevertheless, at its heart, the question before this Tribunal is simply whether Article 22, on its proper construction, constitutes consent in writing on the part of Venezuela to submit this dispute to ICSID arbitration. In other words, does this provision of a municipal statute operate so as to produce the effect on the international plane prescribed by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention?\n\nSchreuer et al *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2ed, Cambridge UP, 2009) 363 [46],\n\n77.\n\nFrom the outset of the Convention, it was envisaged that one method by which a state might give its consent in writing is in municipal investment promotion legislation:214\n\nThus, a host State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes arising out of certain classes of investments to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and the investor might give his consent by accepting the offer in writing.\n\nThe first example of a finding that municipal investment promotion legislation did constitute consent in writing to ICSID arbitration is found in the Decision on Jurisdiction in the *'Pyramids'* arbitration215 in which the tribunal interpreted Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law. But it is axiomatic that each document alleged to constitute consent in writing for the purpose of the Convention must be interpreted on its own terms in order to determine whether it does in fact give rise to such consent.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention [24],\n\n*SPP v Egypt.*\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the question of whether Article 22 of the Venezuelan Investment Law does constitute consent has been argued before three other ICSID arbitral tribunals, whose decisions on the point have been cited to it in these proceedings.216 Nevertheless, the present Tribunal will determine the question afresh, in the light of the submissions, and the expert evidence, placed before it. It proposes to do so by examining:\n\n(a) The approach to be applied to the interpretation of Article 22 as an instrument of consent; and then,\n\n(b) The correct interpretation of Article 22 produced by that approach.\n\n*Mobil v. Venezuela, Cemex v. Venezuela* and *Brandes v. Venezuela.* One of the arbitrators in the present arbitration, Professor Stern, also served as one of the arbitrators in *Brandes.*\n\n2. *Legal principles applicable to the interpretation of Article 22*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Fundamental elements*\n--------------------------\n\n79.\n\nAlthough the parties disagreed on several aspects of the approach which they respectively contended ought to be adopted by the Tribunal to the interpretation of Article *22,* nevertheless, the Tribunal finds that there was a broad measure of agreement as to the following fundamental elements:\n\n(a) Both parties accepted that both international law and Venezuelan law have a role to play (though they differed as to the nature of these respective roles);217\n\n(b) Both parties accepted that the provision had to be interpreted in good faith;218\n\n(c) Both parties accepted that, in arriving at the meaning of the provision, the interpreter was entitled to have regard to a list of factors that were fairly consistent across the various approaches, namely the natural and ordinary meaning of the text, the context, the object and purpose of the provision and the surrounding circumstances.219\n\nRespondent: T2/266/17-267/16; Claimant: T2/306/1-7, T2/316/15-317/8.\n\nRespondent: T2/275/4-6 ; Claimant: T2/315/16-17.\n\nRespondent: T2/273/14-20; Claimant: T2/315/21-316/5.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with each of these propositions. It will, however, elaborate on the applicable principles, which require that two questions be answered: the first one is whether national law has a priority role to play as argued by Venezuela, or whether essentially international law applies to the interpretation of a national law like the Investment Law, as argued by the Claimants; the second question is, if international principles of interpretation are applicable, should one use the rules for the interpretation of treaties or rules for the interpretation of unilateral acts?\n\n*(b) National law or international law?*\n----------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nShould the Tribunal apply national rules of interpretation or the international rules of interpretation? It is the Tribunal's view that the Investment Law being a municipal legal instrument susceptible to having effects on the international plane, both national rules of interpretation and international rules of interpretation have their role to play.\n\n82.\n\nIn addressing this question of consent under Article 25, a tribunal is not bound to apply only host state law, even in a case where one of the parties' consent derives from host state law. This question has already been addressed by other ICSID tribunals.\n\n83.\n\nThus, in *SPP v Egypt,*220 the source of the state's consent was a provision in its investment law. Egypt submitted that the jurisdictional issues were governed by Egyptian law, and that, pursuant to the Egyptian Civil Code, no effective arbitration agreement had been concluded. This submission was rejected by a tribunal presided over by Jimenez de Arechaga. It applied instead general principles of interpretation and international law to the question of consent, stating that:\n\nThus in deciding whether in the circumstances of the present case Law No. 43 constitutes consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, the Tribunal will apply general principles of statutory interpretation taking into consideration, where appropriate, relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations.221\n\n*SPP v Egypt* [55]-[61].\n\n*SPP v Egypt* [61],\n\n84.\n\nIn *CSOB v Slovakia,* the tribunal's jurisdiction was derived from a contract. The tribunal held nevertheless that:\n\nThe question of whether the parties have effectively expressed their consent to ICSID jurisdiction is not to be answered by reference to national law. It is governed by international law as set out in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.222\n\n*CSOB v Slovakia* [35],\n\n85.\n\nHowever, in *Zhinvali v Georgia,* a case where the instrument of consent was a municipal investment protection statute, the tribunal opined that:\n\n... if the national law of Georgia addresses this question of 'consent', which the Tribunal finds that it does, then the Tribunal must follow that national law guidance but always subject to ultimate governance by international law.223\n\n*Zhinvali v Georgia* [339],\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that national law has to be completely disregarded, but considers that logic implies that an act, which is both rooted in the national legal order and extends its effects in the international legal order, has to be interpreted by reference to both legal orders. Thus, an ICSID tribunal determining its jurisdiction is not required to interpret the instrument of consent according primarily to national law, but rather has to take into account the principles of international law. The next question naturally is to determine which principles of international law are applicable.\n\n*(c) Which principles of international law?*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent presented arguments for a restrictive approach, by reference to the ILC Unilateral Declaration Principles. Indeed, the Respondent seeks to argue, on various grounds, that the Tribunal ought to take a more restrictive approach to interpretation of Article **22** than might be the case with other instruments. In the first place, the Respondent alleges that Article **22** ought to be treated as the unilateral declaration of a state to be construed in accordance with the ILC Unilateral Declaration Principles, Principle 7 of which requires declarations to be 'interpreted in a restrictive manner.' For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal does not accept that it must do so.\n\n88.\n\nTo the extent that Article *22,* as a provision in a municipal law statute, is alleged to produce the prescribed effect of state consent under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, it may be analysed as a unilateral declaration of a state. That is to say, it is a statement made unilaterally by an organ of the state, namely the legislature, which may, according to its proper construction, produce legal effects on the international plane vis-\u00e0-vis other states, namely the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention and their nationals. The Working Group of the International Law Commission, when engaged initially in defining the scope of its work on unilateral declarations, accepted that internal acts ('laws, decrees, regulations') need not be treated as unilateral acts, but 'internal acts that may have effects on the international plane... should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with international law.'224\n\n[1997] Ybk ILC Voi 11(2), [205], Ex. CL-112.\n\n89.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the critical distinction is not whether the source of the unilateral act is found in municipal legislation, but rather whether the act is undertaken within, or outside, the framework of a treaty, and in particular a treaty that provides for the possibility of submission to the jurisdiction of an international court or tribunal. Where the question is one of the legal effects in international law to be attributed to the unilateral statements of a state offered outside any treaty framework, one might well accept that a restrictive approach should be adopted, so as to separate from the numerous statements made by heads of state, heads of government and foreign ministers, that much smaller category of such statements that were really intended to produce legally binding effects on the international plane. The same point may equally be made in relation to municipal legislation. The great majority of legislation enacted by states produces its effects solely on the municipal plane, and one must carefully distinguish the much smaller category of cases in which the state intended its legislation to produce opposable effects in international law.\n\n90.\n\nBut these considerations do not apply where the action of the state, whether expressed in legislation or in some other form of statement, is undertaken expressly by reference to an international treaty to which the state is (or wishes to become) a party. In that situation, the treaty itself provides the legal framework within which the effect of the statement is to be determined, and so it is both unnecessary and inappropriate to add an additional standard to that provided under the relevant treaty to the interpretation of the state's act. It was for this reason that the Working Group of the ILC left this category of acts that have a treaty connection out of the scope of its work on unilateral declarations.225\n\nIbid [203]\u2014[204].\n\n91.\n\nIn other words, a national law which is intended to have some effects on the international plane might be subject to the restrictive interpretation provided for in the ILC Unilateral Declaration Principles, but this does not apply to a national law which is adopted in the framework of an international treaty, even if such law is an exercise of the freedom of the state to act on the international plane, as has been outlined by the ILC Working Group on unilateral acts:\n\n203. The Working Group bore in mind that, in the process of treaty formation, amendment, execution, termination, and so on, States carry out acts which, prima facie, are unilateral in character when viewed in isolation (for example, accession, denunciation, reservation, withdrawal). The Working Group nonetheless considered that the characteristics and effects of such acts are governed by the law of treaties and do not need to be dealt with further in the context of the new study proposed.\n\n204. Similar arguments were presented in discussing the possible inclusion of unilateral acts carried out by States in the context of international justice. Mention was made in particular of the characterization of acceptance of the optional clause in article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of ICJ as a unilateral act. The Working Group was inclined to leave this category of acts out of the study taking the view that such acts have a treaty basis.\n\n205. The same position was taken with regard to internal acts (laws, decrees, regulations) that do not have any effect at the international plane. However, internal acts that may have effects on the international plane, such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction (territorial sea, contiguous zone, economic zone, baselines), should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with international law.226\n\nIbid, [203]\u2014[205].\n\n92.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, different kinds of unilateral acts have to be distinguished, *i.e.* purely unilateral acts, called in the work of the ILC unilateral acts *stricto sensu,* to which the Guiding Principles apply; unilateral acts which are a cause or a consequence of a treaty - like acts implicated in the formation or the execution of the treaty - to which apply the rules of interpretation of the VCLT; and finally unilateral acts which are adopted freely but in the framework of a treaty which recognizes this freedom of action, to which apply some specific rules, whose content the Tribunal will now explain.\n\n93.\n\nClearly, the Investment Law is one of those unilateral acts, freely entered into by a state, but taken in the framework of a treaty that leaves all its freedom to the state. In this sense, it can be considered as being analogous to a unilateral declaration of a state accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ, in the framework of Article 36 (2) of the Statute of the Court.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore minded to take inspiration from the analysis adopted by the ICJ for the interpretation of a unilateral declaration of compulsory jurisdiction to the ICJ, which is very similar to a unilateral offer to arbitrate, the difference being that in the first case the offer to accept the jurisdiction of an international court is made to the other states and in the second case the offer to accept the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal is made to the nationals of the other states, both being offers that will deploy their effect on the international plane.\n\n95.\n\nA first remark is that when a state decides to extend an offer to arbitrate to foreign investors in a municipal law, it is free to do so and it can be considered as a unilateral act taken in the exercise of the state's sovereign powers. The ICJ analyzed in the same manner a unilateral declaration of compulsory jurisdiction: 'A declaration of acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court... is a unilateral act of State sovereignty. At the same time, it establishes... the potential for a jurisdictional link with the other States,...'227\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v Canada)* [46],\n\n96.\n\nThese unilateral acts are neither to be interpreted according to the rules of the VCLT, nor according to the rules stated in the ILC Unilateral Declaration Principles; they have their own rules of Interpretation. In the *Fisheries* case, the ICJ clarified this point in the following manner:\n\nThe r\u00e9gime relating to the interpretation of declarations made under Article 36 of the Statute is not identical with that established for the interpretation of treaties by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.... The Court observes that the provisions of that Convention may only apply analogously to the extent compatible with the *sui generis* character of the unilateral acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction.228\n\nIbid.\n\n97.\n\nThese *sui generis* rules applicable to unilateral offers of jurisdiction imply that the interpretation is performed:\n\nin a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned at the time when it accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. The intention of a... State may be deduced not only from the text of the relevant clause, but also from the context in which the clause is to be read, and an examination of evidence regarding the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served.229\n\nIbid [49],\n\n98.\n\nOne of the specificities of the *sui generis* rules applying to the interpretation of the kind of unilateral act at stake here is that the unilateral act 'should be interpreted in a manner compatible with the effect sought by the... State.'230\n\nIbid [52],\n\n99.\n\nAnother specificity is that it has not to be interpreted restrictively, since it takes place in the conventional context of a treaty. Thus, declarations of a state that fall for assessment in terms of whether they produce effects within the context of a treaty framework - and in particular the effect of submission to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal - are not subject to the restrictive approach to be taken for other kinds of unilateral declarations. Such an approach does not limit a state's freedom to act, since the state retains full power to decide whether to enter into the treaty in question and whether to take advantage or not of the possibilities offered by the treaty.\n\n100.\n\nThus, an ICSID tribunal determining its jurisdiction is required to consider directly whether there is the requisite evidence of consent required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, having regard to the common will of the parties on which arbitration is grounded and the general principle (widely applied in municipal law as well as in international law) of good faith.\n\n*(d) The Tribunal's conclusion on the approach to interpretation*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore approaches the question of the interpretation of Article *22* without adopting an *a priori* position which is either restrictive or expansive. As it was rightly put in the *Pyramids* Decision:231\n\n[J]urisdictional instruments are to be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, and jurisdiction will be found to exist if - but only if - the force of the arguments militating in favor of it is preponderant.\n\nPutting the point in the present Tribunal's own words, it will proceed to find that it has jurisdiction if, but only if, the existence of the consent in writing of both parties to its jurisdiction is clear.\n\n*SPP v Egypt* 141 [63],\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal finds itself largely in agreement with the general step-by-step approach to interpretation of instruments of consent proposed by the Claimants232 which it restates to some extent in its own words as follows:\n\n(1) The first step is to look at Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention itself in order to determine whether the statement is capable of constituting a party's consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n(2) In order then to determine whether the content of the statement expresses such consent one must look to general international law applicable to this type of unilateral act, since the issue is to determine the effects of the statement for the purposes of the ICSID Convention as a matter of international law.\n\n(3) Such a statement has the character of a unilateral declaration. But it is a unilateral declaration formulated within the context of a treaty. Accordingly, for the reasons that the Tribunal has already explained, the ILC Principles are not applicable.\n\n(4) Rather, a unilateral declaration alleged to constitute consent to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal is to be interpreted in accordance with the approach set out by the International Court of Justice when interpreting declarations of acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction.\n\n(5) This means that the declaration must be interpreted in good faith 'as it stands, having regard to the words actually used'233; 'in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned.'234 That intention can be deduced from the text, but also from the context, the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served.\n\n(6) Municipal law is relevant to determine the existence and validity of the instrument at issue and may help to ascertain the intention of the state. But the question whether the statement constitutes consent for the purpose of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is, for the purpose of this Tribunal determining its own competence under Article 41 of the Convention, a question of international law.\n\nT2/304/3-317/10.\n\n*Anglo-Iranian Oil Co Case* 105.\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v Canada)* [49],\n\n*3. Concrete application to the interpretation of Article 22*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The limited application of Venezuelan legal interpretation*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nAs just mentioned, domestic law has a role to play first in order to ascertain the existence and validity of the national law, but also in order to help understanding the intention of the state in adopting such law.\n\n104.\n\nVenezuela argues that, as a matter of Venezuelan law, Article 22 does not constitute a standing consent to ICSID arbitration and that this Tribunal ought to apply and give effect to restrictive rules of Venezuelan law in this regard. The Tribunal has carefully considered the submissions of the parties on the interpretation of Article 22 under Venezuelan law; the Expert Opinions of Professor Urdaneta Fontiveros, filed on behalf of the Respondent and of Professor Ayala Corea filed on behalf of Claimants; and in particular the Judgment of the Supreme Tribunal of Venezuela on the interpretation of Article 22.235 The parties' experts disagree on the proper interpretation of Article 22. Further Professor Ayala Corea takes issue with the Judgment of the Supreme Tribunal on a number of grounds. Neither party nor the Tribunal wished to cross-examine either of these experts.\n\nDecision No 1541 on Interpretation Request dated 17 October 2008, Ex. EU-29.\n\n105.\n\nThis Tribunal does not find it necessary to its decision to decide the issues of interpretation under Venezuelan law, nor, for that purpose to determine any conflict of evidence between the experts. That is because the experts agree that the Venezuelan law principles of statutory interpretation require determination of the meaning 'that is evident from the proper meaning of the words, according to their connection among themselves and the intention of the Legislator,'236 which is in full coherence with the international principles applicable to the case. Where they disagree is as to the proper application of those principles to the interpretation of Article 22 as a Venezuelan legislative instrument.\n\nArt 4 Venezuelan Civil Code Ex. EU-4; Ayala Opinion [15]; Urdaneta Supp. Opinion [4],\n\n106.\n\nBut the question with which this Tribunal is concerned is the interpretation of Article 22 in order to determine whether it produces the effect specified under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention on the plane of international law. This question the Tribunal must answer for itself, adopting the general principles of construction which have been outlined by the Tribunal.\n\n107.\n\nIt also follows that this Tribunal is not bound by the decision of the Supreme Tribunal of Venezuela. While this decision is entitled to respectful consideration, the present Tribunal is bound by Article 41 of the ICSID Convention to be the judge of its own competence.\n\n*(b) Text*\n----------\n\n108.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Tribunal returns to the text of Article 22 itself, which it will be convenient to restate here:\n\nLas controversias que surjan entre un inversionista internacional, cuyo pa\u00eds de origen tenga vigente con Venezuela un tratado o acuerdo sobre promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n de inversiones, o las controversias respecto de las cuales sean aplicables las disposiciones del Convenio Constituvo del Organismo Multilateral de Garant\u00eda de Inversiones (OMGI - MIGA) o del Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados (CIADI), ser\u00e1n sometidas al arbitraje internacional en los t\u00e9rminos del respectivo tratado o acuerdo, si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece, sin perjuicio de la posibilidad de hacer uso, cuando proceda, de las v\u00edas contenciosas contempladas en la legislaci\u00f3n venezolana vigente.\n\n109.\n\nThe parties each prepared English translations of Article 22. These differ slightly in the nomenclature used. But the Tribunal is satisfied that its decision on the effect of Article 22 does not turn upon any difference in the English translations, nor was it contended by the parties that the differences were material.237 In any event, the Tribunal has considered the interpretation of Article 22 directly in the original and authoritative Spanish text as well as by reference to the parties' English translations.238 For ease of reference, it now reproduces below a consolidated translation derived from those prepared by each of the parties. Where there is a difference in the translation, the Claimants' text appears first239 and then the Respondent's alternative formulation.240 The Tribunal gives each translation equal weight:\n\nControversies [disputes] that may arise [arising] between an international investor, whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and protection of investments, or controversies [disputes] in respect of which [to which are applicable] the provisions of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency ([OMGI-] MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID) are applicable, shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so establishes [provides], without prejudice to the possibility of using [making use], as [when] appropriate, [of] the contentious [dispute resolution] means contemplated by [provided for under] the Venezuelan legislation in effect.\n\nClaimants translate 'si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece' as 'if it so establishes' and Respondent prefers 'if it so provides.' However, Respondent pleads that '[t]he word \"establishes\" could also be correct, but only in the sense of *if the treaty or agreement establishes that the type of dispute should be submitted to arbitration,* not in the sense of *if the treaty or agreement establishes the fundamental rules and framework of arbitration'* Reply [34] n 60. The Tribunal therefore approaches this point of dispute between the parties as one of substantial meaning rather than semantic translation.\n\nThe procedural languages of the arbitration are both English and Spanish: First Session, [7.1], If there had been a material difference between the Spanish original and the English translations of the Investment Law, the Tribunal would have treated the Spanish text as authoritative in favour of either of the English translations. The Tribunal is satisfied that there are no material differences.\n\nCounter-Memorial [59],\n\nMemorial [37],\n\n110.\n\nThe text contemplates three different types of treaty that may be applicable to the dispute. Each of these cases is stated disjunctively and concerns respectively:\n\n(1) First case: A treaty on the promotion and protection of investments in effect between an international investor's country of origin and Venezuela;\n\n(2) Second case: The Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA);241 or,\n\n(3) Third case: The ICSID Convention.\n\nConvention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (signed 11 October 1985, entered into force 12 April 1988).\n\n111.\n\nOne such category, the Second case (disputes under the MIGA Convention), is not concerned with disputes with an investor at all, but rather with disputes concerning investment guarantees entered into with the Agency itself.242 The other two categories are concerned with disputes involving international investors:\n\n\u2022 In the First case, the express words of the Article refer to disputes that may arise with 'an international investor...';\n\n\u2022 In the Third case, the very name of the ICSID Convention (recited in the Article) refers to 'disputes between States and nationals of other States.'\n\nIbid Art 57 and Annex II.\n\n112.\n\nTo each of these three cases, Article 22 adds a condition and a proviso:\n\n(a) The dispute may only be submitted to arbitration 'according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so establishes/provides'; and,\n\n(b) Such submission is without prejudice to the possibility of using dispute settlement mechanisms provided for under Venezuelan law 'as/when appropriate.'\n\n*(c) Textual context*\n---------------------\n\n113.\n\nArticle 22 appears as the second of three operative provisions within Chapter IV of the Investment Law, which deals generally with 'Dispute Resolution.' The first of these provisions, Article 21, deals with inter-state disputes in cases where there is no treaty in force. It provides:\n\nAny controversy that may arise between the State of Venezuela and an international investor's country of origin with which there is no treaty or agreement on investments, concerning the interpretation and application of the provisions herein, shall be solved by diplomatic means. Should an agreement not be made within twelve (12) months following the date in which the controversy began, the State of Venezuela shall propose the submission of the controversy to an Arbitration Tribunal whose composition, appointment mechanism, proceedings and regulations of fees shall be agreed upon with the other country. The decisions of this Arbitration Tribunal shall be final and mandatory.\n\n114.\n\nThe two ensuing articles then deal with other investment disputes. Article 22 deals with cases in which there is an applicable treaty. It is then followed by Article 23, which provides for other disputes of investors generally under the Investment Law. As already noted, it provides:\n\nAny controversy that arises in relation with the application of this Decree-Law, once the administrative remedies have been exhausted by the investor, may be submitted to the Domestic Courts or to the Venezuelan Arbitration Tribunals, at the investor's discretion.\n\n115.\n\nPausing at this point in the analysis, it may be observed that the general structure and intent of Article 22 may be discerned from its text, when viewed in the context of Chapter IV of the Investment Law as a whole:\n\n\u2022 Inter-state disputes are provided for by way of *ad hoc* arbitration to be settled by *compromis* agreed with the other state under Public International Law (Article 21);\n\n\u2022 Disputes under treaties are to be resolved by international arbitration if the treaty so establishes or provides (Article 22);\n\n\u2022 In the case of all other disputes under the Investment Law, investors have the choice of Venezuelan courts or Venezuelan arbitral tribunals (Article 23).\n\n116.\n\nThe Investment Law carefully defines an 'international investor' - being the category of investors referred to in Article 22 - by Article 3(4) as '[t]he owner of an international investment or whoever effectively controls it.' An international investment is, according to Article 3(2) '[t]he investment that is the property of, or is effectively controlled by foreign natural or legal persons.'\n\n117.\n\nBy contrast, Article 23 refers simply to 'the investor.' It is not by its terms limited to international investors, but can apply to both international and Venezuelan investors. Article 1 states that the Law applies generally to investors 'both domestic and foreign.' Thus, the avenues of dispute resolution afforded by Article 23, being court proceedings or arbitration in Venezuela, apply equally to international and Venezuelan investors. Article 23 therefore operates as a catch-all provision in respect of any disputes by any investor in relation to the application of the Investment Law that are not otherwise provided for in Article 22. These may, at the investor's election, be submitted to adjudication or arbitration in Venezuela. This is reinforced by the without prejudice proviso at the end of Article 22, which directs attention, even in the case of international investors, to the possibility of applying Venezuelan dispute resolution mechanisms as/when appropriate.\n\n*(d) Historical context*\n------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent advances arguments based upon the historical context against the background of which it contends Article 22 was promulgated and which, according to it, demonstrates that Article 22 could not have been intended to serve as standing consent. It refers to Venezuela's historical antipathy to international arbitration in general, and in particular in cases where the state itself is a party.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the general historical and legal context, both under municipal law and under international law, within which a legislative instrument alleged to constitute consent was promulgated may well provide helpful evidence as to its interpretation. But in the present case, it does not find the material advanced by the Respondent to be helpful.\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have in the arbitration file any documents pertaining directly to the legislative history of the Investment Law. Indeed, when requested to produce such material by the Claimants, the Respondent replied that it had no such documents.243 When ordered by the Tribunal to undertake a fresh search, the Respondent confirmed on enquiry that it had no such documents.244\n\nProcedural Order No 1, [17],\n\nRespondent's letter dated 13 April 2011.\n\n121.\n\nThe documents adduced by the Claimants prepared by Ambassador Corrales, Venezuela's Permanent Representative at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva, do not, in the Tribunal's view, advance matters materially. Although the Respondent accepts that Mr Corrales participated in discussions regarding the Investment Law,245 the views of Mr Corrales cannot be imputed to the legislature. In any event, only one such document predates the passing of the Investment Law. In it, Mr Corrales observes: 'in our view, a regime applicable to foreign investments must leave open the possibility to resort to international arbitration, which today is accepted almost everywhere, by means of the mechanism provided for in the [ICSID] Convention,...'246 It can readily be accepted that Article 22 does indeed leave open such a possibility. But this statement is ambiguous on the issue that the Tribunal must decide, namely whether Article 22 constitutes an open offer by the Venezuelan State to international investors to resort to ICSID arbitration.\n\nReply [59],\n\nEx. C-155 dated 30 April 1999.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent's submissions on historical context do not relate directly to the framing of the Investment Law. Rather, they concern earlier periods in the history of Venezuela or other acts of the President of Venezuela taken in relation to other legislation. Both parties accept, however, that the Investment Law was lawfully promulgated by President Chavez, and indeed remains in force. The title of the law is 'Decree with status and force of law for the promotion and protection of investments.' Article 1 provides:\n\nThis Decree-Law is intended to provide investments and investors, both domestic and foreign, with a stable and foreseeable legal framework in which they may operate in an environment of security, through the regulation of the State's action toward such investments and investors, with a view toward achieving the increase, diversification and harmonious integration of investments in favor of the domestic development objectives.247\n\nEx. C-9; Ex. EU-1. The translation given is the Claimants', but there are no material differences.\n\n123.\n\nTo the extent that it is alleged that Venezuela maintained a policy against arbitration of investment disputes at the relevant time, the Tribunal notes that, in addition to Article 22 itself, the Investment Law provides in Article 23 for a right on the part of any investor to resort to Venezuelan arbitral tribunals for the resolution of disputes relating to the application of the Investment Law.\n\n124.\n\nMoreover, Venezuela had signed the ICSID Convention on 18 August 1993. The Venezuelan Parliament had passed the necessary enabling legislation on 10 August 1994.248 Venezuela deposited its instrument of ratification on 2 May 1995. The Convention had entered into force for Venezuela on 1 June 1995.249 As at 1999, Venezuela had entered into at least 15 bilateral investment treaties providing for international arbitration of investor-state disputes,250 including the Barbados BIT which was signed on 15 July 1994 and entered into force on 31 October 1995. In the light of these international acts, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that, as at 1999, Venezuela maintained a fixed policy hostile to the international arbitration of investment disputes with the Republic which might shed relevant light on the interpretation of Article 22.\n\nEx. C-123.\n\nVenezuela denounced the Convention on 24 January 2012. The denunciation took effect on 25 July 2012. In accordance with Art 72 of the Convention, such notice does not affect the obligations of a Contracting State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by it before such notice was received by the depositary.\n\nEx. C-125.\n\n*(e) Submission if the respective treaty so establishes/provides*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nFor present purposes, however, the critical question before the Tribunal is to establish the meaning in the context of Article 22 of the condition applicable to all three of the treaty cases contemplated therein that such dispute 'shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so establishes/provides.'\n\n126.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, part of the apparent difficulty with this condition is the linguistic tension between the use of the mandatory direction 'shall be submitted to international arbitration' which is then immediately qualified by the phrase 'if it so establishes/provides.' Yet, in the context of the role that Article 22 plays within Chapter IV as a whole, this structure of direction and qualification makes sense.\n\n127.\n\nCompendiously, Article 22 is designed to ensure that provision is made for the option of dispute resolution by way of international arbitration in cases in which Venezuela has assumed a treaty obligation under international law so to provide. It follows, therefore, that the provision for international arbitration contemplated by Article 22 must be one that accords with the terms of the relevant treaty, since Article 22 makes no provision for international arbitration save to the extent that the relevant treaty makes such provision. In other words, Article 22 refers to and respects the terms of Venezuela's international obligations to submit disputes to international arbitration, but does not do more.\n\n128.\n\nIn the First case, this qualification is necessary because the category of treaties contemplated by the First case is heterogeneous and not uniform. Each investment treaty contains its own unique terms, including as to investor-state dispute settlement. Indeed, the examples adduced by the Claimants of Venezuelan bilateral investment treaties show numerous different forms of dispute settlement provisions.251 Nor is it necessary that an investment treaty, which protects investments made by investors of one state in the other state, makes provision for the resolution of disputes between investors and states by way of international arbitration at all. Such a treaty may validly engage the responsibility of the state to afford protection to foreign investors, but provide only for inter-state dispute resolution; or it may provide only for resolution by municipal courts. Alternatively, it may provide for investor-state arbitration, but only for a class of claims that is more limited *ratione materiae* than the total corpus of substantive rights vouchsafed under the treaty. All of these are solutions that may be found in contemporary investment treaty practice.\n\nEx. C-125.\n\n129.\n\nBy adding the qualification presently under discussion, the Venezuelan legislator made it plain in its framework legislation on investment protection that all of these options remained open to the Venezuelan state. Thus, in the First case, the international investor would only have the right to resort to international arbitration if and to the extent that the relevant treaty provided for it and not otherwise.\n\n130.\n\nIn the Second case, the legislator denoted no more and no less than the standing mandatory consent to arbitration of disputes between the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the member states expressly contained in the MIGA Convention itself, to which Venezuela is a party.252\n\nArt. 57 and Annex II MIGA Convention.\n\n131.\n\nWhat, then, of the Third case, namely the reference to the ICSID Convention, on which the Claimants rely in the present proceedings? In the Third case, the legislator is concerned with one treaty only, namely the ICSID Convention, to which a majority of the world's states are party.253 But the terms of the ICSID Convention provide that the submission of a dispute under it to international arbitration is subject to the requirements of Article 25. As earlier stated, a fundamental tenet of the ICSID Convention is that 'no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration.'254\n\nAs at 1999, 130 states (including Venezuela) had deposited instruments of ratification. As at July 2012, 158 had signed it and 147 (excluding Venezuela) had deposited instruments of ratification and had not denounced the Convention.\n\nPreamble ICSID Convention.\n\n132.\n\nThus, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the subject-matter of the phrase 'if it so establishes/provides' is 'submitted to international arbitration' with the consequence that 'the condition means, quote: If the ICSID Convention establishes submission to international arbitration.'255 But the Tribunal does not accept the gloss added to this by Claimants that the reference to international arbitration denotes international arbitration as a *means* of dispute settlement.256 Rather, in the Tribunal's view, all of Article 22 is concerned with cases where, by operation of the relevant treaty, there is, for the purpose of the dispute itself, a consent to submission to international arbitration. In the case of the ICSID Convention, that can only be achieved if and to the extent that the requirements of Article 25, including consent of both parties, are met. Otherwise, that fundamental requirement of the Convention would be subverted, which would not accord with the express terms of Article 22 of the Investment Law, which requires that the submission be 'according to the terms of the respective treaty.'\n\nT1/163/22-164/2.\n\nT1/164/3-4.\n\n133.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the argument that Article 22 itself supplies consent is circular, since the condition stated in Article 22 expressly refers to the respective treaty - here the ICSID Convention - for determination of whether it establishes or provides for a submission to international arbitration. Article 22 itself adds nothing further as to this question, which must be resolved according to the international treaty obligations assumed by Venezuela.\n\n*(f) Application of the principle of effectiveness*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nNow, Claimants argue that such an interpretation is contrary to the principle of *effet utile* because it would serve to empty this Third case contemplated by Article 22 of any useful effect. The Tribunal agrees that, in interpreting an instrument of consent for the purpose of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, applying the principle of good faith, it should strive to avoid an interpretation that either (i) leads to an impossibility or absurdity or (ii) empties the provision of the legal effect intended by the state.\n\n135.\n\nBut the Tribunal does not regard an interpretation of the Third case in Article 22 which requires the terms of the ICSID Convention itself to be met before a dispute may be submitted to arbitration under the Convention to have either of these consequences. Of course, as the Directors of the World Bank envisaged, a host state might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit investment disputes to the jurisdiction of the Centre. But that is not the only means by which a state may give its consent in writing. As the Convention's framers pointed out: '[c]onsent may be given, for example, in a clause included in an investment agreement, providing for the submission to the Centre of future disputes arising out of that agreement, or in a *compromis* regarding a dispute which has already arisen.'257 At the time that the Convention was developed, one of its most important objectives was to ensure that 'arbitration agreements voluntarily entered into would be implemented.'258 In such a case, the parties' written consent is embodied in a contract, but its effect on the plane of international law is to engage the operation of the ICSID Convention as the procedural regime under which their dispute is to be resolved by binding international arbitration. Consent in writing established in this way provides a sphere of operation for a submission to arbitration under the Third case in Article 22 that is independent of either of the other cases. Such a submission is established/provided for under the ICSID Convention. It operates according to the terms of that Convention.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention [24],\n\nBroches (1972) 136 Recueil des Cours 331, 345.\n\n136.\n\nIn addition to the instrument of consent, the Convention imposes other jurisdictional constraints on the operation of the parties' consent, such as the requirement that the dispute arise 'directly out of an investment' together with the nationality requirements of Article 25. Moreover, the manner in which the parties' consent operates to submit the dispute to international arbitration is prescribed in detail under the provisions of Chapter IV of the Convention, which, as is well-known, provides terms that are very different from those that apply to other forms of international arbitration.\n\n137.\n\nIf the Claimants' construction of Article 22 were adopted, it would have the consequence that all investment disputes with Venezuela involving nationals of any of the (currently) 147 states parties to the ICSID Convention would be, without more, subject to the jurisdiction of the Centre. In the Tribunal's view, such a construction would require clearer words in the Investment Law indicating the intention of Venezuela to give such general standing consent. Such words are not to be found in the text of Article 22. On the contrary, a good faith interpretation of Article 22 in the light of the context of other elements of the Investment Law applicable to the resolution of disputes involving international investors negates such an intention.\n\n138.\n\nIf such a construction were adopted, it would create a significant overlap with the First case in Article 22, greatly reducing the purpose of that clause. Most of the bilateral investment treaties entered into by Venezuela with foreign states prior to 1999 themselves made provision for investor-state arbitration of disputes under those treaties within the framework of the ICSID Convention. If all disputes with investors of states parties to the ICSID Convention were to be treated as submitted to ICSID jurisdiction under the Third case, there would be much less purpose to be served by the First case, whose operation would be confined to choices of non-ICSID international arbitration, where permitted under the relevant bilateral treaty or, in rare cases, required because the other state is not a party to the ICSID Convention.\n\n139.\n\nThe approach submitted by the Claimants would also have wide-ranging implications for the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of an ICSID arbitral tribunal and the applicable law. Article 22 is not stated to be concerned solely with disputes under the Investment Law, but rather refers generally to disputes arising under treaties. In the First case - a bilateral investment treaty -the scope of claims and the applicable law will be determined by the terms of the treaty itself. The same is true of the Second case - the MIGA Convention. In both of these cases, 'the terms of the respective treaty' will dictate the scope of the claims that may be submitted to international arbitration. Those will be claims arising under international law.\n\n140.\n\nIn the Third case - the ICSID Convention - the treaty itself supplies no substantive causes of action. Its choice of law clause, Article 42(1), refers to the 'rules of law as may be agreed between the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.' The ICSID Convention, including Article 42(1), would operate naturally in the event that the Third case is construed so as to require consent of the state by separate instrument. In the case of consent by arbitration agreement, the contract itself would supply the scope of the cause of action, to be determined according to its applicable law. In the case of consent to ICSID jurisdiction by bilateral investment treaty, the treaty will supply the scope of the cause of action under international law. In both of those situations, the ICSID tribunal would be acting, as contemplated by Article 22, 'according to the terms' of the ICSID Convention. But if the Third case were to be interpreted as supplying consent for all disputes with international investors from states parties to the ICSID Convention, the scope of the causes of action submitted to international arbitration would not be clearly defined.259\n\nArt 22 may be contrasted with Art 23, which permits submission of disputes to Venezuelan courts or arbitral tribunals and does contain a limitation *ratione materiae* to the resolution of '[a]ny controversy that arises in relation with the application of this Decree-Law'.\n\n*(g) The Tribunal's conclusion on the first ground of jurisdiction*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nFor all of the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Article *22* (Third case) does not operate so as to give the consent in writing of Venezuela to submit all investment disputes with nationals of other ICSID Contracting States to the jurisdiction of the Centre. Accordingly, the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection must succeed. The claims of all Claimants, other than the Treaty Claimants, being based solely upon this first ground of jurisdiction, are not within the competence of the Centre and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and must therefore be dismissed.\n\n***C. Second ground of jurisdiction: Barbados BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Legal character of this jurisdictional issue*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe second basis upon which Claimants invoke the jurisdiction of the Centre, and thus of this Tribunal, is by virtue of the provisions of Article 8 of the Barbados BIT. This provides, in relevant part:\n\n(1) Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965.\n\n...\n\n(3) The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of obligations has caused damages to the national concerned, and if such is the case, the amount of compensation.\n\n(4) Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph I of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n143.\n\nClaimants accept that their claim under the Barbados BIT is limited to the Treaty Claimants (Tidewater Barbados and Tidewater Caribe). They further accept that the jurisdiction of the Centre under this head is limited to Venezuela's alleged violation of its obligations under the Treaty. Since Article 8(1) requires that there be a dispute 'between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party', Claimants accept that they 'could not have expected to obtain protection for pre-existing disputes; they expected to obtain prospective protection only against any actions in breach of the treaty the Respondent might take after the restructuring.'260\n\nTl/193/14-19.\n\n144.\n\nThere is no jurisdictional dispute between the parties as to the validity or terms of the BIT. Rather, the Respondent objects to this second basis for jurisdiction on the sole ground that, according to it, Tidewater restructured its business by incorporating Tidewater Barbados and placing Tidewater Caribe under its ownership in order to gain access to ICSID in respect of a dispute that was already in existence or, alternatively, anticipated and foreseeable. This, submits the Respondent, is an abuse of the Treaty, which may not validly supply the basis for jurisdiction of the Centre, in such circumstances.\n\n145.\n\nAt the heart, therefore, of this issue is a question of fact as to the nature of the dispute between the parties, and a question of timing as to when the dispute that is the subject of the present proceedings arose or could reasonably have been foreseen. Venezuela alleges that there was just one dispute between the parties that was already in existence well before Tidewater Barbados was incorporated, and accordingly the present claim falls outside the ambit of the protection of the Treaty. By contrast, the Claimants submit that the dispute which pre-dates the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados was between SEMARCA and PDVSA and solely concerned SEMARCA's arrears and whether SEMARCA would renew its contracts in light of those arrears. The Claimants say that the dispute arising out of the enactment of the Reserve Law is a different dispute with a different party and was unforeseen.\n\n146.\n\nIf the Claimants' contentions are found to be correct as a matter of fact, then, in the view of the Tribunal, no question of abuse of treaty can arise. On the other hand, if the Respondent's submissions on the course of events are correct, then there may be a real question of abuse of treaty. The distinction was well summarised by the tribunal in Mobil v Venezuela\u00a0when it commented:\n\nAs stated by the Claimants, the aim of the restructuring of their investments in Venezuela through a Dutch holding was to protect those investments against breaches of their rights by the Venezuelan authorities by gaining access to ICSID arbitration through the BIT. The Tribunal considers that this was a perfectly legitimate goal as far as it concerned future disputes.\n\nWith respect to pre-existing disputes, the situation is different and the Tribunal considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain jurisdiction under a BIT for such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the Phoenix Tribunal, \"an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs.[\"]261\n\n*Mobil v Venezuela* [204]-[205], citing *Phoenix v Czech Republic* [144],\n\n147.\n\nSince '[u]nder general international law as well as under ICSID case law, abuse of right is to be determined in each case, taking into account all the circumstances of the case',262 it is necessary for the Tribunal to carefully analyse the events of 2008 and 2009 in order to determine the nature of any disputes, the parties to them and when they arose or were reasonably in contemplation.\n\nIbid [177].\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal does this in order to evaluate each of the possibilities addressed by the parties in their submissions:\n\n(1) *Existing dispute:* That the parties were already in a dispute concerning the same subject-matter prior to the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados and the transfer to it of the Venezuelan business on 9 March 2009, such that the dispute which is the subject of the present proceedings had already arisen; or alternatively, even if that were not the case,\n\n(2) *Foreseeable dispute:* That the existence of the present dispute was within the reasonable contemplation of Tidewater at that time.\n\n149.\n\nFor the purpose of considering the first possibility, the Tribunal proposes to adopt the test set forth by the tribunal in *Lucchetti v Peru* that:\n\n[T]he critical element in determining the existence of one or two separate disputes is whether or not they concern the same subject matter. The Tribunal considers that, whether the focus is on the 'real causes' of the dispute or on its 'subject-matter', it will in each instance have to determine whether or not the facts or considerations that gave rise to the earlier dispute continued to be central to the later dispute.263\n\n*Lucchetti v Peru* [50],\n\n150.\n\nIn evaluating the second possibility, the Tribunal will consider whether 'the objective purpose of the restructuring was to facilitate access to an investment treaty tribunal with respect to a claim that was within the reasonable contemplation of the investor'.264\n\nDouglas *The International Law of Investment Claims* (Cambridge UP, 2009) 465.\n\n151.\n\nThe parties cooperated to produce a core bundle of factual exhibits for the oral phase of the proceedings and supplemented this with careful submissions, which have greatly assisted the Tribunal. The following section describes the facts as the Tribunal finds them.\n\n2. *The Tribunal's findings of fact*\n------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Tidewater's marine support business in Venezuela*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nTidewater first established its operations on Lake Maracaibo in 1957, and as early as 1961 identified Venezuela's 'complex' political environment as particularly challenging. It did, however, operate in Venezuela from that date until 2009.265\n\nEx. C-100, 23 & 26.\n\n153.\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this Decision, the Claimants' operations in Venezuela were conducted through SEMARCA, a company incorporated in Venezuela. SEMARCA contracted with PDVSA, PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo and PetroSucre to provide marine support services in the Gulf of Paria and Lake Maracaibo. SEMARCA had no general concession contract with PDVSA or the other companies to which it provided services in Venezuela. Despite having been established and done business there for half a century, such business was conducted on a running account basis, with individual contracts entered into for each provision of services. Thus, for example, in July 2008, SEMARCA entered into a six-month contract with PDVSA for supply of marine services on Lake Maracaibo.266\n\nEx. C-21.\n\n*(b) Contractual dispute between SEMARCA and PDVSA*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nAccounts receivable owed to SEMARCA began to accrue in USD in June 2008 and in Bolivars in October 2008.267 Nevertheless, SEMARCA continued to execute new or renewed contracts in respect of its operations in Venezuela through 2008. Its contract for services on Lake Maracaibo was extended on 26 November 2008.268\n\nEx. C-25.\n\nEx. C-31.\n\n155.\n\nOn 17 December 2008, SEMARCA requested that Tidewater transfer to it funds which were necessary to maintain its ongoing operations. Similar requests were made again on 5 February, 11 March, 20 March, 27 March, 3 April and 17 April 2009.269\n\nEx. C-66-C-72.\n\n156.\n\nOn 16 January 2009, *El Universal* reported that PDVSA was struggling to pay its service suppliers but quoted its Director of Finance, Eudomario Carruyo, as saying that the arrears were 'an important amount, but manageable.'270\n\nEx. R-39.\n\n157.\n\nPDVSA Petr\u00f3leo and PetroSucre continued to make payments to SEMARCA from late 2008 until mid-2009,271 but these did not eliminate the arrears owing during that period. In summary, PDVSA paid approximately US$3 million in December 2008 and a further US$1 million on 6 March 2009. PetroSucre paid US$671,000 in December 2008, US$775,000 in February 2009, US$1,262,000 in April 2009 and a further approximately US$3 million in June 2009.\n\nEx. C-27.\n\n158.\n\nOn 27 January 2009, Ensco International shut down the Ensco 69 rig in the Gulf of Paria in response to a lack of payment of arrears, which were said to have been under negotiation since December 2008. PetroSucre's employees then assumed operational control of the rig under Ensco supervision, with PDVSA describing Ensco's decision to shut down the rig as an attempt to exert pressure and a breach of Ensco's contract, which required that 30 days' notice be given before a party could validly cancel for breach.272 PetroSucre's actions were described by *Forbes* on 30 January 2009 as the 'natural progression' of asset nationalisation in Venezuela.273 Subsequently, in May 2009, Ensco gave formal notice of PetroSucre's breach of contract,274 and on 6 June 2009 terminated the contract.275\n\nEx.

Mr Kehoe said:\n\nUnfortunately, Semarca is at its limit for the financial conditions [necessary] to maintain continuous operations and the Tidewater Board of Directors does not want to send additional money from abroad to support operations while not receiving any payment for our invoices.284\n\n(b) On 18 February 2009, Ms Rosalyn Sierra (Administrator of Aquatic Operations Contracts) forwarded a formal request from Mr Omar Vargas of PDVSA for an extension of 92 days on Contract 4627.285\n\n(c) The same day, Mr Jacob replied that SEMARCA was:\n\n... pleased that PDVSA wishes to extend the contract for the Boats.\n\nSemarca exists to serve needs of PDVSA's vessels, however we cannot commit to any extension of the contract without arriving at an agreement regarding the payments.\n\nWe are not asking for an increase in the fees, only that we receive payment for the services that have been provided and that we continue to provide.\n\nAfter this month, we do not have enough capital to keep maintaining our vessels in good conditions and in safe conditions for our crew.\n\nWe find ourselves in a point where, without additional funds, we will have to place the vessels in the dock, one by one. We cannot in good conscience assume a new contractual obligation that we cannot perform with the quality we are used to providing to PDVSA.286\n\n(d) On 19 February 2009, Mr Jacob again emailed Ms Sierra. He said that he was 'very worried concerning situation with the boats' contract' and that with only four days before the expiration of the contract it was still unclear whether PDVSA would extend it.287 On 19 February 2009, Mr Jacob elaborated on Mr Kehoe's email. He said:\n\nPDVSA owes Semarca an excessive amount of money, by our standards, and nevertheless [we] continue providing services to PDVSA and have not halted operations due to lack of payment.\n\n...\n\nWe are reaching the point where we do not have enough capital to continue maintaining our vessels in good and secure condition for our crew. We cannot in conscience have a contractual obligation that we cannot fulfill with the high quality that we have come to give PDVSA....\n\nUnfortunately, in order to continue, we must receive payments.\n\n...\n\nAll that we ask is that payment be made for services already provided, and that continue to be provided, to PDVSA.\n\nIn the end, this situation of lack of payment is not sustainable and we are close to our breaking point.288\n\n(e) On 24 February 2009, Mr del Pino replied to Mr Jacob's 19 February email that '[t]his week [PDVSA] will begin to regularize payments.'289\n\n(f) On 28 February 2009, Mr Jacob formally refused Mr Vargas' request for an extension of the contract. He explained that PDVSA had 'changed the basis' of the contract when it had opted to pay crews directly, noted that the arrears remained unpaid, and continued:\n\nIt is a fact that, without an immediate payment by PDVSA, we will not be able to maintain our vessels fit for the work, however, in reality, out [of] a sense of responsibility to the crew and to PDVSA, and with optimism that the payment situation will be soon normalized, we will not turn off the operations \\yet [sic].\n\nIn view of the situation, instead of a direct 3 month extension, we propose a 15 day extension, starting March 1st, to March 15th, 2009.\n\nAt the end of this period, of course, we expect the situation regarding the payments to be, at least, solved, and that this new form of administrating the payrolls and benefits of the crew has ended.\n\nIt is only in this manner that we can accept a long term extension.290\n\nEx.

He went on to say that PDVSA was in the process of 'revising all [of its] cost and expense structures' and that although 94% of service suppliers would be paid in full, there were 56 large contractors who would not be paid in full. Mr Ramirez noted that the amount of debt that PDVSA would pay those contractors 'depends on negotiations.'304\n\nEx. R-43.\n\n168.\n\nAs noted above, in March and April 2009, Tidewater continued to send money to Venezuela and pursue contracts with Repsol and Chevron.

C-32.\n\n170.\n\nOn 30 April 2009, Mr Jacob again wrote to PDVSA and said:\n\n... We also have not received any payment of the invoices that remain outstanding, which would have helped to mitigate the enormous difficulties that our company has been facing to continue providing services to PDVSA.\n\nTherefore, we sadly need to inform you that our situation has worsened, and it has already reached its turning point. This is so because our parent company has informed us that it may not continue funding local operations from abroad. Therefore, we hereby inform you that our company will not extend the contracts in reference beyond May 31, 2009, date on which the last mutually agreed extension expires. This decision may only be changed by the senior management of our group of companies if we receive payments for the invoices that remain outstanding and if all other legal formalities for a contract extension are executed and fulfilled.\n\n...\n\nAs we have stated on several occasions, our company wishes to continue providing services to PDVSA, but, to do so, it must receive payments for the services already provided, as per the contractually agreed terms.308\n\nEx.

It was approved by the President and Cabinet309 and transmitted to Parliament310 on that day. It received its 'First Discussion' in Parliament the following day and its 'Second Discussion' on 7 May 2009, and was enacted on that day.311\n\nEx. C-35.\n\nEx. C-36.\n\nEx.

(PDVSA) and its subsidiaries, and that were outsourced to third parties, being essential for the development of its activities. The assets and services to which this article refers to are:\n\n...\n\n3. Those related to the activities in Lake Maracaibo: vessels for the transport of personnel, divers and maintenance; supply vessels with cranes for the transport of materials, diesel, industrial water and other materials; tugs; deck barges; buoy barges, sludge cranes, laying cranes for the placement or replacement of sub-aquatic pipelines and cables; of maintenance of vessels in workshops, piers or docks of any nature.\n\n...\n\nArticle 4.

He stated that the Reserve Law was enacted in response to contractors refusing to lower their rates by at least 40% to continue operating in the country. He explained that it was unacceptable to have 'a fundamental part of the process for oil production... in the hands of a third party that said: If you don't pay me the amount I demand, I will leave with my motor boats and barges and you figure out how you produce oil.' Minister Ramirez denied that 'PDVSA took over those companies because of the debts' owed. He said that 'we are in a process of revision. Many of those debts need revision both in terms of the rates as well as the contracts.'318 The following day, Minister Ramirez encouraged service suppliers to 'stay in talks... under the certainty that we will always pay our debts.'319\n\nEx.

Legal consequences of factual findings*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal now considers the consequences of these factual findings under three headings:\n\n(a) Claimants' submission as to the alleged tax rationale for the transfer of Tidewater's Venezuelan business to Tidewater Barbados;\n\n(b) Respondent's submission alleging a pre-existing dispute over the continuity of service provided by SEMARCA to PDVSA;325 and,\n\n(c) Respondent's alternative submission that the present dispute was reasonably in contemplation before the reorganisation in March 2009.\n\nTl/75/5-11.\n\n*(a) Relevance of tax rationale*\n--------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimants developed the argument in their submissions, by reference to the witness evidence of Mr Carr, which was subsequently supported by the expert report of Professor Steines, that the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados and the transfer to it of Tidewater's Venezuelan business was driven by advantages under US tax law. The Tribunal finds it unnecessary to make a finding as to whether the alleged tax advantages for Tidewater in fact motivated or explained the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados or the reorganisation of its Venezuelan business under the intermediate ownership of Tidewater Barbados. That is because, as Mr Carr very fairly accepts in his statement, the restructuring was motivated both by tax considerations and also by 'risk-mitigation perspectives.'326 Mr Carr points out that 'Tidewater was aware of nationalizations by the Venezuelan government in 2007 and 2008. We wanted to ensure that we had a structure that would mitigate any such risk, especially because Tidewater was planning to increase its exposure to Venezuela through capital expenditures on its Venezuelan fleet.'327 This being so, it suffices for the Tribunal to accept for present purposes that *one* of the two reasons for the reorganisation was a desire to protect Tidewater from the risk of expropriation by incorporation of an investment vehicle in a state having investment treaty arrangements with Venezuela.\n\nCarr Direct Testimony [9],\n\nIbid [10],\n\n184.\n\nAs already observed, it is a perfectly legitimate goal, and no abuse of an investment protection treaty regime, for an investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of future disputes with a host state in this way. But the same is not the case in relation to preexisting disputes between the specific investor and the state. Thus, the critical issue remains one of fact: was there such a pre-existing dispute? In the present case, it is plain from the chronology that there was a dispute between SEMARCA and PDVSA that pre-dates the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados in March 2009 and the transfer to it of Tidewater's Venezuelan business. Thus, the real question for this Tribunal is a narrower one, namely: is that dispute to be treated as part of the same dispute as the Claimants currently assert against the Respondent in these proceedings? Alternatively, was the present dispute reasonably to be anticipated by March 2009 when Tidewater Barbados acquired the Venezuelan investment?\n\n*(b) Pre-existing dispute as to continuity of service*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that there was a single ongoing dispute as to SEMARCA's obligations to provide continuity of service to PDVSA and that this dispute is inextricably linked to the subsequent decision of the Respondent to assume control over SEMARCA's operations in Venezuela.\n\n186.\n\nIn order to advance this argument, the Respondent begins by alleging that SEMARCA was subject to the obligations set out in the Decree Law of Hydrocarbons of 2001328 including the obligation in Article 19 to perform its activities in a continuous way. Claimants submit that this Law had no application to their support services, since the essential obligation of the 2001 Law was to reserve certain primary oil activities to the state, but this was not done in relation to services related to such activities, such as the provision of transport vessels of the kind operated by SEMARCA until the Decree of 7 May 2009.\n\nEx. RL-6.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees. It finds that the Claimants were under no obligation as a matter of Venezuelan law to afford continuity of service. It does so not simply as a matter of a formal reading of the two pieces of legislation. The record of the parties' dealings in 2008-9 set out above demonstrates that both parties knew and accepted that they were doing business simply on the basis of short-term contracts, each of which was negotiated between them on an ordinary commercial basis. Thus, at the relevant time in relation to Lake Maracaibo, the Claimants' obligations to provide services and the Respondent's corresponding obligation to pay for them were set out in their contract dated 31 July 2008.329 This was subsequently the subject of negotiations for an extension, at the request of the Lakes District Procurement Division of PDVSA, in a meeting with SEMARCA on 26 November 2008, which records detailed discussions as to the nature of the services to be provided and the accounts between the two contracting parties.330\n\nEx. C-21.\n\nEx. C-31.\n\n188.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants at no time in fact withheld provision of their services. To be sure, they did write to PDVSA on several occasions in early 2009 indicating that they would have to do so, if SEMARCA did not receive payment on its outstanding invoices. The Tribunal regards this as no more than ordinary commercial pressure by the party performing services under a contract in order to encourage the counter-party to make the contractually-agreed payments for those services under the contract. When on 30 April 2009, Mr Jacob of SEMARCA wrote to PDVSA, he stated:\n\n[O]ur company will not extend the contracts in reference beyond May 31, 2009, date on which the last mutually agreed extension expires. This decision may only be changed by the senior management of our group of companies if we receive payments for the invoices that remain outstanding and if all other legal formalities for a contract extension are executed and fulfilled.\n\n...\n\nAs we have stated on several occasions, our company wishes to continue providing services to PDVSA, but, to do so, it must receive payments for the services already provided, as per the contractually agreed terms.331\n\nThe Tribunal interprets this as a confirmation on the part of SEMARCA that the parties were acting according to mutually agreed defined-term contractual obligations.\n\nEx. C-40 (emphasis in original).\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the Respondent's conduct over the same period also to be consistent with the limited contractual nature of the parties' mutual obligations. Thus, both PDVSA and PetroSucre continued to make partial payments to SEMARCA for its services from late 2008 until mid-2009. When on 31 January 2009, PDVSA made direct payment of wages to SEMARCA workers on Lake Maracaibo, it sought a credit note from SEMARCA under the contract for the sums paid.332 PDVSA was certainly seeking to negotiate with SEMARCA a reduction in the amounts outstanding. But at the same time, PDVSA was seeking extensions to their contracts with SEMARCA,333 and promising to regularise payments.334 As late as 4 June 2009, PetroSucre requested a three-month extension of a contract with SEMARCA for services in the Gulf of Paria.335\n\nEx. C-29, R-49.\n\nEx. R-47.\n\nEx. C-25.\n\nEx. C-98.\n\n190.\n\nThis being so, the Tribunal is unable to regard the dispute between SEMARCA and PDVSA as anything other than an ordinary commercial dispute between a supplier of services and its counterpart for recovery of sums due and owing for the services rendered. Both parties recognised that SEMARCA had no obligation to continue to supply services beyond the end of any contractually-agreed period, and SEMARCA's position was that it would not renew its contracts unless the arrears were settled.\n\n191.\n\nMoreover, the stated position of the Respondent at the time was that the disputes with suppliers over payments were not the reason for the enactment of the Reserve Law on 7 May 2009. Minister Ramirez is reported on 8 June 2009 as denying that 'PDVSA took over those companies because of the debts' owed. He said that 'we are in a process of revision. Many of those debts need revision both in terms of the rates as well as the contracts.'336 The following day, Minister Ramirez encouraged service suppliers to 'stay in talks... under the certainty that we will always pay our debts.'337 Under the Reserve Law, the assets of some 39 service providers were seized.338 The measure was not simply limited to SEMARCA.\n\nEx. R-41.\n\nEx. C-97.\n\nEx. C-13.\n\n192.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's submission that it should treat the payment dispute between SEMARCA and PDVSA as part of the same dispute as the Treaty Claimants' claims against the Republic of Venezuela in the present arbitration.\n\n*(c) Foreseeability of expropriation dispute ?*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nHowever, that still leaves open the alternative possibility that a dispute between the Claimants and the Republic in relation to the expropriation of the Claimants' assets in Venezuela was reasonably foreseeable in March 2009 when Tidewater Barbados was incorporated and the Claimants' Venezuelan business transferred to it.\n\n194.\n\nClaimants commenced their restructuring in December 2008. At least one of the reasons for this is accepted to be a desire to protect themselves against the risk of nationalisation. But was there a reasonable prospect, either then or in March 2009 when the restructuring was consummated, that such a nationalisation was imminent? On the evidence before it, the Tribunal does not so find. Tidewater had been in the business of supplying transportation vessels to the oil industry in Venezuela for 50 years by early 2009 and had continued to trade throughout many changes of government and government policies. Its actions in late 2008 and 2009 were consistent with such an approach. It continued to invest funds in its Venezuelan business. It submitted bids for new business with other oil companies operating in Venezuela, as well as negotiating for extensions to its contracts with PDVSA and PetroSucre - the latter even after the expropriation of its Lake Maracaibo business.\n\n195.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal does not find that the Respondent's actions gave rise to a reasonably foreseeable expropriation of the Claimants' business. Although an oil rig belonging to an unrelated company was seized in January 2009, this post-dated the Claimants' decision to restructure their holdings. In any event, PDVSA's actions vis-\u00e0-vis SEMARCA at the same time were consistent with a continuing will to trade. Although Minister Ramirez had stated in March 2009 that 'the Executive will not permit the oil industry to be paralyzed' or 'any one service supplier [to] paralyze industry activities', he went on to say that PDVSA was in the process of 'revising all [of its] cost and expense structures' and that although 94% of service suppliers would be paid in full, there were 56 large contractors who would not be paid in full. Mr Ramirez noted that the amount of debt that PDVSA would pay those contractors 'depends on negotiations.'339 This is language consistent with a negotiated contractual solution and not with expropriation.\n\nEx. R-43\n\n196.\n\nThe Reserve Law itself was introduced without warning and passed into law over just three days from 4-7 May 2009, with the seizure of the Claimants' assets taking effect the following day.\n\n*(d) The Tribunal's conclusion on the second ground of jurisdiction*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the acts of expropriation that give rise to the present dispute were not reasonably foreseeable by the Claimants either in December 2008 when they began restructuring, or in March 2009 when the restructuring took effect.\n\n198.\n\nIn the result, therefore, the claims of Tidewater Barbados insofar as they relate to causes of action that arose after its acquisition of the shares of Tidewater Caribe are subject to ICSID jurisdiction, Venezuela having given its consent by virtue of Article 8 of the Barbados BIT, and there having been no abuse of that Treaty by the Claimants of a kind that could render inadmissible their invocation of such jurisdiction.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n199.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal hereby decides that:\n\n(1) It has no jurisdiction over the claims of the Claimants by virtue of Article 22 of the Venezuelan Investment Law of 1999;\n\n(2) It has jurisdiction over the claims of Tidewater Barbados and Tidewater Caribe pursuant to Article 8 of the Barbados BIT to the extent that such claims concern alleged breaches of the obligations of the Respondent under that Treaty arising after 9 March 2009;\n\n(3) Accordingly, Respondent's objection to jurisdiction is admitted to the extent set out in paragraph (1) above and overruled to the extent set out in paragraph (2) above;\n\n(4) These proceedings shall therefore proceed only in respect of claims specified under paragraph (2) above;\n\n(5) The Treaty Claimants shall have 21 days from the date of delivery of this Decision on Jurisdiction to file an amended copy of their Request for Arbitration indicating those claims that are pursued and those claims that are not pursued in these proceedings in light of the Tribunal's Decision;\n\n(6) The Tribunal shall fix by Procedural Order, after consultation with the parties, a revised timetable for further pleadings on the merits on the revised Request pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4).\n\n(7) All costs of and occasioned by the hearing of this objection to jurisdiction shall be reserved."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2015-03-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GLOSSARY OF DEFINED TERMS** | |\n| **Astivenca** | Astilleros de Venezuela, C.A. |\n| **Barbados BIT** | Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (signed 15 July 1994, entered into force 31 October 1995) 1984 UNTS 181 (Ex C-10) |\n| **Brailovsky/** **Flores 1/2** | First Expert Report on Valuation prepared by Vladimir Brailovsky & Daniel Flores (24 October 2013) and Second Report (24 April 2014) |\n| **Brailovsky** **Presentation 1** | Valuation Approach, Discount Rate and Pre-Award Interest Presentation (10 June 2014) |\n| **Claimants or Tidewater** | Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. |\n| **Corocoro Contract** | Contract CO-067 (Ex C-22) |\n| **Card\u00f3n Contract** | Ex C-86. |\n| **CVP** | Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo SA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA |\n| **Figuera 1/2** | Direct Testimony of Rub\u00e9n Figuera (24 October 2013) and Second Direct Testimony (24 April 2014) |\n| **Flores Presentation 1** | PowerPoint Presentation accompanying direct testimony of Dr. Flores (11 June 2014) |\n| **Brailovsky/Flores Answers to Questions** | PowerPoint Presentation: Respondent's Experts' Answers to Tribunal's Questions (12 June 2014) |\n| **Gulmar Offshore** | Gulmar Offshore Middle East L.L.C. |\n| **Investment Law** | Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments *(Ley sobre Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de Inversiones),* dated 3 October 1999 (as published in the Official Gazette No. 5,390 of 22 October 1999) |\n| **Kehoe 1/2** | Direct Testimony of Gerard P.

INTRODUCTION**\n------------------\n\n**A Request for Arbitration**\n-----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 16 February 2010, Tidewater Inc., Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater Caribe, C.A., Twenty Grand Offshore, L.L.C., Point Marine, L.L.C., Twenty Grand Marine Service, L.L.C., Jackson Marine, L.L.C. and Zapata Gulf Marine Operators, LLC. filed a Request for Arbitration under the ICSID Convention against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela **(Venezuela** or **Respondent).**\n\n2.\n\nOn 8 February 2013, the Tribunal delivered its **Decision on Jurisdiction** In which It held that It has jurisdiction only in respect of the claims made by Tidewater Investment SRL **(First Claimant)** and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. **(Second Claimant)** (together **Tidewater** or **Claimants)** pursuant to Article 8 of the Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments 1994 **(Barbados BIT).** In light of that Decision, Claimants filed an Amended Request for Arbitration **(Request)** on 1 March 2013.\n\n3.\n\nThe dispute concerns the Claimants' investment in marine support services to the oil industry In Venezuela. The factual background to the dispute Is summarised in Part I C below.\n\n**B Procedural history**\n------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe procedural history of this arbitration until the Decision on Jurisdiction is reviewed in that Decision.\n\n5.\n\nOn 7 June 2003, the Tribunal adopted, with the Parties' consent, a procedural schedule for the remaining steps in the arbitration.\n\n6.\n\nThe Parties then exchanged the following pleadings on the merits:\n\na) On 29 July 2013, the Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits, together with a witness statement of Mr. Gerald P. Kehoe (Vice President and then Senior Vice President of Tidewater, Inc. during the relevant period) and an expert report by Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek (of Navigant Consulting, Inc).\n\nb) On 25 October 2013, the Respondent submitted Its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, together with a witness Statement of Mr. Rub\u00e9n Figuera (former General Manager of Offshore Mixed Companies at Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo, S.A. **(CVP),** a subsidiary of PDVSA), an expert report of Professor Louis T. Wells (Herbert F. Johnson Professor of International Management, Emeritus at Harvard Business School) and an expert report of Mr. Vladimir Brailovsky and Dr. Daniel Flores (of Economia Aplicada, S.C. and Econ One Research, Inc respectively).\n\nc) On 25 January 2013, the Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits, together with a second witness Statement of Mr. Kehoe and a second expert report by Mr. Kaczmarek.\n\nd) On 25 April 2014, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits, with the second witness Statement of Mr. Figuera, the second expert report by Prof. Wells and the second expert report by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores.\n\n7.\n\nOn 8 November 2014, the Claimants advised the Tribunal of the Parties' agreement not to make requests for the production of documents to the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nOn 20 May 2014, following a request from the Tribunal, the Parties communicated the extent of their agreement as to the organisation of the hearing on the merits, including the hearing timetable and the order of witnesses.\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 May 2014, the Claimants sought leave to introduce into the record further exhibits C-250 to C-261. On 23 May 2014, the Respondent confirmed that it no longer objected to the admission of those documents.\n\n10.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal resolved the outstanding issues for the organisation of the hearing and communicated its decision on these issues to the Parties.\n\n11.\n\nThe hearing on the merits was held from 9 to 12 June 2014 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. Present at the hearing were:\n\nTribunal\n\nProfessor Campbell McLachlan QC (President)  \nDr. Andres Rigo Sureda   \nProfessor Brigitte Stern\n\nMr. Marco Tulio Montanes-Rumayor (Secretary)\n\nClaimants\n\n*Counsel (Covington & Burling)*Mr. Miguel Lopez Forastier   \nMr. Thomas (T.L.)

It has subsequently deliberated by various means.\n\n**C Factual background**\n------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Tidewater group was founded in 1956 to supply marine transportation services in the Gulf of Mexico.1 It first established operations in Venezuela in 1958, by the acquisition of the company now called Tidewater Marine Service, C.A. **(SEMARCA),** a company constituted under the laws of Venezuela.2 When the events that are the subject of this arbitration took place, Tidewater had been operating continuously in Venezuela since 1958.\n\nMemorial, [13],\n\nMemorial, [14],\n\n14.\n\nPrior to May 2009, the Second Claimant, Tidewater Caribe, C.A. **(Tidewater Caribe),** a company incorporated in Venezuela, owned SEMARCA. Following a corporate reorganisation on 9 March 2009, Tidewater Caribe was in turn owned by the First Claimant, Tidewater Investment SRL, a company incorporated in Barbados. Each of the claimant companies are part of the Tidewater group of companies, ultimately owned by Tidewater, Inc, a United States company.\n\n15.\n\nSEMARCA had its headquarters in the village of La Ca\u00f1ada, on the western shores of Lake Maracaibo. Tidewater Caribe owned the parcel of land used by SEMARCA for this purpose.3\n\nMemorial, [16], citing Ex C-190. The rest of the parcel was (and continues to be) leased to a third party: Memorial, [17],\n\n16.\n\nThe oil industry in Venezuela was nationalised in 1975. From that date onwards, Venezuela's national oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. **(PDVSA)** and its partially- or wholly-owned subsidiaries engaged private companies to provide support to the oil industry in the country. Those subsidiaries included three relevant to this case: Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo SA **(CVP),** PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo, S.A. **(PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo)** and PetroSucre, S.A. **(PetroSucre).**\n\n17.\n\nSEMARCA provided its maritime support services under contract to both PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo and PetroSucre.\n\n18.\n\nSEMARCA's operations were originally confined to Lake Maracaibo itself.\n\n19.\n\nFrom the late 1990s, SEMARCA expanded its operations to offshore locations, including in the Gulf of Paria off the northwest coast of Venezuela.\n\n20.\n\nDespite having operated in Venezuela for many years, SEMARCA did not have a general concession contract with PDVSA or its subsidiaries. Instead, it operated on a running account basis by means of short-term charter agreements: frequent contracts with a duration of several months that were periodically extended.4 It is common ground that at the time of the seizure of the Claimants' assets, SEMARCA was providing services in both Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Paria, under four short-term contracts:5\n\na) **Lake Maracaibo:** SEMARCA was providing maritime support services to PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo under two time-charter agreements: (i) the so-called **Tugs Contract** (Contract No. 8027); and (ii) the **Supply Vessels Contract** (Contract No. 4627).6\n\nb) **Offshore:** (i) SEMARCA had chartered four vessels to PetroSucre to support operations in the Corocoro Project in the western area of the Gulf of Paria (the **Corocoro Contract);7** and (ii) SEMARCA had a short-term agreement with Chevron Card\u00f3n III, S.A. for two vessels to support its operations in the Card\u00f3n III block of the Rafael Urdaneta Project north of Lake Maracaibo (the **Card\u00f3n Contract).8**\n\nAs noted in Decision on Jurisdiction, [153]; Memorial, [20], citing Kehoe 1, [15]-[16],\n\nMemorial, [25]-[29]; Counter-Memorial, [40],\n\nEx R-86 (Tugs Contract); Ex R-87 (Supply Vessels Contract).\n\nContract CO-067 (Ex C-22).\n\nEx C-86.\n\n21.\n\nThe Parties dispute the duration and status of those contracts at the date of the Reserve Law, a matter that the Tribunal addresses below.\n\n22.\n\nIn 2008-2009, world oil prices fell significantly. PDVSA struggled to meet its payment obligations to SEMARCA.9\n\nCounter-Memorial, [11],\n\n23.\n\nAs the Tribunal observed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, accounts receivable owed to SEMARCA began to accrue in June 2008.10 By May 31, 2009, Tidewater's Annual Report recorded that SEMARCA had accounts receivable of approximately USD $40 million.11\n\nSee Decision on Jurisdiction, [154]-[181], As noted below, the factual findings that were made by the Tribunal for the purpose of determining whether the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction were made out are not binding on the Tribunal when it comes to the determination of the Claimants' claims on the merits. Nevertheless, and subject to what follows in this Award, that summary describes the events leading up to the seizures that have given rise to the present arbitration.\n\nMemorial, [32], citing Ex C-207.43. This total was comprised of approximately $16m payable in USD and the equivalent of $24m payable in bol\u00edvares.\n\n24.\n\nOn 7 May 2009, the Government of Venezuela enacted the Organic Law that Reserves to the State the Assets and Services Related to Primary Activities of Hydrocarbons **(Reserve Law).12** The following day, 8 May 2009, the Ministry of Popular Power for Energy and Petroleum issued a resolution (Resolution No. 51) that identified the Claimants, along with 38 other service providers, as subject to the Reserve Law.13\n\n*Ley Org\u00e1nica que Reserva al Estado Bienes y Servicios Conexos a las Actividades Primarias de Hidrocarburos* (Ex RL-1).\n\nEx RL-7.\n\n25.\n\nThe same day SEMARCA's assets on Lake Maracaibo were seized, including its headquarters at La Ca\u00f1ada and 11 vessels.14 SEMARCA continued to provide services to PetroSucre in the Gulf of Paria following that seizure, but on 12 July 2009 the Claimants' four vessels serving the Corocoro Project in the Gulf of Paria were also seized.15 The Parties disagree on the scope of application of the Reserve Law, the extent of the seizures, and the extent of the Claimants' remaining assets and operations in Venezuela. The Tribunal returns to those issues in Part III of this Award.\n\nKehoe 1, [35] and Ex C-14; Counter-Memorial, [16],\n\nMemorial, [62]; Counter-Memorial, [16]\n\n**II THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nIn this section of the Award, the Tribunal summarises the Parties' respective submissions on the two issues which it is the Tribunal's task to resolve: first, the scope of Respondent's liability; and second, the proper quantum of compensation due to Claimants in the light of the Tribunal's findings as to liability.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal observes at the outset that Respondent accepts that the Reserve Law and the Government's associated administrative acts had the effect of expropriating property of value belonging to Claimants.16 Respondent also accepts that the Respondent is obliged to pay to Claimants compensation for those expropriations.17 As a consequence, the focus of the Parties' submissions was on the scope of Respondent's expropriation of Claimants' property, the lawfulness of the expropriation, and the proper quantum of compensation due as a consequence.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [49],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [161],\n\n**A Liability**\n---------------\n\n**1. Preliminary**\n------------------\n\n28.\n\nClaimants base their claim in this arbitration on the Barbados BIT. They observe that the law applicable to the substance of the claim is determined by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, and submit that the '\"rules of law... agreed by the Parties' pursuant to that provision are recorded in the Barbados BIT itself, supplemented by general principles of international law.\"18 They submit that Venezuelan law is relevant to the extent that it bears on the scope of Claimants' rights and Respondent's obligations; while Article 11 of the Barbados BIT incorporates by reference any principles of international law or Venezuelan law that are more favourable than those imposed by the Treaty, equally Venezuelan law cannot be applied to the extent that it is inconsistent with Respondent's international legal obligations.19\n\nMemorial, [71]-[72],\n\nMemorial, [73]-[74],\n\n29.\n\nRespondent does not take issue with these propositions.\n\n**2. The scope of the expropriation**\n-------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nClaimants say that the effect of the Reserve Law and the associated administrative acts was to directly expropriate valuable tangible assets belonging to Claimants, as well as to indirectly expropriate their shares in SEMARCA itself, thus depriving Claimants of a business with a 50-year history in Venezuela and a proven history of profitability. Respondent, by contrast, says that the expropriations deprived Claimants of nothing more than a piece of land at La Ca\u00f1ada (together with buildings and inventory), 15 vessels (which, as a consequence of the Decision on Jurisdiction, are beyond the competence of the Tribunal, being owned by Tidewater companies outside the scope of the Barbados BIT) and the short period remaining in the terms of two contracts with PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo.\n\n*(a) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n31.\n\nClaimants begin by noting that Article 5(1) of the Barbados BIT prohibits both *direct* and *indirect* expropriation. It defines the latter as State measures which 'interfere with property rights to such an extent that these rights are rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have been expropriated, even though the State does not purport to have expropriated them and the legal title to the property formally remains with the original owner.'20\n\nMemorial, [79], quoting *Vivendi v Argentina (Resubmission)* (Ex CL-138), [7.5.16],\n\n32.\n\nThus, Claimants submit that following the enactment of the Reserve Law on 7 May 2009, and the Ministerial designation of Claimants on 8 May 2009, Respondent's expropriation consisted of three elements:21\n\na) On 8 May 2009, direct expropriation of SEMARCA's headquarters, operations and assets on Lake Maracaibo, as well as certain real estate owned by the Second Claimant at La Ca\u00f1ada.\n\nb) On 12 July 2009, direct expropriation of Claimants' offshore assets and operations in the Gulf of Paria.\n\nc) As a consequence of all Respondent's acts, indirect expropriation of Claimants' rights and interests in SEMARCA, including their shareholding.\n\nMemorial, [80]-[81],\n\n33.\n\nClaimants note that Respondent concedes the first stage of expropriation.22 However, Claimants explain that the expropriation itself had wider effects on SEMARCA's other operations in the country, because its operations in the Gulf of Paria were deprived of access to dispatchers, mechanics or spare parts located in La Ca\u00f1ada.23\n\nReply, [75],\n\nMemorial, [61],\n\n34.\n\nAs to the second stage, Claimants reject Respondent's argument that because the Reserve Law only applied by its terms to Lake Maracaibo, Claimants were (and remain) free to operate offshore. They note that, on 12 July 2009, Respondent seized four vessels operating offshore in support of the Corocoro Project, that this had the effect of terminating the Corocoro contract which was still on foot,24 and that this seizure was undertaken pursuant to the Reserve Law. They also rely on the Tribunal's finding in the Decision on Jurisdiction that on 12 July 2009 'the Claimants' remaining assets and operations in Venezuela were expropriated.'25 The inference that Claimants would have the Tribunal draw is that they did not remain free to operate offshore.\n\nReply, [48], The Claimants say that PetroSucre's 3 July 2009 letter (Ex C-101) had the effect of renewing the contract for three months.\n\nReply [43]-[50] & [76]-[77], quoting Decision on Jurisdiction, [181],\n\n35.\n\nAs to the third stage, Claimants say that Respondent's implementation of the Reserve Law deprived the Second Claimant of control over SEMARCA, as demonstrated by: (i) multiple Venezuelan court decisions which recognise that SEMARCA has become part of, or is represented by, PDVSA; (ii) the fact that the Second Claimant was barred from registering documents for SEMARCA in the Commercial Registry; (iii) letters from SEMARCA's officers to the Respondent explaining that they had been effectively removed from office; and (iv) integration of SEMARCA into the PDVSA business.26\n\nReply, [50]-[55], [81],\n\n36.\n\nClaimants further submit that Respondent's acts have rendered the shares in SEMARCA worthless (and that they do not enjoy the benefit of the accounts receivable because they have lost control over the company).27\n\nReply, [82]-[84].\n\n37.\n\nClaimants say that Respondent's argument that they could not have suffered indirect expropriation because Claimants lacked proprietary rights capable of expropriation is a red herring: their shares in SEMARCA were undoubtedly a proprietary right and they have been deprived of the benefit of that right. It is not necessary that Claimants identify any long-term contractual rights beyond that investment to make out a case of indirect expropriation.28\n\nReply, [85]-[89],\n\n*(b) Respondent's submissions*\n------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants have confused expropriation by a State with reservation of an area of activity within its borders.29 It says that all that was expropriated were the vessels, the tangible assets at La Ca\u00f1ada, and the short periods remaining on the two Lake Maracaibo contracts.30\n\nCounter-Memorial, [18],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [16], [49],\n\n39.\n\nAs to the contracts, Respondent says that the Reserve Law only expropriated a short period remaining on two contracts (the Towing Contract and Supply Vessels Contract), each of which had only 24 days left to run and no right of renewal. Respondent says that because the Reserve Law only applied to Lake Maracaibo, the offshore contracts were not expropriated and expired according to their terms: the Corocoro Contract expired on 30 June 2009 (52 days after the enactment of the Reserve Law) because renewal terms were not agreed;31 and the Card\u00f3n Contract expired on 23 May 2009 but continued until 12 June 2009, 35 days after the enactment of the Law (after which Chevron chose not to extend it because the project was not commercial).32\n\nRejoinder, [33]-[43],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [42]-[45]; Rejoinder, [19], [47]-[55],\n\n40.\n\nRespondent also says that the limited scope of the Reserve Law left the company free to operate elsewhere in Venezuela, and that this is demonstrated by the fact that the Claimants continued to negotiate with Repsol in respect of the Rafael Urdaneta Card\u00f3n IV Project after the enactment of the Reserve Law.33 It says that in consequence there can be 'no issue of compensation with respect to any business outside of the reserved area.'34 The seizure of the four vessels serving the Corocoro Project does not demonstrate that the Reserve Law applied outside Lake Maracaibo, because all four vessels were registered there and three had been used for maritime support services on the Lake.35\n\nCounter-Memorial, [54]-[55]; Rejoinder, [28], [76],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [76],\n\nRejoinder, [27],\n\n41.\n\nAs to the allegation of indirect expropriation, Respondent says that nothing in the Reserve Law affects the ownership or control of SEMARCA. It submits that SEMARCA continued to receive payments in its own name after the enactment of the Reserve Law, continued to operate and negotiate offshore contracts, and that the Claimants remain in control of its accounts receivable.36 Respondent says it did not take possession and control of SEMARCA or remove its officers.37 Respondent says the SEMARCA officers' letters on which Claimants rely were self-serving and written after the expropriation in order to 'create a record of \"indirect expropriation'\".38\n\nCounter-Memorial, [55]-[57]; Rejoinder, [68], [112],\n\nRejoinder, [111], citing *Pope & Talbot v Canada* (Ex RL-163).\n\nRejoinder, [69]-[72], [110],\n\n42.\n\nRespondent says that, in the absence of a property right owned by SEMARCA being taken, there can be no indirect expropriation.39 In other words, Claimants cannot make an expropriation claim for rights or interests that Claimants never had.40 In circumstances where Claimants remain the legal owners of the shares in SEMARCA, Claimants have not identified any substantial assets or rights held by SEMARCA the taking of which deprived the company of its value.41 Respondent says that Claimants seek compensation for the loss of a 'vested right to continue to do business with PDVSA' that they never possessed.42\n\nCounter-Memorial, [56]-[68],\n\nRejoinder, [92]-[98],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [69]-[74], distinguishing *Quasar de Valores* (Ex CL-140) & *Vivendi v Argentina (Resubmission)* (Ex CL-138); Reply, [99]-[109], relying on *Emmis v Hungary* (Ex RL-159) and distinguishing *Wena Hotels v Egypt* (Ex CL-141); *AIG v Iran* (Ex CL-159); *Tecmed v Mexico* (Ex CL-133) and *Metalclad v Mexico* (Ex CL-172) as cases where the company in question was dispossessed of valuable rights or assets.\n\nRejoinder, [9],\n\n**3. Whether the expropriation was lawful or unlawful**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n43.\n\nClaimants say that Respondent's expropriation is unlawful because it fails to respect two of the conditions imposed by Article 5(1) of the Treaty: that the expropriation betaken 'against prompt, adequate and effective compensation'; and that it be carried out on a non-discriminatory basis.\n\n44.\n\nCompensation : Claimants note that the Barbados BIT requires that any expropriation be accompanied by payment of compensation which amounts to the market value of the investment expropriated, calculated before the expropriation (or when the impending expropriation became public knowledge).43 Claimants thus begin by submitting that the mere failure of Respondent to pay compensation in accordance with the BIT renders the expropriation unlawful.44 They note that Respondent's representative rejected the proposal to pay immediate but partial compensation consisting of all the accounts receivable, and indicated that assets would be valued on a book-value basis.45 Claimants say that Respondent was required, at the least, to make a 'good-faith determination of the fair market value of the investment... and to tender that amount promptly' without prejudice to subsequent proceedings by Claimants to challenge its quantum.46 They cite authority for the proposition that a failure to offer compensation,47 or Treaty-compliant compensation,48 renders the expropriation unlawful. They distinguish the authorities on which Respondent relies on the basis that they either concerned expropriation without compensation under customary international law standard, or they involved distinguishable Treaty provisions.49\n\nMemorial, [83], citing Article 5(1) of the Barbados BIT.\n\nMemorial, [84] and the cases there cited.\n\nMemorial, [66]; Reply, [66]-[69]; Kehoe 1, [49], referring to a meeting on 21 July 2009 with the coordinator of the task force formed by the Minister of Energy to implement the Reserve Law.\n\nReply, [94],\n\nReply, [95]-[96], citing in particular *Burlington v Ecuador* (Ex CL-135), [543]-[545] & *Vivendi v Argentina (Resubmission)* (Ex CL-138), [7.5.21],\n\nReply, [97], citing *Rumeli v Kazakhstan* (Ex CL-95), [706],\n\nReply, [97]-[104],\n\n45.\n\nIn any case, they submit that because the Reserve Law requires Respondent to pay compensation only on a book-value basis, and prohibits the compensation of 'lost profits or indirect damages', the Reserve Law forbids Respondent from paying the compensation required by the BIT, and this renders the expropriation unlawful.50\n\nMemorial, [84], Reply, [92], citing Reserve Law, Article 6.\n\n46.\n\nDiscrimination : Claimants submit that, under the Treaty, an expropriation will be unlawful unless it is carried out 'on a non-discriminatory basis'. They say that the expropriation of SEMARCA was unlawful because not all similarly situated providers of maritime support services to the oil and natural gas industry in Venezuela received equal treatment. In particular, they say that three other operators were treated more favourably than SEMARCA:51\n\ni. Gulmar Offshore Middle East L.L.C. **(Gulmar Offshore),** a United Arab Emirates company, was one of the operators on Lake Maracaibo specifically designated in Resolution No. 51. After Respondent seized three vessels owned by Gulmar Offshore in accordance with that Resolution, it subsequently returned them and the company continued to operate in Venezuela (including taking on services formerly provided by SEMARCA). Claimants reject Respondent's explanation that PDVSA did not have the expertise to operate the vessels as the reason for returning them, because this exception was not provided for in the Reserve Law.\n\nii. Guanta Consult, C.A. & Servicios Picardi, C.A. **(Servipica),** a Venezuelan competitor of SEMARCA who was not listed in Resolution No. 51 and whose assets were not expropriated. Servipica ultimately went on to contract its vessels to Repsol on the Cardon IV project, an operation that Claimants had been in negotiations to service.\n\niii. Astilleros de Venezuela, C.A. **(Astivenca),** a Venezuelan company, also operated offshore and was not subject to expropriation.\n\nMemorial, [63]-[65], [85]-[86]; Reply, [56]-[65], [106]-[109].\n\n*(b) Respondent's submissions*\n------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nCompensation : On the facts, Respondent says that it engaged in compensation discussions with Claimants, but those could not proceed because Claimants insisted on an overly-broad confidentiality agreement. It says that agreement on compensation has also been hampered by Claimants' insistence on seeking compensation for rights SEMARCA never had.52\n\nRejoinder, [81]-[89], [116],\n\n48.\n\nOn the law, Respondent submits that an expropriation is not rendered unlawful by the mere fact that compensation has not been paid, provided that the government 'recognises the obligation to compensate.'53 Respondent points out that in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case (as followed in *LIAMCO),* the expropriation was unlawful because the Government of Poland did not have the right to expropriate the property in question under the applicable Treaty, and that, if Poland had been entitled to expropriate, then the appropriate standard of compensation would have been 'the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession' even if Poland had failed to pay any compensation.54 Respondent submits that the concept of 'provisional payment' invoked by Claimants has no support in the authorities.55\n\nCounter-Memorial, [81] and the cases there cited; Rejoinder, [116],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [82]-[83], citing *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* (Ex RL-81), 46-7 and *LIAMCO* (Ex RL-114), 138-9.\n\nRejoinder, [120],\n\n49.\n\nRespondent distinguishes the five cases which Claimants cite for the proposition that the mere failure to pay compensation renders an expropriation unlawful, arguing that in those exceptional cases the State had never made an offer of compensation, or had offered compensation so low as to be non-existent.56 In Respondent's submission, Article 6 of the Reserve Law does not prohibit compliance with the Treaty's terms as to compensation and there is no basis for assuming that the State intended to breach its international obligations in enacting the Law.57\n\nCounter-Memorial, [86]-[88], citing in the first category *Burlington v Ecuador* (Ex CL-135); *Funnekotter v Zimbabwe* (Ex CL-136); *Wena Hotels v Egypt* (Ex CL-141); and *Vivendi v Argentina (Resubmission)* (Ex CL-138) and in the second category *Rumeli v Kazakhstan* (Ex CL-95); Rejoinder, [118],\n\nRejoinder, [119],\n\n50.\n\nDiscrimination : Respondent says that it did not act in a discriminatory fashion:58\n\ni. The vessels belonging to Gulmar Offshore were returned because PDVSA did not have the expertise to operate them. Respondent also suggests that the treatment of Gulmar Offshore's vessels was consistent with the treatment of the Claimants' vessels *President Tide* and *High Quest* (which were released by the Respondent), because in both cases they were foreign-flagged and had allinternational crews. Respondent also says that Gulmar Offshore is in dispute with Venezuela over the effects of the Reserve Law and no longer operates in the country.59\n\nii. Servipica, by contrast, was not operating in Lake Maracaibo at the time of the Reserve Law and therefore was not included in Resolution No. 51.60\n\niii. Astivenca was included in Resolution No. 51 and its assets in Lake Maracaibo were expropriated.61\n\nRejoinder, [125],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [92]-[94]; Rejoinder, [77],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [95]; Rejoinder, [77], [80],\n\nRejoinder, [77],\n\n**4. Other breaches of the Barbados BIT**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n51.\n\nClaimants also allege that the Respondent's conduct constitutes a breach of three other protections afforded by the Barbados BIT:\n\ni. Fair and equitable treatment : Article 2(2) of the BIT guarantees investors 'fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the rules and principles of International law'. A 'central pillar' of the BIT's guarantee is the protection of legitimate expectations, and Claimants say that Respondent violated their legitimate expectation (rooted in the BIT and Venezuela's Constitution) that their investment would not be expropriated without compensation. Claimants submit, in particular, that the Venezuelan Constitution requires compensation to be paid *before* any seizure.62 Claimants say that the Treaty protection is not qualified by the (lower) customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, but even that standard prohibits expropriation without compensation.63\n\nii. Arbitrary or discriminatory measures : Article 2(2) also prohibits the impairment of investments by arbitrary or discriminatory measures. Claimants say that Respondent's measures were arbitrary because they violated the BIT and the Constitution, and discriminatory for the reasons described above.64\n\niii. National treatment and most-favoured nation treatment : Claimants also say that the discriminatory nature of Respondent's conduct constitutes a freestanding violation of Article 3 of the BIT.65\n\nReply, [113], citing Constitution, Article 115 (Ex C-227).\n\nMemorial, [87]-[91]; Reply, [110]-[115].\n\nMemorial, [92]-[94]; Reply, [116]-[117],\n\nMemorial, [95]; Reply, [118],\n\n*(b) Respondent's submissions*\n------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants' other causes of action under the BIT add nothing to their claim of expropriation:\n\ni. Fair and equitable treatment : Respondent says that the guarantee in Article 2(2) of the BIT is the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. Claimants do not claim they had a right to operate in Venezuela in perpetuity and Respondent has a sovereign right to reserve certain activities to itself. This claim therefore boils down to an allegation that compensation has not been paid and adds nothing to the primary claim. That argument cannot succeed because Respondent has always recognised its obligation to compensate.66\n\nii. Arbitrary or discriminatory measures, national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment : These claims simply recycle Claimants' allegation of discriminatory expropriation.67\n\nCounter-Memorial, [107]-[121]; Rejoinder, [128]-[130],\n\nRejoinder, [126]-[127],\n\n**B Compensation**\n------------------\n\n53.\n\nAt the close of the written phase, the calculations proffered by the respective experts were some distance apart. Claimants' experts quantified the total claim at between US $217m and US $234m on an ex *post* basis, and between US $103m and US $141m on an ex *ante* basis.68 Respondent's experts, by contrast, concluded that the proper quantum of compensation was US $1.68m.69\n\nNavigant 2, [4]-[6],\n\nBrailovsky/Flores 2, [10],\n\n54.\n\nIt became apparent during the hearing that much of the difference between the valuations was attributable to the different assumptions that the experts had adopted, in some cases on instruction from counsel.70 During the hearing, both Parties' experts were given an opportunity to make a brief direct presentation of their evidence to the Tribunal, before being cross-examined and questioned by the Tribunal. Subsequently, and at the request of the Tribunal, each Party's experts produced revised valuations on the basis of alternative assumptions. In this section, the Tribunal first outlines the different approach the Parties took to the valuation exercise, before explaining the valuation figures presented by the experts during the hearing.\n\nFor example, the Respondent's experts were instructed to exclude accounts receivable from their calculation: T2/438/17 - T4/439/1.\n\n**1. Standard of compensation and date for assessment of compensation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n55.\n\nClaimants say that they are entitled to *restitutio in integrum:* that is, compensation to place them in the position they would have been absent the Respondent's wrongful acts.71 At a minimum, they are entitled to the fair market value of the **SEMARCA Enterprise** (which they define to include the value of their equity in SEMARCA plus the value of the part of the terminal at La Ca\u00f1ada occupied by the company72) as a going concern before the expropriation measures became public (the ***ex ante*** **approach).** On this approach, the business is valued on the basis of reasonable expectations at that date.73 But Claimants submit that, because the expropriation was unlawful, they are entitled to be compensated for the net cash flows that they would have enjoyed between the date of the expropriation and the date of this Award, plus the value of the SEMARCA Enterprise at the later date (the **ex** ***post*** **approach).74**\n\nMemorial, [97],\n\nMemorial, [96],\n\nNavigant Presentation 1, Slide 4.\n\nMemorial, [100],\n\n56.\n\nClaimants say that the prescribed standard of compensation in Article 5(1) of the BIT represents the condition for a *lawful* expropriation, but that Article 5(1) does not prescribe the standard of compensation that is payable for an expropriation which the Tribunal has found to be *unlawful* or wrongful.75 Consequently, the applicable standard is supplied by customary international law as reflected in the *Chorz\u00f4w Factory* case, requiring reparation to 'wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act'.76 This equates to the Claimants' ex post approach.77 The same standard applies to any breach of the BIT (such as a violation of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment).78 Claimants say that although 'in most adjudicated expropriation disputes' compensation has been assessed at the date of expropriation, in those cases either additional compensation was not sought or there was insufficient evidence to determine the increase in value.79\n\nReply, [129]-[133],\n\nMemorial, [105]-[106] & Reply, [122]-[123], citing *Chorz\u00f4w Factory* (Ex CL-147), 47.\n\nMemorial, [108],\n\nMemorial, [114],\n\nReply, [133],\n\n57.\n\nClaimants say that if compensation is to be assessed at the date of dispossession, it must exclude the adverse impact of pre-expropriation measures that were taken to reduce the value of the Claimants' interests.80\n\nReply, [136],\n\n*(b) Respondent's submissions*\n------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nRespondent begins by submitting that there is no difference between an ex *ante* and ex *post* valuation in this case, because, for the reasons described above, the Respondent did not expropriate the SEMARCA Enterprise itself.81\n\nCounter-Memorial, [96], [106],\n\n59.\n\nTo the extent that the valuation date might make a difference, Respondent says that Article 5(1) of the BIT stipulates the standard of compensation. It is not limited by its terms to 'lawful' expropriations, and authority supports the proposition that the standard of compensation set by the applicable Treaty should apply regardless of whether the expropriation is lawful (but particularly where the only 'wrongful' conduct is the non-payment of compensation).82 Respondent distinguishes *ADC v Hungary* on the basis that the expropriation was deemed unlawful for a number of reasons other than the failure to pay compensation.83\n\nCounter-Memorial, [96]-[102], citing *Chorz\u00f4w Factory* (Ex RL-81), 47.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [103],\n\n**2. Method of valuation**\n--------------------------\n\n*(a) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n60.\n\nOn Claimants' preferred ex *post* approach, their experts calculated compensation in two tranches: (i) the lost net cash flows of the SEMARCA Enterprise from 7 May 2009 until the date of the Award; and (ii) the fair market value of the SEMARCA Enterprise at the date of the Award.\n\n61.\n\nAs to the value of the business itself, Claimants adopt the 'willing buyer/willing seller' approach endorsed by, *inter alia,* the World Bank Guidelines,84 and say that on the ex *post* approach the investor is entitled to the higher of the business's value at the time of dispossession or the value it would have had at the date of the Award taking into account the profits that would have been earned in the interim in valuing the business.85 Claimants' experts utilise a combination of valuation methodologies: primarily (i) a Discounted Cash Flow **(DCF)** analysis, assisted by (ii) the comparable publicly traded companies approach and (iii) the comparable transactions approach.86 To implement the DCF approach, Claimants' experts project future cash flows through to 31 March 2019 (using the same general methodology as for the period 2009-2013) and determine the remaining value of the business beyond 2019 with a terminal (or residual) value calculation.87\n\nMemorial, [109], citing Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment (Ex CL-152).\n\nMemorial, [110]-[113] & Reply, [124]-[128], citing *ADC v Hungary* (Ex CL-107), *Siemens v Argentina* (Ex CL-128), *Vivendi v Argentina (Resubmission)* (Ex CL-205) and *Amco Asia v Indonesia II* (Ex CL-161).\n\nMemorial, [117], [130],\n\nMemorial, [131]-[135],\n\n*(b) Respondent's submissions*\n------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nRespondent's primary position is that it is not appropriate to value the SEMARCA Enterprise at all, because it was not expropriated. To the extent that it is necessary to value the business, the Respondent's experts say that a DCF valuation alone is appropriate, and reject Claimants experts' comparable companies and transactions approaches for the reasons given below.\n\n**3. Elements of the valuation**\n--------------------------------\n\n*(a) Scope of the business*\n---------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Parties dispute the scope and long-term prospects of SEMARCA's business at the date of the expropriation.\n\n64.\n\nClaimants : As to the long-term prospects of the business, Claimants dispute the Respondent's contention that SEMARCA was vulnerable to 'stiff competition' and the risk of PDVSA bringing services 'in-house'.88 They say that SEMARCA had a proven track record of success and numerous competitive advantages, and was one of the few companies well placed to service the increased demand after 2009.89 As a result, the fact that SEMARCA had no guaranteed right to future contracts on the Lake is not a good reason to ignore its future earning capacity.90 They say that PDVSA had no viable internalisation plan, submit that the market would not have regarded PDVSA's isolated 'musings' as a realistic threat to SEMARCA's prospects, and say that, in any case, the limited plans were largely focused on services that SEMARCA did not provide.91\n\nReply, [14], [145],\n\nReply, [17]-[19],\n\nReply, [143],\n\nReply, [20]-[24], [146], [161],\n\n65.\n\nOn the assumption that the Tribunal takes into account business that Claimants would have undertaken in the period between expropriation and the date of this Award, Claimants point to several offshore projects that they say would have resulted in an expansion of their business. In particular, they identify: the Rafael Urdaneta Project, a large natural gas drilling operation north of Lake Maracaibo (of which the Card\u00f3n III Project, to which SEMARCA briefly contributed two vessels - *High Quest* and *President Tide -* was a part);92 the Mariscal Sucre Project, in which PDVSA has committed to invest;93 and the Plataforma Deltana Project off the east coast of Venezuela, in respect of which SEMARCA was in discussions at the time of the expropriation.94 They do not say that the projects on-going at the date of expropriation would necessarily have continued, but that Claimants would have captured a sufficient share of the offshore business to employ the existing vessels plus six more.95 As noted above, Claimants dispute the suggestion that they are still free to exploit offshore opportunities.96\n\nMemorial, [41]-[46]; Reply, [27]-[29],\n\nMemorial, [47]-[48]; Reply, [29]-[32],\n\nMemorial, [49]-[50]; Reply, [33]-[34],\n\nReply, [165],\n\nReply, [147]-[149],\n\n66.\n\nRespondent : Respondent stresses that after 1975 Claimants had a single customer in Lake Maracaibo: PDVSA and its subsidiaries.97 Whatever its trading history, SEMARCA had no guarantee of continuing operation and was subject to the risk that the State would choose to reserve activities in Lake Maracaibo to itself, as it did.98 PDVSA had firm internalisation plans, and all the Reserve Law did was to expedite them.99\n\nRejoinder, [17],\n\nRejoinder, [22], [138],\n\nRejoinder, [23], citing Figuera 1, [42]-[44] & Figuera 2, [26]-[27],\n\n67.\n\nRespondent submits that the Reserve Law does not prevent the Claimants participating in offshore operations.100 It nevertheless says that the record belies Claimants' hypothetical expansion plans in Rafael Urdaneta, Mariscal Sucre and Plataforma Deltana,101 in circumstances where SEMARCA's actual business there was 'virtually non-existent'.102 Respondent thus says that Claimants have failed to establish what the 17 vessels that Claimants assume would have operated in Venezuela would have been doing,103 noting in particular that the *President Tide* and *High Quest* left Venezuela after the Chevron Contract concluded.104\n\nRejoinder, [26], [178],\n\nRejoinder, [56]-[64],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [124],\n\nRejoinder, [66], [179]-[187],\n\nRejoinder, [187],\n\n68.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants' damages claim is speculative, impermissibly assumes that SEMARCA would continue providing services into perpetuity, and is contrary to authority that damages should not be awarded on the assumption that contracts would be renewed when there was no right of renewal.105 It says that no hypothetical buyer would value SEMARCA on that basis.106\n\nCounter-Memorial, [126]-[128], citing *Merrill & Ring v Canada* (Ex RL-99) & *CMS v Argentina* (Ex CL-162).\n\nRejoinder, [144],\n\n*(b) Accounts receivable and working capital*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Parties agree that the accounts receivable owed to SEMARCA totalled US $44,888,040 as at 8 May 2009. However they dispute how the accounts receivable should be treated in the calculation of damages.\n\n70.\n\nClaimants say that because they have been deprived of control or operation of SEMARCA, they are not able to collect the accounts receivable.107 They submit that if the expropriatory acts had not been committed, it is reasonable to think that PDVSA would have been able to satisfy the obligations, and thus include the accounts receivable in their assessment of damages.108 Nevertheless, they assume that some of the amount outstanding at January 2009 would have remained outstanding, and some would have gone to pay off supplier liabilities, so only include US $16.48m in their calculations.109 They thus say that Respondent's experts have wrongly excluded most of SEMARCA's working capital from their calculation.110\n\nReply, [150]-[151].\n\nMemorial, [36],\n\nT2/293/1-9. The calculation is found in Navigant Answers to Questions, Slide 10.\n\nReply, [193]-[198].\n\n71.\n\nRespondent relies on Claimants' assertion in the document production phase that they 'are not seeking payment of those accounts receivable in this proceeding'111 and their experts were accordingly instructed to exclude accounts receivable from their calculations.112 When instructed to include the accounts receivable in their calculations, Respondent's experts subtracted US $27,464,640 in current liabilities, leaving a recoverable total of $17,423,400.113\n\nRejoinder, [75], quoting Claimants' Response to Respondent's Answer to Claimants' First Document Request and Claimants' Reply to Respondent's Answer to Claimants' Objections to Respondent's First Document Request (17 March 2011), [40],\n\nT2/438/17 - T2/439/1.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores Answers to Questions, Slide 7 (liquidation value). In the Respondent's calculations of SEMARCA's value on a going-concern (DCF) basis, the difference between the valuation including the accounts receivable (at 100%) and excluding them entirely ranged between $18,762m and $19,252m, depending on the other assumptions adopted: compare figures in the first column of Slides 10 and 11.\n\n*(c) Cashflow*\n--------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether, for the purpose of calculating cash flows in the DCF analysis, it is appropriate to adopt a three-year spread of historical cash flows (i.e. FY2006 to FY2008) or a four-year spread (FY2006 to 2009). Claimants' expert includes FY2009 in his calculations.114 Respondent's experts opine that this has a distorting effect on the figures, since FY2009 was a year of historically high oil revenues, which had a consequent effect on day rates that could be commanded by SEMARCA.115\n\nNavigant 1, [121] (Fig 27); Navigant 2, [116]-[137],\n\nBrailovsky/Flores 1, [71]; Brailovsky/Flores 2, [72]-[83],\n\n*(d) Discount rate*\n-------------------\n\n73.\n\nClaimants : Having calculated cash flows, Claimants' experts discount them to the valuation date by calculating SEMARCA's Weighted Average Cost of Capital **(WACC).** This takes into account both the cost of equity and the cost of debt. To calculate the cost of equity, Claimants' expert uses the Capital Asset Pricing Model **(CAPM),** which takes into account three principal factors: (i) the rate of return for risk-free investments; (ii) the equity risk premium; (iii) a measure of system risk associated with a given security relative to the market as a whole (known as the *beta* value); and add (iv) a country risk premium.116 As a preliminary point, Claimants say that Respondent's experts use the wrong industry code when extracting data from the Ibbotson/Morningstar Cost of Capital Yearbook, which itself produces a 3.74 per cent reduction in WACC.117 As to the individual components of the discount rate:\n\na) For the risk-free rate. Claimants' expert uses the ten-year historical average yield on United States Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.118\n\nb) For the equity risk premium, Claimants' expert used 5.0 per cent, said to be an approximate average of the range of estimates recommended in empirical studies.119 Claimants say that Respondent's premium is based on a single source and, at 6.5 per cent, is at the top end of the usual range of 3.5 to 7 per cent.120\n\nc) For the asset *beta,* the expert used a sample of comparable companies to derive an unlevered **beta** of 0,618, adjusting the figures for an assumed debt/equity ratio of 10:90 for SEMARCA. He justifies the low ratio on the basis that SEMARCA leased its vessels, meaning it had modest financing needs.121 He says that if the Respondent's experts were to use the right Ibbotson/Morningstar industry code, the applicable **beta** is 0.69.122\n\nd) For the country risk premium (which accounts for two-thirds of the difference in overall discount rate between the respective experts), Claimants' expert excludes the impact of 'certain Venezuelan government policies, such as its nationalisation agenda, which heightened the level of legal, regulatory and political risk'.123 He says that expropriation risk must be excluded because the BIT protects against it,124 and criticises Respondent's experts' reliance on the Ibbotson-Morningstar report because it is based on empirical data that inevitably incorporates such risks.125 That leaves currency risk (assessed as low because most profits were in US Dollars); macroeconomic risk (also assessed as low because of the vital role of the maritime support service sector in the Venezuelan economy); and social risk such as the risk of labour unrest (assessed as moderate). Moreover, Claimants say that recent data suggests that investors in real world transactions are not applying significant 'country risk' discounts.126 They distinguish the cases on which Respondent relies.127 Claimants' expert thus adopts a country risk premium of 1.5 per cent.\n\ne) Finally, the expert calculates the cost of debt based on average rates at which comparable companies could borrow in US Dollars for the three years prior to expropriation, settling on 6.68 per cent.128\n\nMemorial, [138],\n\nReply, [184],\n\nMemorial, [139],\n\nMemorial, [139],\n\nReply, [186],\n\nMemorial, [140],\n\nReply, [187],\n\nMemorial, [141]; Reply, [168]\n\nReply, [169]-[172],\n\nReply, [173],\n\nReply, [174],\n\nReply, [ 175]-[ 179], citing *Himpurrna v PT (Persero)* (Ex RL-82), *AMT v Zaire* (Ex RL-139), *Lemire v Ukraine* (Ex RL-140) & *Mobil Cerro Negro v PDVSA* (Ex RL-83).\n\nMemorial, [142],\n\n74.\n\nClaimants dispute the additional downward adjustments proposed by the Respondent for business risk :\n\na) Claimants dispute that SEMARCA should be treated as dependent on a single customer, PDVSA, given the offshore expansion opportunities.129 Although a buyer might in principle discount a company's value to account for high customer concentration, Claimants say the risk to SEMARCA was reduced because PDVSA already had a diversified customer base and a long history of continuous operation.130\n\nb) Claimants say that geographic concentration was not a significant risk because no prospective buyer would have been concerned that the market for SEMARCA's services would suddenly dry up.131\n\nc) Finally, Claimants dispute the addition of Respondent's *alpha* premium of 2.27 per cent and small-company size premium of 1.08%, because they do not reflect how a willing buyer would have valued SEMARCA in real life.132\n\nReply, [156],\n\nReply, [158]-[160],\n\nReply, [162],\n\nReply, [188],\n\n75.\n\nIn combination, and assuming a debt/equity ratio of 10:90, Claimants' expert proposes a WACC of 6.96 per cent.133 For the purpose of valuing the SEMARCA Enterprise, the Claimants' expert then calculates the residual (terminal) value using the constant dividend growth model, under which free cash flow in the final year of the projection period is divided by the difference between the WACC and the long-term growth rate of the economy.134 Using a valuation date of 31 December 2013 (i.e. the ex *post* approach), Claimants' expert produced a valuation for the SEMARCA Enterprise of US $153,781,338.135 On the *ex ante* approach, they produce a valuation of US $81,677,467 at 8 May 2009, plus interest.136\n\nMemorial, [143],\n\nMemorial, [144],\n\nNavigant 2, [4] (Table 1). This excludes the separate addition of the lost cash flows, although they were taken into account in calculating the value of the business at 31 December 2013.\n\nNavigant 2, [6] (Table 2).\n\n76.\n\nRespondent : On the assumption that a DCF analysis is appropriate (i.e. that the Tribunal decides to value the SEMARCA Enterprise itself), Respondent's experts adopt the following approach:\n\na) In calculating a discount rate, the experts take into account three elements: the cost of equity for an on-going concern operating in SEMARCA's field in a mature economy; the cost of equity due to country risk and the cost of debt to SEMARCA.137\n\nb) Respondent's experts use the CAPM and International Capital Asset Pricing Model **(ICAPM)** methods, and in particular the Ibbotson/Morningstar implementation of the ICAPM method, confirmed by reference to the 'bludgeon method' of Professor Damodaran.138\n\nc) As to equity risk, Respondent's experts adopt 6.5%.139 They explain that this figure represents the most accurate long-term cost of equity capital and it is supported by both the Ibbotson-Morningstar report, which collates data from 1926 to the valuation date, and other published data sources.140 Respondent's experts maintain that Claimants' figure is not reliable, as it is based on data that post-dates the valuation date.\n\nd) As to country risk. Respondent says that the discount rate adopted by Claimants' expert would not even be appropriate for a project in the United States. In reliance on *Himpurna, AMT, Lemire* and *Mobil Cerro Negro,* Respondent says that much higher country risk must be assigned.141 It says that Claimants' exclusion of factors such as expropriation risk is based on a mistaken premise. The rule that the value of an asset must be assessed at a date before the announcement of the specific expropriation does not mean that one must ignore the general risk of government intervention that has always accompanied the investment activities in Venezuela, including the risk that the government would reserve a certain sector of activity to the State.142 It is no answer to say that such risks are controlled by the State.143 Nor does the BIT permit that risk to be excluded from the analysis.144 The Respondent's experts propose a country risk rate on equity of 14.76%, and on debt of 11.89%.145\n\ne) Respondent also says, in reliance on the expert report of Professor Wells, that a significant discount must be applied to take account of business risk, driven by the fact that SEMARCA operated on the basis of short-term contracts with no long term commitments, and because of SEMARCA's dependence on a single customer.146 Respondent says that Claimants confuse 'single customer' risk with 'single supplier' risk,147 and have no answer to the risk of internalisation.148\n\nf) Taking into account an appropriate debt/equity ratio, Respondent's experts calculated an overall discount rate of 24.57%.149\n\nCounter-Memorial, [153],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [153],\n\nBrailovsky/Flores 1, Table IV. 1.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores 2, [201] - [209], Table IV.4; Ibbotson-Morningstar Report, BF-23, Table A-l.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [139]-[144], Rejoinder, [167]-[170] citing in particular *Himpurna v PT (Persero)* (Ex RL-82), *AMT v Zaire* (Ex RL-139), *Lemire v Ukraine* (Ex RL-140) & *Mobil Cerro Negro v PDVSA* (Ex RL-83).\n\nCounter-Memorial, [145]-[147],\n\nRejoinder, [167],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [148]-[151]; Rejoinder, [171]-[175],\n\nBrailovsky/Flores 1, Table IV. 1\n\nCounter-Memorial, [134]-[137]; Rejoinder, [146]-[160],\n\nRejoinder, [156],\n\nRejoinder, [158],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [153],\n\n77.\n\nRespondent's experts produce a final valuation (on the assumption that a DCF approach is appropriate) of US $2.9m,150 as compared to its liquidation valuation of US $1.6m.151\n\nBrailovsky/Flores 2, Table III. 1.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores 2, Table II.1.\n\n*(e) Comparable companies and transactions*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nClaimants : Claimants' experts supplement their DCF calculation by examining both comparable companies and comparable transactions:152\n\na) The experts identify three publicly traded companies most directly comparable to SEMARCA, assign each a comparability rating and then weight their EV/EBIT multiple accordingly. Multiplying SEMARCA's projected EBIT for 2013 by the weighted EBIT multiple produces an enterprise value.153 The experts dispute Respondent's claim that the selected companies are associated with very different country risk profiles, because much of the difference is attributed to uncompensated expropriation risk and related risks, and because there is no correlation between the 'in country' cost of equity and the EV/EBIT valuation multiples of the selected companies.154\n\nb) The experts adopt a similar approach for comparable transactions, identifying six in the period 2010 to 2013 that are potentially comparable to SEMARCA.155\n\nReply, [199]-[203].\n\nMemorial, [146],\n\nReply, [201]-[202].\n\nMemorial, [147]-[148],\n\n79.\n\nRespondent : Respondent's experts reject both of Claimants' comparables analyses. They say that each of the firms selected by Claimants operates its own vessels; the firms do not work exclusively in one geographic area or for a single customer; all the firms are much larger than SEMARCA; and Claimants do not account for different country risks.156\n\nCounter-Memorial, [155]; Rejoinder, [164],\n\n**4. Interest**\n---------------\n\n*(a) Claimants' submissions*\n----------------------------\n\n80.\n\nClaimants seek both pre-award and post-award interest, in each case calculated on a compound basis.157 Claimants propose that the rate should be calculated by reference to Venezuela's sovereign debt rate, because otherwise Claimants would have been forced to serve as compulsory creditors to Respondent. Alternatively, they propose a 'normal commercial rate' as required by the BIT. Their experts propose the US Prime Rate + *2* per cent, or LIBOR + 4 per cent as alternatives to Venezuela's sovereign bond rate.158 They say that Respondent's proposed rate cannot be considered a normal commercial rate.159\n\nMemorial, [156]-[163]; Reply, [208],\n\nReply, [205]-[206],\n\nReply, [207],\n\n*(b) Respondent's submissions*\n------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nRespondent says that pre-award interest should be based on a short-term and risk-free rate, such as the 3-month US Treasury bond plus 1.33 per cent. Otherwise, Claimants would be compensated for risks they did not bear.160 It maintains that simple interest is appropriate as a matter of Venezuelan and international law.161\n\nCounter-Memorial, [157]-[158]; Rejoinder, [190],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [159],\n\n**III THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A Liability**\n---------------\n\n82.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided that '[i]t has jurisdiction over the claims of Tidewater Barbados and Tidewater Caribe pursuant to Article 8 of the Barbados BIT to the extent that such claims concern alleged breaches of the obligations of the Respondent underthatTreaty arising after 9 March 2009'.162 It found that all of the other claims advanced by all other Claimants fell outside its jurisdiction and could not proceed within the framework of the present arbitration. This included, materially, the claims for alleged expropriation of their vessels brought by affiliates of Tidewater Barbados within the Tidewater group that owned each of the vessels used by SEMARCA in the operation of its business in Venezuela.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [199(2)].\n\n83.\n\nIn arriving at its Decision, the Tribunal had to consider the present Claimants' allegations of fact as to the acts of Respondent that gave rise to its claims. The Tribunal had to make an evaluation of these facts. The gravamen of Respondent's objection to jurisdiction under the BIT (ultimately rejected by the Tribunal) was that Claimants' invocation of Respondent's consent to arbitration under the BIT was an abuse of process, since the dispute which is the subject of the present proceedings was already in existence, or could reasonably have been foreseen at the time Tidewater Barbados was incorporated and the ownership of Tidewater Caribe transferred to it. This turned on questions of fact.163\n\nIbid, [145],\n\n84.\n\nHowever, it is axiomatic that no findings of fact made by an international tribunal in the context of a jurisdictional challenge can bind it in its subsequent determination of the merits of the dispute. On the contrary, an arbitral tribunal must, for the purpose of its jurisdictional determination, presume the facts that found the claim on the merits as alleged by the claimant to be true (unless they are plainly without any foundation). In that sense, its determination may be said to be *prima facie.* In the application of those presumed facts to the legal question of jurisdiction before it, the tribunal must objectively characterise those facts in order to determine finally whether they fall within or outside the scope of the Parties' consent. In making this determination, the tribunal may not simply adopt the claimant's characterisation without examination. In this way, a tribunal whose jurisdiction is contested strikes the balance between avoiding pre-judging the merits, on the one hand, and objectively determining the question of jurisdiction on the other. This is the consistent jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice,164 and of ICSID tribunals.165\n\n*Oil Platforms* (CL-39), [16], Higgins Separate Opinion, [31],\n\n*Continental Casualty v Argentina,* [60]-[64]; *Duke v Peru,* [115]-[123]; *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic* (RL-45), [63]\u2014[64].\n\n85.\n\nIt follows therefore that the Tribunal approaches the determination of Respondent's substantive liability to Claimants, if any, entirely afresh and on the basis of the evidentiary record presented to it in the written and oral phase on the merits.\n\n**1. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n*(a) Cause of action*\n---------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe first and principal cause of action pleaded by Claimants is that Respondent expropriated Claimants' investments in Venezuela without payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation in breach of Article 5 of the BIT.166\n\nRequest, [56(a)(i)j; Ex C-10.\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal analyses this claim in the following four steps:\n\n(a) *First,* it considers the constituent elements of the cause of action provided by the Contracting States in Article 5 of the BIT itself;\n\n(b) *Second,* it identifies and analyses the relevant State measures alleged to constitute the expropriatory acts;\n\n(c) *Third,* it assesses whether, and if so to what extent, those measures did in fact have an expropriatory effect; and,\n\n(d) *Fourth,* it considers whether, if so, such expropriation was lawful or unlawful.\n\n88.\n\nArticle 5 provides:\n\n(1) Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. The national or company affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.\n\n(2) Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of their investment to such nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.\n\n89.\n\nThe term 'investment' is defined in Article 1 to mean 'every kind of asset invested by nationals or companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party'. Such assets include, inter alia, shares in a company,167 goodwill and know-how.168\n\nArticle l(a)(ii).\n\nArticle l(a)(iv).\n\n90.\n\nArticle 5 is in a form commonly found in many investment treaties. It does not prohibit the expropriation of investments. Rather, each Contracting Party undertakes only to expropriate if certain specified conditions are met. The expropriation must be:\n\n(a) 'for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party';\n\n(b) 'on a non-discriminatory basis'; and\n\n(c) 'against prompt, adequate and effective compensation'.\n\nThe Contracting States extend these protections to 'measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation.' They also undertake to provide prompt judicial or independent review of an investor's case or the valuation of its investment in accordance with the principles set out in Article 5.\n\n*(b)Relevant measures*\n----------------------\n\n91.\n\nFour measures were relied upon as constituting acts by which Respondent expropriated Claimants' investments in Venezuela:\n\n(i) Reserve Law of 7 May 2009;169\n\n(ii) Ministerial Resolution No 51 of 8 May 2009;170\n\n(iii) Physical seizure of SEMARCA's business operations at La Ca\u00f1ada, Lake Maracaibo on 9 May 2009; and,\n\n(iv) Physical seizure of SEMARCA's business operation at Corocoro on 12 July 2009.\n\nIt Is necessary to take each of these measures In turn.\n\nEx C-12.\n\nEx C-13.\n\n*(i) Reserve Law*\n-----------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Reserve Law Itself, adopted by the National Assembly of Venezuela on 7 May 2009, is entitled: Organic Law that Reserves to the State Assets and Services related to Primary Activities of Hydrocarbons.\n\n93.\n\nIts object is set forth in Article 1 as being 'the reservation for the State, because of their strategic character, of assets and services related to the performance of the primary activities contemplated in the Organic Law on Hydrocarbons.' These activities are henceforth to be carried out by PDVSA, or its designated subsidiary, or through mixed enterprises controlled by them. They are declared to be a public service and of public and social interest.171\n\nArticle 5.\n\n94.\n\nThe assets and services thus reserved include '[t]hose related to the activities in Lake Maracaibo: vessels for [diverse purposes]; maintenance of vessels in workshops, piers or docks of any nature.'172 The Ministry of the Popular Power for Energy and Petroleum with competence on oil matters (the **Ministry**) is empowered to determine by resolution the specific assets and services of enterprises that fall within the Law.173 All subsisting agreements in connection with the reserved activities are to terminate by operation of law.174 As of the date of publication of the Law, PDVSA or its designated subsidiary 'shall take possession of the assets and control of the operations referred to [as] the reserved activities'.175\n\nArticle 2.\n\nArticle 3.\n\nIbid.\n\nArticle 4.\n\n95.\n\nThe National Executive is empowered to decree the total or partial expropriation of the shares or assets of companies performing the reserved activities.176 The just price for any such expropriation shall be limited to the book value of the assets. '[I]n no event there shall be taken into account lost profits or indirect damages.'177\n\nArticle 6.\n\nIbid.\n\n96.\n\nAs summarised above, the Reserve Law had two functions: (a) the reservation to the State in the public interest of the oil industry support functions there specified; coupled with (b) the nationalisation of the assets and operations of the private companies then carrying out such activities and services.\n\n97.\n\nThese two functions were interlinked. Mr Figuera, a witness called by Respondent, who at that time was General Manager of the Offshore Mixed Companies for Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo SA **(CVP),** a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA, testified before the Tribunal:\n\n[O]ur operations in Lake Maracaibo are huge. We have more than 7,000 Wells. All independent, isolated. 7,000 Wells, we have more than 17,000 kilometers of pipeline laying out in the bottom of the lake. We have... about 200 flow stations that we have to supervise and maintain and operate. A huge amount of facilities, not to refer to the rigs, drilling rigs and all the barges that are used to lay out the pipeline and do production and construction activities in Lake Maracaibo.\n\nSo, yes, although we have, as I mentioned, more than 400 vessels of our own, and we have always had a large significant capacity to operate in the lake, yes, that's not sufficient. And we depended up to a point, a significant point, [we] depended upon contractors.\n\nThere are vessels that also we don't have. We have only a few supply vessels, that's not something that we ever care for to develop.178\n\nT1/264/18-T1/265/16.\n\n98.\n\nThe conclusion that the Tribunal draws from the text of the Reserve Law and this evidence is that Venezuela's objective in reserving to the State the relevant oil service activities integrally required the nationalisation of the assets and facilities of the private operators then operating on Lake Maracaibo. Without such nationalisation, the object of the Reserve Law could not then have been achieved.\n\n*(ii) Ministerial Resolution No 51 of 8 May 2009*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Ministerial Resolution contemplated by the Reserve Law was promulgated the following day, Friday 8 May 2009.179 It recites: the 'activities that were the object of outsourcing schemes... place the Venezuelan State in a situation of vulnerability', such that it is necessary to 'correct and recover the dismemberment of essential aspects of the oil activity since such dismemberment threatens the national sovereignty'.180 It resolves that '[t]he services of enterprises or sectors and assets... and the enterprises that provide said activities that are affected by the measure of seizure' are a number of listed enterprises including SEMARCA.181 PDVSA or its designated subsidiary 'is hereby instructed to take control of the operations and immediate possession of the facilities, documentation, assets and equipment related to the activities to which this Resolution refers'.182\n\nC-13.\n\nIbid, Recitals 1 & 2.\n\nArticle 1; item 31, whose activities are described as '[S]upply vessels with cranes for the transport of materials, diesel, industrial water and other materials; tugs.'\n\nArticle 2.\n\n*(iii) Physical seizure of SEMARCA's assets at La Ca\u00f1ada on 8 May 2009*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nOn the same day, Friday 8 May 2009, PDVSA assumed, as recorded in a contemporaneous judicial minute 'the possession of the assets and control of the operations related to the reserved activities and corresponding to the operating headquarters of... SEMARCA'.183 Mr. Kehoe, then Manager of SEMARCA, describes this event in the following terms in his witness Statement:\n\nAt approximately 1:30 AM on 8 May 2009, the Venezuelan National Guard arrived at the SEMARCA headquarters at La Ca\u00f1ada, entered the facility, and took control. We did not receive any notice that the Venezuelan National Guard was coming. At approximately 5:00 AM, three buses arrived, loaded with many PDVSA employees dressed all in red. These PDVSA employees also participated in the takeover of the facility. After the arrival of the National Guard, SEMARCA managers were no longer allowed on the premises except for specific appointments that had to be requested through the local PDVSA management. SEMARCA's non-managerial employees were expected to report for work after the takeover.184\n\nC-13.\n\nKehoe 1, [35],\n\n*(iv) Physical seizure of SEMARCA's assets at Corocoro on 12 July 2009*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nSubsequently, on 12 July 2009, PetroSucre, an affiliate of PDVSA, seized the remainder of SEMARCA's operations at Corocoro in the Gulf of Paria, including the four vessels operating there. It instructed the crews of those vessels that they would henceforth be working for PetroSucre.185 Respondent does not dispute this taking.186 It submits that the Reserve Law was limited to services and activities in Lake Maracaibo.187 When questioned by the Tribunal on why these vessels were taken, Mr. Figuera answered:\n\nThe law, the Reserve Law, requested all vessels related to, underlined \"related\" to Lake Maracaibo operations be taken, and these vessels were registered in Lake Maracaibo, that belonged to the Lake Maracaibo fleet. These vessels worked in Lake Maracaibo eventually, and in several times we noticed in the reports that these vessels moved from Corocoro to Lake Maracaibo operations and performed services to our fleet-as part of the fleet in Lake Maracaibo.188\n\nC-102.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [16],\n\nRejoinder, [79],\n\nT1/270/17-T1/271/4.\n\n102.\n\nHowever that may be, the uncontradicted evidence is that these vessels were working, and continued to work after the seizure at least for some time, for PetroSucre at Corocoro. Their seizure brought to an end SEMARCA's operations in Venezuela.\n\n*(c) Expropriatory effect*\n--------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe next issue is whether these seizures had the effect of nationalisation or expropriation or were 'measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation' of Claimants' investment in Venezuela.\n\n104.\n\nAs the terms of Article 5 of the BIT confirm, it is well accepted in international law that expropriation need not involve a taking of legal title to property. It is sufficient if the State's measures have an equivalent effect. As one tribunal put it:\n\nWhen measures are taken by a State the effect of which is to deprive the investor of the use and benefit of his investment even though he may retain nominal ownership of the respective rights being the investment, the measures are often referred to as a \"creeping\" or \"indirect\" expropriation, or, as in the BIT, as measures \"the effect of which is tantamount to expropriation\".189\n\n*Middle East Cement v Egypt* (CL-171), [107],\n\n105.\n\nIn reaching an assessment of whether the measures had an effect equivalent to expropriation, the Tribunal finds it useful to consider the factors relied upon by the tribunal in *Pope & Talbot* as relevant in the determination of whether a State measure has such an effect, namely whether:\n\n(a) The investment has been nationalised or the measure is confiscatory;\n\n(b) The investor remains in control of the investment and directs its day-to-day operations, or whether the State has taken over such management and control;\n\n(c) The State now supervises the work of employees of the Investment; and,\n\n(d) The State takes the proceeds of the company's sales.190\n\n*Pope & Talbot v Canada* (RL-163), [100],\n\n106.\n\nRespondent accepts that the vessels were taken, but points out (correctly) that, as a result of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the taking of the property in these vessels-whether on Lake Maracaibo or at Corocoro-which were not owned by Claimants but by affiliates, is outside the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal. It also accepts that it expropriated SEMARCA's physical assets at La Ca\u00f1ada, but claims that these had a minimal value.191 Nevertheless, it asserts that Claimants' shares in SEMARCA were not, and have not been expropriated. Thus, it alleges, other assets of SEMARCA, including its accounts receivable, remain in the hands of the Claimants, who remain free to engage in other oil supply business in Venezuela outside the scope of the activities on Lake Maracaibo reserved to the State under the Reserve Law.\n\nT4/851/11-15.\n\n107.\n\nRespondent points out that, after the first seizure on 8 May 2009, SEMARCA continued to assert its ownership of the assets of the company; to claim payment of the accounts receivable (which Claimants continued to carry in their books); and to seek redress for the seizure. It also continued to perform its contracts with PetroSucre at Corocoro, and with Chevron, invoicing and seeking payment for arrears on those contracts, and to negotiate contracts with Repsol in relation to Venezuelan business. This conduct, Respondent claims, is consistent with Claimants' continued ownership of SEMARCA.192\n\nRespondent refers in particular to: SEMARCA to PetroSucre, 14 July 2009 (Ex C-102); Tidewater Accounts Receivable Statement to 31 July 2009 (C-27); Kehoe 2, [18] n 13; SEMARCA Trial Balance Sheet to 31 July 2009 (NAV-473).\n\n108.\n\nMr. Kehoe, when challenged on this under cross-examination, deposed:\n\n[T]he expropriation for me was a transition period from the beginning, let's say May 8th, up until July 12th. In the beginning, we almost felt that this wasn't really going to happen to us, but, as the milestones went along, we found out that this was really the reality right up until the final taking of the PetroSucre vessels on July 12th.193\n\nT1/131/22-T1/132/7.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered this evidence. It accepts Mr. Kehoe's account. The first seizure took place without warning on the very day of the promulgation of the Ministerial Resolution, the day after the passing of the Reserve Law itself. It removed Claimants from control of the seat of their operations at La Ca\u00f1ada. Claimants had operated an oil supply business in Venezuela for fifty years at that stage. Whilst the seizure would have come as a surprise, the Tribunal does not find it surprising that Claimants would not immediately accept its effect. Moreover, the scope of that effect upon Claimants' investment did not finally become clear until the seizure of the remainder of the vessels at Corocoro some two months later. In these circumstances, documents from Claimants asserting the continuation of their business in the intervening period are consistent with a dawning realisation that their business had been nationalised. They do not lend support for the proposition that, after 12 July 2009, Claimants remained in effective control of SEMARCA, their investment in Venezuela.\n\n110.\n\nOn the contrary, contemporaneous evidence from the Venezuelan Courts supports the conclusion that the business as a whole had been effectively nationalised. When employees of SEMARCA brought labour suits against the company in June 2009 and December 2009, the Courts directed that the suits be served on the Attorney General of the Republic. The record showed that only when such service had been effected could the proceedings continue. The Court explained, in the first case, this was '[b]ecause the Court notes the Respondent in this proceedings, the corporate entity Tidewater Marine Service Compa\u00f1\u00eda An\u00f3nima, also known as SEMARCA, has become a part of the State of Venezuela, this being a matter of public knowledge within the country'.194 In the second case, the Court observed: 'TIDEWATER MARINE SERVICE, C.A. (SEMARCA) is an enterprise that was subject to expropriation pursuant to Resolution Number 51... because it was deemed that said company is of a necessary and strategic character to Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. and its subsidiaries'.195\n\nJudgment of 2 June 2009 (Ex C-229).\n\nJudgment of 14 December 2009 (Ex C-230).\n\n111.\n\nThis contemporaneous evidence is also corroborated by the testimony of witnesses called for both by Claimants and Respondent at the hearing. Mr. Kehoe for Claimants deposed that, as a result of the seizure, PDVSA obtained 'the entire infrastructure as it were, actually, of our business of SEMARCA in Venezuela at the time'.196 Mr. Figuera for Respondent confirmed that 'PDVSA Operaciones Acu\u00e1ticas is now operating the vessels that belonged before to SEMARCA'. As such 'it has a director [with] personnel appointed to it'.197 He confirmed that, although it was not yet separately Incorporated, this was planned so that it would become its own cost and profit centre.198\n\nTl/199/11-13.\n\nTl/268/12-14, 22-269/2\n\nTl/268/20 - 269/11.\n\n112.\n\nThe seizure applied to all of SEMARCA's non-managerial employees, who were expected to work for PDVSA after 8 May 2009 - both the ship crews and the shore-based staff.199\n\nKehoe 1, [34], [41]; Kehoe Tl/198/20-199/13.\n\n113.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether the assets of SEMARCA that were the subject of the seizure included its accounts receivable. Claimants allege that both Parties acknowledged this at the time.200 Respondent alleges that Claimants are still entitled to sue to recover the accounts receivable, either in the Venezuelan Courts or otherwise in accordance with the contractual dispute resolution terms.201 It points out that Chevron paid Claimants the dollar portion of the amounts outstanding under its Venezuelan support contract after the seizure.\n\nLetter of 6 July 2009 (C-59); Letter of 9 December 2009 (C-247).\n\nT4/868/21 - 871/20.\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal finds, in the light of the Venezuelan Court decisions referred to above, that Claimants would not have been recognised as exercising effective control over SEMARCA such that they could have pursued legal process in Venezuela for recovery of debts due to SEMARCA in Venezuela. On the contrary, the Venezuelan Courts treated the State as the effective owner of SEMARCA.\n\n115.\n\nBefore leaving this section, however, it is necessary to address one further submission advanced on behalf of Respondent as to the scope of the expropriation. Respondent avers that the property that is the subject of an expropriation can only be determined by reference to property rights held under the host State law.202 Respondent alleges that, apart from the fixed assets, the only property rights Claimants held at the date of the seizure were under two short-term contracts with PDVSA. Thus, it claims, at best only the rights under these contracts may form the subject matter of Claimants' claim.\n\nRelying inter alia on *Emmis v Hungary* (RL-159).\n\n116.\n\nExpropriation under international law undoubtedly contemplates property rights existing under national law that have been taken by the State.203 As the Iran-US Claims Tribunal put it in *Amoco:204*\n\nExpropriation, which can be defined as a compulsory transfer of property rights, may extend to any right which can be the object of a commercial transaction, *i.e.,* freely sold and bought, and thus has a monetary value.\n\n*EnCana Corporation v Ecuador* (RL-1O1), [184]; *Emmis v Hungary* (RL-159), [157],\n\nAmoco (CL-148), [108],\n\n117.\n\nIn *Emmis v Hungary,* the reason there could be no claim for expropriation was because the only property right that the claimants in that case had acquired upon making their investment in Hungary was a fixed-term broadcasting licence that had expired prior to the State measure alleged to constitute the expropriation. For that reason, the claimants in that case, in their contemporaneous regulatory filings, attached no value to their investment after the expiry of the licence.205\n\n*Emmis* (RL-159), [217]-[221],\n\n118.\n\nBy contrast, in the present case, Claimants' investment in Venezuela was begun many years before on its acquisition of SEMARCA. It consisted in the operation of a business that was open-ended as to time. The terms of the BIT confirm206 that an investment is capable of including goodwill and know-how as well as other tangible and intangible assets, including contractual rights. Venezuelan law provides the same. Article 3(1) of the Investment Law207 defines 'Investment' as including:\n\nEvery asset destined to the production of income, under any of the entrepreneurial or contractual forms permitted by Venezuelan legislation, including personal and real property, tangible or intangible, over which property rights and other rights in rem are exercised; negotiable instruments; rights to any performance having an economic value; intellectual property rights, including know how, prestige and good will;...\n\nArticle l(a)(iv).\n\nC-9 Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments *(Ley sobre Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de Inversiones),* dated 3 October 1999 (as published in the Official Gazette No. 5,390 of 22 October 1999).\n\n119.\n\nIt Is uncontested that each of SEMARCA and Tidewater Caribe were companies in good standing duly incorporated under Venezuelan law and that Venezuelan law recognises such assets as property.\n\n120.\n\nTrue it is that the short-term nature of the contracts through which SEMARCA conducted its business in Venezuela, along with other factors, are elements that may be relevant in the determination of the monetary value to be placed upon the business, were it to have been the object of a commercial transaction (to utilise the language of *Amoco).* But this is a subsequent issue to the establishment of a property right capable of expropriation. The Tribunal finds that Claimants' investment in SEMARCA was such a property right.\n\n121.\n\nIn sum, the effect of Respondent's measures was the expropriation in fact of the whole of Claimants' investment in its subsidiary in Venezuela, SEMARCA. The value to be ascribed to that investment for the purpose of determining any compensation to be awarded to Claimants for their loss is a separate question, which will be addressed in Part B of the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n***(d) Was the expropriation lawful or unlawful?***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Respondent did expropriate Claimants' investment in SEMARCA in Venezuela. The next question is to determine whether such expropriation is lawful or unlawful. Article 5 of the BIT does not, after all, prohibit the State taking property byway of nationalisation or expropriation. Rather it permits such a taking, but only under the conditions there specified. That is to say, the expropriation must be:\n\n(a) 'for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party';\n\n(b) 'on a non-discriminatory basis'; and\n\n(c) 'against prompt, adequate and effective compensation'.\n\n123.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the expropriation accords with the terms of the Treaty and is not therefore a breach of international law. If the conditions are not met, the expropriation must be treated as a breach of international law.\n\n124.\n\nIn the present case, neither Party disputes the first condition, namely that the expropriation was for a public purpose related to the internal needs of Venezuela. The Parties do dispute the lawfulness of the expropriation in relation to the second and third conditions: non-discrimination and compensation. Claimants submit that the taking was discriminatory. They also point out that the only compensation provided for under the Reserve Law was book value of the assets. The Law expressly excluded lost profits. This, by definition, did not meet the Treaty standard of 'adequate and effective compensation' since Article 5 itself specifies that such compensation 'shall amount to the *market value* of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation' [emphasis added]. Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the taking was not discriminatory. The whole of the oil support business on Lake Maracaibo was nationalised, affecting numerous other companies. They submit that the Reserve Law did provide for compensation. From the earliest stage after 8 May 2009, Respondent claims the Government had made clear to Claimants that it was prepared to compensate Claimants, but only on the basis of a global settlement. It was Claimants that had not accepted that offer and elected to proceed instead to arbitration.\n\n125.\n\nClaimants submit that, if the expropriation is unlawful, they are entitled, as a matter of the international law of State responsibility, to additional compensation, in the event that the property that is the subject of the illicit taking has increased in value since the date of the State measure.208 Respondent, on the other hand, while insisting that the expropriation was lawful, also submits that the date for valuation prescribed in the Treaty is applicable in any event, whether the expropriation was lawful or unlawful.209\n\nMemorial, [106]-[114]; T4/797/22-T4/798/6.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [97]-[104],\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider first (i) the question of whether the taking in the present case was non-discriminatory; and then (ii) the relevance and application of the compensation standard in the determination of the lawfulness of the expropriation.\n\n*(i) Non-discrimination*\n------------------------\n\n127.\n\nIn order to be lawful, a State taking of property must be non-discriminatory. The Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence relied upon by Claimants in support of their allegation that, in the present case, Respondent did discriminate against Claimants in the application of the Reserve Law.210 It finds that none of the instances of alleged different treatment of other contractors in fact constitutes discrimination against Claimants:\n\n(a) In the case of services provided by Gulmar Offshore, the unchallenged evidence of Mr. Figuera was that its vessels were originally seized, but then released once it was established that they were foreign-flagged and foreign-crewed - a like treatment to that accorded to the foreign-flagged vessels of Tidewater affiliates; and that Gulmar in any event no longer provides services on Lake Maracaibo and is pursuing a claim in arbitration against PDVSA.211\n\n(b) In the case of Servipica, its services were provided off shore and were not covered by the Reserve Law.\n\n(c) In the case of Astivenca, its services on Lake Maracaibo were indeed expropriated under Ministerial Resolution No 51.212\n\nMemorial, [85]; Counter-Memorial, [90]; Reply, [106]; Rejoinder, [77] (and following).\n\nFiguera 1, [40],\n\nC-13, Schedule, no 3.\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the expropriation was not discriminatory against Claimants. It is therefore necessary to assess the relevance of the non-payment of compensation to the lawfulness or otherwise of Respondent's taking.\n\n*(ii) Compensation*\n-------------------\n\n129.\n\nBoth Parties rely upon the foundational decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice **(PCIJ** or **Permanent Court)** in *Chorzow Factory.213* In that decision, the Permanent Court first explained the difference between an expropriation that has to be considered lawful on the condition that a fair compensation is granted or will be granted - possibly by a tribunal - and an expropriation that is illegal *per se.* Once such distinction has been clarified, the PCIJ presented 'the guiding principles according to which the amount of compensation due may be determined'214 and explained that the compensation was not to be the same under both situations.\n\nEx RL-81.\n\nIbid, 46.\n\n130.\n\nThe Court begins by elucidating a distinction between a lawful expropriation and an unlawful one:\n\nThe action of Poland which the Court has judged to be contrary to the Geneva Convention is not an expropriation - to render which lawful only the payment of fair compensation would have been wanting; it is a seizure of property, rights and interests which could not be expropriated even against compensation....215\n\nHere the Court is stating expressly that illegality must stem from a circumstance beyond the mere absence of compensation.\n\nIdem.\n\n131.\n\nAfter having posited the distinction between a lawful expropriation and an unlawful expropriation, the Court explains that the two situations do not entail the same level of compensation:\n\nIt follows that the compensation due to the German government is not necessarily limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus interest to the date of payment. This limitation would only be admissible if the Polish Government had had the right to expropriate, and if the wrongful act consisted merely in not having paid to the two Companies the just price of what was expropriated; in the present case, such a limitation.... would be tantamount to rendering lawful liquidation and unlawful dispossession indistinguishable in so far as their financial results are concerned.216\n\nIbid, 47.\n\n132.\n\nHaving thus stated that lawful and unlawful expropriation must not bear the same financial consequences, the Permanent Court lays down the standard of compensation for *unlawful* expropriations:\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act... is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it - such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation for an act contrary to international law.217\n\nIdem.\n\n133.\n\nThe Iran-US Claims Tribunal in the *Amoco* case confirmed that the level of compensation depended on the legal qualification of the expropriation:\n\n[T]he Tribunal holds that the question of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the expropriation has a direct bearing on the issue of compensation....\n\n...\n\nUndoubtedly, the first principle established by the Court is that a clear distinction must be made between lawful and unlawful expropriations, since the rules applicable to the compensation to be paid by the expropriating State differ according to the legal characterization of the taking.218\n\n*Amoco* (CL-148), [86], [192], citations omitted. The same approach is adopted by the ECtHR: *Papamichalopoulos v Greece,* [36]: 'The act of the Greek Government... contrary to the Convention was not an expropriation that would have been legitimate but for the failure to pay fair compensation... The unlawfulness of such a dispossession inevitably affects the criteria to be used for determining the reparation owed by the respondent State, since the pecuniary consequences of a lawful expropriation cannot be assimilated to those of an unlawful dispossession.'\n\n134.\n\nThe Iran-US Claims Tribunal found that 'the compensation to be paid in case of a lawful expropriation (or of a taking which lacks only the payment of a fair compensation to be lawful) is limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession'.219 It elucidated the distinction in the standard of compensation between a lawful and an unlawful expropriation in the following way:\n\n193. According to the Court in *Chorzow Factory,* an obligation of reparation of all the damages sustained by the owner of expropriated property arises from an unlawful expropriation. The rules of international law relating to international responsibility of States apply in such a case. They provide for *restitutio in integrum',* restitution in kind or, if impossible, its monetary equivalent. If need be, \"damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution\" should also be awarded. See *Chorzow Factory, supra,* at 47. On the other hand, a lawful expropriation must give rise to \"the payment of fair compensation,\" *id.* at 46, or of \"the just price of what was expropriated.\" *Id.* at 47. Such an obligation is imposed by a specific rule of the international law of expropriation.\n\nAmoco, [196],\n\n135.\n\nMore recent investment arbitral practice also supports the same approach. In *Santa Elena,* the Tribunal determined compensation at the date of the taking on the basis that the expropriation was lawful, even though no compensation had been paid for many years.220 In *Goetz v Burundi,* the Tribunal held that, all other conditions for a lawful taking having been met, the failure to pay prompt and adequate compensation did not suffice 'to taint this measure as illegal under international law'.221 In *Mondev v USA,* the Tribunal considered that, in order to render the expropriation lawful under the treaty (NAFTA) all that was required was that 'the obligation to compensate must be recognised by the taking State at the time of the taking, or a procedure must exist at that time which the claimant may effectively and promptly invoke in order to ensure compensation'.222\n\n*Santa Elena* (RL-110), [68], [83],\n\n*Goetz v Burundi* (RL-112), [130],\n\n*Mondev v USA* (CL-046), [71], Cf. the position where the State makes no offer of compensation at all (as in *Wena v Egypt* (CL-141), [100]; *Vivendi v Argentina (Resubmission)* (CL-138) or offers an amount that is so negligible as not to be in made in good faith (as in *Rumeli v Kazakhstan* (CL-95)).\n\n136.\n\nScholars also have insisted on the necessity to distinguish expropriation illegal *per se* and expropriation only wanting compensation to be considered legal. If an expropriation were to be considered illegal as soon as no compensation is granted, then the consequence, according to Salacuse would be that\n\n... in cases in which an expropriation meets all the conditions for a legal expropriation except for a determination of the tribunal that the host State had not paid market value for the property expropriated such an expropriation would have to be considered 'illegal' and compensation would therefore be awarded not on the basis of the valuation standard in the Treaty but on the basis of the *Chorzow Factory* principle and customary international law. It is suggested that such a result would not accord with the intention of the contracting Parties as evidenced by the Treaty text.223\n\nSalacuse *The Law of Investment Treaties* (2009) (RL-123), 328.\n\n137.\n\nW\u00e4lde and Sabahi point outthatthe inclusion in bilateral investment treaties of specific language regarding the standard of compensation for expropriation has the consequence that 'nearly every expropriation dispute will be adjudicated not under customary international law, but under specific binding treaty language'.224 Ripinsky and Williams state that 'a good faith offering of, or provision for, compensation (even if not in a sufficient amount, as long as not manifestly unreasonable) should render the expropriation lawful.'225Marboe concludes:\n\nWhile earlier the mere 'promise' of a State to pay any sum at any time was not enough for the lawfulness of an expropriation, today there seems to be consensus that it is sufficient, if a State, at the time of the expropriation, offers compensation or provides for the determination of compensation.... One may, therefore, conclude that according to arbitral practice and scholarly writing, the mere existence of a dispute about the amount of compensation does not render the expropriation unlawful.226\n\nW\u00e4lde and Sabahi 'Compensation, Damages and Valuation' in Muchlinski, Ortino and Schreuer *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law* (Oxford UP, 2008) (CL-163), 1070.\n\nRipinsky and Williams *Damages in International Investment Law* (British Institute of International and Comparative Law, 2008) (RL-143), 68-9.\n\nMarboe *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (Oxford UP, 2009) (RL-117), [3.46], [3.48],\n\n138.\n\nMost expropriation claims turn on the question whether a measure is expropriatory at all. In such cases, where the tribunal finds expropriation, compensation is almost always due. Cases where expropriation is acknowledged and the dispute revolves around the proper amount of compensation are rare; cases where no compensation has been paid because the label of expropriation itself is contested are the norm. That means that almost every decision finding expropriation would also find unlawful expropriation - and almost every tribunal would then set aside the 'fair market value at the time of expropriation' standard for compensation for expropriation. Such an approach thus would make a detailed and elaborate element of the expropriation provision in modern BITs, including the provisions of Article 5 of the Venezuela-Barbados BIT, effectively nugatory.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal's approach is also consistent with the World Bank Guidelines.227 The Guidelines 'may be applied by members of the World Bank Group institutions to private foreign investment in their respective territories, as a complement to applicable bilateral and multilateral treaties' (to the extent that there is no conflict between them).228 Part IV deals with expropriation. It prohibits expropriation or measures having similar effects 'except where this is done in accordance with applicable legal procedures, in pursuance in good faith of a public purpose, without discrimination on the basis of nationality and against the payment of appropriate compensation'.229 Compensation is deemed appropriate 'if it is adequate, effective and prompt'.230 Compensation is deemed adequate 'if it is based on the fair market value of the taken asset as such value is determined immediately before the time at which the taking occurred or the decision to take the asset became publicly known'.231 Determination of such fair market value Is acceptable If conducted on a basis agreed between the State and the foreign investor *'or by a tribunal or another body designated by the Parties'.232*\n\nCL-152.\n\nIbid, 1.1.\n\nIV. 1.\n\nIV.2.\n\nIV.3.\n\nIV.4.\n\n140.\n\nThe Guidelines thus reinforce the conclusion of the Tribunal that an expropriation wanting only a determination of compensation by an international tribunal is not to be treated as an illegal expropriation. They prescribe a standard for compensation that is identical to that required under Article 5 of the BIT in the present case and then provide that the amount of such compensation will be acceptable if determined 'by a tribunal... designated by the Parties.' It follows that such a tribunal must have an opportunity to make its determination as to compensation. Where such a tribunal has done so (and assuming that the other conditions are met) the expropriation will not be illegal.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that a distinction has to be made between a lawful expropriation and an unlawful expropriation. An expropriation only wanting fair compensation has to be considered as a provisionally lawful expropriation, precisely because the tribunal dealing with the case will determine and award such compensation.\n\n142.\n\nThe essential difference between the two is that compensation for a lawful expropriation is fair compensation represented by the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession and reparation in case of unlawful expropriation is restitution in kind or its monetary equivalent. The precise manner in which, in the modern context, the standard of fair value at the date of dispossession is to be applied will have to be considered in greater depth in Part B of the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n143.\n\nIn the present case, the State did not seek to expropriate the assets without compensation. But Claimants submit that the taking is to be treated as illegal, since the Reserve Law mandates a level of compensation that is limited to the book value of the assets and it prohibits the taking into account of lost profits or indirect damages.233 This, Claimants argue, is inconsistent with the standard of compensation required by Article 5 of the BIT and thus illegal.234\n\nArticle 6.\n\nReply, [92]; T4/790-2.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Article 5 defines the compensation payable for expropriation simply as 'the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation'. It does not prescribe how that market value is to be determined. That valuation is a matter that both Venezuela and Barbados, as contracting Parties to the BIT, entrusted to this Tribunal by virtue of the consent to arbitration in Article 8 of the Treaty. Article 8(3) confirms that the arbitral award may determine, in case of a dispute relating to an expropriation, 'the amount of the compensation.' Thus, to use the language of the World Bank Guidelines, the present Tribunal is a 'tribunal... designated by the Parties' to determine the acceptable level of compensation.\n\n145.\n\nAs will be seen in Part B of the Tribunal's analysis, the Treaty standard of 'market value' does not denote a particular method of valuation. The appropriate method of valuation will depend upon the context. In some cases, the appropriate valuation may indeed be the book value of the assets.235 By virtue of the terms of the BIT and the consent to the determination of valuation by this Tribunal accorded by Venezuela thereunder, this Tribunal is not limited by the limits on valuation imposed by the Reserve Law. But this Tribunal is not disposed to find that the valuation limits in Article 6 of the Reserve Law are of such a character as to render the expropriation as a whole illegal. This is not a case where the State took assets without any offer of compensation. The record does not demonstrate a refusal on the part of the State to pay compensation. Rather, it discloses that the Parties were unable to agree on the basis or the process by which such compensation would be calculated and paid.236 This is therefore a task that they have submitted to this Tribunal.\n\nCL-152, World Bank Guidelines, IV-6(iii)(b)\n\nKehoe 1, [49], Ex R-113, R-114, R-115, R-116.\n\n146.\n\nFor present purposes, it suffices to conclude that the present expropriation was lawful, since it wants only compensation, a matter vouchsafed by the Parties to this Tribunal to determine according to the standards prescribed in the BIT.237\n\nThe present case is therefore to be distinguished from the position in *ADC v Hungary,* CL-107, where the tribunal found that the expropriation violated the four criteria mentioned in the BIT: it was not made in furtherance of a public interest, it was not made according to due process of law, it was discriminatory and no just compensation was provided.\n\n**2. Other Causes of Action**\n-----------------------------\n\n147.\n\nIn essence both Parties argued this case as a claim of compensation for expropriation. In the Tribunal's view, this is the correct approach. The gravamen of Claimants' complaint is that Respondent took their property, being their investment in SEMARCA by means of the State measures that the Tribunal has just analysed in the preceding section. The real questions for the Tribunal are as to the legality of such taking and the amount of compensation due in respect of it.\n\n148.\n\nIn their Request for Arbitration, Claimants added claimsfor breach of the Treaty standards of fair and equitable treatment, for the taking of arbitrary or discriminatory measures and the failure to accord Claimants' investments the same treatment as that accorded to nationals of Venezuela or third States.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal has already considered and rejected the allegation that Venezuela's measures were discriminatory in the context of its discussion of the legality of the taking. The additional causes of action for the taking of discriminatory measures or of a failure in national or most favoured nation treatment do not add anything in the light of that finding.\n\n150.\n\nThe claim of failure of fair and equitable treatment is, in the Tribunal's view, simply inapposite in the present case in which the real focus of the claim is not on the procedural fairness of Respondent's treatment of Claimants, but on its taking of their property. Considering the case through the prism of a claim of fair and equitable treatment does not add anything to the Tribunal's consideration of the questions of liability or the quantum of damage. Claimants rely on the same measures for this claim238 and do not assert that a different measure of damage is applicable. Accordingly, the Tribunal leaves aside the other alleged causes of action and proceeds to analyse the level of compensation to be awarded for the principal claim of expropriation.\n\nMemorial, [90],\n\n**B Compensation**\n------------------\n\n**1. Standard of compensation**\n-------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nOnce the distinction between lawful and unlawful expropriation is accepted, such distinction has to be translated into a workable standard, applicable to the case before the Tribunal, which is one of lawful expropriation. Here, the starting point is the standard enunciated in Article 5 of the Treaty itself, namely 'the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation'.\n\n152.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the World Bank Guidelines provide reasonable guidance as to the content of the standard chosen by the States Parties to the BIT as the standard of compensation to be applied in cases of lawful compensation, where the investment constituted a going concern at the time of the taking. The Guidelines prescribe 'the fair market value of the taken asset as such value is determined immediately before the time at which the taking occurred'.239 Such standard is also consistent with the standard of fair compensation required by customary international law in the case of a lawful expropriation.240\n\nWorld Bank Guidelines, IV-3.\n\n*Norwegian Shipowners' Claims* (Award, 13 October 1922), I RIAA 307, 340; Marboe *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (Oxford UP, 2009), [3.24]\n\n153.\n\nThe International Law Commission has noted that this approach has been widely adopted by international tribunals, in the case of the nationalisation of a going concern:\n\nDecisions of various ad hoc tribunals since 1945 have been dominated by claims in respect of nationalized business entities. The preferred approach in these cases has been to examine the assets of the business, making allowance for goodwill and profitability as appropriate. This method has the advantage of grounding compensation as much as possible in some objective assessment of value linked to the tangible asset backing of the business. The value of goodwill and other indicators of profitability may be uncertain, unless derived from information provided by a recent sale or acceptable arms-length offer. Yet, for profitable business entities where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, compensation would be incomplete without paying due regard to such factors.241\n\nInternational Law Commission 'Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts: Text of the Draft Articles with Commentaries thereto' (Crawford, Special Rapporteur) [2001] 2(2) YB ILC 31, Article 36(23). Footnote 587 observes: 'Early claims recognized that even where a taking of property was lawful, compensation for a going concern called for something more than the value of the property elements of the business.'\n\n154.\n\nAbsent agreement of the Parties, the Guidelines define the fair market value as to be determined 'according to reasonable criteria related to the market value of the investment, i.e., in an amount that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller after taking into account the nature of the investment, the circumstances in which it would operate in the future and its specific characteristics, including the period in which it has been in existence, the proportion of tangible assets in the total investment and other relevant factors pertinent to the specific circumstances of each case'.242\n\nWorld Bank Guidelines, Article IV-5.\n\n155.\n\nWhilst making plain that there is no exclusive validity of a single standard, the Guidelines provide for a distinction to be drawn between 'a going concern with a proven record of profitability' and other enterprises and assets not having this characteristic. Where the enterprise meets this criterion, the Guidelines indicate that compensation will be reasonable if determined 'on the basis ofthe discounted cash flow value'.243\n\nIbid, Article IV-6.\n\n156.\n\nIn the field of investment treaty law, tribunals have frequently found the discounted cash flow **(DCF)** method to provide the most useful method for arriving at a valuation of a business that had been operating as a going concern prior to the taking. In *CMS v Argentina,* the tribunal endorsed the application of the DCF method in that case, which involved a going concern. It found this to be an 'appropriate method for valuing business assets... [where] there is adequate data to make a rational DCF valuation'.244 In *Enron,* the tribunal held that 'there is convincing evidence that DCF is a sound tool used internationally to value companies, albeit that it is to be used with caution as it can give rise to speculation'.245\n\n*CMS v Argentina* (CL-162), [416],\n\n*Enron v Argentina* (CL-198), [385] (footnote omitted).\n\n157.\n\nA *going concern* is defined in the World Bank Guidelines as meaning:\n\n[A]n enterprise consisting of income-producing assets which has been in operation fora sufficient period of time to generate the data required for the calculation of future income and which could have been expected with reasonable certainty, if the taking had not occurred, to continue producing legitimate income over the course of its economic life in the general circumstances following the taking by the State.246\n\nWorld Bank Guidelines, Article IV-6.\n\n158.\n\n*Discounted cash flow* is defined as meaning:\n\n[T]he cash receipts realistically expected from the enterprise in each future year of its economic life as reasonably projected minus that year's expected cash expenditure, after discounting this net cash flow for each year by a factor which reflects the time value of money, expected inflation, and the risk associated with such cash flow under realistic circumstances. Such discount rate may be measured by examining the rate of return available in the same market on alternative investments of comparable risk on the basis of their present value.247\n\nIdem.\n\n**2. Date of valuation**\n------------------------\n\n159.\n\nAs the Tribunal has already found that it is to apply the Treaty standard of compensation for expropriation, the question of the appropriate date to be taken for valuation may be dealt with rather more shortly. Article 5 itself prescribes that what is to be determined is 'the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation'. In other words, the question is what a willing buyer would have paid a willing seller for the expropriated investment at that time.\n\n160.\n\nThis type of valuation has been commonly referred to in shorthand as an ex *ante* valuation, because it seeks to determine the value of the investment *before* the expropriatory measure. But it is important to be clear that this does not mean that the valuation is unconcerned with future prospects:\n\n(a) In the first place, as the World Bank Guidelines themselves confirm, the factors that a willing buyer would itself take into account on the purchase of such an investment necessarily include 'the circumstances in which it would operate in the future'.\n\n(b) In the second place, the Tribunal is not required to shut its eyes to events subsequent to the date of injury, if these shed light in more concrete terms on the value applicable at the date of injury or validate the reasonableness of a valuation made at that date.248\n\nKantor *Valuation for Arbitration: Compensation Standards, Valuation Methods and Expert Evidence* (2008) 68-9; *Rumeli v Kazakhstan* (Decision on Annulment), [150],\n\n161.\n\nThis second qualification, however, does not change the actual date of valuation. The purpose of referring to subsequent events is not to present a hypothetical business that never in fact occurred and would not reasonably have been taken into account by a willing buyer prior to expropriation. Rather, it is permitted in cases where such events shed more light in concrete terms on the value of the investment prior to expropriation. In assessing the value of the business at that date, the Tribunal disregards business prospects that it considers to be too remote or speculative to justify inclusion.\n\n162.\n\nIn the present case, both experts agree that 'the ex *post* approach should only be used if hindsight allows for a reliable measurement of lost cash flows between the date of breach and a present date'.249 There may in particular cases be a real benefit in hindsight. For the reasons already developed, the present case Is not one of an Illegal expropriation and so the Tribunal is not required to determine the content of the requisite standard of compensation required by international law byway of restitution in such a case. The Tribunal is mindful, as the International Law Commission has said, of the need to guard against 'the risk of double-counting which arises from the relationship between the capital value of an enterprise and its contractually based profits'.250\n\nNavigant 1, [268]; Flores, T3/580/8 - 581/22.\n\nInternational Law Commission 'Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts: Text of the Draft Articles with Commentaries thereto' [2001] 2(2) YB ILC, Article 36(26).\n\n163.\n\nIn the present case, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to delve in detail into the case advanced by Claimants as to SEMARCA's alleged future prospects in support of deep-water oil exploration in Venezuela. Substantial time was spent on this aspect of the claim in the expert reports on quantum and in cross-examination at the hearing. The Tribunal considers that this projected future business is too remote from SEMARCA's established support business in Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Paria and too speculative to be reasonably capable of inclusion in an assessment of loss in any event. This is borne out by the fact that, when an opportunity did arise to support Chevron's drilling programme in the Card\u00f3n III block (a program that Chevron abandoned in June 2009 when the well that it had drilled was dry), Tidewater supported this by supplying US-flagged and crewed vessels direct from the United States.\n\n**3. Appropriate method for assessment of fair market value**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nAlthough it is for the Claimants to prove that they have suffered some damage in order to be awarded compensation, it is for the Tribunal itself to determine the amount of compensation.251 This is necessarily a matter of the Tribunal's informed estimation in the light of all the evidence available to it.252\n\n*Sapphire International,* 187-8; *SPP v Egypt* (RL-113), 215. Thus, in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory,* the Permanent Court found that the two German companies had suffered *some* damage as a result of the illegal act of the Polish Government in dispossessing them of the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w *(Chorz\u00f3w Factory,* 46). It then took up itself the task of determining the quantum of that damage, by appointing its own experts to conduct an enquiry: Ibid, 51 and Order (Expert Enquiry): (1928) PCIJ Ser. A No 17, 99-103.\n\n*Rumeli* v *Kazakhstan* (Decision on Annulment) [141]-[149]; Gotanda 'Recovering Lost Profits in International Disputes' (2004-5) 36 Georgetown JIL 61,101.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that in the present case, it is appropriate to determine the fair market value of Claimants' investment in SEMARCA by reference to a discounted cash flow analysis for the following reasons: (a) SEMARCA was, immediately prior to the date of the taking, a going concern with a proven track record of profitability; (b) it had been operating successfully in Venezuela for some fifty years, and (c) in the five years prior to the taking, it had recorded substantial operating income as recorded in its income statements.253 Thus, in the Tribunal's view, it is not appropriate to determine the fair market value by reference to either the liquidation value of the assets of the SEMARCA Enterprise, or the book value of those assets, as Respondent contends.254 Such methods would likely only be appropriate, as the World Bank Guidelines point out, where the enterprise was not a proven going concern.255\n\nNavigant 1, Ex 1.5.\n\nBrailovsky Flores 1, [26] Table 11.2.\n\nWorld Bank Guidelines, IV-6.\n\n166.\n\nHowever, the valuation of Claimants' investment in SEMARCA as a going concern does present particular difficulties in view of the character of SEMARCA's business. SEMARCA was not a publicly listed company and its business was limited to one country and one customer. The Tribunal is not persuaded that the other transactions and companies referenced by Claimants' experts in their reports256 are sufficiently comparable to SEMARCA's business, and to the market in which it operated, so as to assist it in arriving at a fair market value of SEMARCA. It accepts the views of Respondent's experts that the differences between the business contexts in which such other companies were operating are simply too great for them to be comparable.257\n\nNavigant 1, [199]-[255],\n\nBrailovsky Flores 1, [193]-[236],\n\n167.\n\nThe consequence is that the Tribunal must approach the valuation of SEMARCA based upon the factors that are specific to its business. However, even when examined on this basis alone, the ex **ante** valuations prepared by the Parties' experts differed greatly. In his written reports, Claimants' expert arrived at an ex **ante** valuation of US$81.68 million (excluding interest).258 By contrast, Respondent's experts, in their second report, arrived at a valuation of US$2.9 million.259\n\nNavigant 2, [6],\n\nBrailovsky Flores 2, [125] (Table III.1).\n\n168.\n\nThe reasons for the these great differences in valuation are to be found in a number of specific variables adopted by the experts on the basis of assumptions that they respectively made, either on the basis of their instructions from counsel or in their own opinion. It is therefore necessary for the Tribunal to make its own findings as to each of the material elements in the DCF analysis on the basis of the evidence before it. Once this has been done, it will be possible to apply the assumptions that the Tribunal has determined to be applicable to the DCF analysis in order to assist in arriving at an appropriate figure. At the Tribunal's request during the course of the hearing, the experts for both Parties prepared illustrative tables showing the effect of different assumptions upon their calculations, which have greatly assisted the Tribunal in this part of its work.\n\n**4. Elements in DCF valuation analysis**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThere are six variables adopted in the experts' reports that have a material effect on the valuation of Claimants' investment in SEMARCA:\n\na) Scope of business: Whether SEMARCA's business is assumed to be limited to its operations on Lake Maracaibo, or whether one adds operations existing in 2009 outside Lake Maracaibo (and, if so, whether one includes services provided to international oil companies or only to PDVSA and its subsidiaries);\n\nb) Accounts receivable: Whether the outstanding accounts receivable from PDVSA are to be included in the value of the company at the valuation date or excluded from it;\n\nc) Historical cash-flow: Whether to include the whole period from 2006 to March 2009 or to exclude 2009 (on the basis that the cash flow is disproportionately high in comparison to earlier years);\n\nd) Equity risk: Whether to apply an equity risk premium at 5% or 6.5%;\n\ne) Country risk: Whether to apply a country risk of 1.5% (Claimants' expert) or 14.75% (Respondent's experts);\n\nf) Business risk: Whether to make an adjustment for single customer concentration at an assumed rate of 25% per annum or no such adjustment.\n\n*(a) Scope of business*\n-----------------------\n\n170.\n\nSEMARCA's business was primarily concerned with supplying support to PDVSA's oil operations on Lake Maracaibo. As at the valuation date of 7 May 2009, this business was conducted using 11 vessels. The business was a mature one. It had been conducted successfully and profitably over many years. Equally, Claimants and their expert did not seek to suggest that the business on Lake Maracaibo presented real opportunities for expansion. The oil field on Lake Maracaibo, though containing extensive reserves, is a mature oil field. There were numerous other private operators providing support services to PDVSA.\n\n171.\n\nHowever, in addition, SEMARCA was then under contract to support two further oil projects, both of which were carried out offshore. In the first place, SEMARCA was supporting PetroSucre, a PDVSA affiliate, in its operations at Corocoro in the Gulf of Paria with four vessels. The Tribunal has already found on the evidence that these were treated by PDVSA as being covered by the Reserve Law and were seized on 12 July 2009. They had historically formed part of SEMARCA's fleet based at La Ca\u00f1ada on Lake Maracaibo. The value of the business represented by the operations of these vessels must therefore be added to the 11 vessels actually stationed on Lake Maracaibo.\n\n172.\n\nThe position is different, however, in respect of the business represented by the two vessels, the *President Tide* and the *High Quest,* that were contracted to support Chevron in its exploratory drilling project in the Card\u00f3n III block.260 These vessels were not part of SEMARCA's ordinary fleet. They were registered under a United States flag261 and were crewed by United States citizens.262 The contract with Chevron came to an end in June 2009, when Chevron's drilling operations produced a dry well and Chevron abandoned the Card\u00f3n III block. The Tribunal considers that this contract cannot be treated as an ordinary part of SEMARCA's operations for the purpose of valuing its business as a going concern. It was out of the ordinary course of SEMARCA's business and did not continue. It was not organized or staffed on the same basis as the rest of SEMARCA's operations.\n\nCard\u00f3n Contract dated 23 March 2009 (C-86).\n\nKehoe 1, [46],\n\nLetter from Jacob (SEMARCA) to Hern\u00e1ndez 15 June 2009 (C-88).\n\n173.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal decides to exclude the business represented by these two vessels from the cash flow of the business for the purpose of calculating its value. The result is that the business is to be treated as having an assumed scope, based upon its historical operations, represented by the cash flow generated by 15 vessels.\n\n*(b) Accounts receivable*\n-------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe second element that led to differences in the respective experts' valuations was the treatment of accounts receivable. It is common ground that there was, as at 7 May 2009, a large amount (some US$44,888,040) of accounts receivable from PDVSA/PetroSucre recorded in the accounts of SEMARCA.263 Claimants' expert included these sums in valuing the company, making adjustments to ensure that they did not distort the cash flow of the business on an ongoing basis.264 Respondent's experts, on the other hand, had been instructed by counsel not to include accounts receivable in any of their valuations.265 The experts justified this exclusion on the basis that the accounts receivable had not been expropriated, because SEMARCA still exists as a company and is therefore entitled to collect its receivables.266 Its effect on Respondent's experts' DCF valuation was considerable. Respondent's experts excluded all accounts receivable and other working capital from their DCF analysis. This produced a negative free cash flow to equity and a negative discounted cash flow of US$2,433 million in FY20 10,267 with consequential effects on subsequent years.\n\nSEMARCA Aged Receivables ledger July 2009 (NAV-472).\n\nKaczmarek, T2/405/21 - 409/20.\n\nBrailovsky, T2/468/5-21; Flores T3/585/17 - 588/7.\n\nBrailovsky T2/468/18 - 469/7.\n\nBF-5, Table 1A; Flores T3/585/17 - 588/7.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found, on the basis of the contemporaneous record, including the decisions of the Venezuelan Courts themselves, that Respondent expropriated the SEMARCA Enterprise as a whole, by assuming control in fact of its business and all of its assets. Thus, the investment that was lost must include outstanding unpaid accounts receivable.\n\n176.\n\nFor the purpose of valuation of the business as a going concern on the date immediately prior to the expropriation, the accounts receivable must be included. They constitute a valuable asset of the business. The Tribunal is satisfied that a willing buyer would so regard them. In the light of the long history of successful dealings between SEMARCA and PDVSA, these sums, which represent an accrued debt on contracts already performed, would be treated as fully recoverable. There was some evidence presented at the jurisdiction stage that PDVSA wished to negotiate discounts on its outstanding debts with its major suppliers in early 2009,268 but SEMARCA's position had been that it needed to be paid in full. In the merits phase, Respondent's position is that 'the principal asset of the company, its accounts receivable, was not taken, and Claimants remain free to pursue collection of any outstanding accounts under the relevant contracts'.269\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [161]\u2014[163].\n\nRejoinder, [8],\n\n177.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides to include SEMARCA's outstanding accounts receivable as at 7 May 2009 in determining the value to be ascribed to the business.\n\n*(c) Cash flow*\n---------------\n\n178.\n\nThe third element that contributed to the differences in the valuations of the Parties' respective experts is the question whether the cash flow of SEMARCA for the year ended 31 March 2009 should be included in the determination of the historical cash flows of the company. Both experts start their calculation of historical cash flows in FY2006. Claimants' expert includes the results for FY2009. Respondent's experts exclude them on the basis that FY2009 was an exceptional year in terms of profitability.270 They therefore work on an average of historical cash flows for the three years ended FY2008.\n\nFlores T3/573/14 - 574/2.\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it proper to include the results of all four years for which historical cash flow data is presented. A willing buyer of SEMARCA in May 2009 would have taken into account all of the available current financial data on the cash flows of the company. Although the rates commanded in FY2009 were higher than in the previous years, the oil industry is notoriously price volatile. The higher prices in 2009 also in part reflected higher labour costs.271 Taking an average of all four years of historical cash flow seems to the Tribunal to reflect most fairly the available information.\n\nLetter from SEMARCA to PDVSA 6 July 2009 (C-59).\n\n*(d) Equity risk premium*\n-------------------------\n\n180.\n\nA fourth material element in the discounted cash flow analysis that led to material differences between the experts is the percentage premium to be applied to the risk involved in investing in equities rather than risk-free US Treasury bonds. Claimants' expert maintains that 5% is a reasonable estimate. Respondent's experts apply a rate of 6.5%. They opine that this represents the most reliable long term arithmetical mean of equity risk premia in the relevant industry and that Claimants' expert had applied a percentage that was not supported by the most reliable primary data.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully examined the primary data available to it in the form in which it was exhibited to the experts' reports. It finds particularly salient three primary sources of long-term equity risk premia: the Ibbotson-Morningstar Report (which covers the period 1926-2009),272 the Damodaran Report (which covers the period 1928-2009),273 and the Dimson-Marsh-Staunton Report (which covers the period 1900-2009).274 These report a long-term market risk premium, as at 2009 of between 6.0% and 6.7%.275 Thus the Tribunal concludes that it is reasonable to include an equity risk premium of 6.5% in the calculation of the cost of capital.\n\nBF-23.\n\nBF-113.\n\nBF-114.\n\nThe Tribunal has also reviewed the additional papers on equity risk premia exhibited by Claimants' expert to his Second Report (NAV-388 - NAV-392 & NAV-474 - NAV-475). It finds that these either postdate the valuation date; do not present a long-term set of data or represent analysts' various evaluations rather than primary data.\n\n*(e) Country risk premium*\n--------------------------\n\n182.\n\nAn element of greatest difference between the approaches of the experts is the premium to be applied to the risk of investing in a particular country, here Venezuela. Claimants' expert adopted a country risk premium of 1.5%, while Respondent's experts adopted 14.75%.\n\n183.\n\nClaimants' expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, accepted in answer to a question from a member of the Tribunal that Venezuela 'quite possibly is one of the highest risk countries' in the world in which to invest.276 The reason why his country risk premium is so low is that he considers that political risk ought to be excluded from the country risk premium. This opinion is in turn based upon a view about the legal implications of the existence of the investment protections contained in the Venezuela-Barbados BIT. This, he considers, entitled him to exclude the 'real risks of the Government acting in a very negative way towards any private investment'.277 He considers that, in the light of such protections, to include such risks would confer an illegitimate benefit on the State:\n\nIf the State can create these risks that it controls, threaten businesses, [...] lower the value of the business, and then they expropriate, if we're going to take all that risk into account, then they get to purchase the company at a very steep discount because of their own risks that they have created hostile towards those companies.278\n\nT2/312/6-12.\n\nT2/366/17-21.\n\nT2/314/21-315/5; Navigant 2, [204]-[213],\n\n184.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Claimants' expert conflates two separate elements in a legal claim of this kind. The first element is a question of liability: are the protections of Article 5 of the BIT engaged by the specific actions of the host State, such that the investor is entitled to be awarded compensation for the loss of his property? As the Tribunal has already observed, the BIT does not prohibit all State taking of private property. Rather it requires a taking for a public interest to be compensated and provides a mechanism by which the appropriate level of compensation can be awarded by an international tribunal. Doubtless, the Treaty seeks to encourage investment between the Contracting States. But it is not an insurance policy or guarantee against all political or other risks associated with such investment.\n\n185.\n\nIf the Tribunal finds liability, then, at the second quantum stage, the Tribunal must determine the 'market value' of the investment. This second element in the claim is in essence an economic question. It depends upon the value that the market would attribute to the investment in question. Returning to the World Bank Guidelines, this is an amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller of the investment immediately prior to the taking in question. Where this is determined by use of a discounted cash flow analysis, the Guidelines specifically invite a consideration of 'the risk associated with such cash flow under realistic circumstances'.279\n\nWorld Bank Guidelines, IV-6.\n\n186.\n\nThis is not a matter of permitting a respondent State to profit from its own wrong. On the contrary, the damages that the Tribunal is empowered by virtue of the Treaty to award are designed to ensure that the private investor is compensated for the loss of its investment. But, in determining the amount of that compensation by reference to a discounted cash flow analysis, the Tribunal should consider the value that a willing buyer would have placed on the investment. In determining this value, one element that a buyer would consider is the risk associated with investing in a particular country. Such a factor is not specific to the particular State measure that gives rise to the claim. That measure must be left out of account in arriving at a valuation, since, according to Article 5, the market valuation must be arrived at 'immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier'. Rather the country risk premium quantifies the general risks, including political risks, of doing business in the particular country, as they applied on that date and as they might then reasonably have been expected to affect the prospects, and thus the value to be ascribed to the likely cash flow of the business going forward.\n\n187.\n\nThe inclusion of a country risk premium is a very common feature of tribunals' calculations of compensation, since, as one tribunal observed 'the fundamental issue of country risk [is] obvious to the least sophisticated businessman'.280 For example, in one recent decision concerning Venezuela, the tribunal adopted a country risk rate of 18%.281\n\n*Himpurna v PT (Persero)* (RL-82), [364],\n\n*Mobil Cerro Negro v PDVSA* (RL-83), [777]; for other recent examples see *Himpurna* ibid (Indonesia: 19%); *Patuha v PT (Persero)* (RL-138), [482] (Indonesia: 21%); *Lemire v Ukraine* (RL-140), [274] (18.5%).\n\n188.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Mr. Kaczmarek's view as to the appropriate basis on which to approach country risk.\n\n189.\n\nRespondent's experts for their part advanced a country risk premium of 14.75%. This was derived from the Ibbotson-Morningstar International Cost of Capital Report for 2009282 and validated by comparison with the method adopted by Professor Damodaran.283\n\nBrailovsky/Flores 1, [157], BF-24.\n\nDamodaran 'Risk premiums for other markets 2009' (BF-27).\n\n190.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, a country risk premium for Venezuela in 2009 of 14.75% represents a reasonable, indeed conservative, premium. In the light of its rejection of Claimants experts' reasoning, it adopts this premium for the purpose of its valuation of the investment.\n\n*(f) Business risk*\n-------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe final element that led to material differences in the Parties' discounted cash flow analyses is the question of whether any discount should be applied to take account of the risk to the reduction in SEMARCA's business overtime.\n\n192.\n\nRespondent, supported by the expert evidence of Professor Wells, Emeritus Professor of International Management at Harvard Business School, argues that SEMARCA's business was subject to a significant risk arising from its concentration on a single customer: PDVSA and its subsidiaries. This risk, it maintains, requires an adjustment to the valuation of the investment at an assumed rate of reduction of 25% per annum.284\n\nFlores T3/561/10-13.\n\n193.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered this risk against the factual evidence that it heard during the hearing. Mr. Figuera, who in 2009 was General Manager of CVP, the subsidiary of PDVSA responsible for relations with private contractors, testified vividly as to the size and scale of the oil industry support services that PDVSA had to call upon on Lake Maracaibo. He concluded that: 'we depended up to a point, a significant point, we depended upon contractors'.285 The Tribunal has already found that the Respondent enacted the Reserve Law not simply so as to reserve to itself the oil services support industry on Lake Maracaibo, but also, to that end, to expropriate the vessels and the business of the private operators in the Lake.\n\nTl/265/12-13.\n\n194.\n\nMr. Figuera was questioned closely by counsel as to the state of PDVSA's planning before May 2009 to internalise the type of support services then provided by SEMARCA and a number of other private companies by buying or manufacturing its own vessels and training its own crews.286 The Tribunal has carefully considered this evidence. It concludes on the facts that, although there were some plans for the further development of PDVSA's own capacity in the provision of support services,287 these were not such as to represent a major risk of loss to SEMARCA's business. PDVSA was at the time itself operating some support services on the Lake. As Mr. Figuera testified 'we have always had a large significant capacity to operate in the lake [but] that's not sufficient'.288 As at 7 May 2009, PDVSA retained a significant dependence on private operators such as SEMARCA and would have done so, were it not for the Reserve Law that enabled it to obtain the SEMARCA Enterprise overnight.\n\nTl/210-234.\n\nPDVSA Annual Report 2008 (R-89), 107.\n\nTl/265/9-11.\n\n195.\n\nThus, the Tribunal rejects on the facts the analogy repeatedly presented in Professor Wells' evidence of the loss of his consulting business with the Harvard Institute for International Development **(HIID),** closed as a result of a decision of his University in 2000.289 In 2009, PDVSA was operating a very large on-going oil extraction business on Lake Maracaibo. The support services for that business were largely, though not exclusively, provided by private companies. That was a matter of conscious choice for PDVSA and for Venezuela, which had elected to nationalise the oil industry itself in 1975, but not the oil services industry that supported it. True it is that this business was conducted between the private contractors and a single customer through short-term contracts. But the underlying industry function required a large developed infrastructure that could not simply be abandoned, if production on Lake Maracaibo were to continue (in contrast to Harvard University's decision to call a halt to the activities of HIID once it was judged not to be appropriate to the University's work). Nor could such a function be replaced by internal service provision without a protracted period of internal investment.\n\nWells 2, [21]\u2014[27]; T3/647-650.\n\n196.\n\nThus, the Tribunal does not consider that a willing buyer, considering the acquisition of this business prior to the enactment of the Reserve Law on 8 May 2009, would have applied a discount for the risk of loss of the business to its customer.\n\n*(g) Conclusion on DCF calculation*\n-----------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore applies the elements that it has found to be appropriate, using the DCF analysis:\n\na) A business consisting of the services performed by the 15 vessels that SEMARCA operated in or from Lake Maracaibo;\n\nb) Including the outstanding accounts receivable, both as an element supporting the working capital of the ongoing business and as being recoverable in itself;\n\nc) Taking the average of the historic cash flows of the business for the four years 2006 -2009;\n\nd) Applying an equity risk of 6.5%;\n\ne) Applying a country risk of 14.75%;\n\nf) But with no additional discount for single customer concentration.\n\n198.\n\nAs mentioned above, during the hearing the Tribunal requested the experts to prepare additional calculations using their existing models including, inter alia, these variables. The experts prepared additional tables of calculations that they presented to the Tribunal in the course of the Parties' closing submissions. These tables have proved of very considerable assistance to the Tribunal in its deliberations. They produced a significantly greater convergence in figures than had been the case in the experts' reports that were filed in the written phase. Nevertheless, there continue to be material differences in the approach adopted by the experts, which in turn affect the figures presented.\n\n199.\n\nAccounts receivable: Claimants' expert extracts the outstanding large amount of accounts receivable from his calculations. He presents this as an additional sum that would have to be valued and included as a separate line item. After adjustments, he calculates the total nonrecurring working capital to be added in this way to be US$16,484,677 (from the total due from PDVSA and PetroSucre as at 8 May 2009 of US$44,888,040).290 Respondent's experts present only the effect of including the accounts receivable as working capital within their calculations.\n\nNavigant Answers to Questions, Slide 10.\n\n200.\n\nScope of business: Claimants' expert assumes that the total size of SEMARCA's business in May 2009 includes the two vessels chartered to Chevron, thus presenting figures for either 11 vessels only (those actually operating on Lake Maracaibo) or 17 vessels. Respondent's experts limit their calculations of additional business to 15 vessels. As the Tribunal has already found that it should exclude the two vessels chartered to Chevron from its analysis, this has the consequence that the two sets of figures cannot be directly compared.\n\n201.\n\nWith these qualifications, the spread of figures presented by the two experts are as follows:\n\n(a) Claimants: US$31,959 million (11 vessels only) (an earnings multiple of 3.79) + US$16,484 million non-recurring accounts receivable = US$48,443 million;\n\n(b) Respondent: US$27,407 million (15 vessels with 100% recoverability of accounts receivable).\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal has already observed that the determination of an appropriate level of compensation based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of this kind is not and cannot be an exact science, but is rather a matter of informed estimation. The Tribunal considers that a willing buyer would have valued the business at approximately US$30 million, but that it would also have been prepared to pay an additional amount of US$16.4 million for the non-recurring accounts receivable, which it would have been entitled to recover in full from PDVSA upon acquisition of the business. The Tribunal therefore arrives at a valuation (excluding pre-award interest) for the purposes of compensation of US$46.4 million.\n\n**C Interest**\n--------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute the payment of interest in principle. Rather, they differ as to (i) the rate at which interest should be calculated; and (ii) whether it should be simple or compound interest.\n\n204.\n\nArticle 5 of the BIT, which the Tribunal has found to be applicable to its determination of compensation generally, mandates the payment of interest 'at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment.' The Parties accept that this is the applicable starting point,291 but do not agree on how such a rate is to be determined.\n\nMemorial, [158]; Counter-Memorial, [158],\n\n205.\n\nClaimants' first proposed rate was the yield on Venezuela's sovereign bonds in US dollars, which averaged 13.4% over the period.292 This they proposed on the basis of an argument that Claimants had, as a result of the expropriation, effectively become unwilling creditors of the Respondent and should be compensated at the same rate that the Respondent must pay to willing lenders. In the Tribunal's view, this approach mistakes the reason why pre-award interest is commonly included in a calculation of compensation in a case such as the present. Interest in such a case simply aims to compensate the claimant from being kept out of its money between the date on which it ought to have been compensated and the date of payment of an enforceable award. Such compensation is not punitive of the Respondent. Rather, as the Treaty's reference to 'normal commercial rate' underlines, it represents the cost of borrowing the sum that the claimant ought to have received over the same period of time. Thus, the appropriate reference point is the cost of borrowing available to Claimants, not the amount that Respondent would have had to pay.\n\nMemorial, [128], Navigant 1, [261],\n\n206.\n\nRespondent proposes the yield on three-month Treasury bonds plus 1.33%, equivalent to an annual rate of 1.43%.293 But, as Claimants point out, this rate does not qualify as a commercial rate since it is the equivalent of an inter-bank rate, rather than a commercial rate available to a trading company from is bankers.\n\nCounter-Memorial, [158],\n\n207.\n\nClaimants propose in the alternative either US prime + 2% or LIBOR + 4%. In each case, over the period 8 May 2009 to 31 March 2013, these both averaged 5.2%.294 Their expert also points out that Tidewater itself, the parent company, was able to borrow at rates between 4.35% and 4.47% over the pre-award interest rate period.295 The Tribunal considers that an interest rate of 4.5% most closely meets the standard agreed between Venezuela and Barbados in Article 5 of the BIT.\n\nMemorial, n 206; Navigant 1, [322],\n\nNavigant 2, [304], Table 32.\n\n208.\n\nThe second issue on which the Parties are in dispute is whether interest ought to be awarded on a simple or compound basis. Claimants submit that 'the prevailing practice of international tribunals'296 is to award compound interest. Respondent argues that simple interest is called for on the basis of both Venezuelan and international law authorities.297\n\nMemorial, [158], citing *Chevron v Ecuador* (CL-167), [555],\n\nCounter-Memorial, [159],\n\n209.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the basis on which interest is to be calculated in the present case flows from the specific language of Article 5 of the BIT, which requires a 'normal commercial rate.' This is the rate at which the Claimants could themselves have borrowed the same sum. Since a commercial bank will typically compound interest due and unpaid on a quarterly basis, the Tribunal considers that its award of interest ought to be so compounded.298\n\nNavigant 2, [307],\n\n**D Costs**\n-----------\n\n210.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal turns to the award of costs in the arbitration. In accordance with Article 61 of the ICSID Convention it is obliged to determine how and by whom the costs of and associated with these proceedings are to be borne, as to which it retains a wide discretion.\n\n211.\n\nOn 11 July 2014, pursuant to a direction given by the President at the conclusion of the hearing and agreed by counsel for each of the Parties, each Party filed with the Tribunal a Statement of Costs. Each Party has paid its portion of the advance on the administrative fees and expenses requested by the Centre, amounting in each case to US$450,000. In addition:\n\n(a) Claimants seek reimbursement of the fees of counsel and experts amounting to US$7,534,361.33 plus expenses of US$177,739.31;\n\n(b) Respondent seeks reimbursement of the fees of counsel and experts amounting to US$8,479,879 plus expenses of US$520,538.00.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it reserved the costs occasioned by its Decision on Jurisdiction.299 At that stage, each Party prevailed on one of the two grounds of jurisdiction that had originally been asserted. Each of those bases of challenge to the Tribunal's jurisdiction was substantial and properly required the Tribunal's consideration and determination. The Tribunal's Decision resulted in the claims of a number of the original claimants falling outside its jurisdiction. But the claims of the present Claimants under the Barbados BIT were held to be within its jurisdiction. Therefore, as regards the costs of and occasioned by the hearing of Respondent's objection to jurisdiction, the Tribunal holds that each Party must bear equally its share of the administrative fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and of the Centre and bear its own costs.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [199(7)].\n\n213.\n\nThe position is different so far as concerns the merits phase of the proceeding. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that the Claimants have overall succeeded in their claim. The result is that they have been put to a great deal of time, trouble and expense in order to obtain compensation that Venezuela had vouchsafed to provide under the terms of the Barbados BIT and ought to have so provided in 2009.\n\n214.\n\nAlthough the costs that the Parties each claim to have incurred are very large for the scale of the case, the Tribunal does not consider that either Party caused the other to incur substantial wasted costs as a result of the manner in which it conducted the proceedings.\n\n215.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal notes that the sums that it has in the result awarded to Claimants are very much less than the US$234 million (including interest) that Claimants sought in the written phase.300 In part, this was because Claimants pursued a claim to what it called 'ex *post* damages', which the Tribunal has rejected on the law. This claim did result in significant wasted costs in the evidentiary phase, since it required Respondent (and the Tribunal) to consider the plausibility of various alleged prospects for the expansion of SEMARCA's deep water support business in Venezuela in the period after the expropriation.\n\nNavigant 2, [296] Table 30.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal considers therefore that it is prepared to award Claimants a portion of their costs of the merits phase, but not a full indemnity. In all the circumstances, it considers that a reasonable portion that Respondent ought to bear is US$2.5 million.\n\n**IV AWARD**\n------------\n\n217.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal hereby decides that:\n\n(1) Respondent has expropriated Claimants' investment in SEMARCA without payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation;\n\n(2) Claimant is therefore entitled to compensation in accordance with Article 5 of the BIT;\n\n(3) The Tribunal assesses the principal amount of the compensation to be paid as US$46.4 million;\n\n(4) In addition, Claimant is entitled to interest from 8 May 2009 to the date of payment of this Award at the rate of 4.5% per annum compounded quarterly;\n\n(5) Each Party shall bear its equal share of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal members and of the Centre, and shall bear its own costs of and occasioned by Respondent's challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal;\n\n(6) Respondent shall pay to Claimants the sum of US$2.5 million in partial reimbursement of Claimants' costs of and occasioned by the merits phase of these proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on Application for Revision", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2015-07-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Application for Revision\n------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 13 March 2015, the present Tribunal issued an Award in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, brought by Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. (**Tidewater**) against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (**Venezuela**).1\n\nSave as otherwise expressly provided in this Decision, the Tribunal adopts the defined terms in the Award.\n\n2.\n\nThe Award concerned Tidewater's claim for compensation arising out of the expropriation of its oil services business in Venezuela.\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal found that Venezuela had expropriated Tidewater's investment in its Venezuelan subsidiary SEMARCA without payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. It determined that Tidewater was entitled to be compensated for that expropriation, and calculated the principal amount of the compensation to be paid as US$46.4 million.\n\n**II. PROCEDURE**\n-----------------\n\n4.\n\nVenezuela filed with the Secretary-General of the Centre an Application for Revision pursuant to Article 51(1) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States 1965 (**Convention**) and Arbitration Rule 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules dated 20 March 2015 (**Application).** At the same time, Venezuela also sought a provisional stay of enforcement of the Award pursuant to Article 51(4) of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 54(1).\n\n5.\n\nOn 23 March 2015, Tidewater filed a document entitled Respondents' Preliminary Response to the Republic's Application for Revision (**Tidewater's Preliminary Response**). Tidewater submitted that the Application was inadmissible and should be dismissed.\n\n6.\n\nOn 24 March 2015, the Application was registered by the Secretary-General.\n\n7.\n\nOn 31 March 2015, all members of the Tribunal that rendered the Award having expressed their willingness to take part in the consideration of the Application, the Tribunal was reconstituted to consider the Application in accordance with Article 51(3) of the Convention.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 31 March 2015, the Tribunal invited the parties to submit a further exchange of submissions on the Application.\n\n9.\n\nOn 3 April 2015, Venezuela submitted its Additional Observations on its Application (**Venezuela's Additional Observations**).\n\n10.\n\nOn 9 April 2015, Tidewater submitted its Rejoinder to the Republic's Additional Observations on its Application (**Tidewater's Rejoinder**).\n\n11.\n\nOn 15 April 2015, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to seek their agreement to the application *mutatis mutandis* of its first procedural order2 in the underlying proceeding to the Application. It also indicated that, having had the benefit of two rounds of written submissions, it did not regard an oral hearing as necessary. However, in view of the terms of ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 29, the Tribunal informed the Parties that they were entitled to an oral hearing unless they consented otherwise.\n\nA reference to the procedural directions contained in the Minutes of the First Session of the Tribunal dated 24 January 2011.\n\n12.\n\nBy letters dated 17 and 20 April 2015, the Parties each gave their consent to these proposals. Accordingly, the Tribunal has, by agreement, dispensed with a hearing and proceeded to determine the Application on the basis of the Parties' written submissions.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 June 2015, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 38(1).\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated on the Application in person at the seat of the Centre in Washington DC and by other means.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. Venezuela's submissions**\n------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nVenezuela's Application is based on what it describes as an error in the Tribunal's damages calculation.\n\n16.\n\nIt describes the error in the following way:\n\na. At paragraph 197 of the Award, the Tribunal recorded the assumptions that it had determined to adopt for the purpose of the discounted cash flow (**DCF**) valuation of Tidewater's business:\n\ni. a business consisting of services performed by the 15 vessels that SEMARCA operated in or from Lake Maracaibo;\n\nii. the outstanding accounts receivable would be included, both as an element supporting the working capital of the ongoing business and as being recoverable in itself;\n\niii. taking the average of the historic cash flows of the business for the four years 2006 - 2009;\n\niv. applying an equity risk of 6.5%;\n\nv. applying a country risk of 14.75%;\n\nvi. but with no additional discount for single customer concentration.\n\nb. During the hearing, the Tribunal had requested the valuation experts from both sides to prepare additional calculations, applying their existing valuation models but with various alternative variables.3\n\nc. At paragraph 201 of the Award, the Tribunal recorded the results of the experts' calculations applying the elements it had identified at paragraph 197. It recorded the valuations produced as follows:\n\n(a) Claimants: US$31,959 million (11 vessels only) (an earnings multiple of 3.79) + US$16,484 million non-recurring accounts receivable = $48,443m;\n\n(b) Respondent: US$27,407 million (15 vessels with 100% recoverability of accounts receivable).\n\nd. After observing that the determination of compensation 'is not and cannot be an exact science, but is rather a matter of informed estimation', the Tribunal valued Tidewater's business at US$30 million, to which it added $16.4 million for the nonrecurring accounts receivable to arrive at a total compensation figure of US$46.4 million. Venezuela submits that in reaching that result, 'the Tribunal clearly had in mind the calculations of the parties' respective experts set forth in paragraph 201 of the Award'.4\n\ne. The valuation recorded for the Claimants was based on the presentation made by Tidewater's expert, Mr Kaczmarek, at the hearing. Venezuela submits that the actual figure presented by Mr Kaczmarek corresponding to the variables adopted in paragraph 197 was not US$31,959 million but $13,917 million. Consequently, the total recorded in paragraph 201(a) should have been US$30,401 million (US$13,917 million + US$16,484 million).5\n\nApplication, [6].\n\nApplication, [8].\n\nApplication, [9].\n\n17.\n\nVenezuela submits that this involves the discovery of facts that are of such a nature as decisively to affect the Award. In its submission, if the Tribunal had been aware of the fact that the figures presented in paragraph 201 did not correspond to the experts' presentations, the Tribunal would have awarded a different amount of compensation,6 and requests that the Tribunal revise the award accordingly.7\n\nApplication, [11], Additional Observations, [2], [6].\n\nApplication, [13].\n\n18.\n\nVenezuela rejects Tidewater's suggestion that the correct procedure for addressing the alleged error is an application for the Award to be rectified pursuant to Article 49 of the Convention and Rule 49 of the Arbitration Rules. It submits that the amount awarded 'cannot easily be corrected without a substantive review by the Tribunal' and if the impact of the error 'requires review and analysis by the Tribunal, it should not be determined in an application for rectification'.8\n\nAdditional Observations, [3], citing *Railroad Development Corporation(RDC) v Republic of Guatemala* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23 Decision on Claimant's Request for Supplementation and Rectification of Award (18 January 2013), [43], [47].\n\n19.\n\nVenezuela also rejects Tidewater's argument that the alleged error may not have had a material impact on the amount of the compensation awarded.9 It submits that, although Tidewater's expert did not present a figure based on a business consisting of 15 vessels, it is possible to scale up his figure for 11 boats or scale down his figure for 17 boats (which was US$24,435 million). Venezuela accepts that the experts treated accounts receivable differently: Venezuela's experts including it entirely in the DCF calculation and Tidewater's expert including an additional line item of non-recurring accounts receivable in addition to including recurring accounts receivable in the valuation of the business itself. But it submits that this did not affect the Tribunal's ability to compare the valuations.\n\nAdditional Observations, [5].\n\n**B. Tidewater's submissions**\n------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nTidewater rejects the Application. It submits that a transcription error does not constitute a new fact in terms of Article 51 of the Convention, but is properly a matter for rectification under Article 49, and the Application is consequently inadmissible. Even if the Tribunal's error did constitute a new fact, there is no basis for the conclusion that it 'decisively' affected the ultimate Award.\n\n21.\n\nIn its Preliminary Response, Tidewater accepted that the Tribunal had made an 'apparent error' in the transcription of figures from Mr Kaczmarek's presentation.10 In its Rejoinder, Tidewater submits that the Tribunal's adoption of the US$31,959 million figure may have been deliberate. Having recognised that the parties' experts had not produced comparable scenarios, it may have deliberately chosen to adopt a range bounded by a high-end figure produced by Tidewater's expert and a low-end figure produced by Venezuela's expert.11\n\nPreliminary Response, 1.\n\nRejoinder, [3].\n\n22.\n\nEven if the alleged error identified by Venezuela constituted a new fact for this purpose, Tidewater submits that it is 'utter speculation' to suggest that the error had any impact on the Award, let alone a 'decisive[]' one:12\n\na. The Tribunal recorded that there remained 'material differences in the approach adopted by the experts' that limited the meaningfulness of the spread of figures, and that the two sets of figures could not 'be directly compared'.\n\nb. The Award does not specify how the spread of values in paragraph 201 translated into the Tribunal's determination of the appropriate level of compensation, but those differences meant that it cannot be assumed that the Tribunal intended to adopt a figure somewhere within the spread of figures in that paragraph.13\n\nc. In particular, the fact that Tidewater's expert had not prepared a valuation based on 15 vessels meant that the 11-vessel figure 'substantially underestimates [Tidewater's] assessment of the true value of SEMARCA'. Thus, Venezuela's assumption that the Tribunal would not have awarded US$46.4 million because that value exceeds US$30,401 million is unfounded,14 as the Tribunal would have known that this valuation was underestimated.\n\nd. In addition, Venezuela's approach ignores that the parties' experts took different approaches to the treatment of accounts receivable, and that the Tribunal adopted Mr Kaczmarek's approach, which further undermines the assumption that the appropriate amount of compensation would fall within the range set by the figures in paragraph 201 of the Award.\n\ne. The Tribunal's assessment likely reflected other considerations as well, such as SEMARCA's financial performance prior to the expropriation. Tidewater submits that if the Tribunal had awarded total compensation of US$27,407 million plus interest, Venezuela would have 'effectively nationalised' SEMARCA's business as a whole for total compensation equivalent to slightly more than half the company's annual revenue in 2009.15\n\nPreliminary Response, 2.\n\nRejoinder, [13].\n\nRejoinder, [13]-[14].\n\nRejoinder, [15].\n\n**IV. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. Requirements of Article 51(1) of the Convention**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nPursuant to Article 51(1) of the Convention, the sole ground upon which an applicant may request revision of an award is 'discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, provided that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant and the applicant's ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence.'\n\n24.\n\nRevision is one of a closed list of remedies provided in the Convention by way of specific exceptions from the fundamental principle of the finality of the award enshrined in Article 53.16\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention, [41].\n\n25.\n\nThe test for revision contains three essential elements:\n\na. That a fact has been discovered;\n\nb. That it is of such a nature as 'decisively to affect the award'; and,\n\nc. That it was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant when the award was rendered (the applicant's ignorance of the fact not being due to its negligence).\n\n26.\n\nUnless the Applicant can establish all three of these elements, its application will not meet the requirements of Article 51 and must be dismissed.\n\n**B. The relevant paragraph of the Award**\n------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIn the present case, the Application is founded upon the reference in paragraph 201(a) of the Award which states:\n\nWith these qualifications, the spread of figures presented by the two experts are as follows:\n\n(a) Claimants: US$31,959 million (11 vessels only) (an earnings multiple of 3.79) + US$16,484 million non-recurring accounts receivable = US$48,443 million;\n\n28.\n\nVenezuela submits that the figure that was recorded in the document submitted by Claimants' expert (on the assumptions found by the Tribunal) was US$13,917 million not US$31,959 million.\n\n29.\n\nOn reviewing the document referred to in this paragraph of its Award for the purpose of the present Application,17 the Tribunal finds that there is a clerical error in its transcription from the underlying document there cited. The sub-paragraph should correctly read, and should be read as stating:\n\n(a) Claimants: US$13,917 million (11 vessels only) (an earnings multiple of 1.65) + US$16,484 million non-recurring accounts receivable = US$30,401 million.\n\nNavigant PowerPoint Presentation: Response to Tribunal Questions from 11 June 2014, dated 12 June 2014, 8.\n\n30.\n\nTidewater submitted in the Preliminary Response to the Application18 that such a transcription error ought properly to have been the subject of an application for rectification under Article 49(2), a procedure that is specifically designed for the correction of an obvious clerical error.19\n\nPreliminary Response, 1.\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/09/1 Decision Regarding the Claimant's and the Respondent's Requests for Corrections (Bernadini P, Williams & Dupuy, 15 December 2014), [38], discussing the equivalent provision in the Additional Facility Rules.\n\n31.\n\nVenezuela however submits that rectification is not the appropriate course in the present case, because the error 'requires review and analysis by the Tribunal' and 'cannot easily be corrected without a substantive review by the Tribunal.'20 It has therefore chosen to maintain its application for revision under Article 51.\n\nAdditional Observations, [3].\n\n32.\n\nIn these circumstances, Venezuela must meet all of the elements required by Article 51, each of which is indispensible to a claim for revision. The Tribunal considers first, in section C, the requirement of the discovery of a new fact unknown to the Tribunal and the applicant and then, in section D, the requirement of decisive effect on the award.\n\n**C. The requirement of discovery of a new and unknown fact**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nVenezuela submits that the new fact is the knowledge that the correct figure for an 11-vessel business was $13,917m rather than $31,959m.21 It submits that if the Tribunal had been aware of this fact, the Award would have been between $27,407m and $35,462m (the 11 vessel figure produced by Tidewater's expert scaled up to 15 vessels).\n\nAdditional Observations, [6].\n\n34.\n\nVenezuela cites no authority for the proposition that a transcription error can constitute a new fact for the purpose of revision.\n\n35.\n\nFor this purpose, the Tribunal and the parties must be taken to be aware of every fact established by the material before the Tribunal. As the International Court of Justice has held in an application for revision:\n\nThe Court must be taken to be aware of every fact established by the material before it, whether or not it expressly refers to such fact in its judgment; similarly, a party cannot argue that it was unaware of a fact which was set forth in the pleadings of its opponent, or in a document annexed to those pleadings or otherwise regularly brought before the Court.22\n\n*Application for Revision and Interpretation of the Judgment of 24 February 1982 in the Case concerning the Continental Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)* [1985] ICJ Rep 192, [19].\n\n36.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Venezuela has not identified a new 'fact' in terms of Article 51(1).\n\n37.\n\nIf the 'fact' on which Venezuela relies is that Tidewater's expert's DCF valuation for an 11-vessel business was $13,917m, not $31,959m, then this fact is not new, nor has been discovered since the Award was rendered. On the contrary, it was contained in the document submitted by the expert, as part of a set of calculations requested by the Tribunal and submitted on the last day of the hearing.\n\n38.\n\nIf the alleged new 'fact' is the knowledge that the Tribunal used the wrong figure, neither does that qualify. A fact must have been in existence (but undiscovered) at the time of the Award in order to engage Article 51(1). If that knowledge constituted a new 'fact' then any alleged error made by a Tribunal would engage Article 51(1). That would directly conflict with the principle of finality set forth in Article 53, which provides that the award 'shall not be subject to any appeal' or to any other remedy, save for the carefully confined procedures enumerated in the Convention.\n\n39.\n\nAs a consequence, the Tribunal holds that the first element indispensable for an application for revision has not been met and accordingly the Application must be dismissed on that basis. However, and without prejudice to that primary finding, the Tribunal also considers whether, if this clerical error met the first element of the test, it is of 'such a nature as decisively to affect the award'. The Tribunal approaches this question by reference to the Award itself.\n\n**D. Effect on the Award**\n--------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe two documents from which the figures set forth in paragraph 201 of the Award are drawn consist of illustrative tables of figures, prepared at the Tribunal's request on the penultimate day of the hearing and submitted on the last day of the hearing. They show in tabular form, and without further elaboration, the effect in the respective expert's view of different assumptions upon that expert's own calculations.23\n\nThey are defined respectively in the Glossary of Defined Terms as: **Navigant Answers to Questions** 'PowerPoint Presentation: Response to Tribunal Questions from 11 June 2014 (12 June 2014)'; **Brailovsky/Flores Answers to Questions** 'PowerPoint Presentation: Respondent's Experts' Answers to Tribunal's Questions (12 June 2014)'.\n\n41.\n\nThese documents did not represent the experts' respective opinions as to the appropriate valuation to be applied to the business that the Tribunal has found to have been expropriated. Claimant's expert advanced an *ex ante* valuation of the business of US$81.68 million, whereas Respondent arrived at an *ex ante* valuation of US$2.9 million.24\n\nAward, [167].\n\n42.\n\nAt paragraph 198, the Tribunal records its appreciation for these illustrative tables but goes on to note:25\n\nThey produced a significantly greater convergence in figures than had been the case in the experts' reports that were filed in the written phase. *Nevertheless there continue to be**material differences in the approach adopted by the experts, which in turn affect the figures presented.*\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n43.\n\nThis was particularly the case with two of the variables that, on the Tribunal's analysis, 'have a material effect on the valuation of Claimants' investment in SEMARCA'26: (a) the treatment of accounts receivable and (b) the scope of the business to be valued.\n\n[169].\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal approached each of these elements separately in its Award. It ultimately held that a separate element of the total amount of compensation ought to be attributed to the value of the business, based on an assumption of a scope of business of 15 vessels, and a separate element to non-recurring accounts receivable, before arriving at a total valuation for purposes of compensation of US$46.4 million.27\n\n[202].\n\n***1. Accounts receivable***\n----------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal explains the divergence between the experts in the approach adopted in their illustrative tables as to accounts receivable in paragraph 199, in which it observes:\n\nAccounts receivable: Claimants' expert extracts the outstanding large amount of accounts receivable from his calculations. He presents this as an additional sum that would have to be valued and included as a separate line item. After adjustments, he calculates the total nonrecurring working capital to be added in this way to be US$16,484,677 (from the total due from PDVSA and PetroSucre as at 8 May 2009 of US$44,888,040).28 Respondent's experts present only the effect of including the accounts receivable as working capital within their calculations.\n\nNavigant Answers to Questions, Slide 10.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal had already held that 'the investment that was lost must include outstanding unpaid accounts receivable'29 because they 'constitute a valuable asset of the business' and 'a willing buyer would so regard them.'30 It therefore decided 'to include SEMARCA's outstanding accounts receivable as at 7 May 2009 in determining the value to be ascribed to the business.'31\n\n[175].\n\n[176].\n\n[177].\n\n47.\n\nHowever, as the Tribunal observes in paragraph 199, the approach adopted by the respective experts in their respective illustrative tables was not directly comparable, as regards the valuation to be ascribed to accounts receivable that should be treated as 'non-recurring.' The total amount of outstanding working capital due from PDVSA and PetroSucre as at the valuation date was US$44,888,040.32 Respondent's experts did not present a separate figure for non-recurring working capital, and instead calculated the value of the whole business (including working capital) at the lesser sum of US$27,407 million. Claimants' expert on the other hand treated part of the total outstanding accounts receivable as non-recurring, and treated US$16.4 million of the $44,888 million total as being in that category.\n\nCf. the total valuation of the business determined by the Tribunal for purposes of compensation and awarded of US$46.4 million.\n\n48.\n\nThis produced what was, in the Tribunal's view as stated in paragraph 198, a 'material difference[] in the approach adopted by the experts, which in turn affect[s] the figures presented.'\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal had already decided to include the accounts receivable in its valuation as a valuable asset of the business. At paragraph 202, it held that a willing buyer would have paid an additional amount for the non-recurring accounts receivable 'which it would have been entitled to recover in full from PDVSA upon the acquisition of the business.'\n\n50.\n\nIn order to arrive at a figure attributable to this element, the Tribunal could derive no assistance from the Respondent's experts. They had been instructed by counsel to exclude accounts receivable from the valuations in their expert reports.33 The figure presented in their illustrative tables prepared at the Tribunal's request did not include a separate calculation for the non-recurring portion of accounts receivable - an element that the Tribunal held should be included within the valuation of the business. Therefore, as the Tribunal explains in paragraph 202, it had to estimate a figure to be added to address this element. Out of a total amount of outstanding accounts receivable of US$44,888 million, the Tribunal adopted Claimants' expert's figure of US$16.4 million as attributable to non-recurring working capital in making its own calculations. It added this sum to the Tribunal's valuation of business (excluding non-recurring working capital) of US$30 million, in order to arrive at the total figure that it awarded of US$46.4 million.34\n\n[174].\n\n[202].\n\n***2. Scope of business***\n--------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe second material divergence between the experts in the approach adopted in their illustrative tables was as to the scope of the business to be valued. The Tribunal explains this divergence in paragraph 200, in which it observes:\n\nScope of business: Claimants' expert assumes that the total size of SEMARCA's business in May 2009 includes the two vessels chartered to Chevron, thus presenting figures for either 11 vessels only (those actually operating on Lake Maracaibo) or 17 vessels. Respondent's experts limit their calculations of additional business to 15 vessels. As the Tribunal has already found that it should exclude the two vessels chartered to Chevron from its analysis, this has the consequence that the two sets of figures cannot be directly compared.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal had already held that SEMARCA's business as at 7 May 2009 was not limited to the 11 vessels then operating on Lake Maracaibo.35 On the contrary, it found that the business must be valued taking account of the business represented by the four vessels operating in the Gulf of Paria, holding that '[t]he value of the business represented by the operations of these vessels must therefore be added to the 11 vessels actually stationed on Lake Maracaibo.'36 On the other hand, the Tribunal held that the business represented by two further vessels contracting to Chevron should be excluded, for the reasons explained in paragraph 172.\n\n[171].\n\nIdem.\n\n53.\n\nThus, the Tribunal held that 'the business is to be treated as having an assumed scope, based upon its historical operations, represented by the cash flow generated by 15 vessels.'37\n\n[173]\n\n54.\n\nThe figures produced by Respondent's experts in their illustrative table did assume 15 vessels. That figure, applying the other assumptions found by the Tribunal, resulted in a valuation of US$27,407 million, as recorded in paragraph 201(b).\n\n55.\n\nHowever, as the Tribunal noted in paragraph 200, Claimants' expert presented calculations based only upon either 11 vessels or 17 vessels. The 11-vessel figure produced the figure now stated as corrected above in paragraph 28 of US$13,917 million (an earnings multiple of 1.65). Venezuela points out in its Application that the figure put forward by Claimants' expert on the corresponding assumptions for 17 vessels was US$24.4 million.38\n\nAbove, [19].\n\n56.\n\nOn this issue, therefore, in contrast to the position in relation to non-recurring accounts receivable, only Respondent's experts had produced a figure in their illustrative table that was referable to the scope of the business based upon 15 vessels that the Tribunal had decided it ought to apply.\n\n57.\n\nThe figure that Venezuela pleads ought to have appeared in paragraph 201(a) is one based upon an 11-vessel business that the Tribunal decided was not the appropriate basis upon which to value the business that was expropriated. The use of such a figure would have undercompensated the Claimants for their loss. On the other hand, the Tribunal had specifically rejected a 17-vessel scope of business.\n\n58.\n\nVenezuela's suggestion in the Application that either the 11-vessel or 17-vessel figure could be simply proportionately scaled up or down to produce a 15-vessel figure was not put before the Tribunal during the main proceedings. Neither Venezuela nor its expert offered such a calculation in the hearing. It was not part of the evidence before the Tribunal and it played no part in the reasoning in the Award. Thus only Respondent's experts had proffered a 15-vessel calculation.\n\n***3. Conclusion on effect on the Award***\n------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nParagraph 201 appears in the Award immediately after the two paragraphs already cited in which the Tribunal explains why 'the two sets of figures cannot be directly compared'.39 Its function is, as stated, to record 'the spread of figures presented by the two experts'.40\n\nAward, [200].\n\n[201]\n\n60.\n\nIn view of the lack of comparability, the Tribunal had to take its own approach to determining valuation. It had already observed that:\n\nAlthough it is for the Claimants to prove that they have suffered some damage in order to be awarded compensation, it is for the Tribunal itself to determine the amount of compensation. This is necessarily a matter of the Tribunal's informed estimation in the light of all the evidence available to it.41\n\n[164], citing *Sapphire International, SPP v Egypt, Chorzow Factory, Rumeli v Kazakhstan* (Decision on Annulment).\n\n61.\n\nParagraph 202, which immediately follows the paragraph setting forth the figures presented by the experts, returns to emphasise that the Tribunal must make its own determination. It opens by stating:\n\nThe Tribunal has already observed that the determination of an appropriate level of compensation based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of this kind is not and cannot be an exact science, but is rather a matter of informed estimation. The Tribunal considers that a willing buyer would have valued the business at approximately US$30 million...\n\n62.\n\nThis formulation makes clear that the Tribunal has not adopted the figures put forward by either experts, whether in their original reports or in their illustrative tables. Rather it has taken into account the totality of the evidence presented to it in determining the appropriate level of compensation to be awarded, based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. This was a process that, as the Tribunal had observed, 'does present particular difficulties in view of the character of SEMARCA's business.'42 The resulting determination of an appropriate level of compensation, as it held, 'is not and cannot be an exact science.'\n\n[166].\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that, even if (which it has found not to be the case) Venezuela's application were admissible as being based upon a new and unknown fact, it is not, on analysis of the reasoning in the award, of such a nature 'as decisively to affect the award.'\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n64.\n\n**For the above reasons, the Tribunal decides that:**\n\n**(1) The Applicant's application for revision is dismissed;**\n\n**(2) Enforcement of the Award is no longer stayed;**\n\n**(3) As to the costs of the proceedings:**\n\n**(a) No fees and expenses shall be charged by the members of the Tribunal;**\n\n**(b) The Applicant shall bear the expenses of the Centre; and**\n\n**(b) Each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred by reason of the Application.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2016-02-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 9, 2015, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the \"**Applicant**\" or \"**Venezuela**\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") an application for annulment (the \"**Application for Annulment**\") of the award rendered on July 7, 2015 in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 (the \"**Award**\"), brought by Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. (the \"**Respondents**\" or \"**Tidewater**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\") and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n3.\n\nIn its Application, Venezuela requested the Secretary-General to provisionally stay enforcement of the Award (\"**Stay Request**\") concerning the amount of US$46.4 million plus interest in favor of Tidewater.1 Venezuela also requested that the stay be maintained until the *ad hoc* Committee issued its Decision on the Application for Annulment.2\n\nApplication for Annulment, para. 18.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n4.\n\nOn July 16, 2015, the Secretary-General registered the Application for Annulment and notified the Parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n5.\n\nOn 9 September 2015, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that the *ad hoc* Committee (the \"**Committee**\") had been constituted in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Committee was composed of Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somali) as President; Tan Sri Dato' Cecil W. M. Abraham (Malaysian) and Professor Rolf Knieper (German), as Members.\n\n6.\n\nThe annulment proceeding was thus deemed to have begun on the above date. The Parties were also informed that Mr. Marco Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n7.\n\nOn September 17, 2015, the Committee decided to extend the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award until it ruled on such request after its first session. The Committee also fixed a schedule to receive written submissions regarding Venezuela's Stay Request.\n\n8.\n\nOn October 7, 2015, in accordance with the schedule fixed by the Committee, Venezuela filed a submission in support of the continuation of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award (\"**Venezuela's Stay Submission**\"). The Stay Submission was accompanied by Exhibits R-88, R-131 to R-145, and by Legal Authorities RL-180 to RL-187.\n\n9.\n\nOn October 28, 2015, Tidewater filed a reply to Venezuela's submission of October 7, 2015 (\"**Tidewater's Reply**\"). The Reply was accompanied by Exhibits C-1 to C-5, and Legal Authorities CL-1 to CL-39.\n\n10.\n\nOn November 23, 2015, the Committee held its first session with the Parties in Paris, France. Immediately after the first session, the Committee also heard oral argument (\"**Stay Hearing**\") on the issue of the Stay Request.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\na. *The Applicant's Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n11.\n\nVenezuela first argues that Tidewater has the burden of proof and that it has not shown \"prejudice\"3 or \"good cause why a lifting of the stay is necessary.\"4 In its view, Tidewater would not be harmed if the Stay Request is granted because interest is provided for in the Award. Therefore, if Tidewater prevails in the annulment proceeding, interest would accrue at an annual compound rate of 4.5% on all amounts awarded during the period of time that this proceeding is pending.5\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, para. 4.\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, para. 5.\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, para. 5; Hearing Transcript, p. 27, lines 1-7.\n\n12.\n\nThe Applicant further contends that, unlike Tidewater, the lifting of the stay would harm Venezuela when Tidewater tries to enforce the Award while the amount of damages to be paid is uncertain.6 At the Stay Hearing, the Applicant's counsel argued that such enforcement is \"*prejudicial for Venezuela because we don't receive a settlement for that. We don't receive a release of liability for the payment as made*.\"7\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 27, lines 1-7.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 80, lines 4-6.\n\n13.\n\nSecond, Venezuela claims in its Stay Submission that the continuation of the provisional stay of enforcement has become \"standard practice\"8 and is \"almost automatic\"9 in ICSID annulment proceedings. In support of its proposition, Venezuela asserts that \"*out of 42 committees (other than this Committee), only three have refused to grant the continuation of the stay.*\"10 Venezuela concludes that there are no \"unusual\" or \"exceptional\" circumstances in this case that would justify a departure from this practice.11\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, para. 5.\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, para. 5, citing *V\u00edctor Pey Casado and Foundation \"Presidente Allende\" v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on the Republic of Chile's Application for a Stay of Enforcement of the Award, May 5, 2010, para. 25.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, para. 6.\n\n14.\n\nThird, Venezuela submits that its Stay Request should not be viewed as a way to delay payment.12 To the contrary, Venezuela is \"*just exercising a right under the Convention*\"13 as there can be \"*no doubt that there are serious grounds for the annulment of the Award.*\"14 In any event, Venezuela submits that the Parties agreed to an accelerated schedule for the filing of the written pleadings on annulment.15\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, para. 9.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 27, lines 9-11.\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, para. 9.\n\nHearing Transcript, p.16, lines 6-11.\n\n15.\n\nThe Applicant also points out to Venezuela's \"*track record of providing compensation for nationalizations*,\"16 including the settlements reached with companies affected by the 2009 nationalization at issue in this case. In addition, Venezuela has not defaulted on its sovereign debt and has complied (and will continue to comply) with its international obligations.17\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, para. 6.\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, para. 8.\n\n16.\n\nFinally, Venezuela argues that there is no legal or factual basis to partially lift the suspension of the enforcement of the Award.18 In its view, a partial lifting of the Stay of Enforcement \"*necessarily implies a pre-judgment of the merits*\"19 because the Application is directed to annul the amount of damages awarded by the Tribunal in the original proceeding.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 28, line 22; p. 29, lines 1-6.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 28, line 22; p. 29, lines 1-6.\n\n17.\n\nVenezuela submits that the section of the Award that relates to the calculation of damages must be annulled because the Tribunal failed to state reasons and committed a manifest excess of powers and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. If that section of the Award is annulled, it would be up to a new tribunal to calculate the damages to be awarded.20\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 29, lines 17-22.\n\n18.\n\nTherefore, in light of the above reasons, Venezuela concludes that its Stay Request should be granted.\n\nb. *The Respondents' Position*\n------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondents first oppose the Stay Request by arguing that Venezuela, as the requesting party, has the burden of proving that a stay is required. In their view, Venezuela has failed to meet that burden.21\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 22.\n\n20.\n\nTo support this proposition, Tidewater points to the language of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules. According to the Respondents, an annulment committee has discretion to grant a stay of enforcement, under Convention Article 52(5), only if the *party seeking a stay* establishes that a stay is *required* under the circumstances.22 Moreover, Rule 54(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules requires the requesting party to \"*specify the circumstances that require the stay*.\"23\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 22.\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 22.\n\n21.\n\nSecond, Tidewater asserts that contrary to the Applicant's claim, the Stay Request Venezuela seeks is not ICSID \"standard practice.\" In its view, Venezuela's argument that only three out of 42 annulment committees have refused to grant the continuation of the stay is misleading because it fails to mention that in many of those 42 cases, the request was granted only on the condition that the award debtor post a security.24\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 22.\n\n22.\n\nThird, Tidewater contends that Venezuela's Stay Request is dilatory in nature.25 In support of its position, Tidewater cites to *MTD v. Chile* which held that \"*a stay is not appropriate where the annulment application is merely 'dilatory* '.\"26\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 27.\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 27, citing to *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. The Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on the Respondent's Request for a Continued Stay of Execution, June 1, 2005, para. 28 (Ex. RL-185).\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondents argue that even assuming that Venezuela can show \"*serious**grounds for annulment*\" of the disputed amount of US$10,938 million of the Award, there are no grounds at all for annulment of the undisputed US$35,462 million portion of the Award.27 Therefore, the Stay Request regarding that unchallenged debt serves \"*no purpose other than to delay its inevitable enforcement*.\"28\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 27.\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 27.\n\n24.\n\nTidewater claims that Venezuela has not established that a stay of enforcement of the \"whole\" Award is required.29 Venezuela's Application concerns \"*a fraction of the total compensatio* n\"30 because it challenges only the portion of the Award that granted compensation *exceeding* \"*the highest conceivable amount that could have been calculated using even [Claimants'] own expert's DCF model and applying the elements that the Tribunal determined should be employed.*\"31\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 27\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 3.\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 3.\n\n25.\n\nTidewater further contends that the portion of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal that does *not* exceed the above amount, is \"*completely unchallenged and indisputably final*.\"32 Accordingly, Venezuela must pay that portion of the Award regardless of the outcome of this annulment proceeding.\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 3.\n\n26.\n\nIn light of the above reasons, Respondents request that the Committee deny Venezuela's Stay Request. They further ask that \"*at a minimum, the Committee should lift the stay with respect to the portion of the Award that Venezuela's Application does not dispute \u2014specifically, US$35,462 million, plus interest.*\"33\n\nTidewater's Reply, para. 32.\n\n**III. RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE ICSID CONVENTION AND THE ARBITRATION RULES**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an**application in writing addressed to the Secretary General...*\n\n\u2026\n\n*(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision.**If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.*\n\n28.\n\nArticle 53 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.

THE ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n-------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe first task of the Committee is to analyse the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules relevant to the present case. According to Article 52(1) of the Convention \"either party\" may initiate the annulment proceedings, and thus seek a remedy against the award, if it feels aggrieved by the findings of the award or the procedure leading towards it. Although the Convention does not explicitly refer to a request for annulment of part of an award, it specifically gives the *ad hoc* Committee, under Article 52(3), the authority to annul the award or any part thereof. In its Application for Annulment dated July 9, 2015, Venezuela requests, inter alia, that: \"*b. the stay of execution of the Award be maintained until the Decision of the ad hoc Committee on this Application for Annulment*.\" It also requests that: \"*c. the Award be partially annulled under Article 52(1), subparagraphs (b), (d) and (e).*\"34\n\nApplication for Annulment, pp. 9-10.\n\n31.\n\nWhile the Committee is mindful of the fact that it is not called upon at this stage of the proceedings to take a decision on the partial annulment of the Award requested by Venezuela, it is of the view that this distinguishing feature of the present Application for Annulment is relevant to its decision on the Stay Request. It will therefore have to address this issue, which was discussed by the Parties in their written submissions, and argued even more extensively during the Stay Hearing. Thus, the Committee will consider this issue in the broader context of its analysis of whether the circumstances of the present case require a continued stay of enforcement.\n\n32.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules contain the fundamental provisions related to the stay of enforcement of an award. Paragraph 1 of Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules provides that the party applying for an annulment, and either party, may request a stay of the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. Two points merit to be highlighted here. First, a request for stay of enforcement is not necessarily limited to the party seeking annulment, since paragraph 1 explicitly refers to \"either party\". Secondly, the request may concern either \"*part or all of the award to which the application relates*\", which implies that the committee has the discretion to stay the enforcement of part or all of the award depending on the requests of the parties, and on the circumstances of the specific case.\n\n33.\n\nParagraph 2 of Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules deals with the granting of provisional stay of enforcement by the Secretary-General of ICSID and the obligation of the committee, once it is constituted, to rule on whether such stay should be continued, failing which the stay will be automatically terminated. A stay of enforcement may also be modified or terminated by a committee at any time at the request of either party, in accordance with paragraph 3, after it had been granted under paragraph 1 or continued under paragraph 2 of Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules. It is the opinion of the Committee that the stay of enforcement referred to in paragraph 1 of Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules is the one requested in the Application for Annulment and automatically granted by the Secretary-General when the Application is filed in the form of provisional stay.\n\n34.\n\nParagraph 4 of Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules prescribes that a request for stay of enforcement must specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. This is based on Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention which provides that the committee may stay enforcement of the award \"*if it considers that the circumstances so require.*\" Thus, while it is for the parties, when making a request, to provide a clear indication of the circumstances that require such stay, it is for the committee to assess them and decide whether those circumstances effectively require a stay of enforcement. This follows from Article 53 of the ICSID Convention which provides that an ICSID award is \"binding on the parties\", and that \"*each party shall abide by**and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed*.\"\n\n35.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules spell out the nature of the circumstances to be specified. Various *ad hoc* committees have, however, indicated the circumstances to which they attached particular importance in examining a request for stay of enforcement in a specific case. For example, the *ad hoc* committee in the case concerning *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* regarding the latter's request for a continued stay of enforcement of the award, stated that \"*previous ad hoc Committees have attached importance to the following circumstances: 1) prospects of compliance with the award; 2) causation of economic hardship; 3) prospects of recoupment; 4) a dilatory motive*.\"35\n\nSee, *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement, p. 4.\n\n36.\n\nIn its Stay Submission, Venezuela puts forward three circumstances it deems relevant to its request. First, that Venezuela would suffer prejudice if the stay was lifted by the Committee because *\"the Tidewater parties....will undoubtedly take measures to enforce the award.*\"36\n\nVenezuela's Stay Submission, p. 2.\n\n37.\n\nSecondly, that \"*Venezuela has an impressive track record of providing compensation for nationalization*\", providing examples of settlements reached with companies affected by the 2009 oil nationalization and \"*the earlier similar process conducted in 2005 with respect to 35 operating service agreement* s.\"37\n\n*Ibid*, pp. 4-5.\n\n38.\n\nThirdly, that \"*there can be no doubt as to the existence of serious grounds for annulment of the Award under the ICSID Convention*\", and that it is not the case here that the application is \"without any basis under the Convention\" or is purely \"dilatory\" in nature.38\n\n*Ibid*, p. 5.\n\n39.\n\nDuring the Stay Hearing, Venezuela also emphasized that it is not possible \"*to**lift the stay of enforcement of a portion of the damages awarded as argued by the Tidewater Parties.*\" According to Venezuela, \"*there is no legal basis, no factual basis to partially lift the stay of enforcement of the Award.\"* Moreover, for Venezuela \"*a partial lift of the stay of enforcement necessarily implies. a prejudgment of the merits of the Annulment Application since the Application is directed to annul the amount of damages awarded by the Tribunal.*\"39\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 28, lines 19-22, and p. 29, lines 1-6.\n\n40.\n\nFor Tidewater, the sole circumstance specified by Venezuela in support of its request is that the Respondents \"*will undoubtedly take measures to enforce the Award and Venezuela will suffer prejudice*\"; but that \"*does not justify a stay of any part of the Award.*\"40 More importantly, in the view of Tidewater, *\"even if the Republic's concern about Respondent's enforcement of the Award were a basis for staying the challenged portion of the Award, it could not possibly justify a stay of enforcement of the unchallenged portion.*\"41 Thus, Tidewater contends that Venezuela must pay the unchallenged portion of the award \"*regardless of the outcome of this annulment proceeding, and... cannot claim that it is prejudiced by Respondents' efforts to enforce it.*\"42 They finally request that \"*the Committee deny Venezuela's request for an unconditional stay of the whole Award\"* and that \"*at a minimum, the Committee should lift the stay with respect to the portion of the Award that Venezuela's Application does not dispute - specifically US$35,462 million, plus interest.\"43*\n\nTidewater Reply, p. 15.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, p. 18.\n\n41.\n\nThe Committee will now consider the above-summarized arguments of the Parties in light of the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules related to the stay of enforcement of an award as analysed in the preceding paragraphs.\n\n42.\n\nFirst, the Committee does not find the assertion concerning the alleged impressive record of Venezuela for providing compensation for nationalizations to be of direct relevance to the circumstances that may require a stay. Although it may be true that Venezuela provided compensation for nationalizations, the fact that this case was submitted to ICSID shows that an unsettled dispute exists between the Parties with respect to compensation. According to the Award: \"... the Parties were unable to agree on the basis or the process by which such compensation would be calculated and paid.\"44\n\nAward, para. 145, p.49.\n\n43.\n\nSecondly, the Committee considers that it is premature at this stage of the annulment proceedings to assess the Application for Annulment on its merits. Venezuela is exercising its right under the ICSID Convention to request an annulment, and the Committee does not find at this point in time that its request is dilatory in nature. This is, in any case, a matter that will have to be addressed at a subsequent phase of the proceedings.\n\n44.\n\nThirdly, with regard to the possibility that Venezuela may suffer prejudice if the stay of enforcement was not granted by the Committee because Tidewater will take measures to enforce the Award, the Committee notes that Venezuela has not specified the nature of the prejudice that it would suffer from such enforcement measures. Moreover, the Committee recalls Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that:\n\n*\"The Award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention\"*\n\n45.\n\nThis preliminary assessment of the circumstances specified by the Parties with regard to Venezuela's Stay Request needs to be completed by an analysis of the arguments presented by them to the Committee on the possibility of a partial stay of enforcement. Indeed, during the Stay Hearing, both Parties have exhaustively addressed this issue and advanced different views on whether the discretion of the Committee under the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules extends to stay the enforcement of part of the award, and whether in the specific circumstances of this case a partial lifting of the stay of enforcement is warranted.\n\n46.\n\nThe Committee considers that it is important to recall briefly the context in which this debate took place. In the Application for Annulment of Venezuela it is stated that: \"*Venezuela notes at the outset that this Application does not relate to any of the legal holdings of the Tribunal, but only to one issue emerging from paragraphs 197, 201, and 202 of the Award*.\"45 Paragraph 197 of the Award contains the conclusions of the Tribunal on its Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") calculation \"*applying the elements that it... found to be appropriate*\" and describing those elements. Paragraph 201 of the Award reproduces the spread of figures presented by the two experts of the Parties which the Tribunal considered to be as follows:\n\n*\"a) Claimants: US$31,959 million (11 vessels only) (an earnings multiple of 3.79) +US$16,484 million non-recurring accounts receivable=US$48,443 million; b) Respondent: US$27,407 million (15 vessels with 100% recoverability of accounts receivable).\"*\n\nApplication for Annulment, para. 3.\n\n47.\n\nParagraph 202 is worth quoting in full and reads as follows:\n\n*\"The Tribunal has already observed that the determination of an appropriate level of compensation based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of this kind is not and cannot be an exact science, but is rather a matter of informed estimation. The Tribunal considers that a willing buyer would have valued the business at approximately US$30 million, but that it would also have been prepared to pay an additional amount of US$16.4 million for the non-recurring accounts receivable, which it would have been entitled to recover in full from PDVSA upon acquisition of the business. The Tribunal therefore arrives at a valuation (excluding pre-award interest) for the purposes of compensation of US$46.4 million.\"*\n\n48.\n\nOn March 20, 2015, Venezuela submitted an Application for Revision to the Secretary-General of ICSID pursuant to Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the Arbitration Rules in which it requested, *inter alia*, that:\n\n*\"the amount of compensation provided for in the Award be revised to take into account the fact that the figure presented by the Tidewater Parties' expert in his presentation on the last day of the Hearing in response to the Tribunal's questions, and using the guidelines set forth by the Tribunal in paragraph 197 of the Award, was US$30,401 million, not US$48,443 million.\"46*\n\nVenezuela's Application for Revision, p. 5, para.13(c).\n\n49.\n\nBy decision dated July 7, 2015, the Tribunal denied the Application for Revision on the basis of inadmissibility.47 Following the Tribunal's Decision on Revision, Venezuela lodged an Application for Annulment on July 9, 2015 in which it states that: \"*The Tribunal's Decision on Revision does not in any sense cure the infirmities in the Award itself, and, in fact, underscores the point that the Award should be partially annulled on the grounds of failure to state reasons, manifest excess of powers and serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure*.\"48\n\n*Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 (Revision Proceeding), Decision on Application for Revision, July 7, 2015, p. 14. (\"Decision on Revision\").\n\nApplication for Annulment, p. 9, para. 17.\n\n50.\n\nIn its Application for Annulment, Venezuela notes that: \"*Therefore, the total amount stated in paragraph 201 of the Award as the figure according to the Tidewater Parties expert should have been US$30,401 million (i.e. US$13,917 million + US$16,484 million= US$30,401 million), not US$48,443 million.*\"49\n\n*Ibid*, p. 5, para. 12.\n\n51.\n\nVenezuela also makes the following statement in footnote 12 of its Application for Annulment: \"*Had the correct figure from slide 8 (US$ 13,917 million) been inserted in paragraph 201 of the Award, the difference between the parties' experts would have been only US$ 3 million, i.e. US$30,401 million (for 11**vessels) for Claimants versus US$27,407 million (for 15 vessels) for Respondent.\" According to Venezuela: \" If the US$13,917 million figure, which was for an 11 vessel business, had been scaled up to a 15 vessel business, then the figure for Claimants in paragraph 201 of the Award would have been US$35,462 million (i.e.US$18,978 million...plus US$16,484 million for nonrecurring activities receivable), and the spread between the parties would have been US$35,462 million (for 15 vessels) for Claimants versus US$27,407 million (for 15 vessels) for Respondent. \"50*\n\nIbid, p. 7.\n\n52.\n\nBefore the ad hoc Committee, Venezuela insisted on a continued stay of enforcement of the whole Award, despite its Application for partial annulment, and its Application for Revision based on a miscalculation of the US$46.4 million in compensation awarded to the Claimants, as well as the calculations presented in both applications which clearly show that there is an unchallenged portion of the compensation provided in the Award. According to Venezuela *\"there is no legal basis, no factual basis to partially lift the enforcement of the Award,\" and \"[A] partial lift of the stay of enforcement necessarily implies..a pre-judgment of the merits of the Annulment Application since the Application is directed to annul the amount of damages awarded by the Tribunal.\"51* However, when a member of the Committee asked Counsel for Venezuela during the hearing whether it was Venezuela's case that *\"they do not owe even one cent to the Claimants\";* Counsel for Venezuela conceded that *\"that is not the case.\"*52 Moreover, when the same member asked Counsel for Venezuela if it was Venezuela's case that *\"they do not owe at least the 27,407 million, which appears to be an admitted sum, based on your expert's calculation?\"* Counsel for Venezuela replied: *\"we do not dispute that amount.\"*53\n\nTranscript, p.28, line 22, and p. 29, lines 1-6.\n\nTranscript, p.80, lines 16-20.\n\nIbid, p. 80, lines 21-22, and p. 81, lines 1-4.\n\n53.\n\nTidewater contends that *\"Venezuela cannot justify a stay of enforcement of the whole Award because it only challenges a small fraction of that Award. \"*54 According to Tidewater:\n\n*\"Venezuela suggests proportionally scaling up Mr. Kaczmarek's [i.e. expert for Tidewater] 11 vessel valuation to a 15 -vessel calculation. We agree that when you do that, you get a total value of US$35.4 million. By Venezuela's logic, the Tribunal could have awarded any level of compensation up to that amount. This means that at least US$35.4 million of the US$46.4 million in compensation awarded by the Tribunal is unchallenged by the Application, and that is, Members of the Committee, more than 75 per cent of the Award. And we respectfully submit that there is no basis at all to continue the stay of enforcement of that uncontested debt.\"55*\n\n*Ibid,* p. 58, lines 6-9.\n\n*Ibid,* p. 62, lines 5-17.\n\n54.\n\nWith regard to the discretion of the Committee to lift partially the stay of enforcement, Tidewater argues that such power is expressly provided for in Rule 54(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.56\n\n*Ibid,* p. 63, lines 19-22, and p. 64, lines 1-2.\n\n55.\n\nIn considering the requests submitted by the Parties on the continued stay of enforcement of the whole Award (Venezuela), and on the partial lifting of the stay of enforcement (Tidewater), the Committee notes that Venezuela contests the figure of US$46.4 million determined by the Tribunal on the ground that it *\"was substantially higher than the highest conceivable amount that could have been calculated using even the Tidewater Parties own experts' DCF model and applying the elements that the Tribunal determined should be applied.\"* It also argues that *\"such a compensation amount would not have flowed from the Tribunal's reasoning, and, in fact, the US$46.4 million would have been unconnected to any reasoning or calculations.*\"57 However, Venezuela does not dispute the figure presented by its own experts to the Tribunal in paragraph 201 of the Award, i.e. US$27,407 million. Indeed, Counsel for Venezuela confirmed during the Stay Hearing that *\"we do not dispute that amount.\"*\n\nApplication for Annulment, para. 13.\n\n56.\n\nConsequently, the Committee considers that there is an unchallenged portion of the damages awarded by the Tribunal, which amounts to US$27,407 million. In the opinion of the Committee, the Application for Annulment as well as the Stay Request can logically apply only to the difference between this undisputed amount (US$27,407 million) and the amount determined by the Tribunal for compensation (US$46.4 million), which Venezuela does not agree with. Indeed, in its Additional Observations on its Application for Revision, Venezuela, after stating that there was a mistake in the figure reported in paragraph 201 of the Award regarding the Tidewater experts' presentation, observes that:\n\n*\"if the Tribunal had been aware of this fact, the Award presumably would have been somewhere between approximately US$27,407 million (the valuation of the Applicant's experts) and US$35,462 million (the valuation of the Tidewater Parties' expert, scaled up for a 15-vessel valuation, plus the non-recurring receivables).\" Venezuela adds: \"Only the Tribunal could answer the question of exactly where it would have fallen within that range.\"58*\n\nAs noted above, the Application for Revision was rejected by the Tribunal.\n\nApplicant's Additional Observations on its Application for Revision, p. 5.\n\n57.\n\nHaving established that there is a portion of the damages awarded by the Tribunal that is not disputed by Venezuela, the Committee will now turn to the legal issue of whether it has the discretion under the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules to stay or lift part of the enforcement of the Award. The Parties disagree on this point. However, as pointed out in paragraph 32 above, it is the view of this Committee that it has the discretion to stay part or all of the Award depending on the requests of the Parties, and on the circumstances of the specific case under paragraph 1 of Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules. According to Schreuer's Commentary of the ICSID Convention: \"*The ad hoc Committee's discretion extends to whether it stays**enforcement of part or all of the award and to the modification or termination of the stay.\"59*\n\nSee, C. Schreuer with L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, and A. Sinclair, The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, 2nd ed. 2009, p. 1067.\n\n58.\n\nParagraph 1 of Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules is quite clear in this sense: *\"...either party may...request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.*\" In the present case, Venezuela argued in favour of staying the enforcement of the whole Award; while Tidewater requested the Committee to \"*lift the stay with respect to the portion of the Award that Venezuela's Application does not dispute- specifically US$35,462 million, plus interest*.\" The Committee does not, however, agree with Tidewater that the unchallenged portion of the Award amounts to US$35,462 million. It considers that the amount undisputed by Venezuela is US$27,407 million, which is the valuation presented by its own expert to the Tribunal.\n\n59.\n\nIt is also the view of the Committee that the ICSID Arbitration Rules confer upon it the discretion, under paragraph 3 of Rule 54, to modify or terminate at any time the provisional stay of enforcement referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Rule 54 requested in the Application for Annulment and automatically granted by the Secretary-General of ICSID. Moreover, the Committee may modify or terminate the continued stay of enforcement granted by it under those provisions at any time before the disposition of the Application for Annulment. In the present case, a provisional stay of enforcement of the whole Award was requested by Venezuela in its Application for Annulment, and the Secretary-General of ICSID granted automatically such provisional stay of enforcement pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n60.\n\nFollowing the constitution of the Committee, one of the first decisions it adopted on September 17, 2015, which the Parties were immediately apprised of, was to extend the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award until it ruled on such request after its first session. It is this extension of the provisional stay of the whole Award which it granted in its decision of September 17, 2015 that the Committee has now concluded should be modified, after hearing the Parties, by changing it to a continued stay of enforcement on a part of the Award.\n\n61.\n\nThus, the Committee, taking into account the specific circumstances of this case as well as the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules analysed above, finds that it is appropriate to lift the stay of enforcement on the undisputed portion of the damages awarded by the Tribunal, which, as recognized by Venezuela during the Stay Hearing, amount to US$27,407 million.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n62.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Arbitration Rules, the Committee decides that:\n\na. the stay of enforcement is lifted with regard to the undisputed amount of US$27,407 million plus interest from May 8, 2009 to the date of payment at the rate of 4.5% per annum, compounded quarterly; and\n\nb. the stay of enforcement of the amount of US$18,993 million in Claimants' compensation awarded by the Tribunal and of US$2.5 million in partial reimbursement of Claimants' costs is maintained."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2016-12-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** | |\n| Applicant | Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela |\n| Application | Application for Annulment of the Award rendered on March 13, 2015, dated July 9, 2015 |\n| Award | Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5), Award dated of March 13.2015 |\n| BIT | Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments which entered into force on 1994 |\n| C- | Claimants\u2019 (Tidewater) Exhibit [number] |\n| Counter-Memorial | Respondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, dated February 29, 2016 |\n| DCF | Discounted cash flow |\n| Decision on Revision | Decision on the Revision Request, dated July 7.2015 |\n| Hearing | Hearing on Annulment of July 11.2016 |\n| ICSID | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| ICSID Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, effective April 10, 2006 |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, dated March 18, 1965 |\n| Memorial | Applicant\u2019s Memorial in Support of Application for Annulment, dated January 11.2016 |\n| PDVSA | Venezuela\u2019s national oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. |\n| R-\\_ | Respondent\u2019s (Venezuela) Exhibit [number] |\n| Rejoinder | Respondents\u2019 Rejoinder on Annulment, dated May 23, 2016 |\n| Reply | Applicant\u2019s Reply on Annulment, dated April 11.2016 |\n| Reply on Provisional Stay | Tidewater\u2019s Reply to the Applicant\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, dated October 28, 2016 |\n| Reserve Law | Organic Law that Reserves to the State the Assets and Services Related to primary Activities of Hydrocarbons |\n| Respondents | Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. |\n| Revision Request | Venezuela\u2019s Revision Request pursuant to Article 51(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, dated March 20, 2015 |\n| Stay Decision on Stay | Committee\u2019s Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, dated February 29, 2016 |\n| Stay Request | Applicant\u2019s Request for Stay of Enforcement, dated July 9, 2015 |\n| Submission on Provisional Stay | Applicant\u2019s Submission in Support of a Continuation of the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award, dated October 7, 2015 |\n| Tidewater\u2019s PHB | Tidewater\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, dated July 29.2016 |\n| Tr. \\_,2014 p. \\_ | Transcript of Hearing on the Merits (original proceedings) held on June 9 to June 12, 2014, followed by date and page number |\n| Tr. \\_,2016 p. \\_ | Transcript of Hearing on Annulment, held on July 11.2016, followed by date and page number |\n| Venezuela\u2019s PHB | Venezuela\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief dated July 29, 2016 |\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns an application for annulment (the **\"Application\")** of the award rendered on March 13, 2015 in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 (the **\"Award\")** in the arbitration proceeding between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the **\"Applicant\"** or **\"Venezuela\")** and Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. (the **\"Respondents\"** or **\"Tidewater\").**\n\n2.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal found that Venezuela had expropriated Tidewater\u2019s investment in Venezuela without payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. It determined that Tidewater was entitled to be compensated for that expropriation, and calculated the principal amount of the compensation to be paid at US$46.4 million plus interest.\n\n3.\n\nVenezuela applied for the annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1), subparagraphs (b), (d) and (e) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States **(\"ICSID Convention\"),** identifying three grounds for annulment: (i) manifest excess of powers, (ii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and (iii) failure to state reasons on which the Award was based.\n\n4.\n\nVenezuela notes that its Application does not relate to any of the legal holdings of the Tribunal, but only to one issue emerging from paragraphs 197, 201 and 202 of the Award. In its view the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the final amount of compensation was based on an error which resulted in an award of compensation that does not follow from, and is significantly higher than the amount that would have been derived, based on the Tribunal\u2019s decision regarding (a) the methodology that should be used to calculate compensation and (b) the elements that should be incorporated in that methodology.\n\n5.\n\nThe Applicant and the Respondents are hereinafter collectively referred to as the **\"Parties.\"** The Parties\u2019 respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page i.\n\n**II. THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn July 9, 2015, Venezuela filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\")** an Application for Annulment of the Award issued on March 13, 2015.\n\n7.\n\nThe Application was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings **(\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"****).**\n\n8.\n\nAs mentioned above, Venezuela sought annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) that the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers; (ii) that there had been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and (iii) that the Award had failed to state the reasons on which it was based.\n\n9.\n\nIn its Application, Venezuela also requested the Secretary-General to provisionally stay enforcement of the Award (the **\"Stay Request\")** of US$46.4 million plus interest in favor of Tidewater.1 It further requested that the stay be maintained until the *ad hoc* Committee issued its Decision on the Application for Annulment.2\n\nApplication, \u00b618.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n10.\n\nOn July 16, 2015, the Secretary-General registered the Application and notified the Parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n11.\n\nOn September 9, 2015, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that the *ad hoc* Committee (the **\"Committee\")** had been constituted in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Committee was composed of Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somali) as President; Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Cecil W. M. Abraham (Malaysian) and Professor Dr. Rolf Knieper (German), as Members.\n\n12.\n\nThe annulment proceeding was thus deemed to have begun on the above date. The Parties were also informed that Mr. Marco Tulio Montanes-Rumayor, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n13.\n\nOn September 17, 2015, the Committee decided to extend the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award until it ruled on such request after its first session.\n\n14.\n\nOn October 7, 2015, the Applicant filed a Submission in Support of a Continuation of the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award **(\"Submission on Provisional Stay\").**\n\n15.\n\nOnOctober 28, 2016, the Respondents filed a Reply to the Applicant\u2019s Submission Requesting Continuation of the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award **(\"Reply on Provisional Stay\").**\n\n16.\n\nOn November 23, 2015, the Committee held its first session with the Parties in Paris, France. After the session, the Committee heard oral arguments regarding the Stay Request **(\"Hearing on Stay\").** The following persons attended the Hearing on Stay:\n\nFor the Applicant:\n\nMs. Gabriela Alvarez Avila - Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP  \nMr. Eloy Barbara de Parres - Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP\n\nFor the Respondents:\n\nMr. Miguel Lopez Forastier - Covington & Burling LLP  \nMr. Daniel Hudson - Tidewater Inc.\n\n17.\n\nOn January 11, 2016, the Applicant filed a memorial on Annulment **(\"Memorial\").**\n\n18.\n\nOn February 29, 2016, the Committee issued its Decision on the Applicant\u2019s Request for a continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award **(\"Decision on Stay\").** In it, the Committee decided to (i) lift the stay of enforcement for the undisputed amount of US$27,407 million plus interest from May 8, 2009 to the date of payment at the rate of 4.5% per annum, compounded quarterly; and (ii) maintain the stay of enforcement of the amount of US$18,993 million in Claimants\u2019 compensation awarded by the Tribunal and of US$2.5 million in partial reimbursement of Claimants\u2019 costs.3\n\nDecision on Stay, \u00b662.\n\n19.\n\nOn February 29, 2016, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on Annulment **(\"Counter-Memorial\").**\n\n20.\n\nOn April 11, 2016, the Applicant filed a Reply on Annulment **(\"Reply\").**\n\n21.\n\nOn May 23, 2016, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on Annulment **(\"Rejoinder\").**\n\n22.\n\nOn July 11, 2016, a hearing on annulment **(\"Hearing\")** was held in Paris, France. The following persons attended the Hearing:\n\nFor the Applicant:\n\nMs. Gabriela Alvarez Avila - Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP  \nMr. Eloy Barbara de Parres -\u00a0Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP\n\nFor the Respondents:\n\nMr. Miguel Lopez Forastier Covington & Burling LLP  \nMs. Clovis Trevino Covington & Burling LLP  \nMr. Bruce Lundstrom Tidewater Inc.\n\n23.\n\nOn July 29, 2016, the Parties filed their post-hearing briefs **(\"PHBs).\"**\n\n24.\n\nOn October 27, 2016, the proceedings were declared closed.\n\n**III. THE PREVIOUS PROCEEDINGS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. The Arbitration Proceeding**\n---------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe original dispute was submitted to ICSID under the Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments 1994 (the **\"BIT\u2019).**\n\n26.\n\nRespondents, Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A., which were Claimants to the original proceeding, are two companies incorporated in Barbados and Venezuela respectively.4\n\nIn its February 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal dismissed the claims of six out of the eight Claimants from the Tidewater Group and found jurisdiction over only Tidewater Caribe, C.A., a Venezuelan company, and Tidewater Investment SRL, a Barbados company that owned Tidewater Caribe, C.A., since 2009.\n\n27.\n\nSEMARCA, a Venezuelan company owned by Tidewater Caribe, had been providing marine transportation services since 1958 to subsidiaries of Venezuela\u2019s national oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. **(\"PDVSA\").**\n\n28.\n\nOn May 7, 2009, the Government of Venezuela enacted the *Organic Law* that Reserves to the State the Assets and Services Related to primary Activities of Hydrocarbons **(\"Reserve Law\").** The following day, on May 8, 2009, the Government issued Resolution No. 51 that identified the Claimants, along with 38 other service providers, as subject to the Reserve Law.\n\n29.\n\nThat same day, SEMARCA\u2019s assets on Lake Maracaibo, including its offices and 11 vessels, were seized.\n\n30.\n\nOn July 12, 2009, four more vessels of SEMARCA were seized.\n\n31.\n\nOn February 12, 2010, the Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration under the ICSID Arbitration Rules against Venezuela.\n\n32.\n\nIn its Award of March 13, 2015, the Tribunal found that Venezuela had expropriated Tidewater\u2019s investment in Venezuela and awarded it US$46.4 million plus interest.5\n\nAward, \u00b6202.\n\n33.\n\nIn calculating the amount of compensation, the Tribunal first determined the applicable standard of compensation, namely \u2018the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation\u2019 as provided in Article 5 of the BIT.6\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6151-158\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal then found that calculating the fair market value by reference to either the liquidation value of SEMARCA\u2019s assets or the book value of the seized assets would likely only be appropriate where the enterprise was not a proven going concern. Given that SEMARCA was not a publicly listed company and its business was limited to one country and one customer, the Tribunal determined that a discounted cash flow **(\"DCF\u2019)** analysis was appropriate in this case.7\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6165-166.\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal continued with an analysis of the variables that should be utilized in a DCF analysis and made its own assessment as to each of the six relevant factors.8 The Tribunal summarized those elements as follows:\n\n*\"a) business consisting of the services performed by the 15 vessels that SEMARCA operated in or from Lake Maracaibo;*\n\n*b) Including the outstanding accounts receivable, both as an element supporting the working capital of the ongoing business and as being recoverable in itself*\n\n*c) Taking the average of the historic cash flows of the business for the four years 2006-2009;*\n\n*d) Applying an equity risk of 6.5%;*\n\n*e) Applying a country risk of 14.75%;*\n\n*f) But with no additional discount for single customer concentration.\"*9\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6169-196.\n\nAward, \u00b6 197.\n\n36.\n\nAt the hearing of 11 June 2014, the Tribunal requested the experts to prepare additional calculations using their existing models, and taking into account the above-mentioned variables. The experts prepared additional tables which they presented to the Tribunal during the Parties\u2019 closing submissions.10\n\nAward, \u00b6198.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that the tables prepared by both Parties\u2019 experts *\"have proved of very considerable assistance to the Tribunal in its deliberations.\"11* It also noted that *\"[t]hese tables produced a significantly greater convergence in figures than had been the case in the experts\u2019 reports that were filed in the written phase. Nevertheless, there continue to be material differences in the approach adopted by the experts, which in turn affect the figures presented.\"12*\n\nAward, 1\u00b698.\n\nAward, \u00b6198.\n\n38.\n\nIn paragraph 201 of the Award, the Tribunal set forth the results of the experts\u2019 calculations based on the variables it determined appropriate for this case and the qualifications set out in paragraphs 199 and 200, as follows:\n\n*\"(a) Claimants: US$31,959 million (11 vessels only) (an earnings multiple of 3.79) + US$16,484 million non-recurring accounts receivable = US$48,443 million;*\n\n*(b) Respondent: US$27,407 million (15 vessels with 100% recoverability of accounts receivable).\"13*\n\nAward, \u00b6201.\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that *\"a willing buyer would have valued the business at approximately US$30 million, but that it would also have been prepared to pay an additional amount of US$16.4 million for the non-recurring accounts receivable* [...].\"14 Accordingly, the Tribunal calculated the principal amount of the compensation to be paid at US$46.4 million plus interest.15\n\nAward, \u00b6202.\n\nAward, \u00b6202.\n\n**B. The Revision Proceeding**\n------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nOn March 20, 2015, Venezuela filed a Revision Request **(\"Revision Request\")** pursuant to Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n41.\n\nVenezuela argued that the Tribunal had erred in the calculation of the compensation that should have been awarded to the Claimants. It asserted that although the Tribunal in reaching the compensation figure *\"clearly had in mind the calculations of the parties'\",* instead of taking into account the amount figuring in the presentation of Tidewater\u2019s expert, which was US$13,917,433 it mistakenly added the wrong figure of US$31,959,732.16 For this reason, Venezuela requested that the amount of compensation provided in the Award be \u2018revised\u2019 to take into account the figure that had been actually presented by the Tidewater\u2019s expert.\n\nRevision Request, \u00b6\u00b68-9.\n\n42.\n\nOn July 7, 2015, the Tribunal issued its decision on the Revision Request (the **\"Decision on Revision\").** In it, the Tribunal admitted that there was a clerical error in paragraph 201(a) in its transcription from the Tidewater\u2019s expert presentation. It concluded that the sub-paragraph should correctly read as follows:\n\n*\"(a) Claimants: US$13,917million (11 vessels only) (an earnings multiple of 1.65) + US$16,484 million non-recurring accounts receivable = US$30,401 million.\"17*\n\nDecision on Revision, \u00b629.\n\n43.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal dismissed the Revision Request on the basis that Venezuela failed to present a new and unknown fact to the Tribunal in terms of Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal further noted that the illustrative tables submitted by the experts of both Parties during the hearing showed *\"the effect in the respective expert\u2019s view of different assumptions upon that expert\u2019s own calculation\"18* and *\"did not represent the experts\u2019 respective opinions as to the appropriate valuation to be applied'* in the case.19 It also recalled the significant differences in the approach adopted by the experts which explained the difference in the figures presented by the Parties.\n\nDecision on Revision, \u00b640.\n\nDecision on Revision, \u00b641.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to explain that in view of the lack of comparability between the figures presented by the experts of both Parties, it had to take its own approach to determining valuation. The Tribunal pointed out to paragraph 202 of the Award in which the Tribunal explained that this *\"is not and cannot be an exact science, but is rather a matter of informed estimation\"20* and which, according to the Tribunal, clearly suggests that it did not adopt the figures put forward by the Parties\u2019 experts.21\n\nAward, \u00b6 202.\n\nDecision on Revision, \u00b6 44.\n\n46.\n\nIn light of the aforementioned, the Tribunal concluded that, even if Venezuela\u2019s Revision Request were admissible as being based upon a new and unknown fact, this was not of such a nature as \u2018decisively to affect the award\u2019; and thus it dismissed the Revision Request.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n(1) **The Applicant**\n---------------------\n\n47.\n\nAt the outset, the Applicant insists that \"the Annulment Application does not relate to any of the legal holdings of the Tribunal and exclusively focuses on the section of the Award related to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion on the DCF calculation and how, as a matter of fact, the Tribunal did not apply the different elements it found to be applicable under an appropriate DCF analysis. In particular, the Application refers only to paragraphs 202 and 217(3) of the Award.\"22\n\nMemorial, \u00b65.\n\n48.\n\nVenezuela is not seeking to have the Committee overturn the Tribunal\u2019s selected method of determining the adequate compensation. As such, the Applicant argues, its Application does not constitute an appeal. Instead, the Applicant seeks the full and effective application of the decisions made by the Tribunal regarding the calculation of Tidewater\u2019s compensation.23 It explains:\n\n*\"In doing so and based on the parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal also meticulously analyzed and decided each of the elements in dispute between the parties regarding the premises of an appropriate discount cash flow (\"DCF\") analysis that would yield an adequate compensation for the expropriation. However, the Tribunal failed to apply its own decisions regarding such premises. Applicant submits that by doing that, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state the reasons for the value it finally attributed to SEMARCA\u2019s business and committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure pursuant to Article 52(1), subparagraphs (b), (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention, all of which warrant the partial annulment of the Award.\"24*\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b69-18.\n\nMemorial, \u00b64.\n\n49.\n\nFurthermore, the Applicant asserts that no matter how high the threshold of review is determined to be, this is \"abundantly fulfilled\" since the Tribunal disregarded its own decisions and contradicted its own reasoning in determining the amount of compensation due to Tidewater.25\n\nReply, \u00b622.\n\n50.\n\nMoreover, the Applicant submits that the remedy of annulment provided in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention constitutes an exception to the principle of finality and to the binding force of ICSID awards, and as any other provision within the ICSID Convention it should be given full effect.26\n\nReply, \u00b623.\n\n51.\n\nThe Applicant also argues that *ad hoc* committees are not empowered with the discretion not to annul an award once it is found that there are grounds for annulment. On the contrary, *\"if the Committee determines that any of these grounds for annulment is in fact present, then the Committee is under the obligation to partially annul the Award, as Venezuela has requested.\"27*\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b623-32. The Applicant relies on *Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Decision on Annulment, dated May 3, 1985 (\" *Klockner).*\n\n52.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Award is annullable on three grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, namely:\n\n(a) The Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers because it awarded compensation in excess of the amount that had been calculated by the experts of both sides, who used a methodology that the Tribunal determined was appropriate and elements that the Tribunal determined were applicable.\n\n(b) The Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based when the Tribunal valued SEMARCA\u2019s business at an amount that is significantly higher than the amount that would have been derived based on the Tribunal\u2019s decisions regarding the appropriate methodology and the applicable elements without stating any reason. It also failed to state any reason for going beyond the range of values as calculated by both Parties\u2019 experts.\n\n(c) There has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure because the Tribunal did not respect the Parties\u2019 right to be heard on a fundamental point regarding the value of SEMARCA\u2019s business.\n\n53.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, the Applicant has adjusted its request. In its Application, it has requested that the Award be \"partially annulled\"28; in its Memorial, it has requested that *\"the portion of the Award dealing with the conclusion on DCF calculation should be annulled'29 ;* and in its Reply, it has requested that *\"the section of the Award regarding the determination of the total compensation awarded by the Tribunal to the Tidewater Parties should be annulled\"*\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b617 and 19.\n\nMemorial, \u00b663.\n\n54.\n\nFinally, in its PHB, the Applicant submits that its request must not be understood as a challenge of only a portion of the Award while the ascertained compensation in an amount of US$36,481 million is recognized, as alleged by the Respondent:\n\n*\"This is incorrect. The Republic requested the annulment of the finding of the total compensation awarded in the Award (i.e. paragraphs 202 and 217(3) of the Award). Under the ICSID Convention, the Annulment Committee does not have powers to determine the amount of compensation owed to the Tidewater Parties, and in any event it may not consider, in order to determine the amount of compensation, evidence thatwas not before the Tribunalwho issued the Award. If the parties cannot reach a settlement to end their dispute, it would correspond to a new tribunal the calculation of the compensation that would be owed for the expropriation under the Treaty, in which case such new tribunal would need to consider the decisions taken by the first Tribunal and that were not the subject of the annulment proceeding.\"30*\n\nVenezuela\u2019s PHB, p. 2.\n\n**A. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, a tribunal manifestly exceeds its powers under ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(b) when it fails to apply the law specified by the Parties.31 This is also the case when, even if the tribunal argues that it is applying the applicable law, an examination of the award clearly indicates that the applicable law was disregarded.32\n\nMemorial, \u00b627.\n\nMemorial, \u00b628.\n\n56.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the present *\"is not a case where the Tribunal erred in the interpretation of the law or in the weighing of evidence*,\"33 Instead, Venezuela contends that the Tribunal had *\"established'* the legal framework for the Award by opting for the DCF analysis by reference to *\"the World Bank\u2019s guidelines as an additional source of international law to interpret the compensation standard of the BIT.\"34* The Tribunal had thereby determined that the DCF analysis with its various elements \"constitutes the legal framework\" and thus the correct law.35 It was bound to apply this law but subsequently has ignored its application as well as the evidence before it.36\n\nReply, \u00b639.\n\nMemorial, \u00b636; Reply, \u00b635.\n\nMemorial, \u00b633.\n\nReply, \u00b639.\n\n57.\n\nIn the Applicant\u2019s view, the Tribunal first identified \u2018very clearly\u2019 the applicable law to the dispute, i.e. the relevant provisions of the BIT.37 Then, the Tribunal defined what \u2018compensation\u2019 meant under the applicable law. Next, the Tribunal described the methodology it would use to determine the \u2018market value\u2019 of the expropriated assets and pointed out to the special factors pertaining to SEMARCA\u2019s business that had to be taken into account in implementing that methodology. Finally, the Tribunal determined the essential elements of an appropriate DCF analysis for this case.\n\nMemorial, \u00b632; Reply, \u00b6\u00b635-38.\n\n58.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal, \"oddly enough\", disregarded the very same legal framework it had established, and thus ended up overcompensating Tidewater.38\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 33.\n\n59.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the experts\u2019 materials, which were at the Tribunal\u2019s disposal during its deliberations, established a specific value range for the different scenarios anticipated by the Tribunal. Accordingly, the value of the SEMARCA business that had to be taken into account for the calculation of the adequate compensation would have to fall between US$13,917 and US$24,435 million, and by no means exceed that range.39\n\nMemorial, \u00b634.\n\n60.\n\nIt follows from the above, the Applicant maintains, that by determining in paragraph 202 that the value of the SEMARCA business was of US$30 million, the Tribunal *\"clearly failed to apply the relevant provisions of [the legal framework it itself had established]... [and thus] manifestly exceeded its powers\"40*\n\nMemorial, \u00b635, quoting *Amco Asia Corporation et at. v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Annulment of Award of June 5, 1990 and of Supplemental Award of October 17, 1990, dated December 3, 1992 (\"Amco\"), \u00b695.\n\n61.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal failed to make an *\"informed estimation in light of all the evidence available to it\"41* If the Tribunal were to consider the evidence available to it during the deliberations, it would under no possible scenario determine that an adequate compensation for Tidewater\u2019s expropriated assets would exceed a principal amount of US$40,835 million, i.e. the highest figure submitted by Tidewater\u2019s experts, let alone the US$46.4 million that the Tribunal eventually awarded to Tidewater.42 For this reason, the Applicant argues that there is no logical sequence between, on the one hand, the amount of compensation the Tribunal awarded, and on the other hand, the evidence in the record and the legal framework it decided to apply.43\n\nMemorial, \u00b636, quoting Decision on Revision, \u00b6\u00b660-61.\n\nMemonal, \u00b636; Reply, \u00b6\u00b642-46.\n\nReply, \u00b647.\n\n62.\n\nIn light of the aforementioned, the Applicant explains that it is not enough that a tribunal declares to have applied the relevant law, but instead one should look into whether it actually did.44\n\nMemorial, \u00b637.\n\n63.\n\nAs evidenced by the compensation awarded to Tidewater, the Tribunal failed, in the view of the Applicant, to apply the elements that it itself declared to be applicable in this case, and to adequately consider the calculations presented by the Parties. Therefore, it manifestly exceeded its powers.45\n\nMemonal, \u00b6\u00b637-38.\n\n**B. Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the obligation to state reasons follows from Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. Both Articles require that the award enables a reader to follow the tribunal\u2019s reasoning \"from Point A to Point B.\"46\n\nMemorial, \u00b640, quoting *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Government of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on the Application by Guinea for Partial Annulment of the Arbitral Award, dated December 14, 1989 (MINE).\n\n65.\n\nThe Applicant cites different legal authorities to suggest that providing contradictory reasons equals to not providing reasons at all.47 It further contends that insufficient and inadequate reasons may also result in the annulment of an award.48 Finally, the Applicant notes that Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention also require that a tribunal deals with *\"the issues, arguments and evidence presented to it.\"49*\n\nMemorial, \u00b641, quoting Christoph H. Schreuer with Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY (2nd ed., Cambndge University Press 2009), Art. 52, p. 1011, \u00b6389.\n\nMemorial, \u00b643, quoting *inter alia* *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment, dated June 5, 2007, \u00b6\u00b6122-123.\n\nMemorial, \u00b646.\n\n66.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons on why it valued SEMARCA\u2019s business at US$30 million, an amount that exceeded even the amount proposed by the Tidewater\u2019s expert when considering a scope of business of 17, instead of 15, vessels. The Applicant alleges that\n\n*\"[I]t did so without stating any reasons at all for that departure. This resulted in an award of compensation that does not follow from, and is significantly higher than, the amount that would have been derived based on the Tribunal\u2019s decisions regarding the methodology that should be used to calculate compensation and the elements that should be incorporated in that methodology.

Clearly, the Tribunal made a mistake in calculating the compensation.53\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b648-49.\n\nMemorial, \u00b648.\n\nMemorial, \u00b650.\n\n68.\n\nIn light of the above reasons, the Applicant requests that the Award be annulled for failure to state reasons.\n\n**C. A Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Applicant states that two elements should be present in order to annul an award under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, namely: (i) the departure must be \"serious\", i.e. that it *\"had or*  *may have had* *a material effect on the tribunal\u2019s decision\";54* and (ii) it must be a departure from a \"fundamental\" rule of procedure, i.e. it must violate *\"a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law\"55*\n\nMemorial, \u00b652.\n\nMemorial, \u00b653 citing *inter alia*  *Wena Hotels Ltd v.

When doing so, the Tribunal neither stated the reasoning behind this departure nor did it afford Venezuela the opportunity to respond to the Tribunal\u2019s considerations. The Parties\u2019 experts had established a range of criteria that determined the business value. The Tribunal\u2019s intention to depart from these limits should have been announced beforehand, in order to give Venezuela the opportunity to react to this intention and to introduce arguments which might have changed the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning.57\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b658-59.\n\n72.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the only plausible justification behind the Tribunal\u2019s decision to award this amount is that it took into account additional considerations, other than those pleaded by the Parties. If this is true, the Applicant argues, then the Tribunal engaged in a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Applicant insists that\n\n*\"[N]obody can seriously deny that an over-compensation of more than 50% of the value of the business of the \"SEMARCA Enterprise\" did not have a \"material impact in the award.\" An over-compensation of that magnitude clearly has a material impact on the Award, and therefore, a serious departure from a fundamental rule ofprocedure took place.\"58*\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b663-65.\n\n73.\n\nAdditionally, the Applicant submits that the Tribunal cannot be relieved of this breach on the ground that the *\"determination of the appropriate level of compensation...cannot be an exact science, but is rather a matter of informed estimation\"59* In making an \u2018informed estimation\u2019, the Tribunal should have taken into account the limits on the value of SEMARCA\u2019s business under the various scenarios contemplated by the Tribunal, as laid out in the presentations of the Parties\u2019 experts during the hearing on the merits.60\n\nMemorial, \u00b660. citing Award, \u00b6 202: Decision on Revision, \u00b6\u00b661-62.\n\nMemorial, \u00b660.\n\n74.\n\nIn light of the above, the Applicant requests the Committee to annul the section of the award regarding compensation because its right to be heard was breached, constituting a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n(2) **The Respondents**\n-----------------------\n\n75.\n\nAt the outset, the Respondents make general remarks with respect to the standard of review for annulment applications.61 The Respondents recall that annulment constitutes *\"an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of an ad hoc committee is limited'*62 and that *ad hoc* committees are not appellate courts and thus should not review the merits.63\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b637-40.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b639, quoting *Total SA. v.

In any event, assuming that Venezuela could establish that a ground for the annulment exists, the Committee has discretion not to annul the Award in light of the text of Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention and the principle of finality of ICSID awards.64\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b640: Rejoinder, \u00b610.\n\n**A. Manifest Excess of Power**\n-------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the applicable test under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention is to determine both whether (i) there is an \u2018excess\u2019 of powers; and (ii) whether the excess is \u2018manifest\u2019, i.e. it is *\"obvious, clear or self-evident, and [...] is discernable without the needfor an elaborate analysis of the award\"65*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b642 quoting *Total,* \u00b6171.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondents contend that, although failure to apply the applicable law may constitute a ground for annulment, there is no basis for annulment when the Tribunal has identified and attempted to apply the correct law.66 In support of their proposition, the Respondents point out to the annulment decisions in *Lahoud* and *Teco.67* Accordingly, the Respondents submit that errors in the application of law or weighing of evidence cannot constitute a valid ground for annulment.68 This is evident in that the drafters of the ICSID Convention did not include the \u2018manifestly incorrect application of the law\u2019 as a possible ground for annulment.69\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b643-44, citing *Daimler Financial Servicesv.

A correction of such alleged error by the Committee would represent an inadmissible appeal.78\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b656.\n\n**B. Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the Applicant has to meet a high standard when pursuing the annulment of an award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.79 According to the Respondents, two conditions must be met in order to annul an award for failure to state reasons: (i) *\"the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale\";* and (ii) *\"that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision.\"80*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b658; Rejoinder, \u00b617.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b658, quoting *Daimler,* \u00b677, *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija SA. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, dated August 10, 2010 (\"Vivendi\"), \u00b665.\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondents further argue that, similarly to Article 52(1)(b), Article 52(1)(e) does not allow a committee to deal with the correctness and persuasiveness of the reasoning of the award. Accordingly, the Respondents submit that Article 52(1)(e) only poses a \"minimum requirement\" of stating reasons.81\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b659, citing *Wena,* \u00b679.\n\n87.\n\nIt should be also bome in mind, the Respondents say, that the tribunals are not \"computational machines\" and thus have a considerable measure of discretion in assessing compensation.82 According to the Respondents, consistent practice of *ad hoc* committees, which have refrained from overturning compensation awards, supports this proposition.83\n\nRejoinder, \u00b619.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b619.\n\n88.\n\nMoreover, the Respondents make reference to certain **ad hoc** committees which have held that what may appear as contradiction may actually be the result of a compromise reached by the Tribunal.

No contradiction exists. \"Point A\" of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning was its statement that not the experts but the Tribunal itself had to determine the amount of compensation in light of all evidence before it and exercising its informed estimation, based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. \"Point B\" was the determination that *\"a willing buyer would have valued the business at approximately USS 30 million\",92* following the exercise of informed estimation.93\n\nAward, \u00b6202.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b622.\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondents thus conclude that Venezuela\u2019s argument is merely a disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of the evidence.94\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b674.\n\n98.\n\nFinally, contrary to the Applicant\u2019s allegations, the Respondents submit that nothing prevents the Committee from considering the Decision on Revision, which reconfirms the finding of the Tribunal in the Award regarding the misreading of the significance of paragraph 201.95\n\nRejoinder, \u00b624.\n\n**C. Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, to annul an award under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, three elements need to be met, namely:96\n\n*\u2022 First, the procedural rule must be fundamental. \"Fundamental\" rules of procedure are \"rules of natural justice i.e., rules concerned with the essential fairness of the proceedings.*\n\n*\u2022 Second, there must have been a \"departure\" from the relevant fundamental rule. Where a tribunal is acting within the significant degree of discretion afforded to it, there can be no such departure.*\n\n*\u2022 Third, the departure from the fundamental rules of procedure must be sufficiently \"serious\" to warrant annulment. As the Republic acknowledges, to be \"serious\", the departure must have \"produced a material impact on the award.\"*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 76.\n\n100.\n\nAlthough the Respondents agree with the Applicant that the \"right to be heard\" is a fundamental rule of procedure, they note that *ad hoc* committees have recognized to ICSID tribunals a wide margin of discretion as to how best to organize the proceedings in each case.97\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b677-78: Rejoinder, \u2018\u00b627.\n\n101.\n\nMoreover, *ad hoc* committees have consistently held, according to the Respondents, that a tribunal may afford the parties an opportunity to be heard under different ways and that in those cases, the Committee should reject the annulment of an award on the basis that there was a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.98\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b680.\n\n102.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the Applicant\u2019s argument that its right to be heard was breached because the Tribunal went beyond the legal framework it established, and the Parties\u2019 valuations should be rejected. Venezuela had *\"a full and fair opportunity to be heard'* both during the merits phase and at the stage of Revision *\"through voluminous written submission, days of oral hearing, and an application for revision\"* on all the issues that have been raised in this case.99\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b681-85; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b626, 28, 30.\n\n103.\n\nIn any event, assuming there was a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Venezuela has not established that this was \"serious.\"100Instead, Venezuela\u2019s assertion that the alleged departure was \"serious\" is only based on a speculation that the Tribunal would have awarded lower compensation.101\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b686.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b687.\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondents further emphasize the fact that the tribunals have considerable discretion as to how to assess appropriate compensation. Accordingly, the Applicant should have expected that the Tribunal would exercise this discretion.102\n\nRejoinder, \u00b628.\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondents further submit that Venezuela wrongly contends that Tidewater \"pleaded\" a DCF valuation under the factors the Tribunal determined to be appropriate. Instead, Tidewater submitted evidence about other methods of valuation which went well above US$40 million.103\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b688.\n\n106.\n\nFinally, the Respondents argue that any speculation that the Tribunal would have awarded a lower amount is excluded by the Decision on Revision, where the Tribunal admitted to have known the correct figure as well as the transcription error, and which it found not to be of such a nature \u2018as decisively to affect the award\u2019.104\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b689, 30.\n\n107.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Respondents request the Committee to dismiss Venezuela\u2019s argument that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n108.\n\nAs an overall conclusion, the Respondents contend that Venezuela *\"does not contest the Tribunal\u2019s decision to award compensation for Respondents\u2019 investments\"105* but that it only requests the annulment of the portion of the Award that exceeds the allegedly correctly calculated compensation for the loss ofbusiness value and accounts receivable. They state:\n\n*\"The remainder of Tidewater\u2019s Counter-Memorial, as well as Tidewater\u2019s Rejoinder and argument at the Hearing on Annulment, makes clear that Tidewater\u2019s position is that the Republic\u2019s application for annulment should be dismissed in its entirety. Indeed, the Committee has no power to reduce the Award. \"The drafting history of the ICSID Convention [...] demonstrates that annulment is not a procedure by way of appeal requiring consideration of the merits of the case, but one that merely calls for an affirmative or negative ruling based upon one [of the grounds for annulment],\" As explained by the Committee in Tulip v. Turkey, \"[u]nder the ICSID Convention, an ad hoc committee only has the power to annul the award. The ad hoc committee may not amend or replace the award by its own decision on the merits.\"**Nevertheless, should the Tribunal [sic] determine that the Republic \u2019s Application is meritorious, the Committee should leave undisturbed the portion of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal that the Republic admits would have been supported by Navigant\u2019s model (i.e., US$36,481 million). Even under the Republic\u2019s view, had the Tribunal awarded this amount, it would not have manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons, or seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\"106*\n\nReply on Provisional Stay, \u00b6\u00b610 and 11.\n\nTidewater\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b69-10.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n**A. Introductory Observations on the Structure and Objectives of the Remedies under the ICSID Convention**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe evolution of the present case after the Award is particular in two aspects. On the one hand, the whole range of remedies under the ICSID Convention was the focus of the Parties: a possible rectification of clerical errors (Article 49(2) ICSID Convention), a revision (Article 51 ICSID Convention) and an annulment (Article 52 ICSID Convention). On the other hand, Venezuela has based its Application on the grounds of a manifest excess of power, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and/or a failure to state reasons on one identical circumstance, the determination of Tidewater\u2019s compensation. As stated in Venezuela\u2019s Memorial, *\"the Application refers only to paragraphs 202 and 217(3) of the Award.\"107*\n\nMemorial, \u00b65.\n\n110.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Committee finds it appropriate to make two general observations: first, on the structure and objectives of the system of remedies under the ICSID Convention, and secondly, on the specificity of objectives of the different grounds for annulment.\n\n111.\n\nAs to the observation on the different remedies under the ICSID Convention, the Respondents have consistently maintained that Venezuela\u2019s applications, including the application for the partial annulment, is only based on a \"clerical error\" in the Award, and *\"that clerical error continues to be the sole basis for the Republic\u2019s arguments that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, that the Award failed to state the reasons on which the quantum of compensation is based, and that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\"108* In reality *\"Arbitration Rule 49(2) provides the appropriate mechanism for bringing that type of error to the attention of the Tribunal\"109*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b61.\n\nRespondents\u2019Preliminary Response to Venezuela\u2019s Revision Request,p. 1.\n\n112.\n\nThe term \"clerical error\" seems to lead naturally to an application of Article 49 of the ICSID Convention which provides for a procedure to *\"rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error)\u2019*\n\n113.\n\nIndeed, in its Decision on-Revision, the Tribunal has recognized *\"a clerical error in its transcription from the underlying documents\"*, has corrected the error and stated how the respective paragraph should read.110\n\nDecision on Revision, \u00b629.\n\n114.\n\nHowever, the Applicant had not requested a rectification in accordance with Article 49 ICSID Convention but a revision of the Award in accordance with Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, based on the fact that it had discovered, after the Award was rendered, that *\"the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the final amount of compensation was based on an error in its review of the presentation of the Tidewater Parties\u2019 expert\"111* In hindsight, Venezuela\u2019s strategy not to seek a rectification seems understandable. It would not have led to the expected result, since the Tribunal has voluntarily corrected its \u2018clerical error\u2019 without any consequences for the outcome of the dispute.\n\nRevision Request, \u00b64.\n\n115.\n\nAfter a detailed and careful analysis, the Tribunal has rejected the application for a revision. It found that the criteria of Article 51 were not met: no new and unknown fact had been discovered, and, in any event, the clerical error had not decisively affected the Award. The Tribunal affirmed that it had made its own determination, which \"is not and cannot be an exact science\", by way of its own informed estimation and not based on the \"figures put forward by either experts.\"112 Thus, the Tribunal reiterated the correctness of its reasoning and the irreproachability of the Award.\n\nDecision on Revision, \u00b6\u00b661, 62.\n\n116.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Respondents have condemned the Applicant\u2019s request for an annulment as an effort to delay the enforcement of the correct and convincing Award: *\"Having twice raised and lost its arguments before the Tribunal, the Republic now seeks to challenge the quantum of compensation fora third time\"113*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b66.\n\n117.\n\nHowever, the Committee recalls that the remedies of the ICSID Convention follow different rationales and objectives. The revision is concerned with circumstances that existed before the rendering of the Award but could not be taken into account by the tribunal because it was unaware of them and whose knowledge would have altered the outcome. The re-opening of the case allows for a correction because it is considered inappropriate to uphold a decision which is wrong in substance as evidenced by newly discovered facts. The correction is oriented to the protection of material justice.\n\n118.\n\nDifferently, the annulment is concerned with the integrity of the proceedings and addresses fundamental issues *\"of the protection of parties against procedural injustice, as defined in the five sub-paragraphs of Article 52(1),\"114*\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, dated August 2.2012, \u00b6111.\n\n119.\n\nTherefore, the admissibility of either remedy depends on different prerequisites that are of equal value. They do not overlap and they do not exclude each other. The aggrieved party is free to pursue either or both remedies independently as long as the specific prerequisites are met. The fact that Venezuela lost its Revision Request does not de-legitimize its efforts to pursue the remedy of annulment.\n\n120.\n\nThis leads to the general observation on the different grounds for annulment.\n\n121.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the Tribunal has failed to apply its own decisions regarding the premises of an appropriate discounted cash flow analysis that would yield an adequate compensation for the expropriation and *\"by doing that, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state the reasons for the value it finally attributed to SEMARCA \u2019s business and committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure,\"115*\n\nMemorial, \u00b64.\n\n122.\n\nThe one and identical fact of an alleged erroneous determination and miscalculation of the amount of compensation is taken as the one set of facts that fits all. Thereby, the three grounds for an annulment with their very different and specific rationales and objectives are taken as a more or less identical and amalgamated trio under which the same fact is subsumed after some bending, stretching and twisting.\n\n123.\n\nThe Committee insists with some gravity on the finality of ICSID awards. They *\"shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those providedfor in this Convention\"*, as unequivocally stated in Article 53 of the ICSID-Convention.\n\n124.\n\nArticle 52 limits the finality of the Award to five exceptional reasons. They all protect the fundamental procedural integrity, propriety and fairness of the ICSID system but pursue each time a specific and well defined objective based on specific facts. The facts must be established separately and subsumed under the nonidentical requirements of each of the specific grounds.\n\n125.\n\nThe Committee has to determine whether the fact that the Tribunal had \u2018meticulously\u2019 established the elements of the discounted cash flow analysis for the appraisal of the specific business value of SEMARCA and the specific conditions of the expropriation and had thereafter estimated and calculated a Dollar-amount of such value could represent at the same time a manifest excess of its powers, a failure to state the reasons and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. It insists that its findings on the existence of one of the grounds does not automatically reflect on to the other grounds.\n\n**B. Article 52(1)(b): Manifest excess of powers**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nIt should be recalled that *\"Consent of the Parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\"116* Part of the central significance of the parties\u2019 consent is their freedom to agree on the applicable law. The tribunal\u2019s power and mandate is circumscribed by the parties\u2019 agreement. If it does not apply the law that both parties request it to apply, the tribunal exceeds its powers. The Committee subscribes to what it recognizes as *jurisprudence constante,* namely that both the non-application of the proper law and the application of a law that is not proper must be considered as such excess of powers.\n\nReport of the I ixcciL11 vc Directors on the Convention of the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, \u00b623.\n\n127.\n\nWhile the tribunal\u2019s power to identify the applicable law is subject to the parties\u2019 consent, its power is not restricted with respect to the application and interpretation of the law properly identified. The tribunal has a duty to apply the law *lege artis* and cannot be bound by the parties\u2019 directives, even consented, as to a specific method of application. It is for the tribunal to determine the outcome of the dispute in an independent interpretation of the different requirements of the law. If it is convinced that a specific method to appraise the quantum of compensation is more appropriate than another method, it will follow its conviction. The parties to the dispute have no authority to direct the tribunal\u2019s choice in one way or another.\n\n128.\n\nTherefore, the non-application of the proper law must be distinguished from an erroneous application of the proper law. Allegations of an erroneous application of the proper law can only be scrutinized in a system of the administration of justice which provides for appeals of decisions through specific instances. Appeals are explicitly excluded in the ICSID system and *ad hoc* committees are not instance courts. That is a matter of the text of the ICSID Convention. In the abstract, it is not contested by either Party.\n\n129.\n\nSometimes, the line between non-application of the proper law and its misapplication may be difficult to draw but it exists and must be found.\n\n130.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal took great care to establish what the properly applicable law is in the present case. It has distilled from the Parties\u2019 submissions that it is the BIT and the ICSID Convention by reference and, since there was no agreement to the contrary, the *\"law of the Contracting State party to the dispute* *[...] and such rules of international law as may be applicable\",* as provided in Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.117\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 28. 29.\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal found that Article 8(3) of the BIT empowered it to determine the \"amount of compensation\" once it had ascertained the claim for a breach of Venezuela\u2019s obligations and resulting damages. It has further applied Article 5(1) of the BIT and found that Venezuela owed the Tidewater Parties *\"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\",* which *\"shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the pending expropriation became public knowledge\"*\n\n132.\n\nIn its search for a proper standard for the determination of the \"market value\" as specified in Article 5(1) of the BIT, the Tribunal reviewed in a first step doctrine, case law, the World Bank \u2018Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment\u2019 as well as the Text and Commentary of the International Law Commission on\u2018Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u2019.118\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6152-158.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal found the World Bank Guidelines *\"reasonable [...] as to the content of the standard chosen by the State Parties to the BIT as the standard of compensation to be applied in cases of lawful compensation, where the investment constituteda going concern\"*,119 while recognizing that the Guidelines make it clear *\"that there is no exclusive validity of a single standard\"120*\n\nAward, \u00b6152.\n\nAward, \u00b6155.\n\n134.\n\nConvinced by the appropriateness of the World Bank Guidelines, the Tribunal stated that it would determine the fair market value by its *\"informed estimation in light of all the evidence available to it\"121* and *\"by reference to a discounted cash* *flow analysis\"122* and not *\"by reference to either the liquidation value of the assets of the SEMARCA Enterprise, or the book value of those assets, as Respondent contends\"123*\n\nAward, \u00b6164\n\nAward, \u00b6165.\n\nAward, \u00b6166.\n\n135.\n\nIn a second step, the Tribunal continued by identifying *\"six variables adopted in the experts\u2019 reports that have a material effect on the valuation\",* i.e. the scope of business, accounts receivable, historical cash-flow, equity risk, country risk and business risk.124\n\nAward, \u00b6169.\n\n136.\n\nAfter a detailed analysis of the six variables, accompanied each time by the conclusion of whether a certain variable \"must\" or \"must not\" be taken into account, and if yes, at what figure, rate, price or amount, whatever the case may be,125 the Tribunal concluded that it *\"applies the elements that it has found appropriate\"* using the DCF analysis, i.e:\n\n*\"a) A business consistingof the services performedbythe 15 vessels that SEMARCA operated in or from Lake Maracaibo;*\n\n*b) Including the outstanding accounts receivable, both as an element supporting the working capital of the ongoing business and as being recoverable in itself;*\n\n*c) Taking the average of the historic cash flows of the business for the four years 2006-2009;*\n\n*d) Applying an equity risk of 6.5%>;*\n\n*e) Applying a country risk of 14.75%;*\n\n*f) But with no additional discount for single customer concentration.\"126*\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6170-196.\n\nAward, \u00b6197.\n\n137.\n\nIn a third step, the Tribunal asked the Parties\u2019 experts to prepare additional calculations using their existing models including, *inter alia,* the above variables127. Realizing that there were remaining differences in the experts\u2019 calculations and that *\"a discounted cash flow analysis of this kind is not and cannot be an exact science, but rather a matter of informed estimation\"*, the Tribunal considered in a fourth step *\"that a willing buyer would have valued the business at approximately US$30 million, but that it also would have been prepared to pay an additional amount of US$16.4 million for the non-recurring accounts receivable,\"128*\n\nAward, \u00b6198\n\nAward, \u00b6202.\n\n138.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that the estimation of the amount of the market value is irreconcilable with the elements that the Tribunal affirmed to apply in its estimation of the appropriate amount of the market value. The Tribunal\u2019s statement may have to be qualified as contradictory, in which case the Committee will have to specify the effect of such a contradiction.\n\n139.\n\nHowever, in the context of the discussion on a possible excess of powers as ground for an annulment, a finding on a contradiction in a tribunal\u2019s findings and reasoning is of no avail. It does neither equate a non-application of the proper law nor the application of a law that is not proper. At the same time, a possible contradiction is nothing so egregious and outrageous - and the Applicant does not contend so - that it might be worthwhile to examine whether it should be paralleled to a nonapplication.\n\n140.\n\nThe Applicant appears to be conscious of that. It insists that *\"Venezuela is not arguing either, as the Tidewater Parties want the Committee to believe, that this case concerns a mistake in the application of the applicable law* \"129 Rather, it divides the four steps that the Tribunal has made in application of Articles 5 and 8 of the BIT and tries to present them as hierarchically different. It cloaks the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the term \"market value\" of Article 5 of the BIT, step 1, as applicable law. It quotes the elements identified by the Tribunal as appropriate to calculate the market value and contends that *\"[a]s explained by the Tribunal, the foregoing constitutes the legal framework to be applied in determining an adequate amount of compensation required under Articles 5 and 8 of the BIT [...and that] the Tribunal had to remain within the legal framework it had* *established\"*130 In doing so, the Applicant\u2019s argumentation tries to treat as applicable law established by the Tribunal what in reality is step 1 of the Tribunal\u2019s application of law.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b639 and 35.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b633 and 36.\n\n141.\n\nThe Applicant relies on the annulment decision in *Amco,* where the committee had found that the tribunal *\"clearly failed to apply the relevant provisions of Indonesian law. The ad hoc Committee holds that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in this regard\"131* The Applicant uses the quotation by removing the words \"Indonesian law\" and replacing them by \"legal framework.\" The revised quotation reads, in seeming reference to the *Amco* Committee, that *\"the Tribunal clearly failed to apply the relevant provisions of [the legal framework it itself had established]... [and thus] manifestly exceeded its powers\"132.*\n\nMemorial, \u00b631.\n\nMemorial, \u00b635.\n\n142.\n\nFurther, the Applicant submits that the Tribunal *\"confirmed the provisions of the BIT related to the valuation criteria (valuation date and compensation standard), then it cited the World Bank\u2019s guidelines as an additional source of international law to interpret the compensation standard of the BIT, and then it decided that the appropriate compensation shall be calculated by reference to a DCF analysis that took into account certain specific elements, which were also defined by the Tribunal itself.\"133* It qualifies this process as the various steps of the identification of the law, based on Articles 5 and 8 of the BIT as invoked by the Tribunal and asserts that subsequently, in the next step, the Tribunal ignored its application.134\n\nReply, \u00b635 (footnotes omitted).\n\nReply, \u00b639.\n\n143.\n\nWith respect to the foregoing submission, the Committee notes that it has not found an indication in the Award where the Tribunal has \u2018explained\u2019 that the elements for the determination of the market value constitute a legal framework.\n\n144.\n\nThe Committee has equally not found an indication in the Award that the Tribunal qualifies the World Bank Guidelines as\u2018an additional source of international law\u2019. Rather, it found them, together with case law, doctrine and the International Law Commission Draft on the Responsibility of States, as providing \u2018reasonable guidance\u2019 for the interpretation of Articles 5 and 8 of the BIT. The Guidelines themselves do not pretend to be international law and clarify their status unequivocally by stating that they are meant to be *\"useful parameters in the admission and treatment of private foreign investment in their territories,*  *without prejudice to the binding rules of international law at this stage of its development* *\"135*\n\nGuidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment, in: Foreign Investment Law Journal 7/2 (1992), pp. 297, 298 (CL-152) (emphasis by the Committee).\n\n145.\n\nIn fact, the Tribunal did not have the power to create and establish law. The Applicant\u2019s effort to elevate the application of law to the level of establishment of law must fail. It is therefore inappropriate to remove a reference to Indonesian law in the *Amco* decision and replace it by \u2018legal framework that the Tribunal had established\u2019.\n\n146.\n\nInstead, the Tribunal applied Articles 5 and 8 of the BIT in a sequence of four steps. There is no hierarchy between step one and the subsequent steps. To the extent that the steps are inconsistent and contradictory, we are at best or at worst confronted with a mistake in the application of the law and not with an excess of powers.\n\n147.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee rejects the request for the annulment of the Award for an excess of powers by the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Article 52(1)(d): Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Committee has the authority to annul the Award, if and to the extent that the Tribunal departed in a serious manner from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Applicant asserts that the Tribunal violated its right to be heard when it ascertained compensation in an amount falling *\"beyond the amount that results from applying the key elements of an appropriate DCF analysis decided by the Tribunal itself and beyond the range of compensation presented by the parties\u2019 experts at the request of the Tribunal, without stating the considerations for that departure and without giving the opportunity to Venezuela to respond and contest those considerations\"136* and *\"without stating any reasons at allfor that departure \"137*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 58: Reply \u2018 \u00b663.\n\nMemorial, \u00b659.\n\n149.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Applicant\u2019s assertion that the right to be heard and to present one\u2019s case is one of the fundamental principles of due process. Its violation is a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Therefore, the Committee has to determine whether the Tribunal violated the Applicant\u2019s right to be heard when it adjudicated compensation in an amount that was not consistent with the elements of the DCF analysis without prior consultation with the Parties.\n\n150.\n\nThe Parties do not contest that the Tribunal studied the voluminous written submissions and heard the Parties and the experts on quantum extensively during the hearing.\n\n151.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Tribunal has formulated a set of questions to the Parties and in particular to the Parties\u2019 experts *\"to ensure that we have the full range of possibilities ventilated before us\"138.* The questions related mostly to the two different methods to appraise the market value as provided for in Article 5 of the BIT, i.e. the method to establish the liquidation value suggested by the Respondent in the main proceeding and the DCF analysis suggested by the Claimants. When asking the questions, the Tribunal insisted that none of them *\"are to be taken as any indication of any view that the Tribunal has one way or another on the very excellent submissions advanced before it\"139.* The questions were answered and discussed during the hearing and the Tribunal stated that they *\"will assist us in our deliberations greatly\"140.*\n\nTr. July 11, 2014, p. 721.\n\nTr. July 11, 2014, p. 721.\n\nTr. July 12, 2014, p. 947.\n\n152.\n\nAt the end of the hearing *\"the Tribunal\u2019s view was that it has been very greatly assisted by the very detailed written submissions and oral evidence and submissions given to it before this Hearing, and it does not consider that this is a case in which it would be greatly assisted by further Post-Hearing Briefs [...] it is anxious to be able to proceed to the deliberation phase\"141.* The Parties agreed to this view and conclusion and did not ask for a further opportunity to submit arguments or evidence.\n\nTr. July 12, 2014, p. 969.\n\n153.\n\nThe Committee relates this part of the proceeding in some detail because it demonstrates the pain that the Tribunal had taken to afford both Parties exhaustive opportunities to present their case and be heard.\n\n154.\n\nThe Applicant is conscious of that. In order to transport the facts under the provision of Article 52(1)(d), it alleges that the Tribunal has not applied its own standard, has not given reasons for its assessment and has certainly employed \u2018additional considerations\u2019 to which the Applicant was not able to react: *\"there is no other logical explanation as to why the Tribunal exceeded the amount that would have corresponded to the 17-vessel scenario, unless the Tribunal took into account additional considerations, other than the ones argued by the Parties. If that is the case, then the Tribunal, without a doubt, engaged in a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, since it did not give Venezuela the opportunity* *to be heard with regards to those additional considerations that it may have been taking into consideration, whatever they might have been.\"142* The Applicant submits that it had only been able to discover the violation after the Award which does not destroy its relevance.143\n\nReply, \u00b664.\n\nMemorial, \u00b656; the Applicant relies on the Decision on Annulment in *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on the Application for Annulment, dated December 18, 2012, \u00b626.\n\n155.\n\nApparently, the first two of these assertions refer to Article 52(1)(b) and Article 52(1)(e) respectively: the non-application of a legal standard targets an excess of powers and the reproach of not having given reasons for its decision targets the failure to state reasons. The serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure is not concerned with either of these assertions.\n\n156.\n\nAs to the third assertion, the Applicant speculates about additional considerations in the Tribunal\u2019s deliberations without proffering any evidence. The only objective of the Applicant\u2019s construction of considerations that the Tribunal \"may have had\" is to be able to allege that the Tribunal has hidden evidence or thoughts from the Parties. It cloaks the inconsistency and contradiction within the Tribunal\u2019s analysis as something new which should have been brought to the attention of the Parties before the Award.\n\n157.\n\nThe Committee has studied the Award carefully and tried to detect new elements on which the Tribunal might have based its decision. It has not found any. In addition, the Tribunal had unambiguously declared at the closing of the hearing that it had all the evidence before it that it would use during deliberations. It had further stated the obvious that before the end of the deliberations no decision was reached.\n\n158.\n\nThe only evidence available on the deliberations is in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Revision. In that decision, the Tribunal has stated, and the Committee has no reason to doubt, that it had not relied on \u2018any other consideration\u2019 in its deliberations but that *\"it has taken into account the totality of the evidence presented to it in determining the appropriate level of compensation\"144*\n\nDecision on Revision, \u00b662.\n\n159.\n\nThe possible inconsistency and contradiction within the Award are what they are: possible contradictions with possible material consequences. The Committee will have to ascertain this under the appropriate ground for an annulment. They do not present at the same time procedural shortcomings.\n\n160.\n\nThe Applicant bears the burden of proving both that (i) the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a procedural rule; and (ii) that the said rule was fundamental. This has not been done in the present case. Therefore, the Committee rejects the request for the annulment of the Award for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**D. Article 52(1)(e): Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nRead under any perspective, the Applicant\u2019s submissions center on an identical gravamen: it complains that the Tribunal has established elements for the determination of the market value of the Respondents\u2019 business and of the appropriate amount of compensation for the lawful expropriation and that it has fixed that amount in contradiction to these elements.\n\n162.\n\nThe Committee will have to ascertain whether this determination and presentation by the Tribunal amounts to a failure to state the reasons on which its decision was based.\n\n**1.1. The Legal Standard**\n---------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Committee recalls that the statement of reasons is one of the central duties of arbitral tribunals. An award is not a discretionary *fiat* but the result of the process of weighing evidence and applying and interpreting the law and subsuming the facts thus established under the law as interpreted by the Tribunal. The legitimacy of the process depends on its intelligibility and transparency. The statement of reasons allows the Parties to understand the process through which the tribunal makes its findings. Therefore, it is *\"the Tribunal\u2019s duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision\"145*\n\n*Wena,* \u00b679.\n\n164.\n\nThe documentation of the process that leads an arbitral tribunal to its award is of particular importance in investor-state arbitration. In agreeing to arbitration, States surrender part of their sovereign prerogatives and allow arbitral tribunals to scrutinize the legality of acts of *puissance publique.* It is a matter of public policy that the parties to the dispute but also other States\u2019 organs and the public be enabled to understand, if a tribunal rules against the State, why the tribunal believes that a sovereign act violated the law and what would be - in the eyes of the tribunal - a lawful sovereign act under the circumstances. A similar reasoning applies, *mutatis mutandis,* to rulings against an investor.\n\n165.\n\nIn instituting the possibility of an annulment for failure to state reasons, the ICSID Convention recognizes the particularity of investment arbitration. While in commercial arbitration, parties are autonomous and free to exempt the tribunal from stating reasons, the participation of a State and the subject matter of the dispute forbid such waiver. The legitimacy of an arbitral decision to invalidate a sovereign act would be severely undermined if the tribunal did not have to explain why the act contradicts the law.\n\n166.\n\nAt the same time, the procedural mandatory requirement to state reasons does not target the substantive correctness of reasoning in the award. In ratifying the ICSID Convention, the member States recognize the finality of the award and accept the tribunals\u2019 determination of the (un-)lawfulness of their acts. The statement of reasons guarantees procedural legitimacy and validity and does not open the door to a controversy over the substantive correctness of the tribunals\u2019 reasoning. The Contracting States to the ICSID Convention have decided to exclude such controversy by insisting on the binding character of the awards and the inadmissibility of any appeal. The *ad hoc* committee in *Impregilo* formulated a general conviction according to which *\"Article 52(1)(e) does not allow a committee to assess the correctness or persuasiveness of the reasoning in the award or to inquire into the quality of the reasons\"146*\n\n*Impregilo S.pA. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Decision on Annulment, dated January 24, 2014 (\"*Impregilo\"),* \u00b6181.\n\n167.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Committee does not have the authority to reassess the merits of the dispute or to substitute the Tribunal\u2019s determination by its own convictions. Its authority is limited to the examination of the award with respect to the alleged failure to state the reasons on which the Tribunal has based its decision.\n\n168.\n\nThe Committee is mindful that it must try to avoid two errors. One concerns the appreciation of the quality of the reasons. The requirement of stating reasons does not install a benchmark of quality standard. Reasons may be long or succinct, they may be exhaustive or *\"baldly stated\"147*, they may quote heavily from preceding decisions or argue without referencing any - the difference of style or effort to convince the Parties is no reason to discredit reasons.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b666.\n\n169.\n\nIt is the same with the frequent label \"frivolous\": this Committee has never seen an award which lacked reasons completely and has difficulties to understand what the qualification of reasons as frivolous may mean. Either a reasonable, attentive and willing reader is able to understand a tribunal\u2019s motivation, in which case the reasons are not \u2018frivolous\u2019, whatever may be their quality, or the same reader is not enabled to understand the motivation, in which case the tribunal has failed to state reasons.\n\n170.\n\nWith respect to the label \"contradictory\", the Committee shares the view that not any maneuver in the tribunals\u2019 analysis to present a common view can be qualified as contradictory but that only genuine contradictions which \u2018cancel each other out\u2019148 may amount to a failure to state reasons.\n\n*Vivendi,* \u00b665.\n\n171.\n\nThe second error that the Committee needs to avoid concerns the line between the procedural failure to state reasons and the substantive correctness of the award. The Committee is conscious that it must not re-argue the merits of the case. It would do so if it discarded the Tribunal\u2019s exercise of discretion in fixing the amount of compensation and replaced it by its own discretion. Particularly with respect to the amount of compensation, the Committee shares the view of the *Wena ad hoc* committee that stated:\n\n*\"The notion of \u2018prompt, adequate and effective compensation \u2019 confers to the Tribunal a certain margin of discretion, within which, by its nature, few reasons more than a reference to the Tribunal\u2019s estimation can be given, together with statements on the relevance and the evaluation of the supporting evidence.\"149*\n\nIt also subscribes to the views of the *Rumeli ad hoc* committee that stated:\n\n*\"The tribunal must be satisfied that the claimant has suffered some damage under the relevant head as a result of the respondent\u2019s breach. But once it is satisfied of this, the determination of the precise amount of this damage is a matter for the tribunal\u2019s informed estimation in the light of all the evidence available to it.\"150*\n\n*Wena,* \u00b691.\n\n*Rumeli,* \u00b6146.\n\n172.\n\nTherefore, the Committee will abstain from scrutinizing whether the Tribunal has established the facts correctly, has interpreted the applicable law correctly and has subsumed the facts as established correctly under the law as interpreted. It must also not concern itself as to whether the Tribunal has used its discretion erroneously. That would necessarily imply a substitution of the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation and discretion by its own interpretation and discretion and amount to an inadmissible decision on appeal. Rather, the Committee will determine whether the reasons developed by the Tribunal have enabled the addressees of the Award and, for that matter, the Committee itself, to understand the process leading to its conclusions and to the determination of the amount of compensation.\n\n**1.2. The Application of the Standard**\n----------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe case at hand illustrates the rationale of the annulment mechanism based on the failure to state reasons.\n\n174.\n\nVenezuela had expropriated property of the Claimants by an act of *puissance publique.* Together with this act, it had proposed compensation for the expropriation. The Claimants objected to the Government\u2019s decision because Venezuela\u2019s proposal was based on a book value and liquidation value analysis of legally expropriated property and Tidewater\u2019s proposal was based on a discounted cash flow analysis *ex post* an alleged illegal expropriation.151 The Parties\u2019 proposals and valuations submitted by the Parties\u2019 experts \"differed greatly.\"152\n\nFor the Tribunal\u2019s discussion of the Parties\u2019 respective positions cf. \u00b6\u00b653 ss. of the Award.\n\nAward, \u00b6167.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal has rejected parts of both Parties\u2019 approaches to assess the appropriate amount of compensation and has affirmed that *\"it is for the Tribunal to determine the amount of compensation. This is necessarily a matter of informed estimation\"*153. The Parties and in particular Venezuela must be enabled to understand why the method and determination of compensation by an act of *puissance publique* did not meet the requirements of law. That is only possible if the information on which the \u2018informed estimation\u2019 is based is clearly exposed to the Parties.\n\nAward, \u00b6164.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined the Parties\u2019 positions and came to the conclusions that (1) the *\"record does not demonstrate a refusal on the part of the Sate to paycompensation\"*,154 (2) the expropriation was lawf\u00f9l but (3) Venezuela\u2019s proposals for compensation were inadequate. In the long and detailed Chapter 111(B) of the Award, the Tribunal has unfolded its analysis with respect to the correct method, level and amount of compensation.\n\nAward, \u00b6145.\n\n177.\n\nAfter having stated that *\"the Treaty standard of \u2018market value \u2019 does not denote a particular method of valuation\"155*, the Tribunal has opted for the DCF analysis as the appropriate method for its assessment and has given extensive reasons for this option. In particular, it has stated that *\"the Tribunal*  *must* *approach the valuation of SEMARCA based upon the factors that are specific to its business\"156.* It has studied the experts\u2019 reports of both Parties in great detail and has distilled six elements that have an effect on the market value. Again after acarefijl discussion, it has quantified these elements.\n\nAward, \u00b6145.\n\nAward, \u00b6167 (emphasis by the Committee).\n\n178.\n\nThree elements are of particular relevance for the Committee\u2019s determination.\n\n179.\n\nThe first element concerns the scope of the Claimants\u2019 business. The Tribunal has weighed the evidence before it and came to the conclusion that four vessels \"*must*  *therefore be added to the 11 vessels actually stationedon LakeMaracaibo\"* leading to *\"a cash flow generated by 15 vessels\"157*\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6171, 173 (emphasis by the Committee).\n\n180.\n\nThe second element concerns accounts receivable. The Tribunal has explained in detail that *\"the investment thatwas lost*  *must* *include outstanding unpaid accounts receivable\",* and has accepted the undisputed amount of US$16,484,677 presented by Tidewater\u2019s expert.158\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6175 and 199 (emphasis by the Committee).\n\n181.\n\nThe third element concerns the country risk premium. The Tribunal has pondered the experts\u2019 opinions carefully and came to the conclusion that *\"a country risk premium of 14.75% represents a reasonable, indeed conservative, premium. In light of its rejection of Claimants experts\u2019 reasoning,*  *it adopts this premium for the purpose of its valuation of the investment.\"159*\n\nAward, \u00b6190 (emphasis by the Committee).\n\n182.\n\nIn its submissions in support of the Application, the Applicant had reiterated that it still preferred its initial proposals for compensation but had accepted the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the variables and conclusion on the various elements it had found appropriate for purposes of compensation. The legitimizing effect of stating reasons had worked well as far as the identification of those elements was concerned.\n\n183.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Tribunal communicated the elements and their specification to the experts and asked them to prepare *\"additional calculations using their existing models including, inter alia, these variables\"160*\n\nAward, \u00b6198.\n\n184.\n\nThe experts did so. The Tribunal recognized that this had been *\"of very considerable assistance to the Tribunal in its deliberations\",* although there continued *\"to be material differences in the approach adopted by the experts which in turn affect the figures presented\"161*\n\nAward, \u00b6198.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal then noted that the Claimants\u2019 experts had based their calculation on 11 vessels and presented an amount of US$31,959,732. As already indicated above, the Tribunal qualified the figure as *\"a clerical error in its transcription from the underlying documents\"* and corrected the \"error\" by inserting an amount of US$13,917,433. However, the Committee agrees with the Applicant that the figures do not represent clerical errors but the result of alternative calculations. The Claimants\u2019 expert calculated the amount of US$31,959,732 on the assumption that the country risk premium is 1.5%, while the amount of US$13,917,433 used a country risk premium of 14.75%, each time departing from an eleven vessels scenario.162\n\nR-130.\n\n186.\n\nContrary to these calculations presented by the Claimants\u2019 expert, the Tribunal had adopted a country premium risk of 14.75% and a 15 vessels scenario. Thus, by transcribing an amount of US$31,959,732 into the Award, which was based on a country risk premium of 1.5% which the Tribunal had rejected as being unreasonable, the Tribunal did not commit a\u2018clerical error\u2019 but contradicted its own reasoning.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal recognized that the Parties\u2019 experts had been unable to present converging calculations and figures. The Claimants\u2019 experts presented the amounts of US$31,959,732 for the scope of business (based on 11 vessels) and US$16,484,677 for accounts receivable, summing up to roughly US$48,433 million, while the Respondents\u2019 expert presented an amount of roughly US$27,407 million based on 15 vessels and not isolating any amount for accounts receivable.\n\n188.\n\nAfter reiterating that *\"the determination of an appropriate level of compensation based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of this kind is not and cannot be an exact science, but rather a matter of informed estimation\"*, the Tribunal concluded that a willing buyer would have valued the business *\"at approximately US$30* *million\"* and would have been prepared to pay *\"an additional amount of US$16.4 million for the non-recurring accounts receivable\"*, adding up to US$46.4 million \"for the purposes of compensation.\"163\n\nAward, \u00b6202.\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal did not explicitly rely on the amounts forwarded by the Claimants\u2019 experts. In its Decision on Revision, it insisted *\"that the Tribunal has not adopted the figures put forward by either experts, whether in their original reports or in their illustrative tables\"* but that the conclusion was one of informed estimation.164 However, it is obvious that the estimation is based on information derived from the calculations of the Claimants\u2019 experts. The amounts presented by the Claimants\u2019 experts are slightly rounded down by the Tribunal. They are irreconcilable with the Tribunal\u2019s findings on the elements of the proper assessment of the market value, i.e. a fleet of 15 vessels and a country risk premium of 14.75%. The information and with it the estimation is based on a quantification of the country risk premium that the Tribunal rejected categorically and in a detailed reasoning. The two statements of the Tribunal cannot be reconciled. They are genuinely contradictory. Under any assumption on the scope of business -11, 15 or 17 vessels - a valuation of US$30 million is not conceivable.\n\nDecision on Revision, \u00b662.\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondents in the annulment proceedings assert that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning was free of contradiction, since \"Point A\" of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning was its statement that it had to determine the amount of compensation in light of all evidence before it and exercising its informed estimation, based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. \"Point B\" was the determination that *\"a willing buyer would have valued the business at approximately US$ 30 million\",* following the exercise of informed estimation.\n\n191.\n\nThe assertion demonstrates that in fact the reasoning does not allow a reasonable, attentive and willing reader to follow the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and the conclusion:\n\n\"Point A\" was, indeed, the Tribunal\u2019s statement that it had to determine the amount of compensation by an informed estimation based on a DCF analysis. \"Point B\" was the scrupulous establishment of the six elements, which the Tribunal had defined as including a country risk premium of 14.75%. \"Point C\" was the Tribunal\u2019s request to the experts to present calculations based on the elements established by it and the presentation of these calculations in the Award. \"Point D\" would have been a conclusion using the country risk premium of 14.75%, the 15 vessels scenario and the other elements that - as the Tribunal had underlined - must be taken into account. Even by rounding up and down in a legitimate estimation, the result would have been US$16,484 million for accounts receivable and US$19,997 million for SEMARCA\u2019s business to sum up to US$36,481 million. The Committee will come back to these amounts. For the present purposes it suffices to state that, using the Tribunal\u2019s detailed analysis and careful specification of the elements of the DCF analysis, \"Point D\" would undoubtedly not be an amount of US$46.4 million.\n\n192.\n\nThe Committee recalls the rationale of the Tribunal\u2019s duty to motivate the process of its determination of compensation and its conclusions. It is the corollary of its power to determine that a sovereign State has violated international and national law by offering, after a lawful expropriation, an amount of compensation that did not correspond to the market value. The State as well as the investor may legitimately expect that the tribunal explains why the State\u2019s offer would undercompensate the damage and what the correct standard and amount of compensation would be. The Tribunal is entitled to use its discretion and may estimate the correct compensation as long as it explains the process leading to the estimation.\n\n193.\n\nThe Tribunal in the present case did so with remarkable clarity and force. But after having done so, the Tribunal contradicted its own analysis and reasoning by quantifying its estimation using one concrete criterion (a country risk premium of 1.5 per cent) which it had rejected as unreasonable. The contradiction cannot be argued away or cured. It is evident and decisive for the outcome.\n\n194.\n\nThe Committee does not exclude that the calculation was based on an error by the Tribunal in transcribing the figures from the illustrative tables into the Award. However, the ascertainment of a contradiction rests on purely objective criteria and not on subjective reproaches against tribunals. A possible inadvertency of the Tribunal is therefore without relevance and does not have to be established.\n\n195.\n\nAs a result of the contradiction in the reasoning, Venezuela is not able to understand to what extent it has used its public power unlawfully when it offered compensation. That is not the consequence of a misuse of the Tribunal\u2019s authority to discretion but of the Tribunal\u2019s contradictory reasoning when presenting what, in its view, it considered the correct elements for the determination of compensation, but in reality used an element it had rejected earlier to fix the amount of compensation.\n\n196.\n\nThe Committee does not have the authority to annul the Award or any part thereof for reasons of errors in the use of the Tribunal\u2019s discretion. However, it has the authority to annul the part of the Award for which the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which it based that particular part of the Award. The Committee recognizes the high quality of the bigger part of the Award, as both Parties also appear to do. At the same time, it holds that one part of the Award, where a genuinely contradictory reasoning on the amount of compensation cancels out another reasoning with respect to the same compensation, must be annulled.\n\n**1.3. The Consequence of the Application of the Standard**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe contradiction has a material impact on the result of the Award. It cannot be cured by additional reasons. Under these circumstances, the Committee does not have to decide whether in principle *ad hoc* committees have discretion to annul or not to annul the part of the Award for which the tribunal has failed to state reasons. Lifting the contradiction in reasoning would not lead to an adequate remedy. The material consequences of the contradiction would not vanish. It is the Committee\u2019s view that under such circumstances it has no discretion to abstain from annulling what is contradictory.\n\n198.\n\nArticle 52(3) of the ICSID Convention bestows the authority upon the Committee to annul \"the award or any part thereof \" Arbitration Rule 55(3) provides that *\"[i]f the original award had only been annulled in part, the new tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled\"*\n\n199.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s existence and authority emerges with the application for annulment. Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that an application may be made for the annulment of the award. An application for a partial annulment is not explicitly foreseen. Arbitration Rule 50 does not provide otherwise.\n\n200.\n\nThe Applicant has requested the annulment of *\"the portion of the Award dealing with the conclusion on DCF calculation\"165* and later specified that the *\"Republic requested the annulment of the finding of the total compensation awarded in the Award (i.e. paragraphs 202 and 217(3) of the Award)\",* whereby a *\"new tribunal would need to consider the decisions taken by the first Tribunal and that were not the subject of the annulment proceeding\"166*\n\nMemorial, \u00b63.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s PHB, p. 2.\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondents have requested that *\"the Republic\u2019s application for annulment should be dismissed in its entirety. Indeed, the Committee has no power to reduce the Award. [...] The ad hoc committee may not amend or replace the award by its own decision on the merits.\"*167 However, they have requested alternatively:\n\n*\"Nevertheless, should the Tribunal [sic] determine that the Republic\u2019s Application is meritorious, the Committee should leave undisturbed the portion of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal that the Republic admits would have been supported by Navigant\u2019s model (i.e., US$36,481 million).\"168*\n\nTidewater\u2019s PHB, \u00b69.\n\nTidewater\u2019s PHB, \u00b610.\n\n202.\n\nFor reasons of procedural economy, the Committee shares the *MINE ad hoc* committee\u2019s view that Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention implies that a *\"request for partial annulment is clearly admissible\"* and that portions of the award for which annulment had not been requested \"will *remain in effect regardless of the annulment in whole or in part of the portion of the Award in respect of which Guinea has formulated its request for annulment.\"169*\n\n*MINE,* \u00b64.07.\n\n203.\n\nAs stated above, the Committee\u2019s authority includes the possibility to annul portions of the part of the Award for which annulment has been requested.\n\n204.\n\nThe Applicant has requested the annulment of the totality of the Award that deals with the calculation of the DCF and compensation. At the same time, it has concentrated on the Tribunal\u2019s inconsistent reasoning with respect to SEMARCA\u2019s scope of business and the country risk premium. It has not alleged any inconsistency with respect to the relevance and the calculation of the accounts receivable. It has equally not submitted that the totality of the Tribunal\u2019s calculations was contradictory but only the part which exceeds the amount based on 15 vessels and a country risk premium of 14.75%. It has presented a calculation to the Committee leading to an amount of US$19,997 million if the criteria had been properly applied. However, it has warned the Committee that it *\"does not have powers to determine the amount of compensation owed to the Tidewater Parties, and in any event it may not consider, in order to determine the amount of compensation, evidence thatwas not before the Tribunal who issued the Award* *If the parties cannot reach a settlement to end their dispute, it would correspond to a new tribunal the calculation of the compensation that would be owed.\"170*\n\nVenezuela\u2019s PHB, p. 2.\n\n205.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s opinion is refuted by the Respondents. They submit that the Committee has the authority to leave the Award in effect with respect to the accounts receivable, i.e. US$16,484 million, and the amount of the business value that flows from the non-contradictory application of the elements that the Tribunal had established, i.e. US$ 19,997 million. The Respondents submit that the resulting sum of US$36,481 million is the direct and consistent conclusion of the application of the elements and that the *\"Republic acknowledges that Tidewater\u2019s expert submissions would have supported a principal amount of US$36,481 million.\"171*\n\nCounter-Memorial, footnote 3.\n\n206.\n\nIndeed, it was the Applicant that has calculated the corrected amount of the business value, based on the Claimants\u2019 expert valuation model and using the elements identified by the Tribunal.172 It has re-affirmed the figure on page 24 of its power-point presentation during the Hearing. However, it has insisted that the figure was *\"not in the record of Arbitration proceeding\"173*\n\nMemorial, Note 26.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Hearing Power-Point Presentation, p. 24.\n\n207.\n\nThe Parties have no dispute over the following figures and do not allege any inconsistency between them and the Tribunal\u2019s elements established for the valuation of SEMARCA\u2019s market value: US$16,484 million for accounts receivable, US$19,997 million for SEMARCA\u2019s business value, and the total sum of US$36,481 million.\n\n208.\n\nThe Committee is conscious that its authority is limited to annulling or upholding the Award or parts of it. It is *\"not empowered to amend or replace\"* the Award by a new decision on the merits.174 It *\"can extinguish a res iudicata but it cannot create a new one\"175* It is equally conscious that it is not authorized to appraise new evidence.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment, dated November 2, 2015 *(\"Occidental\"),* \u00b6 299.\n\nC. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention - A Commentary, 2nd edition, 2009, Article 52, \u00b6491.\n\n209.\n\nThe Committee has found that the Tribunal has consistently and without contradiction estimated an amount of compensation for accounts receivable of US$16.4 million. The Tribunal has accepted this amount by using the Claimants\u2019 expert\u2019s calculation [an amount of US$16,484 million] and by exercising its discretion of rounding it down to US$16.4 million. The calculation and the amount are undisputed by the Parties. Although the Applicant has applied for the annulment of the total compensation and calculation of the DCF, it has not pursued this request with respect to the accounts receivable and has not substantiated in what way the Tribunal has failed to state reasons for the adjudication of this amount.\n\n210.\n\nTherefore, the Committee rejects the request to annul the totality of the part of the Award that deals with compensation and its calculation. As a first step, it rejects the implied request to annul the Award with respect to the accounts receivable in an amount of US$16.4 million. This part of the Award is upheld as *res iudicata.*\n\n211.\n\nFurther, the Committee has found that the Tribunal has stated reasons consistently and non-contradictorily for the determination of SEMARCA\u2019s business value. According to both Parties, the amount of US$19,997 million flows directly from the application of the elements that the Tribunal had established to be able to estimate the appropriate amount on an informed basis. The Tribunal has stated the reasons which support the ascertainment of the claim in an amount of US$19,997 million. It has only failed to state reasons why it has decided to go far beyond that amount.\n\n212.\n\nIt is the Committee\u2019s duty to annul the portion of the Award for which no reasons are stated. The Tribunal has failed to state the reasons for the adjudication of an amount ofUS$30 million instead of US$19,997 million. That portion of the Award must be annulled. It will be for a new tribunal to assess and calculate whether such amount or another amount must be ascertained. It is not for this Committee to substitute its views in this regard.\n\n213.\n\nConversely, the Committee has no authority to annul portions of the Award for which no ground for an annulment exists, in other words and in the present context, for which reasons are stated.\n\n214.\n\nThe Committee holds that the Tribunal has stated the reasons for the application of the DCF analysis to establish the market value as requested by Article 5 of the BIT. The Tribunal has also motivated clearly and without contradiction its decision to isolate and describe the elements for the valuation of the market value and to quantify these elements for the specification of such analysis. This part of the Award is also upheld as *res iudicata.*\n\n215.\n\nThe Committee has been helped by the Parties to understand that the direct consequence of the application of these elements leads to an amount of US$19,997 million. The Committee has to determine whether it has the authority to confirm this amount as *res iudicata,* as requested by the Respondents but contested by the Applicant.\n\n216.\n\nWhen weighing the arguments, the Committee has looked for assistance to the recent decision of the *ad hoc* committee in the *Occidental* annulment proceeding. That committee had found:\n\n*\"Consequently, the Committee\u2019s decision to partially annul the Award must lead to the annulment of the quantification of damages (US$ 1,769,625.000) contained in Sub-paragraph (v) of the dispositive section of the Award to the extent that it* *compensates the Claimants for 100% (and not for 60%) of the value of Block 15-butnot of the rest of such Sub-paragraph.**The next question to be addressed is whether the Committee is authorized to substitute the annulled figure of damages with the correct number, or whether this task must be entrusted to a new investment tribunal. The parties have discussed this issue, and while Respondent favours the constitution of a new tribunal, Claimants have accepted that in the proper circumstances annulment committees are authorized to insert correct data in partially annulled decisions.**The Committee concurs with Claimants.**It is true that annulment committees are not empowered to amend or replace awards. But this is not the task at hand. What is required in this case, in which the Committee is partially annulling the Award, is for the Annulment Committee to substitute the Tribunal\u2019s figure of damages with the correct one. If this task can be performed without further submissions from the Parties and without additional marshalling of evidence, committees should be entitled to do so. Basic reasons of procedural economy speak in favour of this solution. There is no need for the parties to incur the additional cost and delay of going through a second investment arbitration, when the correct number can be inserted by the annulment committee, after performing a very simple arithmetic calculation and without further input from the parties.\"176*\n\n*Occidental,* \u00b6\u00b6 296-299 (footnotes omitted).\n\n217.\n\nApparently, the circumstances of the present case are different. It is not the Committee that has to do a \u2018very simple arithmetic calculation\u2019 because it was done by the Applicant, based on the elements established by the Tribunal and using the matrix of the Claimants\u2019 expert that had been accepted by the Tribunal. The Applicant\u2019s calculation was agreed by the Respondents to be the direct result of an application of the Tribunal\u2019s own criteria.\n\n218.\n\nTwo issues must be addressed. The first one concerns the Applicant\u2019s contention that the figure of US$19,997 million was not before the Tribunal, and can therefore not be taken into its consideration. With some hesitation, the Committee disagrees. It finds that only the naked figure was not in the records. All the elements leading to this figure were in the record, including the 15 vessels scenario and a country risk premium of 14.75%, as well as the calculation matrix that had led to the US$30 million figure, i.e. the Tribunal\u2019s estimation. In fact, if the Tribunal had not contradicted itself by picking an amount based on a 1.5% country risk premium, which it had rejected before, the figure of US$19,997 million would have emerged naturally from the facts and evidence before the Tribunal. The figure is part of this evidence and not new. This is not different from the figure that emerged naturally in *Occidental* as a result of a calculation that had not been performed by the tribunal in that case.\n\n219.\n\nThe second issue concerns the extent of the Committee\u2019s authority. It does not cover the creation of a new *res iudicata* as the consequence of a new award. The Committee believes that this is not what it does when confirming an amount of US$19,997 million as part of the Tribunal\u2019s Award.\n\n220.\n\nThe amount is encapsulated in the US$30 million that the Tribunal has put forward in partial contradiction to its own reasoning. The Committee neither adds reasons when it confirms that amount as not contradicting the reasons stated by the Tribunal, nor does it fix a \u2018new\u2019 amount. It simply confirms that the amount of US$19,997 million is the direct and consistent consequence of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, as presented by the Parties. By so holding, it does not amend or replace the Award and does not create a new **res iudicata** but preserves the Award in part and with it the **res iudicata** effect.\n\n221.\n\nIn sum, the Committee has decided to follow the Respondents\u2019 subsidiary request to *\"leave undisturbed the portion of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal that the Republic admits would have been supported by Navigant\u2019s model\"177* and rejects the request to annul the finding of the total compensation. It upholds the adjudication of US$16.4 million for accounts receivable and US$19,997 million for the loss of business value, totaling US$36,397 million.\n\nTidewater\u2019s PHB, \u00b610.\n\n222.\n\nAt the same time, the Committee annuls a portion of the Award and the amount attached to this portion, i.e. US$10,003 million, and extinguishes the *res iudicata* to that extent. It will be for a new tribunal to render an award with respect to this portion for which the Tribunal has failed to state reasons.\n\n223.\n\nThe Committee is convinced -not differently from the *Occidental* committee -that reasons of procedural economy militate in favor of this decision. In addition, the high value of finality of awards, which is emphasized by Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, is best respected when the part of the Award, for which no ground for annulment exists, is maintained as *res iudicata,* and only the annullable portion of the award is extinguished.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n224.\n\nAccording to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1) (j), which are applicable *mutatis mutandis* to annulment proceedings (Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention), the Committee has discretion to determine *\"how and by whom\" the,* costs and expenses of ICSID, the Committee and the Parties are borne.\n\n225.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3) (e), the Applicant was *\"solely responsible for making the advance payments [...] without prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with Article 52 (4) of the Convention to decide how and by whom expenses incurred in connection with the annulment proceeding shall be paid.\"* The Applicant has paid the advances as requested.\n\n226.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Applicant\u2019s request to annul the determination of the total compensation on the grounds of a manifest excess of power and of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure has been dismissed, because it is clearly without merits, but that it has partly prevailed because the Tribunal has failed to state the reasons for a part of the Award. The Committee notes that the Parties might have been able to avoid these proceedings upon the discovery of the Tribunal\u2019s motivation.\n\n227.\n\nThe Committee confirms that the Parties have conducted the proceedings efficiently and diligently.\n\n228.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Committee determines that the Applicant shall bear 70% and the Respondents shall bear 30% of the fees and expenses of the Members of the **ad hoc** Committee and of the ICSID costs. Since the Applicant has made the entirety of the advance payments, the Respondents shall pay, in partial reimbursement to the Applicant, 30% of the total costs of the **ad hoc** Committee and ofICSID.178\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\n229.\n\nEach Party shall bear the costs and fees it incurred.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n230.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee decides unanimously as follows:\n\n1. The Committee annuls the portion of the Award for which the Tribunal has failed to state the reasons on which this part is based.\n\n2. All other grounds of the Applicant\u2019s application for annulment are dismissed.\n\n3. The remainder of the Award, including the adjudication of US$36,397 million, remains unaffected.\n\n4. The Respondents shall pay to the Applicant 30% of the total costs of the *ad hoc* Committee and of ICSID.\n\n5. Each Party shall bear its own costs and fees.\n\n6. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 54(3), the stay of enforcement is automatically terminated with respect to the unannulled part of the Award."}]}
